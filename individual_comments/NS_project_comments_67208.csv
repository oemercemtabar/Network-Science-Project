hx64pny,t3_st6r6e,2022-02-16 13:28:51,Economics,"I couldn't read the article because of the paywall, but would be curious to know the economic details behind salary transparency.

If you think about salaries as a market transaction, you're signaling that your time is worth $X when you accept a job at a company. That of course doesn't happen in a vacuum. You probably have researched salaries, or have competing offers from other companies. That turns it into something akin to checking prices on Amazon or Walmart before deciding where to buy a product. From that perspective, transparency seems like a good thing in that it helps you more accurately settle on a price of what something should cost.

However, from a business perspective it seems terrible. I'd imagine it would sow discord among employees or demotivate people. It reminds me of the the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard in which each worker had agreed to work in the vineyard for a denarius. At the end of they day when the workers received their denarius, they became angry when they found out some had only worked part of the day while others had worked the entire day.",MrDrego,t2_36t0t,3,0,reddit4

Or we can just keep doing it the way we do it now, which is to say 'Hi, we have a massive salary range, and where you fall in that range will be determined by your performance in the interview process. What salary are you expecting?'. 

It's not that we want to hide anything, we just don't know what your value is and if we broke it up into more discreet roles, it wouldn't change anything. People will still apply to the wrong roles and we won't know until the process has already begun anyways.",,,17,0,reddit4

hx2mp13,t3_st6r6e,2022-02-15 19:20:07,Economics,"The highest paid individuals will make far more than the average for their field if they are in a specialized field.  They make more because they contribute more and add more value.  People are willing to pay those people more to use them because they get what they pay for.  These are lawyers, engineers, trades people, etc.  There are very low paid and very high paid individuals that have the exact same job title.

The idea that ""all jobs of the same title are equal"" doesn't apply to high paying fields.  Low paying jobs that are low skill are more likely to have similar compensation for the work done.  It's not easy to differentiate yourself and the value you add as a burger flipper or as a janitor.

The real problem are the fields where high effort work is rewarded with average pay based on job title and not value produced.  When employers or managers pay based on the ""going rate"" of the job title and not the value produced, the incentive to provide value through your efforts disappears.  Teachers get paid roughly the same regardless of whether they are awesome or terrible at their jobs.

So I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $150,000, or I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $60,000 and both would be valid depending on who the person making the statement is.  Sharing my salary is pointless.

This is why I somewhat support unions for jobs that are tough to do but there's no real need for different compensation for different efforts.  If the outcome of the job is predetermined and the employee cannot change that outcome regardless of their effort to add value, then there is no competitive advantage for that employee to improve their life.  There should be an acceptable industrial compensation that those employees should receive and sharing salaries could help them out significantly.

I don't support unions for work that can be done at very different levels and provide different values to the customers/clients.  In my field I want to differentiate myself from others in my field to be near the top of the compensation that I can get.  I can take a project design from someone else and save hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars over what they did.  People pay me more but they get more in return.  Having everyone that does what I do get paid what I get paid wouldn't be fair for the weekends, evenings, long hours, and efforts I make to add value to my work.  

You don't deserve a specific pay because you have a specific job; you have to add value to be compensated for it.  Make sure you are compensated fairly and salary sharing may help.  I recommend applying for other jobs every three to five years and taking whatever offers you get back to your current employer and letting them know what those offers are.  That is the ""salary sharing"" that will result in increased compensation for what you do if you are worth it.  You'll at least know if you're already being highly compensated for what you do even if you don't switch jobs.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,-15,0,reddit4

The standard prisoners dilemma implies two groups with a shared dilemma and a shared set of preferences towards their shared options/outcomes towards the dilemma where unfortunately both players are promoted to choose the shared worst outcome for themselves. If you haven't noticed, that's an incredibly balanced situation we largely don't have in the real world and especially isn't applicable towards groups with opposite interests - which is the case for most employers and employees unless they are one and the same. There are examples where both players are incentivized towards the same strategy but their preferences are opposite - employers want to maximize profits while minimizing costs (labor) and employees want to maximize earnings from labor while minimizing their perceived negative consequences from labor (lost time, lost freedom, lost energy, etc.).

Beyond the differences in preferences there is also a difference in power to promote your desired outcome, which powerful employers have the leverage in that department. If anything, our economic system is forced to put increasingly more leverage in the hands of owners of valuable capital over mere labor as under capitalism in a post industrial revolution world capital increasingly has more value and power over mere labor.

That pre-assumes that employee productivity follows a bell curve. In my experience that is not the case in non-labour jobs. The argument here is that it DOESN'T follow a bell curve, and that in something like software development, often in a team of 5 one employee is doing the same amount of work as the other 4 combined. For example, when I automated a process the bank used to make 50 employees spend an hour a day on to do manually, my contribution was effectively worth all 50 of theirs. It would make more sense to pay me  just their hour's salary combined than pay each of them.

The military is a horrible example because it is completely and utterly non-market based.  There is no labor market in the military.  None.  Zero.

Just because the military acts using central planned economics just like the USSR doesn't mean it's good economics.  It's not.

In the labor market, like every single other market, price discovery is based on competition.  In the market of your labor you compete with others of your trade to win work and compensation.  If you take that competition away, there is no way to know if you are adequately compensated for what you do.

The military is a piss poor example of the point you're trying to make.  May as well say you support a centrally planned economy where salaries are all set by the pentagon and nobody can argue for more pay or should ever be paid less if they suck at their jobs.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,2,0,reddit4
hx4vlva,t1_hx4ua59,2022-02-16 04:52:18,Economics,"So in other words, to make more money you change jobs.  Would you prefer a world where that's the only way to make more money?  You don't get additional compensation in the same job, you are hoping to change jobs.  You perform better in hopes of changing jobs, but the job compensation remains constant.

If you apply that to the labor market in general, would that work?  Is there always another position up the ladder that will reward extra effort and value created?  The military has a long long chain of positions.  Does that apply to most labor industries?

In my line of work I'm three steps from the CEO.  How many steps are there to get to a five star general?  Should every labor market be stratified into a huge number of steps and advancement positions?  Can that even work in something that isn't huge like the military or a mega-corp?  If your business only has 15 employees, will locking the wages under a specific job title work?

The military is not the best model for a labor market because it doesn't operate using market forces.  You can't increase your value and be compensated accordingly if that advancement position you'd like isn't available.  Like I originally said, the military sharing what every position pays and operating so doesn't translate to the market economy.  In the military the individual has no bargaining power and no real say in what they are paid.  They are dictated their pay from above and take it or leave.

Socialist countries have organized compensation based on position just like the military does and you have to appeal the bureaucracy to advance just like you do in the military.  The bureaucracy may or may not care what value you add and your ability to leverage yourself is rather limited in such a scenario.

I still stand by what I said, the military model of compensation is not great for labor markets.  Knowing what everyone is paid doesn't help anyone competing to offer value.  Get a few interviews and bids for your labor and you're better off then checking some online compensation list.  Put some effort in marketing yourself and figuring out what you're worth; trusting some stranger to tell you what you should be paid isn't the way to go.

When I worked for government there were some 9 or 10 technical ""positions"" that were compensated and you could work your way up that ladder until you needed an engineer's license.  After you were licensed there were another five steps or so available before that topped out.  Government paid poorly and wasn't really worth it unless you were at the very top.  Having all of that information public didn't do jack to help me or any other government employee because we couldn't argue for a raise regardless of how much value we added.  We could only do the steps to climb to the next position when it became available.  Government employees by and large are very poorly paid because they operate in similar fashion to the military.  How is this the ideal system?  It isn't.  It's far better to be able to be compensated for the value you bring to the table and not compensated by some bureaucratic policy of positions.

That's the problem.  If you know what everyone gets paid, the pay becomes tied to the position and not the value you bring to it.  If the entire labor market operated with set pay for set positions as determined by some central planner, we'd be operating in similar fashion to the USSR.

Information can make the market efficient, but misinformation can make it less efficient.  Efficiency is best created through proper price discovery and not through fixing prices.  When an entire group of people decide they should be paid the same as the highest person paid doing what their ""title"" says they do, efficiency goes out the window.

And no, most places that pay engineers do not directly compensate them for the value they add.  The contract with the client isn't such that the client pays some % of money saved.  The contracts are almost never written that way.  What does happen is that the client asks for engineers to specifically work on their stuff and are willing to pay a higher fee as long as those engineers are on their teams.

When people go through the extra effort to add value, they get paid more than those who don't FOR THE EXACT SAME JOB.

Having everyone know what everyone makes doesn't allow people to be differentiators and go the extra mile to add value to their work in hopes of a higher reward.

Like I said, the best market discovery you can do is apply for positions that you qualify for and take the offers you get back to your employer or simply switch to the higher paying offer.

The best thing you can do in knowing what existing salary ranges tend to be is use that information in deciding how to skill yourself and which markets to employ yourself in and then try to get to the upper ranks of that job market.  That information allows talent to position itself within the fields that are in high demand and lacking in skilled personnel.  THAT increases market efficiency.

Flip this around.  If businesses were to all talk to each other about how much they charge for everything all the time, would that be collusion or not?  Why isn't it if labor is doing it?

Businesses compete with each other and DO NOT SHARE information.  Laborers compete with each other and DO NOT SHARE information.  If I say I earn $150k a year and the people beneath me are making $40k a year, they aren't going to be happy about that.  If all compensations were public information, price discovery would go in the toilet and the ability to determine prices for your labor would be ruined.

All price discovery is essentially ALWAYS a bidding system.  You are trying to convince someone to buy your labor at a rate you desire.  You can't do that if everyone is messing around via collusion.

The lowest paid people will share their incomes, but the highest paid will not.  You won't get what you think you will by making salaries transparent.  Essentially all government employee compensation is public information and government employees get paid worse than their private counterparts almost always.

Everyone knowing exactly what everyone else makes is good how?  In the military it doesn't matter because you aren't going into your boss and asking for a raise.  You don't work harder in the military to get to a higher pay rate for the same job you're currently doing.

In the private sector, knowing everyone else's salary does nothing but make those who are paid less disgruntled and demand more pay.  It forces employers to compensate the underperforming workers the same as the overperforming workers and provides disincentive to those who push the limits of their job to do so.  In a world where everyone is paid the same there's no incentive to create any more value than anyone else and quickly value production drops drastically and you get economic failure.

epu3snj,t1_ept8hmy,2019-06-02 19:19:12,Economics,"The short answer is the government uses a measure of inflation that (deliberately) understates it - especially with regard to housing.  The longer answer is that the CPI has trouble with long-life items (housing, cars, college education) and treats them inconsistently.  Plus some of the weights are really messed up though I'm not sure why since supposedly they're coming from a survey.

For instance housing is 32% of the CPI (without utilities/furnishings).  So it's essentially assuming that 32% of all your spending goes to housing.  That seems really low to me.  Also, rather than using actual housing prices they use ""owner equivalent rent"" - a made-up number based on not just the market price but the market price squared as well as the income of the people living there and the number of rooms.  Just to give you an idea of how accurate this measure is: it basically missed the entire mid-2000s housing bubble and that leads me to believe the betas for income and room count are outweighing those of the actual market housing prices.  Keep in mind that owner equivalent rent by itself is 23% of the CPI.

On college tuition CPI assumes it's 1.5% of spending - so right there is why college tuition isn't having much of an impact on the inflation rate.  That percentage is low but you've got to keep in mind it's averaging in a lot of old people who aren't in college.  Also, like housing, a college education is also a long life item (and many people finance it as such) but rather than come up with some kind of ""owner equivalent rent"" for your education the CPI simply takes it as an expense in the year where it occurs.

Also for medical care they only look at out of pocket expenses and those are assumed to be 7% of spending.  Those are probably up significantly but if they're only 7% they're not going to have a huge impact.",B_P_G,t2_l3cz7,8,0,reddit1

And though your healthcare benefits nominally cost more that's mostly just the fact that healthcare has had more price inflation than other items.

If a months rent is supposed to be 1/3 income, that makes for 3k a month. Let's say I want to put 10% of my salary into a savings account, that's $300 a month. At that rate, it would take me 13.3 months to accumulate the 4k difference.

But in that time, the person with a lower cost of living (since that is what has changed, not the income) would have been able to save more.

Let's say they are able to save 1.5 times what I can (since 12k is 1.5 times 8k). That means in the time I've saved the 4k difference, they've saved 6k. Now I'm at 12k but me 25 years ago is at 18k. While the proportional difference is the same, the absolute difference has increased.

There is no avoiding the fact (and relatively simple math) that when things cost more but you're making the same amount, you'll have less money.

And I just have to say, the other commentor's ad hominem was unnecessary, but they have a point about you coming to say ""I don't agree with these economics.""

The fact is our medical costs are twice as expensive as the next country, the UK, but we are sadly ranked 37th in positive health outcomes by country, according to the World Health Organization.

A lot of it has to do with a tax insurance scheme. 

Hospital board members found their own insurance company offshore, like in the Caymans.   They insure as much as possible, which ""increases"" cost of doing business.   Those bottom line costs are reflected in the price of medicine.   The insurance companies arent taxed.   The board members get dividend payouts from the insurance company, since they own it.   Those payouts are not reflected in their earnings by sitting on the hospital board.

An article came out a couple days ago since it was leaked that Massachusetts hospitals currently have 1.6 billion dollars in offshore accounts.    Note, that figure excludes dividends thus far collected by the insurance company owners.

Those hospitals are also actively buying up other hospitals, so if there are any left that don't do this completely legal money scheme, there won't be eventually.

Also, sorry if you weren't looking for an explanation, but this trend way predates Obama.

What I’m saying to you isn’t “boomers are the problem”, I’m saying that in the particular instance you’re describing, YOU are playing a massive role in the life of ONE person. Your actions are having consequences.

Also I’m saying that throwing away a master’s in Biochemistry is extremely extremely rare. Your son is very bright and at one time was very driven. Those programs aren’t for the faint of heart. Check in with him. In a real and meaningful way. He’s not okay. His bodybuilding is likely just a healthier version of a drug problem.

I’m a 32 year old millennial with boomer parents (born in the early-mid ‘50s). I grew up upper middle class and they had the money to pay for school outright for me. They instead had me take a small loan every year, and I was on my own for my master’s because they didn’t view that as necessary for me to get a start in life. 

The fact that I was a stakeholder in my education made me #1 take it more seriously and #2 extremely angry/driven when there were times I couldn’t find work in my field.

No I don't think an economy based on consumption always increasing is a good one, but it's the one the US has, that's all. I agree with most of your points haha

I'm just realistic: if consumer spending drops significantly, the economy tanks. The problem  is that the economy therefore relies on that unsustainable spending.

The problem is not that poor people are wasting their money, it's that wages are too low. Thus, the solution is to drive wage growth for low income earners. If wages rise, the working class has more money to spend and that drives the economy far more than the Waltons earning an extra million, because working class people spend a greater proportion of their income AND usually spend it locally. They can also choose to spend or save their money once they're earning more than the minimum they need to survive. But the idea that people are poor because they're wasting the small income they have isn't accurate.

&#x200B;

## How to Calculate Net Worth: Two Examples

To illustrate the process, let’s look at two examples.

### Example 1: Gina

Gina is 35 years old. She owns a home worth $250,000, and still owes $150,000 on the mortgage. Her six-year-old car is now only worth about $7,000, but it’s all paid off. She has $1,000 in credit card balances, $25,000 in her 401(k), about $5,000 in her savings account, and $20,000 remaining on her student loans.

#### ASSETS

* Home: $250,000
* Car: $7,000
* 401(k): $25,000
* Savings: $5,000

**Total assets**: $287,000

#### DEBTS

* Credit cards: $1,000
* Student loans: $20,000
* Mortgage: $150,000

**Total debts**: $171,000

**GINA’S NET WORTH**: $287,000 – $171,000 = **$116,000**

### Example 2: Emma

Emma, meanwhile, is 25 years old and rents an apartment. She has a newer car worth $20,000, but still owes $15,000 on it. Relatively new in her job, she only has $2,000 in her 401(k), and $1,000 in savings; she’s paying down $50,000 in student loans. And she’s racked up $5,000 in credit card debt as well.

#### ASSETS

* Car: $20,000
* 401(k): $2,000
* Savings: $1,000

**Total assets**: $23,000

#### DEBTS

* Credit cards: $5,000
* Auto loan: $15,000
* Student loans: $50,000

**Total debts**: $70,000

**EMMA’S NET WORTH**: $23,000 – $70,000 = (**-$47,000**)",HappyNihilist,t2_7mg0s,1,0,reddit1

Also, wage rises to only the bottom 25% (for example) aren't going to cause inflation in the same way that across the board wage rises, and those are the people who need it.

You're right in that many people don't 'feel' well off but are relatively well off (though that's a slippery slope, someone always has it worse but that doesn't make your situation good).

You raise the bottom wages and you effectively raise everyone's wages.

ismihs3,t3_y5nwwl,2022-10-17 02:14:11,Economics,"I’m still a bit confused about the whole recession thing; Oxford Languages defines a recession “by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters,” the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports Q1 2022 & Q2 2022 as decreases in GDP of -1.6% & -0.6% respectively. Why are we talking about this? The Wall Street Journal released “Economists Now Expect a Recession, Job Losses by Next Year” on October 16th stating that a survey conducted among economists that anticipate a recession within the next year has risen. By definition, it is here.  
  
Is this too much to couple with rampant inflation that the Feds are seemingly unable to tame? Sure, we’re late to the party in raising interest rates to mitigate inflation, the Federal Banking system is now playing catch up and the broader markets just slipped below the pre-pandemic highs, the DOW sitting at $29,634 or roughly 200 points below the February 2020 high.  
  
The Federal Reserve just needs to play its game to subdue inflation, and fiscal policy needs to remain aligned with these initiatives. How do we tell a nation to hold on to their britches for the next 12-18 months? A bump in Social Security payments by 8.7% (Tergesen, 2022) for individuals on fixed income will aid while we ride to the other side, a privilege this country has.  
  
Hard times create strong people, strong people create good times. Jerome Powell said there would be “pain,” I can appreciate his candor.

isksrs9,t3_y5nwwl,2022-10-16 18:56:18,Economics,"That might not be very important if GDP goes down. GDP isn't a very meaningful indicator. Our economy is very heavily burdened by impersonal capital income earners and economic rent seekers that inflate GDP numbers, for example. These things are very bad for the economy, yet inflate a number that people wrongly believe is an indication of a good economy.

Let me give you a perspective about the GDP. The optimal economy has 0 GDP. That doesn't sound right, yet it's entirely true. Imagine if we created a general AI that eliminated scarcity. Everything would have a price of 0, so GDP would necessarily have to also be 0. Yet the economy would fulfill all of our need without requiring any labor from us. This would be objectively ideal. 

The point I want to make is that an economy is something complex that can't be simplified to a single number.

What we are seeing now is production responsibilities shifting to generations of smaller size as well as inshoring. In these circumstances, it would be unbelievable to have any significant reduction in employment. 

As the smaller laborer population will have to support an aging population as well as the class of impersonal capital income earners and economic rent seekers, they'll be sucked dry. The governments will have to find other sources of revenues to afford public services. Especially since the retarded central banks decided it was a good time to increase rates. So governments will have to seek other sources of revenue, and they'll target the impersonal capital income earners and rent seekers first.

 If higher taxes disincentivizes those parasitic behaviors, which compensations are included in the GDP, then it might very well cause a decrease of the GDP. But that'll be a good thing since those behaviors are very bad for the economy.",Holos620,t2_8duym,5,0,reddit2

From the other angle there are job postings that exist which are just not reasonable offers. I imagine this is probably worse now as some employers have not updated their compensation to keep up with inflation.

I also hear from some hiring managers that they're looking for an internal candidate which means that the job posting isn't going to help any unemployed person.

When I started in the workforce it was an ASSET for a company to have training, not just for you, but for them.  It was expected that your job in trades would be essentially a learning and mentoring role for you.

Around 6 years into my employment, that mood started changing.  It became ""if we just make them get it, it costs us nothing and if they leave who cares, we invested nothing in them for those skills"".

This is what changed the loyalty viewpoint of industry in my mind.  You no longer cared to stay committed to something that brought you forward, you were committed to those things solely for your own gain, and thats fine, the business is doing likewise.

Here's my plan to handle this issue, which is destroying our economy and draining the Lebensfähigskeit of the youth:

1. Legalize child labor above age 13. We can teach them to read and do arithmetic well enough beforehand

2. Every child in a family gets a government-sponsored cat or dog on their 12th birthday

3. If your child is not working 40 hours a week or getting at least a 3.4 GPA in school taking classes at least 30 hours per week, then the government kills the kid's puppy or kitten.

Cruelty or the threat thereof in early life is the key to motivation and can produce results if we apply it to our workforce development policies.

An example:  let's say you have 100 widget-makers, and 10 executives.  If there is a need for 20 more widget makers, there would be no extra need of executives, yet they refuse to pay for those 20 extra widget-makers out of their salaries,  because everyone *feels* like their contributions shouldn't be lowered for the sake of the company, so instead, they bitch and moan that nobody wants to do the work they don't want to pay for. 

Will the 20 extra widget-makers eventually bring the profit back to previous levels? That is the goal, but executives are not producers, they are takers. Executives talk shit, producers do shit, so the idea of closing shop is just capitalist logic thinking that the ship can't steer itself, so we might as well stop rowing.  And the larger the ship,  the less likely the captains know how to row.  

It's not about how much Executives do, it's about their contributions to the actual profit. When recession is at the fore, and wages for producers go up because slavery is no longer cool, the reality will come.

Basically the entire world economy is going down simultaneously and that’s why several economists are very wary.

Of course if you're working at 74 it's a shit situation and you should be helped but realistically that's a small portion of the population just like how those who retire at 55 are a smaller set of the population.

[Then there's also the fact wage increases for those over 65 have jumped **63%** *after* inflation since 1985](https://www.aarp.org/work/employers/americans-working-past-65/) so of course if earnings are way up people will see retiring older is better than retiring at 65 especially since life expectancy is 4 years longer higher than it was in the 80's.


It's a super complicated issue but really even retiring at even 83 years of age in the US is still better than the age of retirement of 65 when it was set in 1935 when average age was 61 (i.e. life expectancy was 4 years *less* than retirement age) and it's more like retiring at 72 years of age if we balance for life expectancy after retirement in the 1980's.",SUMBWEDY,t2_gwny1,1,0,reddit2

Your final sentence shows that you can't logic your way out of this argument,  and you know that cutting an executive frees up the opportunity for more profit. So, if you want to pretend that meetings are efficient,  go  ahead, and send me the Financials of hourly pay of said executives,  and display how that results in more profits, not future profits.  

I'm pretty confident that every company could be streamlined towards more profitability,  but the real question is who gets the extra slice?   For the last 40 years, every efficiency has funneled up to executive pay (shareholders/ directors / owners), this upcoming forced recession to prevent a depression in executive wages via inflation control looks like it will be a regression to the mean, or a lot of rudderless companies with executives stealing golden parachutes  taking capital away from the company leaving them in a struggling position - The take the ball and go home method of selfish governance. 

Look at all investment markets.  They are vacuuming all the profits as we speak, so those useless heads of companies are either going to die or retire, leaving the company to restructure.  But as you seem well aware of, people don't like change, and the companies that have the proper Hr flow from employee to executive will be in position to weather the storm.

Lost my job initially due to a layoff in 2020, but immediately after that my elderly father got diagnosed with cancer...my mom has Alzheimer's, so it was up to me to be caretaker for them both now. He died this past January, I tried getting back into the industry so I could get back on my feet but 4months later my mom's neurologist says she's later stage and needs 24/7 care. 

I had a house down payment saved up, wanted kids, the whole shebang...now I'm moved into their house, can barely get gig work because I'm overqualified to work at a grocery store or retail and I can't get back into industry because of my mom. The kicker is that my dad left her money so she qualifies for zero assistance (professional caretakers, etc) until she is bled dry by her own disease. Only reason I haven't gone completely broke yet is because I managed to get a client to consult for so he gives me intermittent engineering work. I had a gig job for $20/HR working nights at a club but I checked my security cameras to see if my mom was okay and saw her on the floor...I showed the manager the footage, said sorry, and just walked out mid shift. You can imagine how that went for me lol. 

Apart from the loss of morale and depression from watching my mom deteriorate in front of me 24/7, I have lost over $320k in earning potential since the caretaking started (based on lost salary and bonuses, spent savings, etc) because I still need my own bills paid.  It's like there's no end in sight. 

I finally told my extended family that I'm not doing this forever and hit the job applications hard...I thankfully have two second interviews this week.

I think out of pocket costs came to under $5000, and our in home health team would find ways to re-up every six months. This went on for two years. 

The problem with Alzheimer's/dementia is that it is not classified as a terminal disease so you have to pay out of pocket until you're broke. The cost to the family as a whole can sometimes (like in my case) financially cripple not only the patient but the family caretakers as well. But my father told me on his death bed that he wanted her at home as long as possible. I had to sign off on his paperwork to go to in patient hospice and that was only because it literally became medically irresponsible to keep him home since we were no longer equipped to deal with his care. 

In my mom's case it's not medically irresponsible yet, imo. We had a nurse come and do an assessment on her and she is physically fit, and she is still capable of bathing herself, etc. She basically just needs a babysitter (me) so she doesn't do anything dangerous, but at this point she just eat, sleeps, and watches TV.

At least in the US, you can do as little as 3-5%.  In this case you will have to pay PMI (private mortgage insurance) which is an extra monthly fee of a  $100-200 usually until you get to 80% ""loan-to-value"" ratio, but if you (for some reason) wanted to buy a house sooner than it's possible to save 20% for a down payment, this is an option.

Also for anyone who hasn't taken out any kind of loan before, the interest rate is the percentage of the loan value you have to pay back every year.  So for example, you take out a $250,000 loan at 10% to buy a $300,000 house, that first year you will have to pay $25,000 in interest.  Your monthly payment will stay the same through the life of the loan, but because you owe so much in the beginning, only a little bit of the money you're coughing up will go toward the principal (i.e., the money you actually borrowed).  In this example, your starting principal is $250,000 and after one year and $25,000 in interest payments, your ending principal will be $248,500.  So the next year, you will pay $24,850 in interest with the same monthly payment, and your principal will decrease ever-so-slightly faster.

When you have your 5% saved up for a down payment, don't forget that there are also a bunch of closing costs and potentially real estate agent commissions to pay as well!  Having 8% in cash at least is a good idea if you're going to put 5% down on the loan: you can buy down ""points"" for a lower interest rate with your extra cash, or buy furniture so you don't have to live in a Call of Duty cave.  You can also pay more toward your principal every month to reduce the total interest you will pay and possibly pay your house off faster, which might be a good idea if your interest rate is higher than returns you could expect to see if you invested that money.

It sucks ass to get started, but if it works for your lifestyle and you can afford it, owning a home can eventually be worth it.  Maybe not at these interest rates, but you might get a chance to refinance if rates get lower...usually that costs some money, but it's worth it if you can reduce your interest rate by 2% or more.",Useless_Troll42241,t2_jn7yo19vw,34,0,reddit3

It's how much people need that skill set vs how many people have it.

This is the thing that is catching most first world citizens out.

In the 50s to 70s, America was the only nation / market of note that isn't still recovering from ww2 or being fucked by communism and dictators or whatever.

In the 70s to 90s the rest of the world still more or less catching up

From 90s onwards even  ""this world nations"" have caught up mostly in regards to quality of workers at the low end (highschool graduate & most undergraduates) more than the cost of living has on a relative basis. 

So a factory worker in the states made ""some amount of money"" which afforded them a certain lifestyle in the past, that exact same wage on a nominal basis will go much much farther in any country that isn't the United States.

I live in a somewhat small city and it's shrinking every year.  Walmart Supercenter managed to close the mall, and recently Walmart cut their hours to close at night rather than being 24/7.  The local grocery store chain built a supercenter and put the other competitors offering cheaper prices out of business so now that the grocery superstore only has Walmart to compete with they can charge whatever they want.  Recently they started a membership program on their old gas card, if you pay $100 annually you get more coupon options.  

Work is mostly industrial and family operated farms, so if you don't have those skills good luck finding a suitable job (me).  

Education is terrible.  We had many primary schools, 2 middle schools, a high school, a private Catholic school, and a community college.  Well, the city got rid of a handful of primary schools.  One was converted into expensive apartments.  Recently one of the middle schools closed.  

We used to have mini golf, but that closed years ago.  Now the only entertainment is the monthly local concert downtown when the weather is good and a few bars if alcoholism is your idea of entertainment.  

Lastly the local hospital has changed ownership over the years and gone to shit.  If you have cancer, they can only help send you out of town to a better hospital.  I've been in a few times from allergies to cancer meds and nearly died once from the ER's stupidity.  Even my dentist pulled the wrong teeth when I was a kid now I look like a hockey player.  Funny thing is I'm now on disability and can't use that insurance for my vision care.  My new dentist offers a progressive plan for the disability insurance which I need to get checked every 6 months in order to qualify for better things like fillings.  If I don't stay with it then the treatment options goes back to square 1.  

Point is living in a small city sucks ass and disability makes it feel like people are taking advantage of you rather than helping.

We made just under 100k a year and because of a cheap, small apt saved up 30k over the course of 2 years with 2 kids and bought a house. And that was before they started their flex schedules, now that I've moved up into management and make over 100k myself, my wife picks up 10-20 hours a week and makes her own schedule. She can skip days/weeks with no penalty and gets a lot of pto for how little she works.

On top of that, the benefits are extremely good, my wife got 20 weeks at 100% pay for maternity leave and I got 6 weeks at 100% pay. Plus my wife gets 1.5 hours a day to pump while on the clock for as long as she needs it. Medical, dental and vision are really good and cheap. Plus they offer accommodations for schedules, a good leave option process, career choice for those who don't want to stay in amazon and most importantly for me, a *fantastic* promotion path. Which let a college dropout long time addict go from  making 25k a year to 115k a year in 6 years. And the sky is the limit really. 

It wasn't easy when we both worked opposite schedules but we made it work and got through it and now she is part time.

If between two time periods, there exist an overabundance of supply of something relative to demand, then the price of that something should go down

Why that happens can come about from a lot of different ways. 

I'm not trying to make a judgement call on your specific example, just making observations around overall labour tends. Any specific job or personal situation is going to have a lot of idiosyncratic influences that are very relevant to that particular insurance, but on a population wide scale, many of those factors tend to wash out. 

What's always true (at least in free markets) is people won't work for a lower wage than they can reasonably get elsewhere, and employers won't pay more than what a reasonable substitute will cost. Yes there is friction to changing from one employee to another and moving production and whatever, but over multi year timescales, that cost is diluted. If there is a job that is paying less and less, it's probably for a valid reason. 

The common rhetoric of ""greedy corporations"" doesn't make a lot of sense because of the job is providing a lot of excess value relative to the wage, and there's no takers at a low wage, the greedy businessman action would be raise the wage so that the job is filled so they can start making me more money.

k8h11ti,t1_k8gx80d,2023-11-09 07:07:15,Economics,"Okay, I was just trying to understand your point.  Anecdotally...

What I've seen in the different generations of my working career, I believe is a ""sign of the times.""  In the 80s, people worked multiple jobs as coming out of the 70s economy meant you could get ahead by having two working adults with one more more having jobs.  Both my parents had two jobs, and did gig work on the side to get ahead.

When I entered the work force in the early 90s, then we had tons of jobs and not enough laborers.  Everything was headed to the Y2K tech boom.  Salaries were constantly being renegotiated as things were under market rate.  It was a crazy time where college degrees weren't needed in a lot of tech professions.  You just had to show you had the skills.

Then the Y2K bust happened, dot com start ups crashed, there weren't enough jobs, the wages stagnated, layoffs and downsizing happened in so many industries, and mergers of companies were more common.  The people coming into the entry positions had to take lower starts, but honestly, in my industry, was comparable to what I was making.  But yeah, the rate of growth was rough, and the ""you have to change jobs every 2 years in order to make more money"" got really warped.  You did have to change jobs to make more money, and loyalty to jobs sank pretty low.  But you saw people trying to get that experience and wait out until jobs became more available.

When the Financial Crisis occurred, I saw a lot of people lose their homes and built up equity if they lost their jobs.  Some were already stretched thin on their payments, so I definitely saw some volatility in the work place.  That got people to look for a better job, since there were still jobs available, some people to hunker down in their position, and others just reevaluate.  We got more responsibility because hiring freezes were the norm.

All through this, wages never really went up, the hiring of workforce was only happening in the industries that had expansion.  There weren't enough service workers (like hotel staff, wait staff, retail) that I heard from the nieces and nephews how it was easy to get summer jobs or jobs while in college.  Now that 2010 was in full swing, the internet was full force, it was shoved that kids needed college degrees in order to succeed.  Conjecture on my part, but I think it's in partly due to the fact that the quality of high school education has gone down.  I think teaching salaries were another area that never really grew.

My mother couldn't really understand why some kids wouldn't just work minimum wage jobs and not go to college.  I had to remind her that she's Asian and would have considered it a failure if my life's work career was to flip burgers.  ""No son of mine will have that job!""  The only acceptable professions were doctor, lawyer, or engineer.  So now you have this generation of highly educated kids fighting for the experience and trying to gain recognition in the internet filtering processes that HR departments use.  It really bothers me thinking about how the resumes of qualified people are never even making it to a human eye.

So I get that technology is reducing the need for labor, and that there's more people in their labor pool, and that skills get outdated or lessened in value.  It just seems that so much of the end game for the jobs I've worked at is keeping the bottom line as low as possible, and catering to top line growth.  At the end of the day, it's never the labor that actually seems to see wages that can give them an affordable life.

The fact that I've only ever needed one job to be able to afford things, makes me realize how lucky I am.  My parents worked non-stop.  And the millennials I see now have fallen into that same pattern.  They have one job, but are likely to have at least one side gig or side hustle just to keep things going.  But that's my commentary on the world... keep the labor too busy, and they'll fail to notice just how the system isn't really benefitting them.",arkibet,t2_i93ca,2,0,reddit3

I'm sorry dude but a $5500 a month mortgage and a maid is a pretty lavish lifestyle. Remember the state of MA has an average household income of like $80k last I checked, it's higher the closer you get to Boston but your lifestyle is way over what the average is.

There are problems for sure but in my experience they care *way* more about safety than other warehouses(I have a theory about the safety numbers being bad but it's just my opinion) and they offer career options whether in building or out that I've never seen anywhere.

I've watched personally 20+ people take the jump from supervisor(they call a process assistant but it's basically the first jump up you take from entry level and it's filled only by people who moved up from the entry level) to management. And multiple times we ran out of people who wanted to make the jump so we had to hire from elsewhere. Everyone here who has been willing to put in the work and prep for interviews and such has the opportunity. College degree, no college degree, no relevant experience, it doesn't matter.  All that matters is how you are doing now and what kind of attitude you have.

I saw a guy go from tier 1 to l7(makes like 200k a year) in 6 years...that's insanely fast but he was someone with no degree who worked in construction before. I went from t1 to l5 in 5 years which is great. So many have done the same thing.

But it doesn't matter. They're not going to pass any of this stuff anyways. Why you may ask? Is it cause they lost control of the house? Nope. 

They had control. The teacher shortage isn't new. They couldn't do shit. Manchin doesn't support any of this crap. 

Look at Michigan. Gov. Whitmer proposed teacher retention bonuses last year, knowing Republican controlled state legislature would block it. Then Democrats get control. And wow. Stunning. All financial assistance, bonuses, or talk of raises for current teachers disappears from the budget proposals. When asked about it, her office gives no comment. 

Instead they're giving scholarships for incentives to get new people into the system. Which, sure, great! But that doesn't change the system. It doesn't make the actual job or pay of the jobs better. It just makes it easier to pull people into a profession where half of people leave the career in 5 years. 

Whitmer pushed the emphasis to the scholarships and expanding preschool to 4 year olds for free. Awesome. Absolutely amazing. 

Who's going to teach them? How are you going to make people want those jobs? Because we already woefully underpay early childhood educators compared to their underpayed K-12 counterparts. Crickets for those answers. 

But hey, they're going to spend millions on tutoring for kids after school! Awesome! Who's doing that? The underpaid and overworked people you already abandoned as soon as the votes came in?

But they're not making things better. 

And I swear, if I see one more study showing ""We looked at the reasons teachers leave. Outside of pay, here are the reasons!"" No. Just stop. Pay people. It's that simple. 

But no one wants to do that. And the teachers are already in the room for this price, so uh... Let's just try to replace all the ones who are running because they know the con, with fresh college kids we tricked into thinking it was a great opportunity.

I was happier at the alternative school, even though they were the ""bad"" kids who got expelled, and even though I had to work 12 hours a day since the pay was so bad, because I had smaller class sizes. 

Yes, all education staff members deserve to be paid more, but for a lot of us money isn't the biggest thing. To me it's class size. And it really just depends on the makeup of individual schools. 25 might be fine in one school, another school it's 15.

For the last two years I've taught at a really low public school. I love my students, but they have a lot of issues. Once my class sizes start getting over 15 students, adding one more student is like adding five. There are just so many behavior issues, but there's also so many academic issues. I'm talking about kids who are seventh graders who read at a second grade level. Kids who need one-on-one help to complete the most basic of work. As a teacher it's impossible to deal with extreme behavior issues along side the extreme academic issues and effectively teach when I've got 20-25 kids in a small classroom. 

My school's enrollment has slowly been decreasing, and the AP said yesterday that instead of having 1.5-2 teachers per subject there would just be one. He framed this as a good thing because we'd have less students in the school and it'd be easier to control things. What it really means for me is now instead of having 95/115 kids spread between 5 classes and the rest with another teacher, I'll have 115/115 spread between five classes because I'll be the only one teaching that subject for that grade level. So now my already too big of classes to effective teach in this school just went up by 4 kids per class.

jbsymlx,t3_11o63vm,2023-03-11 13:54:02,Economics,"Hi, I’d like to chime in. I’m 23 years old, graduated in 2018 with my diploma. When I was in high school, when sophomore year came around,I started to skip school and get high. It was easy. No one ever came looking for me and I never had to worry about getting caught because there was just no one to catch me. Both my parents worked full time so I could just stay home alone if and when I wanted to…. I kinda miss those days. 

As junior and senior year came around, I would
Only go to school 2-3 days a week, and only like 1-2 days a week about half way through senior year. I wasn’t performing academically, not because I was incompetent but because I just wasn’t ever at school. Sometimes I’d feel guilty, but then I’d go to school and sit in classrooms for hours to feel like I was wasting my time. There would be worksheets to fill out and text book pages to read, that’s pretty much it. I stopped feeling guilty for skipping school because I wasn’t learning anything anyways. School was just a placeholder for me at this point, a waiting room until graduation. 

Speaking of graduation, since I wasn’t performing at school I thought I might not graduate. I began to worry, I really wanted my diploma and I wasn’t really on track to get it due to not only my grades, but also my attendance. I had no where near enough seat time to graduate. But it’s okay because they gave my graduating class these grade recovery packets that were a completion grade basically. If you completed the packet, it’ll bring your grade to a c for whichever class it was designated for. So I just filled out those packets and graduated that way, I got my diploma. This was the case for about 70% of my graduating class…. It may have been closer to 80% now that I think about it. 

This was my high school education. It could’ve been better if I put more effort into it, put more effort into keeping my grades up, more effort into attending, more effort into my mental and emotional health so actually getting out of bed and making it to school would be easier, but I didn’t because I was bored and anxious. I’d struggle with anxiety, depression, and boredom while at school. It simply wasn’t a happy place for me, and that sad thing is that there were so many others just like me, and some far worse off.",icedcoffeeuwu,t2_5rgbmvnf,6,0,reddit4
jbu8fft,t3_11o63vm,2023-03-11 19:25:15,Economics,"I agree that it will take more than $60,000 to solve the teacher shortage. Look, when I made the transition from Corporate America to Teaching - pay wasn't entirely a factor for me. I made the drop from $64,000 down to $46,000. After two months of teaching, they bumped me up to $55,000 because they factored in all my master's degree units. So it wasn't as bad as of a drop. If I made it tenure at the end of this year, I would have gotten a $10,000 raise thus effectively bumping me up to $65,000. So $65,000 pay would have been doable for me for a few more years - I would have had to take more salary point classes to get to my personal min required of $75,000. 

Pay is only one part of the equation, but something that needs to be talked about are the working conditions. I'll lay out the issues below: 

1. Extremely limited bathroom breaks. This came as a shock to me coming from Corporate America. You only have recess & lunch to take your bathroom breaks. That's not how the human body works!!! If you gotta go, you gotta go. So teachers get a lot of UTIs and it is possible for UTIs to develop into a further complication because of lack of access to bathroom. 
2. No access to coffee and snacks. This was another shock because I always had free access to this no matter how big or small of a company I was at. We work with kids for God's sake and you can't even at least supply us with that? It's more energy draining than any office job. 
3. Some admins believe that you should be on your feet all day long and that if they catch you sitting down for one minute (even if its just to take a sip of water) - they think you're lazy and will write you up. This is horrible! Again, we're human and we need breaks too. 
4. Admins come into your classroom, they sit there, and they watch you work. They will do this multiple times a week or multiple times a year calling it ""informal observations"". It's unnerving having someone sit there and watch you like that. That's the most extreme amount of micromanagement I'd ever been subject to. In corporate America, managers just ask to be copied in on emails and they will only step in if there's an issue. I thought I had a micromanager in Corporate America when she was calling me every 20 minutes, but honestly, I rather take a phone call conversation every 20 minutes then have someone sit there & breathe down on my neck watching me.
5. Behavioral Challenges - Parents and Admin refuse to take accountability of any kind and they blame it on the teachers. This current generation of parents are extremely hands off unlike any other generation... all they wanna do is have fun with their kids (vacations and buying them fun stuff) without the responsibility. Parents don't discipline them at home and they refuse to reinforce concepts at home. Yet we get blamed for low assessment scores & we're doing everything we can... but we need help of the support system. Yet we don't have the support system. Parents & admins are stacked against us. 
6. Socio-Emotional Issues - After the pandemic, both adults and children cannot regulate themselves emotionally. I've seen both adults and children throw tantrums at each other, say really unkind things to each other, do such inappropriate things. I think everyone needs a social skill training. It doesn't matter who you are or how old you are - I feel basic manners and boundaries have gone.",chocolatelove818,t2_3qh891fc,3,0,reddit4

But the first year she was teaching, we qualified for food stamps. The salary was a joke. She's gotten several raises from the state, worked her way up the ""tiers"", gotten her national boards, and so on. It was hard work but she's doing well now.

But even so, there are over a hundred job openings in our district for special ed teachers. Resources and specialists are stretched almost to the breaking point. Classes are overcrowded. Special ed especially benefits strongly from small group instruction, and she has 4 times the number of kids in her class than the curricula assume. 

Parents are struggling, and don't have the time or energy to participate in their children's education. Most of them are no-shows to IEPs and parent-teacher conferences -- which are all scheduled with them over the phone. Kids do no homework or reading outside of school. There's a strong ""that's not my job, that's why we have teachers"" mentality among parents, especially the ones struggling with poverty. 

The grades the students get almost fully correlate to the income level of their parents. Rich kids live in rich areas and have parents who focus on education from an early age and donate generously of their time and money to their schools - and I can't blame them for doing so. They want what's best for their children. 

But most of our state is very poor, and those struggling parents can't make those kinds of sacrifices or investments.

I support deregulation of the labor force.  And deregulation merely means ""less regulation,"" it doesn't mean no regulations at all.  There would be more people willing to become public school teachers if it were deregulated.  This means LESS formal education required for teachers.  It can be incredibly demoralizing for a teacher to spend years getting masters degrees in education- only to enter the classroom and find out that they are surrounded by horrible children and it is illegal to discipline them.  This is very common in the labor force, someone goes through years of formal education- only to find out that they hate the job.

There are plenty of shortages in blue collar contracting work too because of labor licensing and regulation. Logic means comparing what happens in heavily regulated vs less regulated states and countries. Are there really more accidents and incompetence in carpet installation in less regulated New York than highly regulated California?  There weren't a bunch of wicked villainous kidnappers because Uber replaced government regulated taxis. 

I really see no way out of labor shortages with so much regulation, licensing, and formal education in place.  The US wouldn't have recovered from WW2 with so much regulation in place.

jbsez1h,t1_jbrdmez,2023-03-11 10:00:04,Economics,"Hi there, former teacher here and here's my story: 

I studied real hard to become a teacher, here in my southern EU country. Among my peers in my master's degree, me and one other girl had the highest grades. My average was of 17.1 out of a possible 20.0. I was a complete shit student my whole life, so that was where I turned it around. And it didn't go unnoticed. The course's coordinator appointed me as my class's spokesperson and course representative for the University's assemblies. 

I loved that first year of theory. Then I went out to the field. My internship was pure hell. Yeah, the kids don't care, it's true. I almost expected it. What I didn't expect was for other teachers to fuck me over. There was such little respect for the profession and 0 compassion, but to my understanding, some were just surviving and that meant doing and saying anything.

I didn't give up then however. I did 1 more internship. I still went and worked as a fully flegded teacher after finishing University. I would work hard til midnight to do lesson plans the students would enjoy, but no. They didn't care one iota. It's an extremely ungrateful profession and it isn't just the kids and fellow teachers. Half the time I'd prep a lesson, only to not have the projector work that day, or have an internet blackout, etc... My teacher used to tell me that I needed 2 and 3 back ups in my plans. Like... what? That's your answer to these shitty resources?

I was also the youngest person in all my schools. Let's just say that the teacher's lounge was like walking into a necromancer's chamber. At some point I asked myself ""wtf am I doing? I'm stressing and falling part over a job that does not give a single fuck"". So I quit. I didn't care about the money at all and more of it, wouldn't have swayed me to stay. It's the culture around it that is toxic af.

60k teachers about to retire in my country, in the next 4-5 years. That's nearly half the entire pool of professionals. My country's response was to lower the bar for a teacher to get into a school.

jbser0p,t1_jbs28yk,2023-03-11 09:56:49,Economics,"Hi there, former teacher here and here's my story: 

I studied real hard to become a teacher, here in my southern EU country. Among my peers in my master's degree, me and one other girl had the highest grades. My average was of 17.1 out of a possible 20.0. I was a complete shit student my whole life, so that was where I turned it around. And it didn't go unnoticed. The course's coordinator appointed me as my class's spokesperson and course representative for the University's assemblies. 

I loved that first year of theory. Then I went out to the field. My internship was pure hell. Yeah, the kids don't care, it's true. I almost expected it. What I didn't expect was for other teachers to fuck me over. There was such little respect for the profession and 0 compassion, but to my understanding, some were just surviving and that meant doing and saying anything.

I didn't give up then however. I did 1 more internship. I still went and worked as a fully flegded teacher after finishing University. I would work hard til midnight to do lesson plans the students would enjoy, but no. They didn't care one iota. It's an extremely ungrateful profession and it isn't just the kids and fellow teachers. Half the time I'd prep a lesson, only to not have the projector work that day, or have an internet blackout, etc... My teacher used to tell me that I needed 2 and 3 back ups in my plans. Like... what? That's your answer to these shitty resources?

I was also the youngest person in all my schools. Let's just say that the teacher's lounge was like walking into a necromancer's chamber. At some point I asked myself ""wtf am I doing? I'm stressing and falling part over a job that does not give a single fuck"". So I quit. I didn't care about the money at all and more of it, wouldn't have swayed me to stay. It's the culture around it that is toxic af.

60k teachers about to retire in my country, in the next 4-5 years. That's nearly half the entire pool of professionals. My country's response was to lower the bar for a teacher to get into a school.

I hate to make stereotypes, and this certainly doesnt apply across the board. It is just an anicdote.

As an American, there are several factors I see that have undermined education that have nothing to do with any individual student's choices, motivation, or anything like that. These will probably sound like conspiracy theories but it's... just the way things are here.

1.) First, public education has blatantly been under financial attack by politicians for decades. The right wing is quite literally trying to weaken public schools for monetary gain because private school lobbyists want to take over more of the sector.

2.) Second, as a part of the first point, it has been under rhetorical attack for some time now as well. The fact that well-educated people tend to lean left has been turned into propaganda that public schools are liberal indoctrination camps has taken over public discourse and that has trickled into high school and grade school as well.

3.) It's hard to illustrate how split the US population is by geography and wealth. We have many of the most prosperous suburban towns in the world with excellent education opportunities where kids are getting world-class college-quality education before they graduate high school, and there are desperately poor rural schools where a single teacher with a 4-year degree is handling every topic. America's education opportunities are still factually near the top... in very small, specific places. This has always been a factor in the world, but the US is lagging especially badly, as our culture of individualism has abandoned our poor communities and rural communities.

4.) Related to the last point: geography. The US is absolutely freaking huge, and our population is spread across it like icing on a cake—piled up in some places, but with a thin even layer across the rest. In the poor parts and rural parts (god help you if it's both), it is difficult to build and staff enough schools that kids can physically get to, especially with our dogshit public transportation. This is an enormous part of the reason that the US spends so much money on our education system for it to still be... not that great.

5.) Wealth gap (again). Income inequality is reaching a boiling point in the US. Our cost of living is still terrifically high and climbing aggressively, but wages for the lower classes have been stagnant (way behind inflation) for ages. This might seem a bit unrelated to early childhood education, but fewer families than ever before are able to take good care of their children. The way that children are treated here is tragic, to say the least. Many spend formative years at the cheapest daycare available because    families without some kind of higher education literally may not be able to pay the bills without both parents working.

I know this is a ton of seemingly unrelated stuff, but the class divisions and political entanglements of the US are very much breaking down everyday life here, every single day. On the bright side, many of these issues have been growing in public awareness, and some have even improved.

Also, I think this is ultimately a small part, but America has a deeply-rooted general culture of ignorance and stubbornness that clashes badly with formal education. I don't think this is a ***cause*** of any of this, but it is a large part of the reason things have gotten so bad without the public ""realizing"" until very recently.",RareKazDewMelon,t2_yrad5,1,0,reddit4

Okay, so, I’m a doctor and the way medical education has gone, it’s highly based on passing multiple choice exams. 

However, NBME (the test makers) design the question styles to not just be simple memorization questions. The questions are generally long and give you a lot of information about a clinical scenario, you then need to think 2 or 3 steps in advance to get the answer correct. 

For example, they may describe a patient’s symptoms only, then ask a question like: what side effect of treatment may they need to monitor for?

So, in your head, you need to figure out the diagnosis they have based on their symptoms and history, then you need to know what the medication would be to treat them, and then, you need to know the side effects of that medication in order to get the question right. 

It makes the test mostly unbeatable. It basically impossible to pass these tests without having incredible depth of knowledge about the subject.

Title 1 schools are the toughest. My district is the lowest paying within an area of 8 districts. The lowest paying just gave their teachers a raise, no we’re at the bottom. 

The turnover for title 1 schools is about the same given different incomes. 

Teaching isn’t a capitalist venture. Like, soldiers don’t join the army for that $100k paycheck. There is a lot of mythos involved, and that mythos supplants pay. Same with teaching. 

Right now it’s about conditions. For me it’s everyone who has an opinion on what I need to be doing ALSO doesn’t do the job. Do the job, then have an opinion. 

But let’s say that the pay goes up $40k everywhere; wouldn’t the expectations immediately go up as well?  The thing about working in a demoralizing profession is the freedom of nothing to lose. I’ve been “talking back” to parents and it’s wonderful. “No, you gave your student the cellphone, the technology exists on it for you to monitor the use, it is not my job to Police your property”.

I do believe there are a lot of people who would be good teachers who don't have backgrounds in masters degree education programs, but instead have backgrounds in the military, white collar jobs, or blue collar jobs.  

A petite woman who has been in academia her entire life probably isn't going to be as good at disciplining horrible children as someone with a military background would be.  Paying her more money isn't going to make her any more mentally tough.

I was working at a particularly bad school a few years back. We had a lockdown with an actual-dude-with-a-gun outside. Someone robbed a store at gunpoint and fled into school grounds (we were next door to the gas station they robbed).

Anyway, they called out the lockdown with the ""it's real"" codeword. I shoved my students into the supply closet. All forty of them into a fairly small space to sit and wait.

They locked and deadbolted me outside of the supply closet and wouldn't let me in, then proceeded to be as loud as you might assume 40 kids in a bad school locked in a supply closet without a teacher might be. I tried my key, but someone in there was holding the deadbolt lock and they were laughing. Some students inside tried to protest, but at that point they were at the mercy of the big ones holding the door.

I stood out in the empty classroom with a piece of metal pipe I had laying around ready to beat the hell out of anyone who tried to come through my front classroom door (locked, of course, but it has a man-sized plate of glass on it that isn't hard to break and walk through).

Sat there like that for four hours, knowing anyone walking by would hear these kids. Nothing I said would quiet them down. They spent the four hours on their phones, goofing off, being unbelievably loud, and destroying my supply room. Graffiti all over, things removed from containers and boxes, things dug through, things *stolen*. I had a full set of gearVR headsets in there we used - I won them through a school project I spearheaded and submitted to a samsung grant/competition.

Beyond the 8-3 school day, teachers many times have to arrive early to attend meetings and do prep work for the day. When school ends, they’re still at school for meetings and possibly attending/supervising clubs if they’re a sponsor. During the evenings and on weekends they’re grading in-class assignments, homework, projects, exams, and papers. Most importantly, they’re creating their lesson plans for the upcoming days and weeks. This means planning out how each class period will work, finding/creating/adapting materials such as work sheets and homework assignments, creating lecture PowerPoints or reviewing ones provided by the textbook. And of course, the script isn’t perfect so when students are struggling with parts it means rewriting those plans to focus on certain concepts. That’s an arduous process for just one class, now imagine an elementary school teacher who has to do this for English, Math, Science, and Social Studies/History or my high school chemistry teacher who taught college level AP Chemistry, honors chemistry 1 and 2, and standard chemistry 1 and 2. 

Teaching is a difficult and high hours job that deserves significantly higher pay.",ukfan758,t2_kg5d6,2,0,reddit4

jbu8dya,t1_jbtzqbz,2023-03-11 19:24:58,Economics,"I see your point, but our teachers don't get to pick their curricula. Every few years the legislature decides to purchase a new one, and mandates the teachers teach it. The teachers get no say in what they teach, they have to teach ""with fidelity"" the curriculum they are handed. 

Then they scrap that when they don't get immediate results on test scores, and purchase a new curriculum from the curriculum publishers, and roll that out. Every few years there's a brand new K-12 curriculum. The kids might see 4 or 5 different curricula during their 12 years at school.

And the different systems don't play well together. They all assume that you've been following their curriculum for all the previous years, so they assume certain things are going to be taught in a certain order. So giving 5th graders a curriculum that assumes they're taught certain things in 4th grade, and replacing it with a new one assumes entirely different things were taught in 4th grade, is confusing and counterproductive to students. (my wife has been through 2 different government administrations, 3 different school boards, and 4 different principals, all of whom have had different visions of what classrooms and education should look like.)

One time the teachers were told that they need to all teach exactly the same curriculum -- *to the page* \-- at every single school and classroom in the state. That way kids who are moved from one school to another will miss exactly nothing. But it allows exactly no wiggle room for a classes get ahead or behind due to unexpected closures, missing school, teachers being sick, or a million tiny things that could keep them from being perfectly synchronized.

Add to this the fact that the curriculum she uses specifically assumes she as a 6:1 teacher student ratio, and her class is 20:1. These are students with *severe* behavioral and emotional disorders. Her classroom is totally destroyed by children flipping desks and sweeping things on the floor several times a week, because there aren't enough adults present to handle them. She is legally obligated to educate *all* students, regardless of their behavior or disability. She can't kick them out. There's nowhere else to put them. And when disruptions like that happen, and the classroom is cleared, and an intervention team called in, *nobody* is getting educated. The intervention team itself is just teachers pulled from their own classrooms, which suffer too.

Teachers are simply not given the tools they need to succeed, and then punished for inevitable failure. 

I can't speak for your teachers union and their salaries, or your own, but I do know that for their level of education (usually masters) teachers are the lowest paid career of all professions. If you're getting a masters, literally *any* other job will pay more. And if your degree is in math or science, the gap is even greater. 

And I won't say there aren't bad or ineffective teachers. But I've always argued that if teachers were paid more, so that there were people lining up for the job (instead of the hundreds of job vacancies in our district), they would feel safer purging the deadweight. (actually identifying bad teachers is its own problem, since frequently swapping a teacher whose students perform well on tests with a teacher whose students perform poorly, has absolutely no effect on student performance. If the teacher isn't the key factor in that equation, what is?)

As it is, if they do fire a teacher for under-performing, the class is just going to end up with an even *more* unqualified long-term substitute, or divided among the other already-overcrowded classrooms, which drags down performance even lower. 

Every now and then they try loosening the standards for becoming a teacher to make more of them, but then they're hastily trained and ineffective. Or they try tightening the standards so the teachers will be more effective, but then there aren't enough of them.",NameLips,t2_21odr51g,2,0,reddit4

I don’t give a fuck about the civil war or the Persian wars, also don’t give a fuck about math or proper English. What I do care about is learning new languages (I speak 3 from rural Midwest America, English/Spanish/French) I care about financial literacy and investing tactics, I care about the science behind how someone makes buying decisions and how I can manipulate their thought patterns, I care about reading peoples body language, i care about coding/programming, etc etc. None of which are taught in schools (except language but there are better/free ways to learn these now and coding, again, better/free than the classroom).

The problem isn’t we don’t want to/can’t learn. It’s that the generic copy/paste shit they teach us in schools from teachers who I don’t believe are smarter/more capable than me.

Majority of Parents are too busy because they are chasing the next paycheck to make ends meet, and therefore have no time to spend on their kids, which puts too much pressure on Educators. Also there are Social Media parents that have kids on third of fourth spot on their priority list. And there is Political Brainwashed parents that think schools have gone Woke and teachers are overfunded. And there is Loaded Parents, although a smaller percentage, which instead of putting the effort to raise good children they spoil them beyond common sense just to get them off their backs 

I’m neither of those groups, fortunately. But I have been raised by my parents that way (and different part of the world) and I appreciate that mentality. I always have been pushed to do my best and behave my best (FYI didn’t grow up in a religious family).  

TBH I am not impressed with curriculum my kids are learning, and I can’t blame teachers for that, if that’s a reason for parents to drop the ball on teachers. But there are options, I push my kids to do extra work on payed websites to challenge and further improve themselves.

My son had amazing teachers and faculty in high school who went the extra mile with him and communicated with me probably more than I wanted. It’s definitely a societal problem, with many kids, by the time they reach HS, simply not giving a fuck about their education. I can only make assumptions as to why (ie, disincentives from parents who maybe felt the education system didn’t help them or are disillusioned with the system). Bmore is a city of contrasts: it’s an incredible town with amazing charm, but has real societal issues with poverty, opportunity, and policing. 

I’d argue the amount of money being spent is adequate as there are a complex set of issues that need to be addressed (ie, a dozen or more schools that need complete overhaul like HVAC installs so they don’t have “heat days” where class is canceled, but they’re OLD historic buildings so it’s extremely expensive and difficult to remodel or replace them). We still have some lead pipes. Transportation is so-so; most HS kids take the city bus to school if they’re too far to safely walk, and there’s very limited mass transit options here. 

But the biggest issues are the incentive structures for those who lack opportunity. We can change those, but it will take a lot of investment.

Those same kids might do really well in a trade school learning how to work on cars, becoming personal trainers or something else that they actually find interesting.

Rent in Orlando is about $2K, more of you want to optimize for the better neighborhoods with the better schools. We've been lucky with charter schools, which don't require you to live in the pricey neighborhood the school is actually in.

So, $2K in rent means that 2 weeks of every month is just rent. With 50% of your income going to housing, you're already considered financially distressed, and we haven't even figured in utilities.

For the record, to your other point, I do have a masters degree and teachers do have more pay and benefits then a lot of working professionals I know in our area. This probably varies greatly by state and district. Regarding special needs kids. So in our school one of the things they did was put all the disruptive kids in one class with our non-disruptive kid who just needs to be taught differently. The times we tried to change teachers because of crap like that the district literally came in and accused us of all kinds of things they made up to the point where we had to get them to back down with a lawyer and even then they refused to change classrooms. Maybe this is because of the teacher to student ratio you spoke about. My wife worked in special needs classrooms as an aid and had more knowledge about our child’s disabilities than the actual teachers.

“Maryland has made significant progress in reducing lead levels statewide, but significant disparities in lead poisoning still exist. At the same time, new programs through Medicaid have made it easier for families to eliminate sources of lead in their environment. We strongly encourage all parents who have not done so already to make sure their children are tested for lead, as it is the only way to know that your child has not been exposed.”
Thousands of students go untested, have lead issues in their homes and do not have access to water fountains at school. They rely on bottled water being available while at school. This stresses school budgets.

jbtztru,t1_jbto9sr,2023-03-11 18:24:55,Economics,"That's pretty much the gist of it. People are quick to point out the root causes of these issues, which are typically easy to identify and generalize.  

The real question is what are proper avenues or even full solutions to the root causes? How do you make people better parents when many of the bad parents are people that should have never had kids to begin with? An entire reworking of the education system and their programs is needed, but the fix will not be instantaneous and will need other systems in place for efficient changes to them as technology, science, and society progress. Administration is typically an economics and bureaucracy issue. So you have suits encouraging the continued use of an inefficient and ineffective system to meet standardized test scores for continued funding, else your school will decline even more with less resources and money to keep the good teachers. 

Culturally we have not valued education enough, and over time have become complacent. Sure, the good parents will create good children, which in turn become good students and find their own path to success. But how many good parents are needed to sustain society? How do you shift a culture to value education more without worsening the stress put on children and in turn worsening the suicide epidemic?

The first course of action has to be tackling the antiquated education system. Seperation of children based on comprehension earlier in the grade system is important, so those that learn at a slower pace are identified and aided to ensure they don't fall too far behind. In theory, the only ones that will fall behind are the mentally deficient or the ones with bad home lives, which is just an unfortunate reality, but can be improved with time. Accelerate fundamental courses like Math, because children actually have incredible capabilities for shaping the way they analytically think through things with complex math. Include philosophical and societal courses during middle school and high school to teach children how to question things and establish values. Teach with the goal of understanding rather than memorization, so students will always have fundamentals to build off of as they figure out their own way to truly learn things. Include more college level STEM courses in high school so students can explore their options earlier, not the watered down versions we have now. 

This isnt even the whole picture or a total solution, just ideas that I personally have. What we really need are smart people in power that understand the issues, ask the right questions, talk with other experts, and are willing to implement complete overhauls to the system that allow for iterative improvements over time. Then hopefully the culture will change, hopefully better education also creates better living standards, also allows for better understanding of the world and people around us, which in turn can create better parents.",IBlowMen,t2_hm1th,2,0,reddit4

No tenure anymore (legislation killed it), and teachers have ZERO protections here (no real union, no real legal leg to stand on), so, they non-renew teachers all the time to cut costs. If you've got 15+ years of experience, your days are numbered. They'll boot you because you have zero protections in our ""right to work"" state (they simply don't offer you a contract next year due to budget or whatever, and you have **zero** recourse against this - and you don't find out until the summer has started so you're scrambling for a new job while every other teacher in the universe is doing the same thing). From there, they'll hire a newbie (or hire someone who doesn't even have a teaching cert), and you'll end up with a massive paycut if you try to take a position anywhere else (districts only honor 5-10 years of experience in pretty much every major district in the state). This is a big deal, because your RETIREMENT is based on the pay you earned in your last few years of teaching, so many of these teachers choose early retirement rather than taking a new job that would fuck their retirement earnings forever, or they just nope out of the whole thing entirely.

This also means you'll probably be stuck driving to the next city over, because the district that non-renewed you can't take you on at any other school in their district or they'll have to pay you at full-price, so... you are basically forced to commute to a different city in the area. Can't move, either, because cost of housing has gone up so much that you're stuck in whatever you managed to get your hands on (if you were lucky enough to buy in BEFORE the insane price and rent increases).

My last year, we didn't even get contracts until the summer had already started. When they found out I wasn't renewing, they yelled at me because school was just about to start up, how could I possibly not renew my contract with so little time! I wasn't giving them time to replace me!

jbstbpj,t1_jbsqb4q,2023-03-11 13:03:57,Economics,"This is a long post so I apologize. It depends on the standard of living and who they're teaching. I personally believe those who work with more difficult students should be paid more to attract higher quality teachers. 

On the same subject, teachers, or anyone, shouldn't have to get advanced degrees and potentially go into tens of thousands of dollars more into debt just to increase their pay. I know it's different across states and within states across districts, but the common ways in education to make more money is by basically buying an advanced degree, working more (tutor/coach/teach an additional class/summer school), or maybe a yearly increase of like 3%.

Part of the problem is many teachers start so low to begin with. They're also paid much lower at the start of their careers compared to people with similar education. Get a bachelor's and teach and make like 35k. Get a bachelor's and go into IT and make 50k plus. Easy decision. 

Like what we're talking about. Sure, in my district I can make up to about 100k (92 base with about 8k to retirement) but I have to have a masters plus 40 credits and 20 years experience (I misspoke earlier, it's 20 years not 30). If you just stick with a bachelor's you're capped at 70k with retirement after twenty years. And yearly pay increases stop at year 12 until the teacher starts getting incriments of ten advanced credits or until year 20 when it's a one-time 2k raise. 10-30k difference just because of a piece of paper that often puts a person into debt just to get it. 

By the 2024-2025 school year, teachers in my district with just a bachelor's start at 43k. Even if they started at 50k, not even 60k, were talking $400ish a month extra after taxes. That's a world of difference. 

The thing about starting teacher salaries is that they're so low that it's hard to retain teachers because of the horrible working conditions. It took me eight years and another masters degree just to not have to work	a night job and 12 hours a day to support myself. But I love my students and my job. The only people you retain with low starting salaries are those who love what they're doing despite the working conditions. But that only goes so far and we get burnt out. Increasing starting pay by 10k might be enough to convince more teachers to stay.",CustomerSuspicious25,t2_94fjksqd,2,0,reddit4

We made the same amount of money, and his job is significantly more demanding, in my opinion. This isn’t to say teachers in my city don’t have it hard, they absolutely do, and it’s why I’m not a teacher anymore. There’s this belief firefighters just go to grocery stores and hang out at the station, and I hate it. At least in the department he works for, he is criminally underpaid and their call volume is INSANE. 20+ runs a day. Everyday he works, he responds to gunshot wound victims, motor vehicle accidents, and other traumas or emergency health situations. Every other day, he is on the pumper and responds to fires. His last tour, there were three fires in one day. Do you have any idea the physical demand it takes to fight two fires in old apartment complexes during the middle of the hot day in full gear…. And then respond to another at 2 am? 

Maybe there’s a significant difference between departments. It just makes my heart hurt to think about the lack of respect and appreciation people have of the 3000 firefighters in my city, when they are so deserving. 

My intention was to point out that firefighter are also needed and should be valued, and that we don’t need to compare this job to teaching. They are both hard in their own ways.

While I do think that there is some small part due to the glorification of mental illnesses by some segments of society, the kind of stuff that got really big on tumbr back in the day before it broke out into wider circulation on social media, I think that the fundamental nature of social media itself is what’s causing mental illness. I’m not saying most these kids want to be mentally ill, or making comments on your very specific situation. 

Social media has become so insanely toxic, hyper partisan, hateful, and overall negative that any human being that spends a substantial amount of time on it is going to have noticeable effects on their emotions. I’m 37, so I’m at the dividing line of the last humans who had a large portion of their childhood before the internet. We didn’t have social media until I was a freshman in college, and as you know it was a very different place back then. And even at my age I have to take time off because if I go to Reddit or Twitter too frequently I get noticeably more angry and depressed. 

So my main point is these kids that have no other frame of reference, that didn’t get to grow up in the pre internet 90’s, have completely internalized the insane levels of toxicity, negativity, and anger that have become the predominant narrative on social media.

Reminds me of an old study that claimed that banks were treating a particular group unfairly because they got loans approvals at a rate equivalent to [other group] with a lower credit score but once they had the loans had an *identical* repayment rate....

Then some statisticians pointed out that the results showed that the group were *actually* less likely to pay back their loans with the same credit score such that the banks were almost perfectly calibrated re real risk of default and the original authors agreed.

If a companies share price got *unfairly* decreased due to a diverse board then such companies would end up looking unusually profitable with unusually high dividends compared to share price.

On the other hand if you observe no correlation then it means the market is well calibrated...

My question is: how does a journal trust you're telling the truth without releasing your data? 

I know more about data than Economics, by that I could fabricate a dataset that adheres to my criteria and become famous simply by the fact that I consistently fudged data points around a standard normal distribution to adhere to a point I wish to prove.

I've never seen top level research in economics not explicitly state where they get their data from; anything outside of that would be either ignorance or malice, as far as I'm concerned.

The point is moot though because this particular paper did fully release this info.

It’s quite telling what women have to keep putting up with.

Edit: also some positions have a larger effect on company culture than others. If the CEO is sexist/racist/ etc it hugely overshadows other people on the board that may not be themselves actively making a hostile workplace but are unable to overrule the elephant in the room. If you have a sexist hiring manager that has to approve all hiring/promotion that will handicap what candidates are able to move up the chain.

Unfortunately, similar efforts have backfired in the past.

Without information on criminal records, employers relied more on their own biases; the large unintended effect suggests that employers overestimate the share of black and Hispanic men with criminal records, so criminal records information equalized hiring outcomes.

Employers may initially offer lower salaries to women because of their bias, but if they are making an offer, than the woman is still in a position to negotiate that salary higher. Again, this is different from not offering jobs to those you suspect of having criminal records, where there is no room for negotiation.

Weather or not women can then successfully negotiate a higher salary remains to be seen.

This isn't very surprising; they're going to work with whatever proxies they have. Blacks have about six times the incarceration rate of whites. If a company is really risk-averse, they're likely just going to not interview blacks at all if they don't have records on their criminal histories, even though the majority of black people have never been incarcerated for committing a crime.

Thus the groups which are most going to benefit are the groups which commit the least crime, and anyone who is in a group which commits above-average crime rates is going to get screwed, even if the overall group rate is still quite low.",TitaniumDragon,t2_4ibkz,6,0,reddit2

One is about overall fair employment which as you stated didn't work out so well. And the other is about closing the wage gap for women and to an extent minorities.

We already know males are more likely to be offered a higher salary right off the bat. This usually translates into employers having to compete and offer a greater wage rate than what the candidate held before, in this case being a male that is already making more money than most women, therefore continuing the trend of this male making more than his female counterpart.

Women are generally paid less than males from the start of their professional careers and will hold that lower standard of wage as they advance in their careers because employers now know for a fact that they'll be able to offer a lower wage rate than what they might offer a man that is already making more for the same position.

All this does is remove that lower standard of pay for women and again to an extent for minorities as employers will not know for sure if the candidate already makes more than what they're willing to offer. It doesn't even the playing field, but it will definitely make for competitive offers by allowing uncertainty in the candidates current or previous wage.

It's not relying on biases. It's relying on statistics.

Statistically blacks are more likely to have a criminal record. If you can't access the information about an individual, you're forced to either assume either blacks and whites are equally risky to hire, or assume all whites are a similar to risk the white average and blacks risky to the black average.

Current salary is just one signal here, and this is why it's always a good idea to get more than one offer if you're searching for a job. Let's say your current job pays $50k, but you're actually worth $70k and $75k to employers A and B, respectively. Whether you share your salary or not, your first offer for employer A might be $55k. Without an offer from employer B, you might only get to $60k or so, but if you get them to bid each other up, you should end up with ~$71k.

This ban should make employers offer higher salaries across the board, which is better for everyone.  

I'm not saying it's going to work, but the thought process behind the law when introduced in Massachusetts was that employers would be more inclined to offer a higher salary as they don't know what they're competing against.

In other words, that person would be offered towards the high end of the range you provide. Easy. If you're going to be a better offer, then you can say so openly and early on.

>  In your add do you say, with x experience you get y, with a experience you get b, etc, etc.

What I was suggesting is ""Employees at this position can expect been X and Y"". In other words, display the numbers you already know (assuming you budget well). Though of course nothing prevents you from doing what you suggested would be absurd.

> All they do is force out small business and allow large corps to flourish.

If you are saying small companies can't win unless they use salary information asymmetry in their favor, why should anyone work for a small company? Why should I work for your company if you can't at least compete on compensation with all the other firms who may want me?

The solution is easy. If you want to attract more and better talent, pay more. Charging less or selling better is the main way that smaller firms can compete in the market.

Information asymmetry is one of the main things that prevents markets from working optimally. Allowing employees to not feel pressured into giving out their salary history will reduce the massive information advantage that employers have.

To the point about the wage gap, the information asymmetry will tend to hurt lower-skilled and lower-salaried more - which heretofore has tended to be disproportionately minorities and women most of all.",BritainRitten,t2_3a1ia,2,0,reddit2

It becomes a tax, whereby the purchaser is required to support an American worker and a cost, whereby US national income is in effect reduced.

Economics is unique I think where a lot of the theory is changing so rapidly, including questioning basic facts based on what I've had economists say. 

this is not really true in other fields.

In medicine or other biomedical areas, the basics don't change, anatomy is anatomy, cells are cells, physiology is physiology. New advancements, or tweaks to prior knowledge may occur, but overall it is just learning new information, and applying that. New tools come available, you learn to use that. 

Same with the rest of STEM, the fundamentals of mechanics don't change, special relativity isn't changing. Thermoydynamics is not changing.

We learn more about how they work, but the basics of how they operate doesn't just change. Even something as ""new"" as QM doesn't change in terms of the basics. Spooky Action, Heinsberg Uncertainty, wave-particle duality etc. 

The thing is it requires a very large conceptual, practical, and theoretical understanding to learn the things in the first place, and remembering them to apply them later.

Even programming. Programming fundamentals don't change. Once you learn to code, C, C++, Java, Python, MATlab, R, these things are used so frequently and for such a long period of time that they are unlikely to be given up any time soon.

The culture could be, say ""this one worker is doing the labor of what once required 10 workers. Here is your 10x wage!"" or ""we only need you 1/10th the time! here, take the same pay, we are just as productive!"" 

But instead it's ""I shall fire 9 people, keep all the productivity gain from the work done by the remaining one and not pay them any more - even though they are producing 10 times as much"".

dcz2d5t,t1_dcz1vhj,2017-01-27 11:54:08,Economics,"That second sentence of yours is true, one dollar benefit the poor more than it does the rich. I have 2 points against that though: 

1) forcing the opposite is ever moral? The dollar could be flowing straight to the fattest capitalist pig who never donates. One honorable thing for him to do is to donate at his own free will, but given he is a fucking pig and he won't do it, does it make it ok to force it? Do ends justify the means?

2) I partiatly disagree with your proposition that the rich are taking advantage of the poor. The rich do take advatange of the poor on the very common occasion that it is colluding with the government, or that it is itself the government. Otherwise it's all voluntary. Somebody just created a company (a capitalist) and will profit much from it hopefully. He tries to hire somebody to help, and this employee will only accept the offer if the offer benefits them. As long as it is all voluntary, it will be 100% beneficial for both the owner and the employee.

Also in that last scenario, it is clear to me the owner will get more money out of it because he added the most value to the business by, well, creating it in the first place. He may have been richer and now he will get even more money, that's good for him! That's actually what moved him to take the risk and create the company. The employee however didnot have the vision, did not take any risks, however a hard worker he may be, for that he earns less.

I have been an employee my entire life, mainly because I'm risk averse, even if there have been multiple low cost opportunities for me. The prospect of making a lot of money is what is making me want to quit my job and take the plunge.",Flowerburp,t2_x3ejq,1,0,reddit3

It is why [95% of the income gains since the recession have gone to the Top 1%](http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/15/news/economy/income-inequality-obama/). Again... clear example of a zero sum game that is the world of finance today.

As for what happens when a company becomes more efficient: They never really have a reason to increase their workers wages, since their wages are determined by what that person's market value is. They instead get a temporary boost to profits, which they deserve for seeking out more efficient practices. But the boost is always temporary, since competitors have an incentive to copy their methods and compete on prices (look at graphs on profit margins, they haven't been increasing exponentially over time despite the fact that efficiency has.)

Here's an [actual study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2895161) from Harvard:

> We explain why S&P 500 shareholder-payout figures provide a misleadingly incomplete picture of corporate capital flows and the financial capacity of U.S. public firms. Most importantly, they fail to account for offsetting equity issuances by firms. We show that, taking into account issuances, net shareholder payouts by all U.S. public firms during the period 2005-2014 were in fact only about $2.50 trillion, or 33% of their net income. Moreover, much of these net shareholder payouts were offset by net debt issuances, and thus effectively recapitalizations rather than firm-shrinking distributions. After excluding marginal debt capital inflows, net shareholder payouts by public firms during the period 2005-2014 were only about 22% of their net income. In short, S&P 500 shareholder-payout figures are not indicative of actual capital flows in public firms, and thus cannot provide much basis for the claim that short-termism is starving public firms of needed capital. We also offer three other reasons why corporate capital flows are unlikely to pose a problem for the economy.

...

> Our analysis thus suggests that the volume of share repurchases and dividends by the largest public firms is highly unlikely to indicate that short-termism, or some other factor, is causing public firms to distribute too much cash to shareholders. Those arguing that short-termism is harming the economy will need to look elsewhere to find support for their claim.

And [here](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2016/01/26/executive-pay-share-buybacks-and-managerial-short-termism/) is probably the most comprehensive (and actually scientific) study done on the topic that I have seen.

> The findings summarized in this post illustrate great diversity in share buyback activity. If corporate capital allocation strategies were more homogeneous (e.g., universal share buybacks or universal capital investment growth), the findings of our analysis would perhaps be very concerning for macroeconomic growth and public company stability. **However, the results of our study show that individual company decisions are not homogeneous, and that shareholder returns for companies employing both investment and share buyback strategies are similar.**",dontfightthefed,t2_ce00m,5,0,reddit3

The impact comes from transport companies. Cab companies no longer need drivers, so there's a *huge* regular cost to them that's completely eliminated.

That's demonstrably false — not everyone utilizes tools & information nor spends their time in the same manner.

If you compare a farmer with a computer vs. a programmer with a computer, both experience an increase productivity (albeit in different ways) — there is no absolute loss in productivity or well-being simply by both parties having access to the same tools. In other words, both groups having access to computers  in this example is a [Pareto optimal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pareto-optimality) outcome.

Using the same farmer vs. programmer example, suppose both groups have access to large drones. The farmer would be able to use the drones to dust crops on a regular basis and experience a massive increase in productivity, but a programmer (for the sake of this argument) doesn't have any use for a large drone. This is another Pareto optimal outcome because even though the farmer experiences productivity gains and the programmer does not, the programmer also does not experience any loss due to the farmer's gain (and in fact would probably experience gain in the form of decreased food prices).",dangersandwich,t2_53x7e,11,0,reddit3

If you look at the article I linked, point #3 is an attempt to argue back against the claim that there's nowhere better to invest, so they turn to buybacks. First, it notes that buybacks are not the best way to redistribute unneeded profits back to shareholders:

>Some people used to argue that buybacks were a more tax-efficient means of distributing money to shareholders than dividends. But that has not been the case since 2003, when the tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends were made the same.

Then it also says:

>But the MSV [maximizing shareholder value] school ignores other participants in the economy who bear risk by investing without a guaranteed return. Taxpayers take on such risk through government agencies that invest in infrastructure and knowledge creation. And workers take it on by investing in the development of their capabilities at the firms that employ them. As risk bearers, taxpayers, whose dollars support business enterprises, and workers, whose efforts generate productivity improvements, have claims on profits that are at least as strong as the shareholders’.

>The irony of MSV is that public-company shareholders typically never invest in the value-creating capabilities of the company at all. Rather, they invest in outstanding shares in the hope that the stock price will rise. And a prime way in which corporate executives fuel that hope is by doing buybacks to manipulate the market. The only money that Apple ever raised from public shareholders was $97 million at its IPO in 1980. Yet in recent years, hedge fund activists such as David Einhorn and Carl Icahn—who played absolutely no role in the company’s success over the decades—have purchased large amounts of Apple stock and then pressured the company to announce some of the largest buyback programs in history.

Also:

>Many academics—for example, Gary P. Pisano and Willy C. Shih of Harvard Business School, in their 2009 HBR article “Restoring American Competitiveness”  and their book Producing Prosperity—have warned that if U.S. companies don’t start investing much more in research and manufacturing capabilities, they cannot expect to remain competitive in a range of advanced technology industries. 

>Retained earnings have always been the foundation for investments in innovation. Executives who subscribe to MSV are thus copping out of their responsibility to invest broadly and deeply in the productive capabilities their organizations need to continually innovate. MSV as commonly understood is a theory of value extraction, not value creation.

The problem, then, is that companies claim they're out of good investment opportunities, but aren't. They're simply cutting down on future innovation, research, and production in favor of short-termism because the myopic view is better for CEOs and short-term shareholders who help boost the stock price.",,,10,0,reddit3
dcy7dw0,t1_dcy6fug,2017-01-26 21:20:00,Economics,">Yeah, that characterization of stock buybacks is comically wrong. It's essentially just a more tax efficient dividend. That is just one guy's (poorly researched, poorly thought out) opinion on what is causing this.

What's interesting about your response is that it makes clear you either didn't read, or are just ignoring, what the author of the link said.

The author addressed precisely this claim about it being a more ""tax efficient dividend"", saying:

>Some people used to argue that buybacks were a more tax-efficient means of distributing money to shareholders than dividends. But that has not been the case since 2003, when the tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends were made the same.

So already, we've got that off the table.

I also find it very disingenuous that you call Will Lazonick, a professor of economics with a history of research into innovation and competition, and who got a PhD at Harvard in economics, ""one guy"" who has a ""poorly researched, poorly thought out"" opinion.

Moving along:

>Here's an actual study from Harvard:

Even more interesting is that your study that you attempt to use to debunk my source, a professor of economics, is done by a lawyer and a professor at Harvard's Business School. Our sources are fairly equally reputable, and trying to discount mine is poor form.

As for your study, I'm sure there'll be continuing debate on the subject. I look forward to it. I'm sure there will debates over their methodology, as well as how they represent shareholder payouts generally (especially the tender offer and otherwise distinction).

>And here is probably the most comprehensive (and actually scientific) study done on the topic that I have seen.

Each single one of those cities listed in the article are the most desirable places in the country to live in due to weather, culture, geography, amenities, architecture, etc. There is high competition to live in these places, and it will never change. If everyone had the choice of living in San Diego, or Fargo North Dakota, 99 times out of a 100 people will choose San Diego because it is the more desirable place to be.

But we can’t all live in San Diego. So prices go up.

I’m not denying boomers could buy a house in Boston or Seattle for a cashiers salary in 1965 or whatever. But that was 70 years ago. The population doubled, immigration has increased, the nation de industrialized and the world globalized. Things change, and with it economic realities.

People try to defend living in these places because “higher salaries”, but It is a well known fact that adjusted for cost of living, the coasts have some of the worst salaries to offer.

https://flowingdata.com/2021/03/25/income-in-each-state-adjusted-for-cost-of-living/

I’m sorry, but at this point, if youre insisting on living in a place with high desireability and competition, you have to accept that what is considered middle class lifestyle in your Midwestern home state is exponentially harder to achieve in a place with lots of money. That’s not the systems fault it is a fault of your expectations. You’re not a victim. 

Edit: just to further emphasize the point- when adjusted for cost of living, average salaries for coastal states don’t actually out class those in the interior even though the sticker price is higher.

When adjusted for affordability from average salaries, Massachusetts is beaten by Iowa, Washington States is Beaten by Missouri, Oregon is beaten by Alabama, and Hawaii, California, AND New York are beaten by West Virginia.

Edit 2: people arguing that salaries on the coast ARE high enough despite evidence to the contrary. I don’t even want to argue. Either the article is wrong and making 300k IS enough in NYC to offset the costs so you shouldn’t complain; or the article is right and the rat race salaries don’t justify COL. Pick your victimhood narrative please- but the coasts can’t simultaneously be unaffordable and also the only places you can make money to live cuz every city not on the coast “doesn’t have jobs”.

Maybe $90k in a VHCOL city feels like $30k in a LCOL city, for a 3x multiplier. I can believe that for certain city comparisons.

But not $300k versus $100k. Anyone who says this simply hasn't actually had to budget in both an expensive city and a cheap city. The following items are basically the same cost between cities, or completely uncorrelated with general cost of living:

* Digital subscriptions (Netflix, Office 365, etc.)
* Phone and internet service
* Most physical electronics (phones, computers, TVs)
* Most durable goods that can be bought online
* Any consumption that takes place away from your home city: travel, vacations, charity/support for a dependent who lives elsewhere, etc.
* Investment grade assets, like stocks, bonds, CDs, even real estate in some cases
* Debt repayment

1. Even if you only buy a ""crappy"" million dollar house, that house is worth a  ton which you can later sell for a ton. When you retire and move to a more cost friendly area you can use that equity to live like a king.
2. You can get a much larger 401K match at your company due to your location inflated salary. This will also allow you to max out your 401K every year which will allow you to live much better when you eventually move.
3. You can also max out your IRA. 6-7K is nothing when you are making a 300K salary. Once again, this all drastically helps you in the long run when you go to retire and move to a more cost friendly area.

You have a choice, you can live in a cool fun place with lots of restaurants, culture, etc, and pay a premium for it. Or, you can move to a smaller town and get a lot less of all that but at a reduced price.

It's all good that someone making $300,000 in NYC is fine, but the median household income in NYC is absolutely not $300,000 It's $70,000. Nevermind the barista and such that have to commute hours or pay absurd living standards to work there to make Starbucks for anyone in NYC.

Either people are infatuated with the top-line at the expense of the bottom-line or there are other factors not accounted for — not counting the social sorting and lifestyle aspects afforded by the HCOL cities. 

I’d posit that the broader, more diverse job markets in major metro areas mitigate risk for workers. And that this risk mitigation plays a significant part in location choices. Say Komatsu acquires Caterpillar, then lays off middle management, executives, HR, IT and Marketing. The Peoria economy isn’t going to readily absorb those workers. People will have to uproot their families. Compare that to CenturyLink acquiring Qwest in Denver and initiating major layoffs. The larger job market provides more opportunities for the large market (higher COL) workers to find equivalent positions. A broader economy also allows workers more freedom to choose employment situations and careers that suit their interests and needs.

To defend these investments, people have generally favored the passage of policies and legislation that made it harder to build new housing, in order to keep the supply low, while demand increased ever higher. Where we are at now is a consequence of decades of this policy of upholding the investments of all the people who already own houses. We could significantly shakeup the housing market through loosening zoning regulations, and other incentives for developers wanting to build high density housing, but it would come at the cost of lowering home values which will piss off a huge segment of the electorate.

I’ve seen many Redditors claim that any income under $1 mil is middle class, and that $400k a year “is not very much money”. (A post on this sub not that long ago had to be locked because so many were saying that and complaining). Apparently it’s normal to spend $15-20k (or even more) on vacations? $100+ per person a restaurant? Botox/fillers, as well as handbags that cost a few thousand dollars are apparently “affordable”., etc. On a reality tv sub I frequent, many people were claiming that they never spend less than $800 on a haircut and color. Even those claiming to live in LCOL areas said they spend at least $400. (I’ve always been in a HCOL, and no one spends over $150 unless they go to the most expensive salons in the city). I feel like I’m living in an alternate reality. The people I know who do make $250k+ don’t live like that.

I wonder what happened to make people so out of touch. Reddit used to champion the little guy and hate the rich. Now the definition of rich has been changed.

The longer version:

I worked at a finance software provider for venture capital, private equity, fund of funds, family offices, that sort of thing. That put me in touch with a lot of resourceful folks.

I eventually quit my job at the software provider and started helping companies with acquisitions. A lot of managing partners don't really know fuck all about how software works. They hire someone to go through it all, and during mergers and acquisitions, to essentially be their little gray man who shows up and reports to them in an unbiased way.

Did that for awhile.

One of the acquisitions involved a US venture capital firm, a Chinese company, and a firm who had a development team in Vietnam. I was asked to come here for 3 months to go through things and ensure everything was handed off, answer any questions, and act as a liaison for the US company.

I decided I liked it here, and stayed for a bit longer, and started just being a code monkey. Initially I was selling crm software, particularly Salesforce and Dynamics. That put me in contact with a fairly large streaming company who had offices in Australia. I was hired to help them with their billing and content management system, and various odds and ends.

One thing lead to another, and I've now lived here for 8 years. I charge between $175-220/hr, but the streaming company coming up on the latter half of that. They are a very good and generous customer, and essentially just buy any amount of time I'm willing to commit to them. My location has never been an issue.

I do various odds and ends for some accounting firms and SaaS companies as well.

It was just right place right time. I had enough money to not really care if anyone said no to me, and I think they knew that.

I will say though, that the key to being successful in software is being hyper specialized. I'm very, very specialized in my skillset, knew some people, and have a few open source application, articles, and skills that make me the go-to guy for one very weird particular niche.",TldrDev,t2_uq29p0f,3,0,reddit4

Where is this? And what are you comparing to? It sounds like an exception.

Income inequality seems to not be awesome everywhere… (link - https://davemaps.com/maps/us-income-inequality-2017)

Fewer mental health issues because you have literally zero resources. The crazy folks aggregate in the city because that’s where the resources are.

The education point is nonsense. I’d put boston school’s education against anything and everything Mississippi has to offer. All day. (And NYC, or DFW, or the twin cities, or any other decent metropolis.)

And you don’t have to “keep them quiet”. They are cheap BECAUSE no one wants to live there. There are places all across the south creating tax incentives and even outright paying people to move there, yet they still struggle to acquire talent.

As in, getting a coffee is a walk across the street, and you say hi to the owner, who is also a next door neighbor, and has kids in the same class as yours.

Getting really good X food is within walking distance. X could be literally any cuisine.  (And they’re fucking GOOD. Not fucking Olive Garden versions of whatever…) 

Putting 4000 miles a year on your vehicle, but strictly in highway miles on vacay. It’s not 15K miles a year commuting through fucking assholes. EVERY. GODDAMNED. DAY. 

WALKING to the park with your dog, not driving there and then having to clean his muddy ass before he ruins your seats on the way back.

I mean, different strokes and all, but I just love being around things to do. That I can walk to, easily.

And the crowds aren’t bad at all, after you learn to avoid them.

I also lived in Salem, MA for a while. And I would put those October crowds up against Tokyo. Tokyo probably has quantity, but the QUALITY of the fucking dipshits in Salem takes the day. It’s absurd the number of fucking weirdos walking around gawking at dumb shit. I hated them.

BUT, I found the local spots. The local dives the assholes didn’t know about, the REAL good food, and the behind the way places you only found after living there for months. THOSE are the places that make it what it is. 

(Segue - one of my favorite things in Salem was called ‘poof day’. The day after, whatever weekend was closest to Halloween was called ‘poof day’. As in “poof. They’re gone.” And it was a big day of, kinda low-key specials at bars, maybe some house parties, just a day to get out, stretch your legs and celebrate that all the tourists were gone.

If you can afford five figures for a vacation, you’re doing pretty well. The poor cannot even save that much in a year with all their expenses.",B4K5c7N,t2_yz1u6q4,9,0,reddit4

I married into a pretty big family and I'm by far the largest breadwinner. The cheapest house we can afford within an hour's driving distance of my job that would give everyone their own 10x10 bedroom (not terribly unreasonable since everyone minus the toddler is or shortly will be an adult, with little ability to move out in this economic climate) is over $10k mortgage per month. It's doable, but that's over two thirds of my take home pay. A good chunk of the rest goes to daycare. I'm looking at the possibility of getting something cheaper and building an ADU, but that means probably another year of people getting crammed together while it gets built out.

I realize this is all ""rich people problems,"" but it's kind of shocking to be earning so much and things still aren't all that glamorous. Like, I drive a 15 year old Prius with body damage that would cost more to fix than the car is worth. It's just weird.",FableFinale,t2_5spv9fd3,7,0,reddit4

It says that they are being robbed of their future even if they are managing to get by in the present. They will be working well into retirement age and their children will not get many of the opportunities that they would if they had a well funded 529. 

I am not saying the people making $300k deserve sad violins for their discomfort; but rather it's a good juxtaposition for how much money it requires to have a plan to retire at a reasonable age and provide opportunities for children. 

I am also assuming no generational wealth. The family making $300k and ""just"" getting by are preparing their children for a different set of circumstances. They likely will not only have a large financial safety net in addition to opportunities like college, but they stand to inherit a reasonable sum of money that can be applied to their own savings strategy and afford them in turn to live extravagantly.

Expect to make a 20% down payment at minimum; many jumbo lenders require more. At the bottom end of jumbo loans, this would amount to a required down payment of $145,240, but rises with higher loan amounts. According to the CFPB, jumbo loans can go as high as $1 million to $2 million. In that case, a minimum down payment would end up in the range of $200,000 to $400,000.

In a HCOL situation I would guess they would hit $5 million around 55? Depending on tons of factors, $5-7 million starts to be the ""live off interest and retirement drawdown"" mark. 

So they retire at 55 and get to travel or have ""toys"" like a boat and genuinely enjoy life. They probably don't really have to worry about money, but they also won't be buying a yacht or multiple sports cars. Luxurious but not extravagant. 

Shouldn't that be an attainable goal for everyone? That's what I mean by a good juxtaposition. If you make $300k and save carefully and consistently you get to have a chunk of life to enjoy.

My best advice to anyone young is to find an accredited school and get through as cheaply as possible if you’re the type of person where your work speaks for itself.

I was a bottom halfer (tough school unless you were in a social group or fraternity with access to professor files and other cheat methods) and ended up with lots of debt out of school as I had a year abroad, and some failed classes. $160k student debt at 6-7% is not easy to live with paying each month no matter your college degree.

Fwiw, I am in the $200k ""saving"" category and I prioritize luxurious retirement so my perspective is similar to the articles mentioned I would guess. I do not have access to generational wealth. I am very privileged though to have had excellent opportunities.  I don't think of myself as ""getting by"" because I have lived paycheck to paycheck needing to choose what bill to pay in the past. But I also at the same time struggle to see how people afford new cars, boats, jet skis, giant houses, 2 kids, cabin at the lake and other items. I prioritize saving is the simple answer and after saving enough of the income to retire a little early there's not a ton leftover for large expense extras. I can buy an ice cream cone whenever I want, but I would struggle to buy a cabin on the lake.",spyderweb_balance,t2_bdtaxruw,3,0,reddit4

I’m not here complaining about my monthlies and feel extremely fortunate to make what my wife and I do.  Anyhoo, it matters that most of these high earners’ comp is bonuses and sometimes money in the ether (options).  Some examples:
* options - may be exercisable, often aren’t when the stock market is plunging like it has,
* stock rsu’s - get taxed on selling heavily, so you’ll have a several thousand dollar tax bill offset if you liquidate them in a given year
* bonuses - once a year, most folks use this to pay off their credit card debt or other debts, or fund a big family vaca/expense (Griswold family pool)
* the point - these come once or a few times a year, don’t get baked into monthly run rate budgeting and often are used for cleansing debt or a big purchase for most people.

With a family of four, a nice house in a popular metro area, these families aren’t capable of saving $200k in a few years like you allege (single earner no fam, sure they could), the point is that’s damn near impossible in a major metro area if you’ve bought a home semi-recently and have a large family to feed- It’s a lot harder than you think.

Between government regulations and a cultural shift towards entitlement or outsourcing to professionals, my kid basically cuts our grass and OCCASIONALLY gets to help at a barn for $10 a day.

Footnote: Let me explain the cultural shift comment...

He is either told two things, sometimes both.  

1) They won't hire him for some meanial odd job (cutting grass, cleaning house, etc.) because he should work for free.  It's considered ""exploitive"" to charge the old guy living in a 4 bedroom home with an acre size yard to charge him to cut the grass.  ""Kids should help old people, not charge them.""  One neighbor actually chastised him and went to the houses he had jobs and offered to do them for free rather than allow my son to ""take advantage"" of the old people.

2)  Others tell him he'll do a bad job and they would rather pay 5 times as much to hire a landscaper or a cleaner to come in.

The minimum wage will place firms further from the vulnerable poor students mentioned in this article, meaning that those among them that are indeed hirable at the minimum wage now have a longer commute and may require independent transportation. This is a vicious cycle.

The minimum wage freezes in place the most vulnerable people in any given society - the young, the poor, minorities, those with social functioning disorders, those with prior criminal history, and those with mental handicaps. They never have a chance to ""climb the ladder"" because the minimum wage cuts off the bottom rung.

These are people who are more likely to lack the ""human capital"", i.e., workplace skills and habits, that most people is a society acquire through the circumstances of their birth, childhood social interaction (""privilege""), and unofficial employment. A white kid in the suburbs who has zealous teachers, teamwork experience in class projects and sports teams, and mows lawns under the table, is much more likely to be hired at $10/hr than his urban black counterpart who has none of those things.

Once again America's utterly inadequate public transportation systems and haphazard urban planning come down on the poor.  The difference between the poor and the desperately poor are whether or not they can afford a car.  Some of the most clever mechanics I've seen are up in Maine, a poor state where the cold, moisture, salt and hills take their toll on cars but are absolutely needed for any sort of employment.

(If a parent contacts me it makes me less inclined to hire that person as they need to do the legwork themselves if they want a job.) We never even ask about transportation in the interview, we only make sure that they have transportation when making the job offer.

I think what's more likely is that a teen from a low-income family doesn't have much of an idea of how to apply for a job. I've gone through hundreds of resumes that are filled out incorrectly, have grammatical errors, and have entire sections left blank. There's also a question on our online system that asks something like, ""What relevant experience do you have that we haven't asked about"" and this is most commonly left blank by teens. Which doesn't help me as a hiring manager at all. If all I have is a name and whichever high school they attend, that's pretty useless to me. If someone is applying for a job with me and has no work experience, then that's the most important field for them.

Adults are much more likely to know how to fill out job applications, to be specific, to have resumes, and to give me more information. I make interviewing decisions based on what I'm looking for, not on how old the candidate is. 

So sure, while I'd like to be someone who can help a teen get his or her first job, I'm also required to hire the best candidate. It's the applicant's job to convince me that they are the best person for the job, and a big part of that process is the application.",SouthOfOz,t2_mpoan,1,0,reddit1

Anecdotal evidence here, but I (29yrs old) got a job at a supermarket near my school when I was 14. Worked after school and weekends at just over minimum wage, saved the vast majority of my money over the next 2.5 years so I could get my license and get a car, insured and all. Weekends I'd walk to the bus stop and take the bus prior to owning a car.

The difference may have been how I set my priorities at that age and had a long term plan. The long term planning played a huge role. Instead of buying a bike at 14/15 I waited and saved for my car, not spending money on things I didn't need just because I had money. My parents made the most out of the money they had, prioritizing essentials - we didn't ever really go out to eat or go on vacations, didn't get too many toys or other non essentials. I'm not a common case of a poor kid, my parents were just so disciplined and worked their butts off. They sacrificed so much for their kids and family.

So much of the poor v rich issue is to be able to plan and look towards the future. Kids growing up in poorer families have parents who either work paycheck to paycheck, or aren't able to save essentially making it difficult to learn how to plan for the long run.

Yes there is a price point but this goes well beyond just price and that also needs to be concitered.  For a company they are much more likely to only look at their short term bottom line than the issues caused later if many companies all do the same thing when it comes to kids and their bottom line.

This is when the dream of the invisible hand of the free market breaks down and the flaw in the idea is seen.

Some simple models *do* predict that. But it sounds like you're making an empirical claim, that it *does* happen -- repeatably. 

As far as I can tell from reading the academic literature, that is not what has happened in the past when the minimum wage goes up. Certainly the minimum wage has never been as high as $15 per hour, so it's harder to make predictions in that case.

They will continue to remove labor costs with automation.  Most all companies will do that.

And as they do that they will remove economic demand that they rely on to sell their goods and services.  More and more people will just have less and less money to spend.

I think you are assuming economic demand is a constant.  It's not.    It can go up or down.  With the above happening it's going down.

Generally for a person to be happy, they need to be better than other people. Not all other people, but just a subset of other people. So we generally structure our societies to have an underclass.

People want to feel secure that they will not be part of said underclass. So in the past we would either segregate people that are a little different and in a minority to fill that underclass. 

This resulted in the majority of the population to be happier (at the expense of the said minority), and a little more secure (as they knew that will not part of the token minority of their society)

Today in the modern world it is a little harder to contain the underclass to a particular minority. As we also want to be feel that we are good people and that we do not want to be racist and the such. 

This resulted in the underclass to be a bit more fluid, and anyone can be poor, so more people have anxiety and mental health issues as they now lack the certainty that they will not be part of said underclass.

But we still do not want to blame the state of the underclass on ourselves, as you know we are good, honest, generous people (most people do not want to think of themselves are evil or bad). So to solve said conflict, we just blame the poor on being poor. This way we do not really have to feel like assholes for locking them into the poverty cycle. And still get to feel a little more secure, because we assume that we are good and hardworking and we are nothing like those lazy idiots....

d4vsrjs,t1_d4vm5w1,2016-07-01 20:13:05,Economics,"My two cents (heavily on the left side, so choose your amount of salt now) :
For a true free market situation, you need not only a minimum wage, you need a guaranteed income of some sort. A ""right not to work"". Here is why:

You are already *forced* to work in order to have a dignified live. 

But nobody is forced to hire you,they can shop around for somebody cheaper, or replace you with a machine. Or just not fill your position. When looking for a job, you have none of these options.

The  fucked up thing is, the bigger the company already, the more they can play that game. If a vacancy can be left unfilled for weeks and months because you can move people around, pay for contractors etc, you have a much stronger negotiation budget. 

Meanwhile at some point *you need that fucking job to pay rent/medical bills/for food*. And also, small companies might go under because they can't find good replacements at some point.

The ""right to work"" argument (which I think is used as justification for union busting in the states?) is a thus a massive amount of doublespeak in my opinion.

If you can't live of 40 hours/week of your wage, then that wage is not enough. If your work does not create enough value, then its should be automated or prices need to rise in order to value that work. But if people are desperate enough to do whatever, for however long in order to give their kids a dignified life, then there is no incentive for these things. Imagine how much you would have to pay the guy cleaning up the shit some spoiled brat smeared on a wall if you could say ""you know what? I think I'll move back to $backwardass_place where living is cheap, spend my time watching coursera and creating $mydreamthing instead"" at every moment.

d4viq2g,t1_d4vffek,2016-07-01 16:37:37,Economics,"I think this notion is worth discussing more. 

Not so long ago, it appears to have been heavily favored by the economics profession: 

>The earned income tax credit has been part of political debates in the United States regarding whether raising the minimum wage or increasing EITC is a better idea. In a random survey of 1,000 members of the American Economic Association in 2000, more than three-quarters of economists would generally agree that the Earned Income Tax Credit program should be expanded.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit)

I'm uncertain of what the consensus is today, and admit that a lot has changed in the world since 2000. But we are still faced with the issue that while global trade has lowered prices and improved efficiency in many ways -- and on the whole, made us a more prosperous country than we would otherwise be -- there are also those who have lost a great deal in the process.

Warren Buffett presents what seems to me a fairly balanced view on this subject in his 2015 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, describing the enormous benefits society has garnered from improvements in productivity, while also acknowledging the struggle of those whose livelihoods have been upended: 

>The productivity gains that I’ve just spelled out – and countless others that have been achieved in America
– have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed – and will
continue to enjoy – major gains in the goods and services they receive.

>To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely
benefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay a
terrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.
We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public
shareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from good
decisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who
diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning
investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average – an index fund of sorts – soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the while
paying ever-increasing dividends.)

>A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to
produce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decent
employment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.
When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded,
putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they could
learn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood they
could not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, which
struggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spoke
Portuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.
The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.

>Americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever be
employed in farming.

>The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to
work but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformed
and expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) **The
price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the
unfortunate.**

Reasonable people can disagree with the above argument, and other proposals for dealing with the issue are out there.

We infer greater character even for those who inherited their money, or got it by luck.   A teenager with a $30K car usually didn't get it by hard work, but by their parents buying it for them.     And I know about signaling, hence 'fake it till you make it.'    Signaling works *because* of the just world hypothesis, because we automatically infer greater character, intelligence, talent etc in those who have wealth, regardless of the source.

- Positions are low-skill and easy to train, just need enthusiastic teens who want to work.

- Can hire 5 positions. Each gets 20-40 hours a week for 2-3 months.

- Gets 90-100 applications for those positions.

They all need to be weighed against the cost and benefit but the minimum wage also has a cost and benefit.  It's cost directly to the employer is higher wage costs.  For society without it's higher safety net costs.

Now one can try to argue that the higher cost of wages means higher sell prices but that ignored the profit like its not there.  A company should always be aiming to charge the highest prices the market will bear so if the minimum wage goes up it really cannot move up the sell prices that much.  More likely what will happen is the added cost will come from the profit. 

For a company they have a habit of thinking short term.  Think about it for a bit.  The ones paying minimum wage or near minimum wage are saying what to the people they are paying that wage to?

Is it I would pay you less if I could?  And in doing so what does that really say to the employee?  Now a company could and they do say work hard and get a better job but if it's for the same company why would they pay well if they don't have to?  That get back to the minimum wage where they are trying to pay as little as possible.  

That gets us into treating people like humans not widgets and in economics that's too easily forgotten. 

So from that standpoint there is again a cost and a benefit.  Pay badly and one will probably not get the best effort from those folks.  They are not stupid.  But the company gets a cheaper wage cost.

Add in many companies trying to do the same thing and what happens to the whole economy?  We more likely get lower economics demand since workers are pretty much the same group as customers.  Treat them badly with a bad wage and one will find bad customers with little money to buy things.

One of the problems with modern retail work is [the just-in-time model being applied to labor](http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/shift-change-just-time-scheduling-creates-chaos-workers-n95881).  Retailers and service-sector managers are increasingly moving to a model in which employees are perpetually ""on call"".  You're not just supposed to show up when your shift starts.  You're expected to show up whenever your employer calls you - often any time between 7am and 10pm.

So workers have irregular hours (and irregular pay) while employers can keep down costs by only bringing in extra labor when its maximally efficient.

This kind of labor min-maxing puts financial strain on the employees and forces otherwise capable workers out of the labor market simply because they can't keep up with the erratic schedule of the employers.",Zifnab25,t2_4gfpj,7,0,reddit1

Minimum wage does not impede social mobility. Cronyism, entrenched networks and a lot of other stuff does. If you can't live of it, then it is not a rung on the social ladder.

Look at unfettered capitalism before unions fought back: robber barons, monopolists, old moneyed gentry. Look at almost 300 years of basic stagnation between 1600 and 1800 when it comes to the standards of living of the lower classes.

Do you know what raised the standard of living? Technology creating massive change in society. Part of these changes were a larger distribution of wealth, because there were enough people that demanded it. We need that again.",0x652,t2_b2uyc,3,0,reddit1

A capitalist economy is based on the money being a motivation to do more work and to create new and better things.  It can also help to better distribute limited resources but for people it's normally more money better.  

So it becomes not what money can do but money itself as the aim for more and more people.  The folks that get the most money are the winners. 

> forced to pay people what they are not worth

Why would a company want to pay what someone is worth?  Why wouldn't they work very hard to pay people less than they are worth?  If they do that they could save money and that money could be turned into profits for the shareholders.

As again why should any company pay someone what they are worth?

It's this attitude that's bringing down America. 

 The fact that this guy is ""forced"" to be an asshole for most of his 74 years because he's facing competition from much larger companies that are given preferential treatment by government at all levels doesn't make it right.

You know, before I started travelling to Europe I felt all the protectionism for small mom-and-pop businesses was a terrible idea.  But realizing that individuals or families can safely run a business for generations this way - perhaps a somewhat marginal one, but it provides a _good living_ for the whole family.  I come back to a spot years later, and the same people are there, providing the same very competent service with somewhat newer products. 

It's one of those things that America has lost - the idea of a ""good living"".  Now there are a huge number of horrible jobs, and a tiny number of really decent ones (and I say this as someone who manages to get those tiny number of decent ones - but my friends...)  

Millions of Americans believe that it's perfectly acceptable for a full-time job to pay less than living wages.  They consider some jobs are just not worth paying for.

They should see a cashier in a Berlin supermarket - these are professionals and man, the velocity and accuracy is just amazing.

In principle, ""patently obvious"" would mean that there'd be a consensus when it comes to the published empirical research. Some studies finding one relationship, while other studies found a different one, and a third set finding a neutral effect would not be a thing. 

That's also not really what I found when I regressed the US statewide data while I was writing my thesis. Although, admittedly, I used data from 2001 to 2007, and I used ""employment"" instead of ""unemployment"", so that the whole thing could be linked to a supply & demand based argument.

This is called the ""marginal productivity of labor"" for that activity. For some jobs (e.g. ditch-digging by hand), that productivity is quite low, and lower than the minimum wage. Nobody (or very few people) is employed in the above-the-table economy in these jobs today because the productivity of that job is below the minimum wage (an example of a job with very low productivity in which a lot of people are employed below minimum wage in the black economy is e.g. fruit-picking).

>Multiple factors can affect the physical health and psychological well-being of workers. Research indicates that job strain and/or repetitive and hazardous work conditions may have detrimental effects on physical health. Stress experienced and perceived can affect a person’s psychological well-being. Work stress research has examined the psychological demands of a work load, workers’ perceived sense of control over their performance, safety stressors, work organization, and work atmosphere (Clarke, 2006; Aittomäki, Lahelma, & Roos, 2003; Gillen, Baltz, Gassel, Kirsch, & Vaccaro, 2002; Dembe, Erickson, Delbos, & Banks, 2005; MacDonald, Harenstam, Warren, & Punnett, 2008; Landsbergis, Cahill, & Schnall, 1999).

The concern that I was bringing up, specifically, is that employers have no incentive to compensate workers for these consequences. It's clear that workers in low-skill jobs do not have the leverage to negotiate for a better contract, because of the glut of competition for jobs as well as the lack of barriers keeping (anybody) out of the low-skill job market. Thus, I'd conjecture that the wage-premium for ""stress"" in low-wage jobs is nearly zero. However, the costs are certainly nonzero.

I think it is disingenuous at best to restrict your analysis of job-related stress to mere income level. A school bus driver and a city bus driver may have roughly similar paychecks, but the school bus driver likely has the much more stressful job. I'm ""blaming"" low paying jobs for deaths to the extent that jobs stress the body and do not pay enough to seek ""repairs"" (e.g. healthcare, recreation). ",earnestadmission,t2_b8np0,2,0,reddit1

This goes double for retail work, or (fast-)food service. When an employer hires you to complete a job, they are asking a fully grown human being to accomplish certain profitable tasks on the employer's behalf. The time spent working for the employer is time that can't be otherwise spent, especially given the economy's regimented schedule.

Yes - and minimum wages are essentially why this is happening (there are other factors, like domestic price levels, which are also affected by the minimum wage, and also workplace safety and environmental rules are part of this). In the absence of minimum wage and workplace safety rules, offshoring to cheaper markets wouldn't be a thing. If you want to stop offshoring, you have to do one of two things: 1) make American labor competitive, which means eliminating minimum wage or 2) get American consumers to be willing to pay much higher prices for goods and services.

for housing if you compare a 3 br house to the same number of bedrooms in NYC then you're looking at anywhere  from $500,000 to over $1 million to buy and close to $5000 a month to rent if not more. cheaper almost everywhere else

&#x200B;

for all the horror stories about the cost of cars, they aren't that much. family I have in Colorado pays like $90 a month full coverage for insurance for an older car and I pay around $150 or so a month full coverage near NYC for a luxury SUV. the NYPD doesn't enforce most traffic laws and there are a lot of accidents and property crime and it's in the higher insurance costs. 

&#x200B;

most of the everyday stuff is about the same but NYC everything is an extra cost. if you have a car and want dedicated parking then you have to pay $300 - $1000 a month for a garage spot,  many schools don't have sports so you have to pay for it for your kids. used to cost me $200 a month. fines for everything

some of the child care prices are ridiculous too. when both my kids went to camp it was something like $7000 for both of them for a summer day camp in NYC and half that price out west and it was cheaper with airfare so guess where I sent my kids. camp out west was daily trips and fresh air in a rural setting and day camp in NYC is in a rented storefront, once a week to a rented pool and maybe some trip.

jcg7wcl,t3_11sr13g,2023-03-16 16:37:55,Economics,"When we talk about what is or is not a middle class income in our economy we are no longer doing it right.

Prices are so different depending on where you are that simply looking at gross dollar income gives no idea what that will buy.  $100k does not buy a lot in California, but in Bethany Oklahoma you would live like a king as long as your idea of a king is your communities' top 5% or so.

I say what we really need to do is set a standard for what is and is not the traditional middle class activities and expectations and divine the income required to support that at a given start date, say, 1995.  What did it take to break into that middle class for an average household size.  Two parents and a couple/few kids for example.  Middle class people do not have to limit family size because of financial limitations.  If you have to hold yourself to one or two children you are not middle class.  And that is the way to approach it, for example if you cannot afford a foreign vacation every other year or so you are not middle class.

And I would say that middle class should be the the middle third of all incomes.  Low income and poverty being the bottom third, and affluent to wealthy the top third.  Middle is just the middle of all that.  As it is they usually use quintiles and a lot of the time you see the bottom two as poor to low income and the working class, then two quintiles for middle class, hence lower middle class and upper middle class, then there are the affluent and rich.

Then to define it further you have to differentiate between very expensive metros like SF Bay Area, LA, NYC, Miami, and Seattle, from the rest of the nation.  St. Paul is going to get to middle class at a lot lower income than Atherton.  Tampa would be about where Ukiah is for a middle class income.  By the way, Ukiah is up in Mendocino County a long way from a city.

As a single head of household in the greater Tampa region I would say that to be middle class as I understand it would take me at minimum $135k.  Part of the problem is middle class traditionally not only could afford ALL necessities but quite a few ""luxuries"" from the point of view of the working class, and they had enough to set aside for full college expenses for their kids, and they had enough to save a significant portion for retirements, and they had enough in the bank for emergencies.  They were fully insured too against disasters or medical need.  They has financial security as well as a decent if not luxuries life.

&#x200B;

a lot of these articles are often wildly skewed by what they're actually considering to be nyc.    


like... those articles that say the average rent is 3k    ...rarely ever consider anything above 96th street.    


NYC is more expensive.   but ... the relative expense in different areas isn't so wildly extreme.    


for instance.  my rent in upper harlem (the 140's)  for a decently sized one bedroom at the time i left the city  was $1600  (started at $1200... and crept up over a decade i lived there)     When i moved back to where my parents live in coastal VA.   I couldn't find any decent apartments.  for cheaper.  everything was $1500+   and  anything nice was more.   And while there may have been some very marginal gains in square footage.  a lot of apartments in that area were old.  shitty old like garabge construction lame as fuck boring apartment communities.  like... nothing more than motels as apartments.      and still.. comparably priced.  to find new construction,  or nicer areas to live in ... $1700  or $2k  plus wasn't outside the norm.      But... when i looked around at jobs in the area.  the rate of pay for a comparable job...was a lot lower in that area.  


So...in a way. the cost of living in that misc part of coastal virginia was higher than upper harlem manhattan nyc.    


now... if you live in a fucking nowhere part of the country.   maaaaybe those metrics change.   but holy fuck who wants to live there.    And what are you getting living in such a place.    


I wound up moving to silver spring maryland.  a commuter suburb of washington DC.   my apartment is aprox $2k.   and it's nice.  my current apartment if it were in nyc.  Would be $3k-$5k  easily.    but... i wouldn't even say it's bigger than my old harlem apartment.    


and now.. living in the burbs,  i'm paying for parking, and have a car payment.   So.. my income is spread over more requirements or strain on it.    


and i make just under six figures.   I don't feel like leaving nyc,  suddenly made my income go a whole lot futher.  if anything,  it's extremely tight/nuanced trade offs.   of slightly better amenities.  but more costs for necessities in transportation.    


and would say... i knew people in nyc who made huge salaries.   200k   500k and up.   some people spent their money on living downtown, or in hipster neighborhoods,  insanely high rent.   everything was an order service, paid for extremely overpriced gyms or fitness fads. blew a ton of money on luxury clothes/fashion.    went out to over priced bars or scenester events.     ---but i also knew people who worked in tech,  for the same high salaries.  who living in deeper brooklyn   or way uptown.   saved a fuck ton of money.   and didn't live extravagantly.    hell... my neighbor in harlem worked for uber,  made 300k a year.  paid slightly less than me in rent.   We would hang out   ..do nerd shit like board game nights.   and yeah.   his TV was huge,  and he bought like.. brand new gamer PC stuff a lot.   but...

jcgnq24,t1_jcfpqsu,2023-03-16 18:16:45,Economics,"Preferences are also super important and hard to measure.  In broad analyses can mostly be hand-waved away because people tend to self select into areas that suit their preferences.  In more individualistic calculations (such as deciding whether YOU should relocate between cities), it becomes very important.

Space in NYC is very expensive.  If you want to have a whole room in your house dedicated to a hobby, that's $$$ in manhattan but might be nearly ""free"" in exurban Omaha (because the homes there all already have more space than you need).  

Ditto for cars.  Car ownership is hugely expensive in Manhattan.  There are still car enthusiasts who live there, but owning/storing/maintaining a vehicle requires significantly more money than somewhere where cars are cheap to own and every home on the market in the neighborhood is legally required to have at least a 2 car garage.

On the other hand, many things are the same price (or cheaper).  If you are super in to camera gear, NYC is a great place.  MSRP on a Canon lens is uniform across the USA, but NYC actually has a very high concentration of camera retailers that often compete for lower prices (and a healthy used market).  Lot of random food items actually end up cheaper in NYC, fashion items are more accessible and cheaper.  Thanks to public transit you can eliminate all car expenses.  If you highly value a lot of cultural/entertainment things, they effectively become cheaper in NYC (e.g. you don't have to travel to see a Broadway show or go to one of many top museums because they are already there).

If somebody who loves the NYC lifestyle ended up living in far-suburban Omaha, they might spend a ton of money trying to be happy.  Frequent trips to other places to visit museums, eat top-notch food, see shows.  Having to special order things they can't easily get locally, etc.  On the other hand, somebody in Omaha who loves to fish, hunt, work on their sports car, and who has a spouse that loves quilting and has a dedicated sewing room...they are going to spend a ton of money trying to be happy in NYC (even in the outer boroughs).  $$$ for space for hobbies and car, frequent fishing/hunting trips that require flights or overnight stays, etc.  If you care about things like big houses and each kid getting their own bedroom, you probably aren't ever going to choose to move to NYC unless you make $$$.

Obviously NYC-Omaha Suburbs is an extreme example, but this is true anywhere.  The ""normal basket of goods"" for people varies by area.  It might be pretty normal for someone who lives in Salt Lake City to budget $1000 for a ski-area season pass.  If that person moves to Tampa, it could go either way--do they really love skiing and still buy an Epic pass AND now they have to pay for  flights and hotels to make ski trips...or do they switch to beach/water activities and save money?

The reality is, with 180k in a cheap city, tou can get a mansion, and in nyc / general areas, you can get that too with 500k but honestly less than 450 or 400, especially with a kid or few, and no you can’t get that crazy mansion assuming you’re a responsible spender.

There’s also a lot of handwringing about “what if we break up and s/he takes my *stuff*” from people who ain’t got no stuff.

what would happen if 50% of nyc plumbers moved out overnight? suddenly the remaining 50% would be able to command higher prices/wages. if there was a shortage due to high COL, wages would go up. it's the supply and demand principle.

video game software developers is a great example of this. software developers usually make \*really\* good money. but not if they work with video games, usually. why? because way too many people want to work with video games, it's their 'dream job', so companies can get away with paying much lower than an equivalent 'boring' software job. because they know if one person says 'no' to that wage, there will be a huge line of other similarly qualified candidates who is eager to take the job at the same low wage.

everybody wants to live in nyc. that's why everything costs a lot there in the first place. people could move to cheaper cities but they don't, because nyc is worth it to them. and well, that is the trade-off you end up making. you're basically voting with your wallet, by saying living in nyc is worth the drawbacks.

1. Never have a car payment. Pay outright and buy a car on Craigslist. You can find plenty that go from A to B for under $1k. You're bleeding on interest for such a small purchase. 
  
2. Get a new job. I don't care what your skills are or not are. I don't care your qualifications. You can easily find a job paying more than 22k a year. Even if it's a job like being a handy man or something. My SIDE gig as a handyman on the weekends makes more than you do. You could probably make more mowing lawns. 
  
3. Rent from a local small landlord. They usually have houses split into apartments. They are cheap, you'll get a yard, the landlord is relaxed and rules are too, and try to get one with a garage you can use to make money. 
  
4. Find passive income. This is income you don't have to do anything to make. Like owning a rental property. A guy I know made some tailgating grill trailers and he rents them out and makes a decent amount doing it. Another idea I've seen is renting dumpsters.

In the end we have finite things and production capacity. Even though nominal wages have stated high the larger overall earnings as the worker pool grows diluted the value of each dollar. Essentially number of houses stays relatively constant to number of people, but household income grows. Since the consumer has more money, they’re likely to part with much more of it on absolute terms as it is still a similar fraction of their income and net worth.

So actually due to the growing work force housing affordability has become a thing that is difficult to achieve for individuals. The plus side is now women are on more equal footing.

jcfbrv5,t1_jcf8qrt,2023-03-16 12:58:19,Economics,"Sure. I currently live in NYC and grew up in Ohio. 

First, let's start with something obvious: we don't (have to) pay for cars, insurance or gas. That, on average, is a huge expense that can now go towards housing. All of a sudden, that large rent gap shrinks considerably. But, yes, roommates are likely a thing way beyond other markets. That's also notable. The 1br average is $4100 here, that's their data point. Most people share a $5500 bedroom at $2750 

The utilities are a wash. 

Restaurants: That gap has also shrank. I moved here in 2011 and the spread was drastic, now it's fairly competitive. Now I'm talking run of the mill places. You want to go to Masa and spend $800 a person, go for it. But kitschy bistro to kitschy bistro, there might be a 10-20% bump ($2-4 per plate), but nothing eye poppingly substantial. Cocktails in NYC are roughly $13-$14. They were $12 in Greensboro, NC as of 3 weeks ago. Fast food is different, however. Our value menus are utter shit. But hot dogs and dollar slices is cheaper than anything you're finding at a medium CoL market. 

Groceries: This really varies. Wegmans is finally in NYC and can go toe to toe with other CoL markets on prices. Whole Foods gonna Whole Foods anywhere. The little boutique grocers, bodegas and places like Gristedes WILL charge you out the ass. But there are cost effective alternatives, so it depends on where you are pulling your data from. I would say, overall, that the cost gap is shrinking as more value options are starting to break into the city. Target is expanding here like wild.

Data sets: This is where this conversation lives and dies. Small or medium CoL places have exponentially less data points to compile. The aggregate of the most expensive restaurant on earth and an aggressive catering towards the luxury demographic will skew those numbers way up. People making $100,000 aren't routinely going to and/or eating the things that are bringing the CoL up. 

In conclusion: I can say definitively that $100k is way more than $36k elsewhere. It's just a different lifestyle. But that's high density living for you.",brownsfan007,t2_koa2j1z,7,0,reddit2

Waiting for the train is ""miserable"", but sitting in Manhattan traffic isn't? You think dealing with owning a car in Manhattan isn't miserable?

Besides, if you really want to get around fast, hop on a bike. You don't even need to own one for the occasional trip, they have stations with e-bikes all over.

Highly paid CEOs aren't the norm; most companies don't really find much value in their CEO beyond him being the highest leadership and a link between the owners and the rest of the company. In certain highly specialized sectors, the CEO may not even be the highest paid employee. Let that sink in...

However, in large companies with high % of public ownership, shareholders often give zero fuck about the long term health of the company and grant generous stock - based bonuses to upper management, the CEO in particular.

Jack Dorsey - CEO of Twitter and Square.  Twitter salary - $0. Square salary - $2.75 (that's correct, two dollars and 75 cents).  Any of his other compensation wouldn't be considered by this ""Study""

Mark Zuckerberg - $1 annual salary.

Labor is only one of many pieces that go into a company and producing a product and service. Knowing what capital and technology to combine with that labor is just as important as the labor itself. 

Take Amazon. Warehouse workers and laborers moving boxes was always something that existed. If the ""wealth"" of Amazon shareholders is gained solely by extracting profit from the labor of the workers, then why did the Sears catalog disappear? They did the same thing with their labor, moving boxes and shipping them to peoples houses.

It's knowing what technology and capital to combine with labor that brings a good chunk of the value of a company, and that is not easy nor is it risk free.

But yeah.  The core tenants of any economy once you transition from a immediate return system, to a currency based one and have an abstract means to store and transfer value, that the natural consequence is that a person that generates more goods (or what have you) naturally acquires more of that value proxy. 

The angst in our current system is complex, but one that is easy to pick out is the modern Wall-Street Fortune 500 CEO (Or some).  What value are they generating?  Taking profits and spending it on stock repurchase and dividends instead of R&D or organic growth.  Sacrificing the goods and services of a whole group of people to acquire for themselves, and investors massive amounts the value transfer mechanism (dollars) while generating no value themselves.  If anything, the opposite?

It is a valid criticism.  Not all CEO’s operate like this. I’d argue most don’t, or the system would collapse (maybe that is what we are seeing with Wall-Street bailouts?) Or, being handsomely rewarded for poor performance (see ex Boeing CEO).  

I agree that the system is broken in that way.  The person that cuts all the fig trees down to reap the rewards, and transfers none of it to the people picking the figs, takes the profits and runs is not how a healthy economy operates. 

But, not rewarding the person who picks twice the average figs or optimizes harvest to maximize yields making everyone more productive shouldn’t have their value generation equalized and transferred to those that can not, or will not.

The counterargument is that the investors sacrificed some of their consumption to provide tools which enhance the productivity of the workers. It is only right that they should be compensated for this contribution. In particular, I think both workers and investors should be compensated according to how much they contributed.

So then, how do we determine how much the workers contributed and how much investors contributed? Well, suppose a burger flipping venture consists of many workers flipping burgers using frying pans provided by investors. The contribution of each individual worker is the difference between the number of burgers the venture would have flipped with him and without him, and the total contribution workers is the sum of each worker's individual contribution. Likewise, the contribution of each individual frying pan is the difference between the number of burgers flipped with the frying pan and without the frying pan, and the total contribution of each investor is the sum of each frying pan's individual contribution.

>Except this is not the case due to depreciation. Because tools eventually wear out, output will decrease until neither the worker or investor are making any money. To prevent this from happening, investors take part of the proceeds from their investment and re-invest it into new and better tools. So just like workers, investors are also continually making contributions to the venture.

I do take some issue with this though. Investment and management are two very different things. Stock in a company doesn't have to be bought to purchase new fry pans; once it's sold, unless bought back by the company, it's ownership changes don't provide funds to the company. Instead, the maintenance and replacement of means of production are supplied by the sale of the product it created. In this case the maintenance isn't profit and many tax laws represent the expense as such. 

So yes, if the original owner and investor of the company provided the upfront funds and continues to manage the company, they should be compensated for their investment contribution and their management contribution. But unless the owner is continuously investing their own funds over and over, the investment portion is over in my mind. Unless you'd consider the deferment of compensation to instead reinvest in the company... but that's a bit trickier to quantify. 

I think the solution is employee ownership of the company. I still need to read up on the implementation of employee ownership in real world business and potential theoretical implementations. That said, perhaps when value provided is quantified, beyond just a wage being provided, a unit of ownership could be generated for the company. This would mean as the initial investment fades into the past and becomes less of the overall continued success of the company, so would it's influence and yields. That's just an off the cuff idea though.

This is the issue about ""Private Property"" that Pinkos argue about so much.

They argue it's immoral for someone to own peoples ability to feed themselves, as it gives them undue power over others. Yes labor is required to eat still, but someone doesn't get to eat your sandwich because their grandpa bought up all the ways to make food.

>Literally nothing is stopping you from becoming your own employer.

Cool, can I get one small loan for a million dollars please? A shit ton prevents people from being their own employer. Not to mention, what would a world of only business owners look like? In reality, the barriers to becoming self employed are huge (unless MLMs are to be believed). For example, I work in Information Technology. I believe that Internet Service Providers are ripping their customers off and not giving them good service. Guess what, if I wanted to start my own ISP to compete, the likes of Comcast will crush my business. Google, a huge organization with effectively unlimited resources compared to me, tried to start Google fiber for the same reasons I listed. Comcast and other ISPs shut them down, bogging them down in court and having laws put into place which give them an effective monopoly. 

And that's me, an educated professional with a middle class background. Imagine the obstacles faced by people less fortunate than me. Should they just be relegated to being a lower class than me? I am pretty confident with my financial capabilities since that always interested me; the idea of the accounting required to run a business terrifies me, not to mention choosing health insurance plans for employees, and all the other clerical stuff I don't even know about. There are people out there who still cash their checks at liqueur stores because no one in their community has enough institutional knowledge to know to start a bank account. Fuck them right, start a business.

>Working hard isn't enough to warrant getting paid, you have to work hard and create a product other people want to buy. Just because they worked hard doesn't mean that their product is desired by the market.

Ah commodification; where instead of setting out to create something useful, you set out to make a profit. There are many issues with this to be argued as well. Take a look at the logical conclusion of that process: [GarfieldEats](https://garfieldeats.com/), which is pizza shaped like the cartoon cat Garfield's head... Because there are only so many good ideas out there and some people are getting desperate. Maybe people are getting depressed because of all the consumerism around them, because all the intelligent people in our society are either a) Trying to find a new piece of shit to sell to people or b) Trying to figure out how to get people to buy all the dumb shit being made. More stuff doesn't really benefit me. I enjoy my computer with it's associated games, being able to take a shit in indoor plumbing, and enjoy a beautiful day with my family. I don't need someone trying to convince me I want a garfield shaped pizza. 

Also that doesn't begin to mention the sheer amount of luck involved in that. Does everyone need to play the capitalist lottery to get their fair share? Or can we just live our lives and do the work required to do so. Also, if you're interested, look up the theory of Bullshit Jobs. It's really interesting how so much of us work so hard to provide nothing of value.

>This is something you work out with your employer, especially in smaller companies. Some people like getting paid in equity, some a paycheck. There is risk to both. If I have a startup and it's just me and Jimbob and I say to Jimbob ""Hey Jimbob, would you like to be paid in cash or equity?"" And Jimbob says ""Cash only, I don't want equity"".... What is going to happen if the company (that I own and Jimbob works for) becomes worth billions? Jimbob doesn't get shit. He decided not to take equity. Now of course if Jimbob and I were friends it'd kind of be an ass move to not pay him more, but there's nothing entitling him to that money.

Jimbob's decision to take cash only assumes the risk of making more or less money is the only factor. Let's look a JamesRobert for a second. He just graduated and got married with his first kid on the way. He has quite a bit of student loans, because unskilled labor doesn't pay enough to maintain a quality standard of living. You could argue he could work in a trade, but economics shows that if everyone did that, welding would be a worthless skill. So he has student loans and a responsibility to his family. He finally gets a job offer, which can be a daunting task with no work experience, so he accepts immediately lest he not be able to pay his bills. His employer now states, ""JamesRobert, as you know we're a startup and as such need to minimize expenditures until we can be profitable. As you may also know, 90% of start ups fail. Would you be willing to cut your salary in half for an equity stake in our company?"" To which JamesRobert can look at his budget and quickly state, ""No, I wouldn't be able to pay rent, feed my family, or put gas in my car with that salary."" The company goes on to make billions in no small part due to his help in the early days and JamesRobert isn't entitled to anything because of factors outside his control. Or it fails miserably and he's back on the job hunt. 

>Give me your plan to prevent billionaires/millionaires and we can talk about this more

I'm not looking to stop people from being billionaires; it's not like I want there to be a law in place that says ""Once you make $999,999,999.99, no more money"", even though a slightly lighter version of that was in the US, with the highest tax bracket taking 90%+ of all income earned over $200,000 between 1943 and 1964 (Notably awful years for the US economy right?), compared to our current steep 37% tax rate on the highest bracket. [Source](https://www.tax-brackets.org/federaltaxtable/1944). Now I am not sure what I would ask for, like I said I am not educated enough to be comfortable making that decision. That said, what I do want to say is there are plenty of arguments against our current system which I strongly agree with.

Also looking back, you essentially said I was wrong before I even presented a plan. Those are some strongly ingrained biases, perhaps consider working on thinking outside your current bubble to ensure you actually are supporting the best possible system, especially before trying to espouse those ideas to others. Just because it's the way it's always been (in your lifetime) doesn't mean it's the best way. In fact, I feel like if I did state an idea, you'd just push all the same arguments you've been conditioned to without even thinking about what I said. Maybe I am wrong; but I have been online long enough to know many people will latch on to one little thing and say the same thing over and over, walking away like they've ""won"".

>There are numerous laws in place that would prevent a situation like this (anti trust / bribery / etc) so it's hard to take that example at face value.

I don't use Reddit all that often and was using it as a means to procrastinate in my class last week. Deadlines caught up and needless to say I've had a busy week.

>My whole thing against the ""means of production"" and all the derivative discussions from it are that it's... kind of difficult to argue against. What would the equivalent in modern day society be? Let's pretend that I'm your employer. I don't think I own your way of feeding yourself. 

So I've actually been thinking about this a lot as well. Like I said, these farther left ideas are just something I am still exploring and looking for viewpoints and ideas on. From what I've read the kind of society where the ability to provide for basic needs is protected, without destroying capitalism altogether, is socialism. In this case the industries which are required for basic needs are commonly owned. No one person should be provided undue power over whether people can eat, be clothed, sheltered, etc. Other businesses, such as entertainment companies which create the video games we all love can operate the same way they do today. My main argument, from what I remember, was that external circumstances can prevent people from participating in capitalism at the same level. You can't take an equity stake over salary if you're responsible for aging parents and the reduction in salary would be unacceptable. If instead the basic medical care, shelter, and other needs of the parents were guaranteed, we could expect our hypothetical game developer to be able to make a rational decision. There is also Universal Basic Income, which could be calibrated to ensure fear of homelessness or starvation wasn't a factor and is more popular with those that believe capitalism makes industries more efficient (amongst many other factors and ideas). 

>I'm not in kahoots with other business owners to pay you as little as possible. I'm TRYING to pay you as little as possible, because that's in my best interest. Why wouldn't I? The thing is, you have a collective ability along with society to also demand better wages.

One thing I don't want to convey is that business owners, investors, and other parties which benefit from capitalism are evil or bad. Like you say, you're acting in your own best interest, as is the employee. The issue which makes the system itself unethical is that if basic needs must be met via a wage, then employers have more leverage than employees. This is an unbalanced power dynamic which leads to one party benefiting over the other. I'll accept a lower wage if the alternative is to starve. I'll stay in a subpar work environment if I am afraid of unemployment. This is only because the logical conclusion to me not getting a job is death. If that imbalance were removed, if the basic needs are met for everyone, then a more fair negotiation can take place. (I'll disclose that my dad is a small business owner. I don't have a bias against the owner class, I am a direct beneficiary of it. I also know my dad is a good moral person and my best friend. I'm just saying that the system of capitalism we operate under creates an inherent unethical situation, regardless of the intentions of anyone operating under it)

>There are 30 million small businesses in the United States. Logic follows that there would be roughly 30 million small business owners (or at the very least within the same order of magnitude). That's... not a small amount, at all.

I'll agree that the number of small business owners is likely within the same order of magnitude as 30 million. I do have an uncle who's a serial entrepreneur and currently owns around four successful small businesses last I checked, but I am sure he's an exception. I do take some issue with the classification of a small business, since it's not a very nuanced definition. It just essentially is an upper limit to the amount of employees a company has, varying by industry.

Even if we did assume though that every one of those 30 million small businesses were founded, owned, and operated by average Americans just working their way up, that's not a large number. That's less than 10% of the U.S. population as of 2019. Which then goes back to why do we support a system which provides 10% of the population undue power over the remaining 90%? One thing to consider is perhaps we could get that number higher; maybe more people would be willing to take the risk and start a business if they had a safety net to rely on. I know one guy I used to work with, super smart and motivated guy could have demanded double his salary or started his own business. But he didn't because he has a wife a four kids and was petrified of not being able to provide for them. We're missing out on his potential contribution because of that fear.

##Oh man this is getting long again...   

>And here is why people say that capital owners take on risk. There is reward for taking a stake in a companys success. Yes, sometimes people are in dire straits and need cash rather than equity.. but how can we complain about not having access to the 'means of production' if we don't want to assume the risk? Owning capital is not free money because it has risk.

So the argument I was making here is essentially the risk isn't the same for everyone. The exact same situation for another employee, let's call him Steve, who's parents paid their way through college and has their parents provided a safety net if anything goes wrong is much different. Steve isn't taking nearly the same risk, but has access to the same reward. In this case, the person from a poor background is denied access to the 'means of production', unless they're willing to risk the well being of their child. How can we not complain about the unequal system, where there are those who through no effort of their own have easier access to the 'means of production'? Again, I'm in Steve's shoes here, I could run off to silicon valley and live in a van until the startup I worked for had an IPO; but that's an extremely privileged position for me.

>Long story short, no one was paying that 90% tax rate. Why would they? If I were a CEO and the law was that anything over say $1MM was taxed at 90%... I would ask for any compensation over $1MM to be in the form of company stock or other equity.

>Why should we tax him to the point that he would have to sell his own shares in the company he himself founded just to pay taxes? What if the government did that to you or I? What if you bought a house that just happened to be in an up and coming area and the taxes eventually got so high that you had to end up selling it? To hell with that, no one should deal with that. Billionaire or not.

Honestly I am still researching this bit. I am against the idea of assets outside of cash being taxed prior to being converted to cash as well. I currently own a small amount of some cryptocurrencies from long before they caught onto the mainstream. During the 2017 period of crypto prices skyrocketing, I directly exchanged some crypto for another. I was charged tax on the profit of the transaction at the end of the year (with the rules being written after my transaction) despite me not receiving a liquid asset out of the exchange. Taxation like that is counterproductive since if I didn't have enough money already, I would have had to sell my investment. That said, if I ever exchanged my crypto for cash, I'd expect to be taxed on my profits; so should Bezos. 

If we had a tax bracket that took 100% of someones money after they earned $1MM in a year, Bezos should be able to decide to receive stock rather than cash. He shouldn't be taxed on it either, until he sells it. This is all under the assumption you can't walk up to a real estate agent and give them some stocks in exchange for a house though. If he wants retire and live off his stocks, selling only $1MM per year as well, that's his prerogative. But you do see how this would limit wealth growth right? Doesn't matter if he has $100 Trillion in stocks if he can only use a million a year. Should that be the solution? Probably not. As I said before I am still researching this end of things; honestly though if it's gotten to this point I think we've already messed up along the way.

>But the general idea is that our tax laws are actually working pretty close as intended. Yes there is evasion that should be fixed, yes there is bribery and sometimes it's ineffectual to stop it, but capital gains are taxed at a lower rate (only when sold!) and that is the system working as intended. So if I see someone flourishing I don't think ""Jee they should pay more in taxes"". I obviously don't think things are perfect the way they are, but I think they're much better than the internet would have you believe.

>After all, this is the best time in all of history to be alive! There are plenty of issues here and there, but I feel this whole idea of billionaires and inequality is a bit over discussed by Reddit and the media. The economy and wealth in general is not a zero-sum game. Someone else can be rich without someone else being poor and suffering for it, I do believe.

This might just be difference in opinion, but I wouldn't describe the richest people in this country right now as flourishing. I'd describe someone who worked through an engineering degree, worked their way up in the industry, and is now maintaining an upper middle class lifestyle as flourishing. The ultrarich seem to be of a fox in the hen house and maybe we should fix the holes in our perimeter instead of ogling how fat they are getting. The economy isn't a zero-sum game, that's been true since the industrial revolution, but that doesn't necessarily mean the rich aren't benefiting to the detriment of the poor.

More than you think.

Retail shareholders make up a relatively small percentage of the investing community and even among those shareholders, the percentage of those people who are relatively sophisticated (bankers, lawyers, small business owners, doctors, etc.) is relatively high.

The lion's share of money invested in public companies is managed money.  While the ultimate beneficiaries might be middle class union pensioners or workers with 401ks, the money is invested by sophisticated money managers.

The problem isn't lack of sophistication or board members who don't have the interest of shareholders in mind - it's that CEO pay is a market like any other market and these salaries are what companies need to pay to keep CEOs.

To wit, when you remove the agency problem entirely, CEO pay doesn't dramatically decrease.  Private equity/similar companies don't have an agency problem, since the private equity shareholder runs the company directly (there's still a board, but it's usually just employees of the fund) and they don't have an incentive to overpay CEOs (every dollar paid to the CEO takes away from the fund's return, which is how the private equity sponsor is paid).

Given inflation and population growth it’s practically unavoidable that the gap between the average “person in poverty” and average “rich person.” The reason those things have increasing costs is a good deal in relation to inflation and the belief citizens pay more when they see their money supply grow. Except that applies if you remind your boss that a year has passed and you need a 5% wage hike in compensation along with the inflation. Probably why someone who started their median income wage earning career in the 1980s would now with inflation would have trouble making ends meet if they never asked for a wage hike.

I know the appeal of socialism. I really do as it’s simply financially-assisted altruism. But the matter is when you take progressively more wealth from those that have to give to those that don’t for the sake of “equality of outcome” you’re creating several issues on their own. 

How do you determine who deserves a share? Not everyone at the poverty line is going to become a net taxpayer from being given financial support. How would you determine that?

Second how do you justify the taxing of anyone above the line to give to those that didn’t work to earn it? It’s simply forced charity, never mind the language. Shouldn’t people have a choice whether their income goes towards another family? Or should everyone simply accept the fact that what is it three-fifths of their income goes towards social programs.

The third issue is assuming you give wealth freely, how do you insure the users don’t simply remain dependent on the system. It’ll return the link later, but the Black population in America has seen an increase in poverty even with the the Great Society programs all the way to the social programs since then. Could it be that some people seeing an incentive to not work had become locked in the cycle of poverty?

The fourth is the increasing debt that comes along as those that have leave your nation to save on your taxes (because they will go elsewhere where the tax rates are more favorable) and leave the average person to pay. Wasn’t the income tax introduced sometime after Social Security? It didn’t exist before and only added on to the already greater dependency of Americans on the government.

Another point is noting the increasing debts of those European nations that have social democracies as you like them, and how slowly their debts have grown. Where do you think those debts originated from? How do you expect England or France or Germany to pay the costs of the very social programs on their governments? I’m probably wording this terribly but social democracies only function well on a growing economy that can handle the brunt of a loss of wealth. The same can’t say on a staggering on decreasing economy. In those scenarios it hurts their economies.

Yes there will be rich and poor. Yes outcomes wont always be equal. But we were actually talking about equality of /opportunity/ not outcomes. And the degree of inequality between rich and poor matters. The richest 1% went from 33% of total wealth to 41% of total wealth since 1960. The poorway 90% went from 32% to 21%. Those shifts are huge and meaningful in every day lives.

Progressive taxation isn't hard and has been shown to INCREASE GDP growth vs regressive or flat taxation. This is largely due to well studied concepts like marginal utility and diminishing returns.

Rich countries are rich largely because their workers are highly productive. Productive workers require high investment in education, training, health, and physical capital. These investments have the added advantage of being largely non transferable, ensuring actual investment rather than just wealth extraction.

Your ideas of black families in the US are just wrong, poverty has decreased by over 30% since the 60's (when they were given full rights). The issues facing minorities in the US are multifaceted and complicated, if I were you I'd just keep it out your mouth since you're not going to even look up the single statistic you bring up.

There are plenty of programs which have been shown cost effective. Free community college, expanded Medicaid, single payer healthcare. We already pay for the services you claim can't possibly be afforded, but we lose out because We both pay more for less (ex. Highest healthcare spending but low outcomes) and because we don't distribute the services efficiently (ex.

I think you are the type to act differently with your own money than with someone else's. You feel that other companies should spend money a certain way. But I believe that if you were to start your own company, spending your own money, with the intend to not get wiped out, you would find yourself doing what you despise.

\> but managers ought not to take excessive pay if the point is to grow a company 

That's not really up to you. That's up to the boss (shareholders). If the shareholders want to pay more, that's entirely up to them. The type of argument you're making is the ""celebrities shouldn't buy $50,000 handbags"". But you're not likely to argue that the middle class person should opt for the $25000 car over the $28000 car. 

\>  If a manager pays himself $50m  

The idea of specialization is that you should let someone else do the job that you're not fit to do. Generally, this means that shareholders let the managers run things. The purpose of shares and corporate structures is to allow people to invest money into businesses, without needing to have the knowledge or experience to run the business. When a company runs well, shareholders allow management to keep doing what they're doing. When a company runs poorly or loses money, shareholders fire management. Your thought that ""managers pay themselves X"" is not the entire picture and is at best, a temporary situation until shareholders intervene.

\> Workers are paid very little relative to the amount that stockholders gain. 

Again, you're selecting. We can talk about Groupon and and talk about how workers get paid astronomically compared to how much investors lose. You need to look at all gains and losses as a whole. As a whole, the entire market averages about 8 to 12&#37; in returns per year. To produce that average, some companies will have large gains and some will have large losses for investors.

\> What if I were to tell you that not everything is fundamentally based on individual choices? 

When you cherry pick your examples, you will always find contradictions. What's more important is that the system as a whole work well. Someone growing up in poverty in America has about a 50&#37; chance of getting out of poverty. Compare to a country full of corruption like India. A person born into poverty has a 99&#37; chance to remain in poverty. Given the real, not theoretical alternative systems in the world, I'd say the US is a pretty good place to be poor in. 

I've gone through my entire life watching people waste opportunities. I've watched my peers watch cartoons over doing homework. Skipping extra credit work. Spending money on things they don't need. Spending time on things they don't need. Engaging in vanity when they are broke. Opting for instant gratification over long term benefits. Drinking the night before exam day. Partying the week before exam day. Picking a fun job over a better paying job. Choosing not to look for a new job. Spending feeble savings on vacations, then complaining about housing being too expensive. Just about everything is a choice. 

  
\> you ignore the many others who were in the exact same position, yet failed sometimes not due to individual choices, but socioeconomic and environmental effects  

Luck is maybe 1&#37; of the outcome of someone's life (on average). Yes, I understand that if you're an orphan getting bounced around abusive foster homes, then luck has determined 99&#37; of your life.

2) Because taking a firm public generally leads to an increase in valuation of the firm (see the works of Fama and Jensen for empirical support of this).

3) Because if your firm is publicly traded, stock options as a form of compensation that are reliable as a form of valuation.  In privately held firms, stock options represent a subjective, insiderview of the value of the firm,whereas the market is the independent evaluator that decides whether a publicly traded firm is viable.  Knowing the role of institutional investors and larger investor firms and funds helps provide an understanding of just how vital outside valuation of the firm is.

In other words, if you want your company to grow, and you want it to prosper, at some point an IPO will be considered.  You will then also have to have the knowledge required to actually execute the IPO.  If you have holdout partners, you'll have to know your options.

The paper has now been peer-reviewed and published in *Econometrica* - [here](http://klenow.com/HHJK.pdf) is an open-access link to the published version. There may be minor differences between the earlier version and the published version, but the methodology is the same. The text of my explanation is copied below.

_____________

That's the conclusion of [a working paper by Chang-Tai Hsieh, Erik Hurst, Charles Jones and Pete Klenow](http://klenow.com/HHJK.pdf), which was drawn to my attention by [Atif Mian posting it on Twitter yesterday](https://twitter.com/AtifRMian/status/1063428273215021056). (EDIT: the figure refers to all per capita growth, not total growth). The basic reason is simple: discrimination in 1960 meant that lots of women and black people did not pursue careers even when they would have had a great natural talent for those careers, and instead worked in jobs that they were less suited for. This mismatch between their talent and the jobs that they worked in meant they were less economically productive than they would have otherwise been and the economy suffered as a result. As discrimination has reduced over the subsequent 50 years, talented women and black people could go into careers that made better use of their talents, and the economy grew as a result. 

This isn't too surprising - what's perhaps more surprising is the size of the effect. A quarter of all growth from 1960 to 2010 is a very substantial effect. In this post, I'll try to explain how the authors' model works and, roughly speaking, how they came to that number.

The model in the paper focuses on three main types of discrimination. The first is wage discrimination between black and white people and/or between men and women. In the model, employers prefer to hire white men relative to women or black people, and so they will only be willing to hire the latter groups if they can pay them lower wages in a given occupation. This acts like a tax on the wage that women/black people can receive. The second is educational discrimination, which is modelled as women and black people having to pay a higher cost for a given level of education - this is ""a shorthand for complex forces such as discrimination against blacks or women in admission to universities, or differential allocation of resources to public schools attended by black vs. white children, or differential parental investments made toward building up math and science skills in boys relative to girls"". The third is preferences or social norms that make women or black people less willing to choose certain occupations, even if they have a talent for them. 

Based on this framework, the authors then use data on wages and occupations for black and white men and women from 1960 to 2010 to estimate the size of each of these three discriminatory forces, and how that changed over time. The main assumption they make is that the innate talent of women and black people for each occupation, *relative* to white men's talent in that occupation, has not changed over time. So there may be some occupations that men are naturally better at than women, for instance, but their assumption is that the *natural* ability of women to do that job has not *increased* relative to men's ability to do it since 1960. If that assumption is true, then all the changes we see in the occupations chosen by white and black men and women between 1960 and 2010 must be due to changes in these three discriminatory forces. Then it's reasonably straightforward to use the changes in the distribution of occupations over time to estimate how much the combination of these three discriminatory forces has changed.

To answer the question of how much this affects economic growth, they set up a model of the whole economy. There are lots of workers of different genders and races; each individual worker chooses the level of education and the occupation that will be best for them (maximise their expected lifetime utility), based on their own talents, the wages in each occupation, the education required for each occupation, and the level of discrimination that they might or might not face when working in an occupation or choosing their education. Employers choose the amount of people to hire in each occupation so as to maximise profits, but they may be willing to pay some cost to hire fewer women or black people (even if those people are well suited to the job) because they may be racist or sexist. The optimal decisions of the firms and workers produce labour demand and supply curves for each occupation, and the wage in each occupation is set by the equilibrium of labour supply and demand. The equilibrium number of people working in each occupation and their talent for that occupation then determines the economy's total output. Discrimination lowers total output because it prevents some people who have a talent for that occupation from working in that occupation, and pushes them to work in other ones where they are less productive. 

They then take this model and choose values of the variables in the model that best fit the data, including the discrimination parameters. They're able to match the observed data on earnings and employment quite well, as shown in [this table](https://i.imgur.com/LKQMXRO.png). But because they now have a structural model of the whole economy that takes discrimination into account, they can simulate what would have happened to US GDP if discrimination against women and black people had stayed at the level that it had in the 1960s, rather than falling over time. They do this by choosing all the other parameters describing the economy to match the data, but holding the discrimination parameters fixed at the level they were at in 1960. The result from this simulation is that 27% of growth in GDP per person between 1960 and 2010 is accounted for by changes in discrimination. The figure for *market* GDP per person is even higher at 38%, but this is an overestimate because market GDP excludes the value of unpaid work done at home by women, which was probably higher in 1960 than in 2010 since more women now participate in paid work.  Splitting up the three types of discrimination described, they find that the most important one was educational discrimination, by some distance - labour market discrimination had an effect, but a smaller one, and there's not much evidence that changes in social norms/preferences had an important effect.

How does this break down between groups? The simulations imply that reduced discrimination slightly lowered the earnings of white men - they grew about 10% less since 1960 than they would have done if discrimination had been maintained. The mechanism is that in 1960, white men who did not have much talent for high-skilled occupations were still working in them because discrimination prevented any competition from women and black people, but by 2010 reduced discrimination has meant these kinds of men have to work in lower-skilled jobs. But this is more than offset by big gains in earnings for black men and women, and for white women - 28%, 56% and 85% respectively of the earnings growth for these groups from 1960-2010 is explained by reduced discrimination. 

The authors provide several robustness checks, showing that different assumptions about talent and the discrimination faced by men and women are either implausible or do not affect their conclusions too much. The specific numbers that they come up with depend on some of the assumptions about the model structure, the way the economy works and how discrimination matters. But the basic conclusion is clear: reducing discrimination was a very important contributor to American growth between 1960 and 2010, and continuing to reduce discrimination could produce more economic growth in the future. This is true not just of discrimination on the grounds of race or gender, but also economic barriers that people from poor families and regions face regardless of their race.",usrname42,t2_6jd5g,83,0,reddit1

f248d18,t1_f23lbpn,2019-10-01 16:19:04,Economics,"First, thanks for this summary!

Second, I'll read this full paper later, but reading your summary and the intro summary to the paper, it seems like they are handwaving the role of 'capital' as an asset class over the entire period.  I think that this is a massive oversight that you can't just throw in a control variable for.  

Put differently, I could completely buy this argument if we are talking about an economy where 'labor product' has a direct and measurable impact on final GDP.  Imagine a shoemaker that crafts shoes individually and their final sales price is a direct function of the talent of the craftsman (or craftswoman).  In this scenario it is obvious that excluding black/female craftsmen would have a negative impact on GDP.  

But this not the world we live in.  The world we live in, and this has been true the entirety of the Post WW2 era in the US, has been marked by the disintermediation and commoditization of labor starting with physical labor and moving currently into white collar labor.  To the shoe example: today, shoes are made by the thousand, identically and in massive volume, by capital-intensive machinery *and it doesn't matter who is manning the machine* - man, woman, black, white, Hispanic, Asian - the machine will still make X shoes per day, and the GDP contribution is identical. The 'capital' separates the 'labor' from GDP contribution (disintermediation), and the expansion of the labor pool represents an inter-labor value transfer, not incremental value add.  Notably, this is exactly what the study found.  

I can think of a few edge cases where this isn't true.  For example, professional sports are *massively* more economically productive (when you define productive as encouraging productive resource use and/or spurring monetary velocity) as a result of desegregation.  And I think you could make a really strong argument for 'Person X' being able to sell into 'Community X' as opposed to an outsider (eg increasing resource use and velocity within under utilized communities).  However, on the whole, the post WW2 era has been marked by the ascendancy of 'capital' and the decline of 'labor'.  The thing is that you can't just 'control' for something that is a seismic shift in your dependent variables - the rise of 'capital' and its relation to GDP is the definition of universal multicolenarity.  

I mean this is the root of Piketty's whole argument (if you agree with him), and is a sub-element of the ages old 'Seat versus Ass' argument.  'Seat v Ass' is the colloquial slang for the 'professionalization' of labor - the 'seat' is the position (eg, the guy running the machine) and the 'ass' is the individual.  The professionalization argument is the net impact of managers creating 'seats' such that it doesn't matter who occupies the seat - the ass doesn't matter.  Think about a McDonalds - all the processes, rules, roles, tech, assets, etc ensure that each restaurant can tolerate 75% turnover; the 'seats' are generating value and the 'asses' don't matter; the ass just needs to perform rote/repetitive/routine tasks.  If 'asses' are not relevant, the gender/race of that ass doesn't matter either.  And the thing is that you see the 'S v A' debate all the way up in high-level investment banking; one of the biggest insults you can say to a banker is 'that guy is a business card and nothing else,' meaning any idiot with the same business card could close the deal.

TLDR: the authors of this study seem to be over emphasizing the value of Ass, but there's a lot more compelling argument that Seat has been the driving factor of GDP growth. Slightly less snarky: I think the authors might be measuring the ascendancy of 'capital' and professionalization, *which so happened* to occur along side labor desegregation.",Laminar_flo,t2_7gmyn,13,0,reddit1

This was the point of me bringing up investment bankers - you're seeing the ascendancy of seat at the highest (and ostensibly most skilled) levels.  I don't like Piketty, but this is his argument: there really aren't that many jobs anymore where 'labor' is capable of capturing excess value.  He's dead wrong on his conclusions, but his framework has some validity.  

And I could come up with a ton of other examples; I was just talking w people at work last week about how coding/programming is such a commodity skill these days.  Sales is process/data driven.  All of finance is data/process driven (this is largely regulatory, but the end result is the same).  Consulting is data/process driven (Bain/McKinsey/BCG all have their 'system' and the team just slightly moves the parts).  I work in extreme high-end finance; when I'm hiring juniors, I'm looking to plug a specific 'hole' in my team - I want the 'seat' filled.  

These are all highly skilled jobs; however, the 'seat' is still ascendant.  Its a joke in the finance/consulting world about how many high-flying bankers/consultants leave their firms to go out on their own - only to fail miserably b/c they don't have the institutional support they took for granted - eg, the seat was the driving factor.  And for every Frank Quattrone, who succeeded on his own, there are 1,000 bankers/consultants that crawl back to an institutional firm after crashing and burning.

Where? The model is basically all human factors.  Where specifically are the authors examining the relative capital intensity of the workforce over this period?  

>Who cares about ass vs seat?

Well, to the extent that capital is either replacing people or making them more productive, this is the *only* thing to care about. 

>They aren’t putting any value on ass

You're kinda contradicting yourself here, no?  Their entire thesis is that all the ~33% of GDP gains are due to the 'new' asses in the seats.

And I work with hyper-complex models for a living, and a *HUGE* thing they didn't do is any sort of robustness test; and note that statistical robustness is vastly different from predictive robustness.  I didn't want to get into it earlier, but no robustness testing is disqualifying to me.  Something like this would have been to take the model and try it in another economy (Brazil/Mexico, for example, to test race or Japan/China to test gender).  Or to 'mid test' it by running it from, say, 1960 to 1980 and then running it blind from 1981 to 2010 to see if the predicted results match actuals.  Or splitcrossing it by running the model blind across different wage sectors to see if the model is predictive.

Let's take a look at what you actually said.

\> The strength of an economy is a better covariates than ""discrimination.""

Given that the strength of the economy is the outcome under study, that statement is nonsense. 

Are you saying ""the strength of the economy is more predictive of the strength of the economy than discrimination?"" Because that's totally vacuous. Or are you drawing a line between the abstract concept of economic ""strength"" and the measurable ""GDP""? Because then you run into the same quantification problem you pointed out,

Your statements are non arguments because they're incoherent. You're just spewing technical terminology you don't understand, and while I'm sure you have a loose argument in your head, nobody can understand you because you're using words totally incorrectly.

My best approximation for what you're trying to say is that ""other variables are better predictors, and discrimination has a comparatively minor effect."" The problem is that the set of variables you indicated are either backwards in causality or stationary over time. Keep in mind, the subject isn't building the best predictive model, it's understanding historical causal pathways. With that in mind, your argument that other variables are more strongly coupled to GDP has nothing to do with the article and does not contradict the comment you responded to. 

You know you were talking nonsense, the incoherency of your statements is right in front of you, recorded and unambiguous.

In other words: because Just In Time supply chains were artificially bottlenecked during the pandemic closures, they cannot ramp up production past 100% without large investments, which they won't do because long-term there will not be sustained demand at a level that will make the investment worthwhile.

To tie this back to my main point: it will take in many cases months if not years for the supply chains to normalize. As long as this continues there will be increased inflationary pressure. 

It's worth noting, as many other commenters have indicated, that this isn't just ""every sector produces widgets and there are bottlenecks in all sectors."" There are certain industries that are seeing increased aggregate demand, and others are seeing supply constraints.

(Don't get me wrong, great to hear wealthy people can continue to capitalize on their fixed interest rate debt) Young people are priced out of the housing market, the value of their wages are going down while products are getting more expensive.

I guess they can be thankful they can use their pennies to continue paying their consumer debt (cars, credit cards) while simultaneously screwing over future generations who are going to pay for it anyways when the government inevitability raises rates, depleting stock market returns and making rates even higher on the already expensive housing market.

I think that point of view is dangerous because it places the onus of inflation on the laborer/consumer when it should be placed on the corporation. When inflation goes up, corporations will always argue that the costs should be shifted to consumer (whether in price or quality of the product) but when profits go up, those bonuses only go to the shareholders. This is why worker productivity hasn't kept up with real wages since 1979.

One thing to keep in mind is that, outside of sales jobs, jobs with high bonus share tend to be high pay jobs.

Big bonuses are common in finance, consulting, some forms of law, etc.  Tech tends to be a little different since they rely on equity compensation--but that ends up being very similar: Your RSUs or stock options could end up worth more than your salary...or the company could perform poorly and they end up worth almost nothing.

If you are talking about a $60k job, then yeah...doesn't make sense to have a 40k base salary with 20k in bonus that you might not get.

But if you are talking about much higher incomes, you tend to get a lot of variable compensation.  What if your total compensation could be $250k, but your base salary was only 165k?  Does that become worth it, even if a lot of that bonus is driven by firm performance factors that you have no control over?  

And its highly unlikely the bonus would ever be zero (since people would quit)--so really its more like you are taking a job where the expected total comp is 190k in a bad year and 250k in the good year.

You don't even understand what you are arguing. 

If I own an asset, the value changes relative to the market, that is true. 

If I bought an asset with leverage, I do not actually own what I am paying on until the leverage is cleared, and the leveraged amount does not decrease with the value of the item. It is a fixed amount based off the terms of the loan.

When deflation occurs, while the value of the asset depreciates, the loan amount does not, putting you underwater on the asset that the loan was for. So, if you no longer can clear the loan entirely by selling the asset, you are worse off than the person that owns the asset outright.

If college only appeals to men because they think the increased earning potential will help them find women, those men could just not go to college, that's fine. We could use more tradesmen. We don't need to pressure them into anything economically suboptimal with the threat of loneliness.

In a world where men make more than women and have higher education on average, it makes sense for women to want a man with their education or more.

If men made more than women, on average, then the guy in the same place in line opposite a woman would likely make more than them.

Even if they made the same money, the guy would be further down the line of  ‘all guys’ and she would be dating ‘down’. This is admittedly an oversimplification.

This kind of thinking hinges on the presumption that domestic violence is a one way street where ""lower class"" men are primarily to blame. I would reason a 50/50 is more apropriate across classes and genders. For example:

If we take a look at statistical studies done in white middle class groups we find that up to 45% of women have suffered domestic abuse in their marriage, sexual abuse is at 50% and psychological abuse runs up to 90%.

Paints a pretty horrific picture about white middle class men except these statistics are about white middle class lesbian marriages. Proving that abuse is not a gender or class specific problem. It is an asshole problem.

>domestic violence increase in household when the woman start to earn more. 

Shouldn't we study what role this power dynamic shift plays in the way women behave and how they treat their now ""lower class"" husbands? Because if your mindset is any indication for what that behaviour entails then I'd  say you, and your fictional white collar women, would firmly fall in that quoted 90%.

We truly need more unbiassed insight in the role women have in domestic abuse cases because your insights claiming to advocate a nuanced discussion is positively laced with assumptions based on classism and sexism.

i2p76h0,t1_i2p3xst,2022-03-30 10:54:12,Economics,"I see the point you are making here. Women starting to earn more is beneficial as they will not be coerced to stay in abusive marriages in order to protect their financial security. I recognise there's all sorts of reasons why women might unfortunately stay in abusive relationships, this is one area we are making progress in.

As for the part of males with lower relative incomes choosing to not marry 'up' and women with higher relative incomes marrying 'down', I think pride is the common factor. Men being too prideful to accept women who 'usurp' their traditional role as the successful one and women being too prideful to accept someone below them in the economic hierarchy. This is what makes it a really hard issue to tackle because it's based in pride, a more emotive issue than a logical one. I think you could make the case that patriarchal norms are what make men prideful in this case, having sexist views of women. In the with the women here I think their pride might come from plain classism. But yeah, the overall issue seems really complicated.

In all honesty I haven't heard of higher earning women being abused more than lower earning women before. I'd need to do my own reading and research on that.

But yeah, I wholeheartedly agree with you that having nuanced discussion on this topic would be really helpful and that gender-based blaming discourse is getting in the way of us achieving equality.

Women are becoming mothers later in life - a phenomenon tied to increases in educational attainment, growing labour force participation and delays in marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The average age of mothers at first birth is 27, up from 23 in 2010, recent CDC data has found.
This changing picture of motherhood has been driven in part by declines in pregnancy among teenagers. The birth rates among teenagers aged 15-19 had the steepest decline of all age groups: down by 8% in 2020 to around 15 births per 1,000 females.

From your link.
Not directly related to the dating market. If we make campaigns to reduce teen pregnancy, and demand always increasing productivity by forcing every couple to have dual incomes, paired with higher cost of living. Then there is no surprice couples don’t want kids or delay having them. 

The correct way to influence the falling birthrates is to give couples the economic incentives to have kids. More maternity leave. Direct government payments for parents, affordable childcare. You know the things that actually make it easy to have kids.",,,5,0,reddit3

The problem is that in general women don't want a man who makes approximately the same as them. They want a man who makes significantly more and the women earn so much these days that the demand is higher than the supply. Looking at actual married couples, you can see the distribution in income between wives and husbands in [figure 1 here.](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2019/06/10/why-are-women-who-earn-slightly-more-than-their-husbands-hard-to-find/) In one study, mentioned in [this article](https://ifstudies.org/blog/whither-hypergamy) married men earned 58% more than unmarried men, showing a clear preference for higher-earning men; and not just slightly higher earning.

So in nearly every city, women earn 80-120% of men yet they show a preference for a husband earning 58% more than them.

You can also see the preference in divorce statistics. Women who out earn their husbands are 33-50% more likely to get divorced. It causes strain on the marriage in many ways. [33% in this article.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/can-american-men-ever-be-happy-if-their-wives-earn-more-than-they-do-2019-04-29) [50% in this article.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/603298/women-who-make-more-than-their-husbands-should-watch-out%3famp)

Women appear to be retaining a cultural/natural preference for a higher earning man even as they move upmarket. But due to the bell curve distribution of incomes, the number of men shrinks rapidly, creating a very difficult dating market.

Assuming you have reliable blue collar jobs, this is less of an issue. If your jobs are based off of coal or something outsourceable, maybe it's more of an issue.

This is true, though ER wait times are likely less due to the lower population and density.

Did you read what i said? How are women being hypergamous if they are choosing men that earn less than them? In our society wealth = social status too! 

So HOW do both arguments being presented here make sense when they are countering each other? 

Are women earning more and being more educated AND having men with lower education achievements and less wealth as people to choose from? 

OR do they have a dating pool of highly educated, and wealthy men to choose from?

Also WHICH women? I’m a Black woman and can tell you the data says MOST black women that marry, marry down - men will less wealth and lower status. Add to that how many black men are incarcerated, how many have records, and how many actually even want to date/marry Black women considering the fact that Black women are less likely than any other group of women to date outside of our race.

I am not saying otherwise.  But my point is that for the vast majority of these men they be done working by their 50's.

I haven't finished it yet, but here is the abstract:

>Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.",,,13,0,reddit4

**Theoretical Overview**

Does a free market prevent wage gaps from forming, due to competition?

Let's assume perfectly competitive labor markets which have the following important properties.

- Free Entry/Exit – No barriers to entry/exit (including entry/exit costs)

- Homogeneous work environments (so firms only compete on wages offered)

- Perfect information- All parties have the same information

- A large amount of buyers and sellers- no one can have a monopoly or significant market share

Under these conditions, 'taste based' discrimination cannot cause a wage gap. If marginalized workers work for discriminatory firms, nondiscriminatory firms will hire them away. This will put pressure to equalize wages between these groups, potentially running discriminatory firms out of business, though not necessarily. If discriminatory firms can hire enough of their preferred workers without causing a wage gap, they will stay in business. This is the argument that free markets prevent discrimination, first formulated by Becker (1957)

- What happens if we relax these perfectly competitive assumptions? For instance:

- What if there are not enough nondiscriminatory firms to employ marginalized groups?

- What if search costs are higher for marginalized groups?

- There are significant barriers to entry or exit?

Then wage gaps due to taste-based discrimination are fully possible. For example, if we allow for job search then marginalized groups will face harsher job search costs and their employers will know they have lesser outside options. This giving firms financial incentives to create a wage gap, even if they have no taste for discrimination.
The important takeaway is that cannot assume economic outcomes from a deductive approach alone - the assumptions we make could change our results. Instead, we need to look at empirical data. We also need to be clear about what assumptions we are making, because they matter quite a bit. By tweaking a single assumption (for instance, the cost of job search), we go from a model where discriminators suffer competitive disadvantages, to one where firms face financial incentives to discriminate. The need to look at data bring us to the most common way to do that, looking at the ""raw"" gender wage gap or the ""controlled"" gender wage gap, which is the next section.

**Bad Controls**

(or ""Being Paid 77 cents on the Dollar and Controlling for Education: The Omitted Variable's Edition"")
Many of the gender wage gap arguments on reddit boil down to one side asserting that the 77 cents to the dollar wage gap is pure discrimination and the other asserting that other things like education, hours worked, etc. have to be controlled for as they cause earnings to be higher. They are arguing that the 77 cents on a dollar claim isn’t looking at all relevant variables, and that the gender wage gap mostly disappears when you control for these relevant variables.
Both of these two views paint too simplistic a picture. It's true that the raw gap is roughly 77 cents to the dollar. It's also true that the gap shrinks significantly when controlling for hours worked, education, etc. What we don't know is which way the causation goes. Do women earn less because they choose lower earning majors and shorter work hours, or does the existence of discrimination cause women to alter their choices of majors and alter their working hours? Education, working hours and other 'controls' are not necessarily appropriate controls, as they could also be dependent variables which are outcomes of discrimination. For further discussion of this point, see the /r/economics Bureau Member Chat.

In addition, as [**Goldin (2014)**](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf) notes the gender wage gap has shrunk across time.

> The mantra of the women’s movement in the 1970s was “59 cents on the dollar” and a more recent crusade for pay equality has adopted “77 cents on the dollar.”

Then notes some potential reasons why.

> As women have increased their productivity enhancing characteristics and as they “look” more like men, the human capital part of the wage difference has been squeezed out.


Something caused women to change their human capital decisions (educational attainment, etc.) shrinking the gender wage gap. These factors motivating these human capital decisions could very much matter too! For instance, increased work ethic would affect on the job performance and increase educational attainment. However, this type of omitted variable problem is very difficult to control for.

Once you realize that you do not have every variable controlled for, your analysis does not have a causal interpretation. It is possible that leaving out a control variable puts you closer to the unknown “true” effect. On the other hand, it is possible that the control variable is really an outcome of discrimination, or that leaving out an important variable puts you further away from the “true” effect. Both of these arguments suffer serious methodological problems.
There are two basic strategies to deal with this. One method is to find a way to run experiments. An advantage of this approach is that there is no doubt you have gotten cause and effect right. A downside of this approach is you do not know how sensitive your findings are or if they scale to outside situations - is your experimental set up valid in the wider market? You also might not know exactly how or why your cause and effect happens. These make it hard to know what policy to use. This is discussed in the Audit Studies section below.

Another option is to build a model and see how well the model explains the data. This is very handy because it lets you easily know what to do from a policy perspective. You can easily see where factors are important and where they are not. The downside is that you could have assumed the wrong model. These models are testable because they ASSUME what variables are relevant and what ones aren't, so they limit the amount of variables you need to look at. However, there is a risk of incorrect modeling or omitting relevant variables. An example of this approach is Claudia Goldin’s work, which is discussed below.

edit: Since even this sub is misognyst, read the damn article people!!

- When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. But a gender pay gap soon appears, and it grows significantly over the next two decades.

- So what changes? The answer can be found by looking at when the pay gap widens most sharply. It’s the late 20s to mid-30s, according to two new studies — in other words, when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do.

So the article clearly states that women make pretty close to men until women start having children. Trying to argue that it's because women just don't like to work the same hours as men is lie -- that pay gap is far smaller in women without children.

dmossbr,t1_dmosnlp,2017-09-07 15:51:56,Economics,"**Audit Studies**

Given these flaws in just looking at wages directly and what limited information these provide, what can we know about the gender wage gap and other gaps? The answer is we need to use a different research methodology. First among these are audit studies.

An audit study is using secret shoppers to see if there is a difference between how the genders are treated. First otherwise identical resumes are used, with only the names varying, to allow gender to vary. An example could be one employer is randomly sent a resume with John Smith, while another is randomly sent a resume with Jane Smith. As employers are selected at random, their unique features are controlled for, provided the sample size is large enough. What these studies allow us to see are the average discrimination that an individual faces. These do not answer if a specific firm is a discriminator or not, but that in aggregate an identical woman gets more or less calls than an identical man. Sometimes these audit studies also hire actors to pretend to be the individuals on the resume. This allows us more information on if a woman is less likely to get hired, even after receiving a call back. Unfortunately, these studies are not perfect. The actors are not double blind (they know it’s a study) and may act different either consciously or unconsciously. Fortunately, the sending of resumes is not biased by this (as it predates the involvement of actors). This allows us to see if there is any discrimination on the average firm towards a particular gender. This is very important, as it allows us to know if there is discrimination in a given labor market or not.

However, even here faces drawbacks. Although this tell us the average discrimination a gender faces, it does not tell us the marginal discrimination a gender faces. This is because it does not take into account an agent’s ability to dodge discrimination. An agent is not going to take their average offer, but their best offer. For this reason, these studies identify if a group faces discrimination or not, but not how much the discrimination lowers their wages.

Finally, a drawback is that these can only really study small labor markets. For example, this can study all of the tech postings on a job's website. Or all the job postings in a newspaper for a given time period. It is impossible to do an audit study on all available jobs. So these studies also can identify discrimination only within a narrow specific labor market, and even then, only really for call backs.

In sum, these studies are useful to change discourse from “is there discrimination or not” to “how much does discrimination matter.” They cannot identify how much discrimination changes labor market behavior on their own or identify the scope of discrimination on their own. They cannot even identify why discrimination happens. Is it because employers genuinely do not like women? Is it because women have less outside options? Is it for some other reason? These questions left unanswered make it difficult to write policy to solve this problem. Here is an example of an audit study, in practice.

**Claudia Goldin’s Work**

Claudia Goldin is a professor at Harvard and a leading researcher on the GWG. Her work ([**Goldin 2014**](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf)) while important, is often misrepresented. For this reason is deserves it own section.

Claudia Goldin wanted to explore how due to gender roles, women value work flexibility more than men, affects the gender wage gap. So she constructs a model where some industries need people to work long continuous hours. An example is a MBA working as a consultant needs to work long hours on a project, as they can not have someone else take over. It’s just not feasible to get the other person up to speed, compared to paying more to one MBA and having them work really long hours. This causes wages to increase as hours increase, in industries like this. This means, someone with an MBA who works 30 hours a week might make $40 dollars an hour, but an MBA who works 70 hours a week might make $70. So they make more per hour in addition to working more hours. However, not all industries have increasing returns in hours. Some, like pharmacy, have constant returns in hours.
She looks at a few professions, with specific subsamples. Specifically she looks at J.D.s from University of Michigan, MBAs from University of Chicago and National Pharmacist Workforce Survey. This allowed her more precise information then what is usually available from the census survey. She empirically looks at the explanatory power of the model outlined above.
She finds that initially the earnings differences are small, but increase between the genders over time. She also finds that hours worked is correlated with family needs. For example, 15 years out of the program, MBA grads begin to have a large gender wage gap. This is correlated with women in the program having children, particularly if they also have a high income spouse. JD’s also have similar patterns. In short, it looks like women who have less labor supply see reduced earnings, especially when accounting for the various reductions in labor supply. This leads to large gender wage gaps in these industries, due to the increasing returns for hours worked.
Of particular interest is the occupation of pharmacy. This is because as she notes

> Most pharmacists today work for non-independent retailers, mainly large chains, or in hospitals—about 75 percent do. But four decades ago around 25 percent were employed in these sectors. Self-ownership and employment by independent pharmacies declined greatly in the interim.

Pharmacy today, and pharmacy in the past are the same with how working less hours would affect your earnings. Now, with standardization of making drugs and electronic records, it is much easier for one pharmacist to finish up a job started by another pharmacist. As such, we would expect the gender wage gap to shrink in this industry and it has. This also allows female pharmacists to take time off without having to exit the labor force. This results in a very small gender wage gap, after controlling for hours.
In sum, Goldin’s work suggests another policy avenue to reduce the gender wage gap, to have more professions allow for workplace flexibility.
It is important to note that although this work is excellent, it can be taken out of context. First of all Goldin assumed a specific model of the labor market, namely one where women suffer gender wage gaps due to different valuations of leisure. That’s perfectly fine, because it helps her think about this specific mechanism that generates the generate wage gap. However, it could be that this model is misspecified in some way. She could have assumed the wrong model. The people citing her aren't aware of the assumptions she's making in her model (which brings us back to section 1)

Also, her data is not experimental like the data generated by audit studies, so we do not know if we are making correlation = causation type mistake here. So, despite what is often said, she did not out and out disprove discrimination. That said, it is really good work, and the fact it can explain so much of the data suggests there is certainly something to this idea about hours worked.

The wage gap is what it is because women are more likely to work 35-40 hours a week and men are more likely to work 50-60 hours a week.  My girlfriend works 40 hours a week, I work 60, and wouldn't you know it I make about 50% more than her.  This isn't because of systematic discrimination, it is because of different choices.

Plus women take jobs with more flexibility in scheduling, that aren't expecting you to be on call 24/7, and that allow them to be home with the children.

It's simply an equation of the overall number of hours one chooses to spend working, or doing things that aren't work, like building a family.

I don't think this is true.  I think the core story is that women shoulder more of the burden of raising kids than men.  There is little question that raising a child is hard work, and it would be a surprising result if women were able to maintain an equal presence in the wage labor market while disproportionately providing primary care for children.",SmokingPuffin,t2_8f0cw,85,0,reddit4

This implies that working 50-60 hours a week or being on call is something that society wants from its employees. I'm sure that this is what employers want. We already have laws that incentivize an 8-hour work day (overtime).

We could mandate that companies provide paid parental leave and have a government campaign to encourage both parents to take it. 

This could encourage a higher birth rate (maybe leading to increased economic growth) and possibly better outcomes for young children?

Really though, the point I wanted to make is that there is more than one way to narrow this gap. Women don't necessarily need to work more, we could also encourage men to work less.

Literally nobody is saying that there should be a law requiring women to work more or select certain jobs. 

>The wage gap is what it is because women are more likely to work 35-40 hours a week and men are more likely to work 50-60 hours a week. 

Did you read the article?  The problem is the societal pressure of being pressured to raising children. 

>It is logical for couples to decide that the person who earns less, usually a woman, does more of the household chores and child care, Ms. Kerr said. But it’s also a reason women earn less in the first place. “That reinforces the pay gap in the labor market, and we’re trapped in this self-reinforcing cycle,” she said.

Another quote from the article 

>Some women work less once they have children, but many don’t, and employers pay them less, too, seemingly because they assume they will be less committed, research shows.

And another

>When their pay is calculated on an hourly basis, they are still paid less than men for the hours they work, Ms. Goldin has shown in previous work. Employers, especially for jobs that require a college degree, pay people disproportionately more for working long hours and disproportionately less for working flexibly.

I mean...did you read the article?

Also, u/daimposter was certainly not arguing for requiring woman to work more hours, but likely something like this

>To achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.

Which would be easy to discern if you weren't being deliberately obtuse and had actually read the article.

Make daycare more affordable (subsidize)? That's a start. This isn't rocket science so its weird I'm being downvoted and the first response is ""What law is going to make women work more hours than necessary?"". At least one answer is very obvious but I understand that reddit will just not admit that men having the political power means many of women's issues aren't properly address and help to create conditions that lead to the current wage gap.

>The wage gap is what it is because women are more likely to work 35-40 hours a week and men are more likely to work 50-60 hours a week. My girlfriend works 40 hours a week, I work 60, and wouldn't you know it I make about 50% more than her. This isn't because of systematic discrimination, it is because of different choices.

And this is total bull. Did you even read the article? 

- When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. But a gender pay gap soon appears, and it grows significantly over the next two decades.

- So what changes? The answer can be found by looking at when the pay gap widens most sharply. It’s the late 20s to mid-30s, according to two new studies — in other words, when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do.

So the article clearly states that women make pretty close to men until women start having children. 

Next time, before you downvote someone and suggest that they are wrong, read the article.

>does the existence of discrimination cause women to alter their choices

Women could be discriminated early on in life preventing them from succeeding in manual labor for many reasons.  Women may be pressured not to gain strengths or pursue physically demanding jobs. Even without the pressure the [NIOSHA](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-131/pdfs/2007-131.pdf) manual list 51 lbs as max anyone should be expected to routinely lift without assistance. [Not an impractical amount for every women to lift.](http://livehealthy.chron.com/much-can-average-female-bench-press-6110.html)

Men are physically stronger then women, but the difference is not applicable to jobs in a developed society. A worker can only build a well to a certain quality. If there is a worker that is twice as strong, the well isn't twice as good or finished twice as fast. Strengths has a high diminishing return on the value it provides to jobs today. At a certain point they just build a machine.  Like in digging ditches, mining, demolition, war, construction and fabrication, careers that 100 years ago valued and required great strength have completely been reinvented. 

Being stronger 100 years ago made a big difference. Could it be the gender discrimination, that benefited past societies, created systemic differences hurting Female pay today? I dont know.

Nobody who makes real money gets paid overtime.  The gender gap happens at the salaried employee level.

That high skilled workers tend to work more hours shouldn't surprise anyone.  Both the high skill employee and their employer have incentives to push to higher utilization levels than the low skill worker.  Typically, the way you manage this within a family is by having a high wage earner work many hours and a low wage earner that works fewer hours and takes care of more of the nonwage labor that needs doing in a family.

> We could mandate that companies provide paid parental leave and have a government campaign to encourage both parents to take it.

Under such a system, it will still be economically efficient for one parent to shoulder most of the childcare burden so that the other can be maximally efficient in the labor market.  Splitting the burden evenly reduces the overall economic value of the household.

What you probably want here is to make stay at home dads equally socially accepted as stay at home moms.  Obviously having mostly men in the high earner role and mostly women in the caregiver role results in a gender gap in earnings.

Women have the majority of votes in this country, they have all the political power they wish to have, some just don't agree with you.  

I don't know about the above poster, but I did read the article and the comment that the problem is largely about hours worked is correct.  Early in the career before taking time when men and women are more likely to be working similar hours, they make the same income.  Women's hours then dip, generally forever but at least for a decent period of time and after that are paid less than men both in total and hourly because firms pay disproportionately more, the more hours you work.

But this makes sense, if you include human capital development in hours worked (as another poster called it job experience), then more hours worked last year translates into higher performance per hour this year.  Men are building up human capital while women are taking time off or leaving earlier.  This alone can probably explain the disproportionate hourly pay for more hours worked, but in addition firms like to reward those who demonstrate they're willing to put in more hours as that likely translates into higher willingness to put in hours during high necessity crunch times.  

There are other things going on here too, men are more willing to take risks looking for jobs than women and men are more likely to move for a better job while women are more likely to follow regardless of pay changes.  

These things only confirm that what little wage gap there is is indeed primarily due not to systematic discrimination but due to personal choices.  If women want to make as much or more than men, they need to make different decisions within their households which is the responsibility of families more than it is for government run by either sex.

I found this paper to be pretty interesting on the increase of men working long hours in the last quarter of the 20th century: http://www.nber.org/papers/w11895.pdf

> Mandated paid leave doesn't change the fact that after those few months are up a man will still take a job that requires more hours than a woman who wants to be home more for time with the child. Women tend to value time with the child more than men value money. This isn't going to change with a law.

You make the assumption that women want to be home more and that men care more about money than women. It is also possible that childcare costs more than a woman could make in the workforce and therefore she decides to stay home instead - increasing the length of her absence from the workplace. In response a man could be working longer since it is not generally feasible to support a family on a single middle class income in the United States.

And the top 5% wealthiest are only 5% of the voting population but obviously have a significantly higher impact than just 5%.

The fact that you think  ""women have the majority of votes"" was a valid defense clearly shows you are not interested in the facts or reality. 

>Early in the career before taking time when men and women are more likely to be working similar hours, they make the same income. Women's hours then dip, generally forever but at least for a decent period of time and after that are paid less than men both in total and hourly because firms pay disproportionately more, the more hours you work.

Yes, and that's the point of my original posts.  If women were in charge rather than men, you would see more of these issues being addressed rather than ignored.  Affordable daycare would likely be one thing that would assist in reducing the wage gap and giving women better options once they start having children.  But as expected, WheelsNo3 doesn't really care about that...he just argues it's a womens decision to have children or not. 

>But this makes sense, if you include human capital development in hours worked (as another poster called it job experience), then more hours worked last year translates into higher performance per hour this year. Men are building up human capital while women are taking time off or leaving earlier. This alone can probably explain the disproportionate hourly pay for more hours worked, but in addition firms like to reward those who demonstrate they're willing to put in more hours as that likely translates into higher willingness to put in hours during high necessity crunch times.

Yes, and affordable day care and lengthy paid paternal leave would better help a couple decide if they want to both get back to work or if one should  stay home. The way it currently is for most couples, the options are limited and it's more likely to lead for the woman to stay home for a period of time. 


>There are other things going on here too, men are more willing to take risks looking for jobs than women and men are more likely to move for a better job while women are more likely to follow regardless of pay changes.

How does the link contradict the OP? The OP article said the pay is relatively the same until women start having children. Your link says women make about the same as men in their 20's -- which is mostly before women start having children.

From your article:  ""*Women in their 20s have reversed the gender pay gap, but their earning power is still overtaken by men later in life.*""

Obviously the higher the pay, the larger the gap from annual % raises. This has nothing to do with discrimination and is the result of different starting points. Now when we start talking about people making six figures that get annual % increases to their wages, that gap starts to get pretty wide. It's just numbers.

Also, if low barrier jobs like landscaping have more men then discrimination is more prevalent, because men aren't able to take low barrier less stressful positions. 

>among immigrant populations that have completely different upbringing and social conventions

You're over reaching by saying ""Completely different"". [Gender Gap problems](http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/) persist in most of the world. The immigrants coming to the US are overwhelmingly from countries that have major Gender Discrimination issues and pay gaps. [Outside the Philippines I dont see a single country in the top 10 that has a better recorded then the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Origin) So, immigrant culture would more likely be contributing to the difference. (NOTE: This does not mean getting rid of immigrants would solve the problem)

>pretending that there are no differences between the sexes just breeds resentment and accusations of discrimination by policies intended to help minimize pay differences caused by solvable social tendencies.

I almost absolutely agree.  *There are many differences caused by society*, in the case of wages it comes in the form of productivity to society when genders are driven towards specific careers. *There is resentment*, because gender discrimination is a million little pricks that individually mean nothing.  *There are accusations of discrimination by policies* because the individual sees the policies as a punishment holding them back instead of a corrective measure benefiting society. *Solvable*, I hope, all I know is it is getting better.",onethomashall,t2_161zra,7,0,reddit4

Furthermore, studies using names have real problems as names can convey class and economic background characteristics that firms may value differently regardless of race.  The perfect example of this would be the propensity to be considered given a very white lower class name like Jethro or Cleatus.  Studies have suggested unusual names are simply less preferred likely due to the assumption that the people are less likely to fit in.  

Not the above poster, but personally I would suggest the evidence has consistently demonstrated a narrowing of the gender pay gap due to non discriminatory reasons and because we keep closing the gap due to those (to the point we are now at maybe 2% unexplained), that it's simply unreasonable to say that discrimination is causing significant differences between similar people.  To be convinced that women suffer due to systematic discrimination, I'd need to see a study that could demonstrate that regardless of career choice, human capital development, and hours worked, women make a considerable amount less than men, particularly outside the absolutely top of the scale which simply requires too complex a set of evaluation to make an appropriate judgment.  Yes that means I don't view answering the glass ceiling problem as a top priority, but that's because the necessary set of characterization for top executives is likely a complex mix of everything from hours worked to brilliance to social skills and narcissistic self promotion.  

As for racial discrimination, I think most of it is more about factors that simply correlate to race and the remainder (which is much larger than for gender pay gaps) is due to unfortunate assumptions based on real statistics (i.e. solving root causes would be more productive) and while real and terrible, the pure racial bigotry is probably small at least in corporate America (and probably often goes the other way due to affirmative action kinds of programs).  

It seems to me that the causes of different outcomes are more due to upbringing than to bias.  Girls are more likely to be brought up to be polite not brazen and to avoid math, science, and business pursuits (partially due to biological reasons).  Blacks (unlike say Asians) are more likely to grow up in an environment that doesn't emphasize educational investments and conformity to American corporate culture (simple examples are found in speech patterns and styles of dress that hold back lots of black kids).

dmosott,t1_dmorifc,2017-09-07 15:50:06,Economics,"> Can you show me an industry that pays a good wage that isn't exempt from overtime laws?

You assume that there is some entitlement to both good wages and protection under the law, there isn't and there shouldn't be.  This will simply be an intractable difference between us.  You want more laws protecting mid to high wage employees, I don't think there should be.  Simply agree to disagree.

> You make the assumption that women want to be home more and that men care more about money than women. 

[On average, this is true](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/do-women-like-child-care-more-than-men/?mcubz=0), women enjoy care taking more than men.  On an individual basis it certainly doesn't hold true in all cases, and in those cases the traditional roles can be easily flipped through free choice of the parties involved.  But on a population level, this higher level of enjoyment that women have will lead to men leaning into work more while women lean into parenting.  This bares itself out in the number of hours worked.  I'm not making an assumption about every single man and woman, but I am making a well documented statement about population level difference, the type of differences that leads to gaps like the one discussed here.

The US is at a low fertility rate of 1.84 currently, but we also have an average of 1,000,000 immigrants enter the US a year.  I am not anti-immigration.  I think immigration is important.  But the problem is over population in general.  We do not need more than replacement level fertility, we use enough resources with the population we have as it is.  It would be almost irresponsible for the US to boost fertility above replacement (which admittedly we are slightly below currently).  The population of the US has changed less that 1 percent for most of the last 20 years.  A stable population number is important to becoming a sustainable society, which is something I strongly believe in.

And no, you specifically did not say anything regarding laws about working certain hours, it was more a general statement about my feelings towards this discussion of a topic that is the result of free choice, and actions to change the outcome at a population level will have no effect other than the potentially trample the rights of those at the individual level.",wheelsno3,t2_8ogug,2,0,reddit4

I object highly to the idea that a disparity in outcome due to individual choice needs to be ""corrected"" by legislation.  Women can choose to not have a child.  Couples can choose that men be the primary care taker.  These are individual choices that could correct this perceived problem.

I am never a fan of more laws, especially when those laws are aimed at something that is the result of the aggregation of millions of free, individual choices.

I actually agree that ideally men and women should get paid parental leave.  I don't support the government forcing it.  I support companies offering it a competitive advantage to draw in talent.

Government is not always the answer.  That's my point.

And as for my post history, please go ahead and find something I have said that is actually misogynistic.  Nothing I have said in this thread is as such, and if you think stating that I don't want laws to take away free choices of individuals is somehow hateful towards women then I don't want to live in whatever authoritarian world you want for us.",wheelsno3,t2_8ogug,7,0,reddit4

Mostly, but not always.  The problem you'll have here is that the efficient opportunities to do things remotely or by timeshifting we are nearly fully utilizing, because they are powerful ways to reduce the cost of labor.

> Is this always the case? 

This is tautological.  If a given kind of worker isn't scarce, why would they command a high wage?

> Is the relationship proportional? 

To what?

> How does the scarcity of high wage earners relate to the gender gap?

I estimate that if there were no scarce workers, there would also be no gender gap.  That's a post-scarcity society though, so economics has little to say on the topic.

In the present economy we have, high wage earners are disproportionately male, and this forms the bulk of the explanation of the wage gap.

> In what contexts?

In approximately all contexts.  Interacting with other humans is easier when they are next to you in time and space.

I had no intention to condescend.  

I read the previous conversation and didn't find anything in it interested me in further discussion.  I agree with /u/daimposter on the diagnosis, but not the policy prescription.

I wanted to highlight that increased flexibility and reduced hours are not costless policies.  There's a good reason for employers to demand long, inflexible hours of high earners.  Labor and business must meet in the middle here -- part of the story is businesses reacting to an increased demand for flexible jobs, and part of the story is women being able to stretch towards high achiever roles.

The only way I can see landing women in those high achiever roles is increasing male participation in the caregiving role.  I see no plausible future where women shoulder most of the caregiving burden and an equal role in the labor market.  Both men and women need to get next to the idea that it's ok for the woman to be the primary earner and the man to be the primary caregiver.",SmokingPuffin,t2_8f0cw,5,0,reddit4

But yeah, in my case I downvoted you both because you whined and because I disagree with you, quelle surprise. 

The top 5% are generally households with one woman and one man with generally community ownership of funds.  The fact of reality is that women do indeed simply have more voting power and pretending otherwise is simply obtuse. At the end of the day political power is in votes not dollars and if more women wanted to assert their political power in alignment with you, they could.  Women tend also to be more independent which is why swaying their vote is one of the major talking points in almost every election.  But a thing that may surprise you is that many people don't make the entirety of their electoral decisions with their genitals but rather based on their diverse beliefs. 

It is a woman's decision (with some small roles for men) whether or not to have children.  Women after a certain age also tend to live in a household with a male partner with whom they can choose to delineate the parental responsibilities at least after a brief period after birth as they see fit.  If a woman wants to earn more she can choose not to have a baby or make her partner take over more child care responsibilities, she could adopt and raise an older child, or work with grandparents and others to provide daycare.  The fact that these alternatives are not more commonly taken is not necessarily the governments job to fix.  

Maybe we should make it easier for parents to go back to work sooner by creating a wealth transfer between people who don't want or can't have or choose to raise their own children and those who do, that may make childcare worse in this country or better.  But you are right that it'll probably make it easier for some women to work more and thus earn more.  If that's what people want I suppose they can vote for candidates that support it, regardless of what's in their pants.

In addition there are other studies that have better controls than what this one has: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/19/ebay-study-shows-online-shoppers-are-subconsciously-sexist

If the data wasn't so clear, you might be able to say ""Ah, women are worse salesmen than men because of how they emotionally approach things.""  You could say that the data suggests they are undercutting themselves.  But in this case, it's clear that they aren't.

Until men are not ashamed to stay home with the kids (when they desire to), we are going to have a hard time really knowing if the choices people make in the workplace are due to what they desire.  On top of that, there's still a problem of viewing women as deserving less pay, though I think it's much better than in the 60s.",jemyr,t2_5hb10,2,0,reddit4

Calling out someone's bias does nothing to actually answer the argument. Attacking someone's bias doesn't answer the argument either. I suppose it is useful if you want to imply that you're somehow less biased (or totally unbiased) without the explicit condescension.

Despite the connotation you're reading in my words, I don't believe stay-at-home parenting is the 'lesser' option. You framed childrearing as an either/or: either you have a kid and be a parent, or you have a career, but not both. In your words, the items are mutually exclusive, and I disagree with that statement. As I said, a woman (or man, if they stay at home) may not reach executive status if they decide to raise their kid or kids for 6 to 10 years, but not every career needs to end in an executive position. If the stay at home parent can find a job with flexible hours or the ability to work from home, should they be turned away because ""Oh, you're also a stay-at-home parent""? Careers take decades to build, but children start school after 6 years, assuming they don't go to preschool or kindergarten. What about all the lost productivity of the parent past the point where their kid needs them 24/7? I would be extremely satisfied if society allowed for stay-at-home parenting that didn't destroy career opportunities, but that is precisely what you're doing by framing career/parenting as an either/or when you could be pushing for better retraining programs, remote work programs, reduced hours. All of these things are workable solutions in some, maybe many, industries that would allow for more stay-at-home parenting without stopping the career dead. 

What I really questioned in your post was the peddling of (what sounds a lot like) biological determinism. 
> The biological realities of the distribution of traits in men and women mean that outcomes will be unequal because they specialized to do different things.

What traits? What specializations? How do those specializations account for men in caregiving roles, or stay at home dads?

I do want to point out one thing, though, which is that the tendency to associate ""black"" names, speech patterns, and style with poor education and poverty is an example of systematic racial bias. I agree that a hiring manager might not look at a resume and think ""Lamar? Hmmm, sounds like he's black and I don't want to hire black people."" But they might have the thought process of ""Lamar? Sounds poor and uneducated and I don't want to hire poor and uneducated people"" without consciously being aware of the fact that their thought process really is Lamar -> black -> poor and uneducated. Associating black culture with poverty and a lack of education is itself an example of racial bias. Furthermore, the idea that women and minorities should have to conform to ""corporate"" culture (which is largely white, male culture) in order to be successful is biased and discriminatory.

Lastly, you say that the causes of different outcomes are more due to upbringing than bias. But the upbringing that shapes women and minorities is an accumulation of biased interactions that they experience throughout their life. Women's parents are biased against behavior that is considered brazen when a girl does it, and confident when a boy does it. Women's teachers are biased against their interest in math and science.  And these biases carry through to their work life. ",tongmengjia,t2_4pmbl,6,0,reddit4

That's not a good argument. We need people having children. Even if we don't, the very fact that your solution is just ""don't have children"" shows how insensitive you are on the subject. 

>Couples can choose that men be the primary care taker.

First, women are the ones to actually bear the child. So no matter what, they would need to take time off. Second, most men don't get lengthy paid parental leave so the system is already set to have the mom stay at home and limit the options. Third, just because it's still a choice of who stays home doesn't mean the issue can't be addressed by making childcare more affordable, rather than passing the burden on to the mother OR the father.

I agree that Sweden and Norway have significantly reduced the motherhood penalty, but I don't believe that is significantly related to parental leave policies.  [This paper] (http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/files/2010/The-Within-Job-Motherhood-Wage-Penalty-in-Norway.pdf) covers the period 1979-1996, during which there was a 60% reduction in the motherhood penalty.  For the bulk of this study period, there was a shared 13 weeks of parental leave available to either parent, but it was much more commonly taken by the mother.  In 1993, Norway allocated 4 of the weeks of leave to the father only.

Some relevant conclusions drawn in the paper:

> Among childless women, those who subsequently became mothers earned slightly lower wages than those who remained childless. But once a mother, major negative treatment effects of motherhood added to the very small negative selection effects.  The motherhood penalty was thus mainly a treatment effect: Women, when they became mothers, tended to change employment to lower-paying occupations and occupation-establishment units. 

> Women with children worked in different and lower-paying occupations and occupation–establishment units
than childless women. By 1990–1996, once mothers and nonmothers worked in the same occupation in the
same establishment (i.e., job), they for most practical purposes received the same pay, the motherhood 
Within-Job Motherhood Wage Penalty in Norway 24 penalty was 0.6%, 0.9%, and 1.4% for one, two, and three or more children. The penalty at this level was significantly reduced over the 18-year period. This indicates a strong reduction of discrimination or of productivity differences.

Restating: the motherhood penalty in the study period is primarily about women self-selecting into mom-friendly occupational tracks after becoming a mother.  Over the period, reduction of the motherhood penalty was primarily driven by a strong reduction in employer discrimination or mothers becoming more productive at work.  Do these results really sound like plausible consequences of 4 weeks of paternal leave in the tail end of the data set?  Or does it sound more like Norway made it easier for mothers to work?

I estimate that Norway's excellent childcare system is the dominant factor here, and I believe you will agree on this point.  

> Sweden, if you research, will show similar improvements based on their incentivization of paternal leave.

I have seen no such paper.  I agree, similar improvements, but I can find no one who claims those improvements are based on paternal leave incentivization.

The closest support I can find to that conclusion is [here](http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45782/1/623752174.pdf):

> Each additional month that the father stays on parental leave increases mothers' earnings by 6.7%

I conjecture this is a signaling effect -- in families where the father takes more parental leave than the mother, you are likely looking at some mix of a career-focused wife and a caregiving-focused husband.  The paper itself presents a few possible explanations, this one included, but makes no claim as to linkage.

> The nonstarter to serious inquiry here is that you're grouping Scandinavian countries as a whole based on ""maximally egalitarian"" policy but without isolating for paternity leave and for the comparative effects of their paternity leave adjustments.
...
> So the point stands -- paternal leave, when smartly crafted, is a tool for reducing the wage gap. 

I am not aware of any paper, or any methodology, that is capable of isolating the effect of paternity leave.  
Can you cite me something on this?  My understanding of the literature is that it's difficult to claim a link between paternal leave and wage gap reductions, because paternal leave policies have invariably been enacted alongside other policy and cultural changes and isolating their effects is problematic.",SmokingPuffin,t2_8f0cw,1,0,reddit4

I don't know if it will pay for itself in terms of increased taxes, but I do believe it has long term benefits for your economy.

Certainly one would expect cheaper daycare to result in more women working for more years of their life.  I don't think it results in more productivity -- you get productivity by dividing GDP by hours of labor, and cheap daycare will increase hours of labor proportionally more than it does GDP.  You will get more tax revenue, because you're effectively moving unpaid labor into paid labor, but we don't usually think of tax increases as good for an economy.  

Overall, it's tricky to evaluate, because there aren't a lot of similar cases to study.

The question at hand is regarding the earnings gap.  The article at hand says that women take time off of the career path for child rearing and then when they return they work less hour.  This stunting of career progress and then subsequent reduction of hours worked leads to women earning less in a year than men.

I said to the above commenter that no law can make men and women work the same number of hours, because any such law would be authoritarian, and thus the gaps is the result of the choices of men to work jobs demanding long hours.

You and I trade a few comments, and then you throw out this line about ""living wage""?

Where does that come from?  We have laws forcing employees to get paid overtime if they work more than 40 hours in a week if they are waged OR if they make $47,000 or less a year as base pay.

This isn't a country where cultural pressure means physical danger (for the vast, vast majority of people) unlike in cultures with honor killings and such. People have the ability to make their own cultural changes in the world. 

Ultimately, the cause of a considerable amount of the inequality in our society are exactly things like moms teaching daughters they should pursue care giving careers rather than stem or business, that girls are taught to be passive rather than competitive risk takers.  Similarly, one of the big problems in some (generally not the successful) minority cultures is less attention to educational investment and conforming to traditional American cultural norms.  

These are problems that can be mitigated to some degree in the classroom or perhaps to a limited degree by government funded extra curricular, but far and away these are primarily the results of personal influence by parents, family, and friends, as well as media.  To some degree we have to realize the government isn't going to be successful (and likely shouldn't) try to force dramatic cultural change at the personal level.  I'd guess the best approach we really have is just to talk about these things, and maybe some public service advertising similar to what we did to change our cultural outlook on littering.  I know I believe it's a good thing to be critical of media portrayals of women and minorities, though I think so often when they try and fix it they only make it worse.

FTFY. That's actually a pretty good definition. Equality and equity are not the same thing. 

I would also suggest reading the book that is widely credited with starting second wave feminism (which is a misnomer if there ever was one; the Suffragettes were not feminists nor would they agree with a feminist postmodern worldview in the slightest), namely The Feminine Mystique. 

And while you are reading that book, remind yourself that the author is someone who detested children (despite having three of her own) and was in a mutually abusive with her husband (and that is assuming we believe HER half of the story, There is plenty of corroboration that she was physically violent with him, and pretty much only her word that he returned the favor). She also had a big problem with the sources of ""research"" that was cited to help make her case. [A LOT of it turned out to be nonsense](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/02/4-big-problems-with-the-feminine-mystique/273069/). She was a violent Antifa type. And she is credited with igniting the movement. That's why I don't buy for a second that the modern manifestation of Antifa is ""radical"" feminism or a fringe element. It is the CORE element of feminism. I mean, when you base your entire worldview on neo-Marxist notions like the patriarchy and gender-based class oppression, you are bound to end up in a radical place.

This whole ""feminism is the notion that men and women are equal"" is modern window dressing to make it more appealing to people like you. And it IS appealing, until you look under the surface and see why these people are pushing these insane ideas. They want equity. They want social justice. Those are incredibly dangerous and toxic ideas that have no place in a modern society. There are a million and one YouTube videos as to why that is, done by people far more articulate than I, but if you want somewhere to start, I would suggest Jordan B Peterson.

It will be hard to actually make this stick.  Daycare businesses have a lot of overhead that moms don't.  The big upside to daycare is for high wage moms to be able to do their high wage work while working class people can watch their kids.  It's really hard to make a daycare system that's efficient enough to make it rational for working class moms to use daycare.  You can apply a subsidy to make it rational for the mom, but that just transfers the cost to society.

In particular, a group of moms that rotate the kidwatching are just comically more efficient than a daycare.

> Tax revenue increase due to more in the labor market to me is about lowering the amount you tax everyone. The people not in the labor market still benefit from my taxes without working. Now that they work, in theory tax rates should be able to decrease so long as the amount taxed stays the same.

I think it's certainly possible to make such a change revenue neutral, at least in theory.  The question is what benefit you gain.

> It's hard to target the rich in a way that would lead to them having more kids.

I think it'd be pretty easy, economically speaking.  It's a political problem.  

I don't see any need to target anyone on this topic; my view is that more people isn't inherently better than less people.  Like you, I believe this is more of an opinion thing.

The twist to this, going forward, is that millennial women are far more educated than millennial men, and so maximum efficiency will be obtained for most families to have the woman be the primary breadwinner.

Stand firm in what you believe and have a plan B. From a job perspective, ALWAYS have an updated resume on job boards. Build a solid relationship with some recruiters. You'll be a lot more confident and capable of assertiveness if you know you can easily land another similar job with your network. Know your worth and know what wiggle room you're willing to accept ahead of time. If you're confident that you're worth a certain value and you show that to an employer, it absolutely has an impact. If the employer doesn't match your value, or even get within the range you have in mind for your ""wiggle room"", be tactful about how you negotiate. Make it clear that you want to work for them, but also that any offer less than your value will require you to think about it for a few days (which basically means consider other offers since you hopefully have that network I mentioned earlier). That's all assuming you're looking for new employment.

If you're referring to raises, offer tangible proof in terms of numbers that explicitly demonstrates your value to the company. Honestly, the way things are now days, at least in very corporate environments (in my experience), raises are set and only vary by a couple % regardless of your performance. This makes me more inclined to leverage my network and use that plan B I mentioned to increase my wages every few years, unless I find a diamond in the rough where the company actually invests in their employees and gives fair raises based on talent/merit. It really doesn't appear that companies value loyalty now days (value meaning fair work for fair pay, so an employer simply claiming to value loyalty without properly compensating for it doesn't count). So utlizing the ""I have other offers for $x, can you beat that"" method of negotiation tends to be the go to.

Hopefully that helps a little bit. I am no expert in all this, but this has been my philosophy for handling things and it's worked okay for me, as far as minimizing the stress since you'll be confident that you can secure employment elsewhere, worst case.",unseenspecter,t2_7on7p,1,0,reddit4

This is childish behavior.

Furthermore, most women don't have birth complications and most women in Sweden actually work close to fulltime during the entire pregnancy, And most are actually back at work within 2 weeks of labor.  

Why women choose to take out more of the parental leave can have many reasons. I don't think I'm close minded to that idea. Things like societal conditioning like women are assumed to take most care of the baby. But I'm also open to the idea that this is what women want, even if their men want to help. My brother has 5 children and is the most egalitarian man I know.  
Yet both his wives chose to stay at home more, because that's what they felt like.  

Another factor why women stay at home more is because most women choose a partner who makes more money. So it financially makes sense that the one who earns more stays working. And then we have the factor of men working more in private sector, which more often than public sector doesn't have as much flexibility.

I wonder why Sweden has such long parental leave if they only take 2 weeks? Hmm, seems odd. 

I totally believe women have free will. But in America, a woman can get pregnant with someone on accident or on purpose and that other person has the complete option of walking away anytime within the next 9 months or 18 years.  And while sure, some women abandon their children, far more men do than women (82% to 18%, https://www.thespruce.com/single-parent-census-data-2997668 ).  There is no free will if you have a child and the father walks away; there isn't a nanny fairy that steps in and covers. And if this high earning man leaves, then she's doubly stuck huh.

That was the first I could come up with.  That does not mean it is the best or the only instance; however, it is the easiest to recognize in terms of a difference between the sexes.  I stated that men are physically more capable than women and that no woman has greater skills than a man to compensate for this difference.  You appear to be offended and are attacking this claim because you are offended not because you actually know of evidence where this is wrong.  Instead, you will need to go out and cherry pick evidence of why you are right instead of knowing you are right prior to starting the argument.

> A scientific sub like /r/economics shouldn't be okay with asinine opinions being spouted as fact like that.

This is not an opinion.  If a person was to say that the Earth is flat, they would be expected to show evidence of this.  You claimed that women were better than communication than men.  Therefore, you should be expected to show evidence of this when I state there is no evidence of this.  Saying, ""There is no reasonable evidence whatsoever that the Earth is flat"" is not an opinion.  This is exactly the same as my statement.

> I think that speaks volumes to your bias and the reason that no one should take your original assertion seriously.

I have no intentional bias and no agenda.  Any bias would simply be my inability to come up with random scenarios off the top of my head where a woman might have more skills than a man.  If I had evidence of anything to contrary of what I said, I would consider it.  Your point about women being smaller is a great point and wonderfully counteracts the arguments for the physical abilities of men allowing them to be more versatile in the work environment.  If men are usually larger and stronger, then women are usually smaller.  This means they can do other things that require a smaller person to accomplish.  Excellent point, and I agree.  I did not consider this as a positive aspect originally.

Now, saying that women have smaller hands means they can do things like solder smaller components to motherboards or iPhones, for example.  Most of these tasks are within other countries where the pay is low, and these are not considered high risk except for the instance of repetitive stress injuries and hazards in the workplace by companies not properly protecting their workers.  This would not equate to greater pay, though, in countries where these types of poor workplace conditions exist.  (It would in many countries, though.)  Can you 

However, I think you are the one showing bias.  You are cherry picking sources to suit an agenda that women are somehow equal to men in terms of everything, and sadly, that is not the case. The physical capabilities of the sexes are different.  You cannot argue that women are smaller and then claim that women are the same.  

There are things that women have more value in regards to.  While it cannot really be considered a skill that men are more physically capable (and I am surprised you are not arguing that point but it sounds like you are trying to do so in some cases), you are trying to call having small hands a skill.  If women and men are equal in skill (which does not disprove my statement that there is no skill at which women excel over men), you cannot say that having small hands is necessarily a skill, and your attempt to prove me wrong is simply you saying that women have more skills than men by virtue of tiny hands since the intelligence of both men and women are the same.  (Women often get more education nowadays, though, which puts them at an advantage over men which is great to compensate for physical differences.)

You are saying that women have skills by virtue of small hands.  I was saying that women do not have skills greater than men and therefore cannot compensate for the physical difference.  I am not sure if having a smaller stature is comparable to greater physical strength, though.  I then stated that women have greater sexual value than men, and this small assertion that women are valued more than men in a sexual aspect seemed to trigger you, but it is true.

> your response was to attack the strawman

I am not aware of a strawman.  You are welcome to point it out.  You do appear to be greatly offended because you said, ""Im just dumbfounded that his brain could only muster up"" which is an ad hominem attack against me without saying anything against my original argument that women have more sexual value while men have more physical capability.  I think this points to you obviously arguing with me because you were offended, and you jumped to your conclusions without doing any research of your own.  That is fine, but do not try to pass it off as fact.  You then did your research after coming up with your own conclusions about the matter, and you came up with a single example of tiny hands.  Why are my two examples of models and pornography less adequate than your single example of tiny hands?

> I disagreed because your claim was wrong and founded in lazy ignorance, not because you ruffled my sensitive feathers.

Now, my claim may be wrong since you have shown a single paper written by a psychologist that has a conclusion that does not even disprove what I was saying, but your justification for my claim being wrong is that women have small hands.  And you cite this as a skill.  If this is a skill then heavy lifting is a skill.  Therefore, you have noted that there are skills at which women are better than men, but only coming up with a single example of small hands does not in any way make my comments bias.  From the social viewpoint of a layman, my comments may be sexist, but they are not any more sexist than saying ""Women usually have larger breasts than men.""  It is simply a statement of fact.  (Unless you want to argue with my breast comment being incorrect as well and find a single article online that shows that, in fact, men somehow have larger breasts based on the surface area of their chests.)

Now, back to your single example of where women have greater skill than men because of tiny hands:

> Females also perform better than men on some measures of Manual Dexterity but there is no meaningful sex difference on other Manual Dexterity measures. All other psychomotor measures 
favor men with the exception of Speed of Limb movement where 
we advise caution in drawing conclusions. Our findings for Speed of Limb movement are complicated by forearm tapping favoring men and two-plate tapping favoring women.  Also, there is possible publication bias in the two-plate tapping and there may be age moderators.

This is part of the conclusion of your article.  I suspect you did not even read it.  Again, you simply used Google to get the first answer you could to contradict my claim and then copied and pasted it.  You did not even have any examples where women are better at communication.  (This is the exact argument made by the person at Google that was fired for his memo, by the way.)

> And there might be other jobs that pay even more that women are better at. Communication and approachability skills are inherent in workplaces that make a lot more than the ability to be strong and tolerate risk.  That's assuming that women are actually measurably better at those jobs. Much more difficult to prove than physical strength.

My response to this is to state that there is no evidence that women are able to communicate better than men.  Again, there is no skill I have been shown (other than your tiny hands example) where women are better than men at it.  You are the one making the claim that women are better than communication.  You also equate that approachability is a skill which I argue against, and this furthers my sexual value claim more than your ""women have more skills than men to make up for physical differences"" claim.

As for simply using Google, I suggest that you follow this advice.  A simple Google search would show that my claim that female models make more than men is clear.  Thousands of articles reference this and show that, yes, female models make more than male models.  [I am not even sure how you could argue against this point.](https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/news/gender-pay-gap-in-modelling-industry-sees-women-earn-75-more-than-men-a3597656.html)  And I am not even going to waste my time posting a link that indicates that female use of sexuality is much more profitable for women than men.  I have looked it up.  I see it.  Women can use their sexual value for much greater returns than men.  I never said that women are only good for sexual value.  I simply said that you cannot go around spouting that women have more skills than men, and therefore, this makes up for the physical capabilities of men.  I even offered a counterpoint that the sexual value of women more than compensates for the physical differences that men may have, but women are oftentimes not willing to capitalize on their sexual value.  This does not make a woman worth less than a man.  All people have equal value as people, but in terms of production, the value that society assigns to each gender is different.  Your attempt to argue against this shows a lack of research, and you should re-evaluate your biased position.

dmqrbaa,t1_dmqkbcn,2017-09-08 19:11:30,Economics,"Oh, I see you were saying communication and emotional skills (i.e. social skills).  

I don't know if we have enough controls to be able to draw that conclusion.   I do remember a study where they showed men were worse at handling the needs of an infant (handling the crying, changing diapers),  but the same data shows that women supervised men more, leapt in to do the work, and in short - prevented many men from actually being able to build the skill.  In fact, there's been a movement towards training women how to recognize when they are preventing their spouses from learning how to care for a child, and that their assumptions their spouse is genetically incompetent at the skill set is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  

And that point still isn't accounting for societal norms added on top of child care.

So can we truly know if men and women have a native advantage when it comes to social skills and communication skills?  

But I'll admit, my experience with hundreds of small children makes me think that there's something to emotional intuition.  This is not scientific, by any means, but it does appear to me that most of the boys are less aware of feelings.   However, when they are asked to pay attention to feelings, they are just as aware as girls, but also they seem to have less coping mechanisms to handle the feelings.  I think the coping mechanisms are a matter of not practicing them  as much, a function of not being aware.   But everything else seems the same.   The girls are very competitive, but seem more aware of how that effects people's feelings minute-by-minute.  The boys headspace isn't there unless you tell them to think about it.  Then they take it all in, and don't know what to do with all the data.

My personal takeaway from this is that a man would make an excellent nurse, because when asked to be attentive,  they have the same skill set.  And the amount of training required would make all men equivalently proficient to the women by the end of training.  If there is a genetic lift, it's not substantial enough in the face of training.  In my opinion.

This seems true to me across the spectrum of jobs.

But my perception of the truth could still be a function of what our culture is.  It's anecdotal.  I'd be very interested to see a test that could really see if boys are less aware of emotion (when not asked to pay attention) compared to girls.  But how do you suss that out from parenting?  Maybe parents are constantly reminding their daughters to think about other people's feelings, and not their sons.  ",jemyr,t2_5hb10,1,0,reddit4

With respect to reality, we're speaking at cross purposes. I accept that sexism has fallen dramatically. My point is that *many* men and women continue to choose traditional divisions of labor because that is optimal for them. They aren't mutually exclusive, feminist women can like childrearing, and feminist men can like breadwinning. 

When it comes to economic optimality I worry we're also speaking at cross purposes. I'm talking about optimality as a couple maximizing their utility, which isn't the same thing as maximizing their wealth. For example, if a couple sews scarfs for 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, then their productivity (and incomes) are going to skyrocket, but their utility is going to markedly decline, because that's no kind of life. The point is, the couples know that two time-consuming full-time incomes is an option, and very often they're preferring other options instead, such as one full time and one part time.

fffhhjt,t3_etbjqv,2020-01-24 16:41:03,Economics,"There’s a ton of people here making a ‘legal tender argument.’ Everything I’ve read so far is pretty wrong. 

Here is a free financial history lesson: The gist of that language on a $1 bill is that the ‘the US Dollar’ - in the abstract - must be accepted as legal tender in all debts public and private. It does not mean that you must accept a specific bill (eg a $100 bill) as currency. 

That language came about in the late 1800s/early 1900s when it was common for local banks to issue their own currency. This practice was largely a ~100 year rolling financial disaster bc if you were accepting the currency (for example you ran a store) you had to guess if the bank issuing the currency was stable or even existed. These bank notes were generally gold/silver redeemable, but what are you supposed to do if the issuing bank was 4 weeks of travel from your store?

It was a *massive* drag on trade, which was a big problem as the expansion of rail networks meant trade was now regularly occurring over thousands of miles (as opposed to locally, where you knew the local bank and could have a better sense of how stable the local bank was). Imagine being a retailer in Chicago; would you accept a $5 bill issued by a bank in Buffalo NY? Probably not. And I’m not even getting into all the local recession/depressions that would occur if a local bank collapsed, which happened all the time. 

When the federal govt created our modern financial system (namely creating the Fed and greatly expanding the role of the US Treasury) one of the first things they did was to monopolize the financial system by soft-banning all non-USD currency. The ‘all debts public and private’ language is essentially the enforcement mechanism for that monopoly. It was a soft-ban bc the Fed/UST knew that the USD would be the currency that held the most public confidence. So if the USD was mandated to be accepted, it would naturally force out other currencies - which is what happened. 

To the more modern issue: I’m on mobile so I’m not linking the specific cases, but this issue has gone to court before. I’m going from memory, but there was an old case where someone sued bc a gas station bc they wouldn’t accept bills larger than $5 (this was a long time ago), and the court ruled that the refusal to accept a $10 was legal because the *transaction* (the debt) was still settled in USD, which was the point of the law. 

A retailer going to credit-only would still be legal because the transaction is still settled in USD, as stipulated by the law - the credit card is just a convenience. If you go to LasVegas, you can kinda see where this blends into a weird grey area, where you can use chips at a table, but you cannot buy dinner with chips. In this case, the casino and the restaurant are operated by two separate companies, and settling a cross-transaction is too close to accepting a non-USD currency.  But there is obviously a grey area in the middle. 

This topic is going to come up again in the near future involving crypto coins. Eventually there will be a ‘Bitcoin only’ store that will get stepped on by the US Treasury. Honestly, that case won’t be interesting - the Treasury is within its rights to enforce that. To me, the interesting case will be when some retailer opens a store that only accepts a USD-backed stable coin. The UST will say ‘no way bro’ but the retailer will argue that a stable-coin is USD backed and arguably no different than a credit card transaction. *THAT* will be an interesting - and potentially extremely important - court case.",Laminar_flo,t2_7gmyn,38,0,reddit1

You  yourself cannot create a bank to engage in electronic money exchanges. You're dependent upon a company to provide that service for you. When a service reaches that level of universal usage and requirement, it becomes a utility. Unless we're willing to have the government provide financial services for everyone *yikes*, I don't see how this is a good idea.
 
At worst, huge parts of the population can get completely shut out of buying any goods or services because of computer errors, or intentional by the bank. At best, you're forced to have every single transaction you make timestamped, with your name and location recorded and tracked by a bank. Whose ability and altruism you must count on to get things right 100% of the time with 100% of their customers.
 
Using the excuse of convenience is how we got the Patriot Act. Yes, there are some benefits that business owners will see like less employee theft, less time spent counting money.

Essentially the options seem to be:

A.) Require private businesses to shoulder the one time expense of installing cash drawers and a safe, in addition to ongoing cash management expenses. 

B.) Go through the coordination headache of trying to get thousands of poor people to open a bank account, the infrastructure headache of setting up a bank, and the regulatory headache associated with obeying bank regulations. And since this is supposed to be in the public interest, you'd probably want the bank to have a decent sized branch network in order to serve people who don't have computers or smartphones, and those branches are expensive, so the taxpayers would likely have to pay for this.

fffjva0,t3_etbjqv,2020-01-24 17:05:29,Economics,"There is a question about how cashless benefits poor. Let me give you an example. In China, almost all street vendors accept mobile payments. A lot of places do not accept cash. The street vendors are legitimate very poor population- their incomes are very low and competition is fierce. If you walk up to a breakfast stand in China, you just yell at them “give me an egg”, they will prepare and take it over, you will do mobile payments without them looking (a lot of times), then there will be a beep sound indicating paid. This would reduce one labor (no cashier now) and there is no cash safety concerns. So for a small vendor, it is easy to setup (a barcode in some cases and a speaker), cheaper (less labor), efficient (reduced customer waiting time). 

Now, what happened to US? Credit cards. The transaction cost is too high (5%+?) for those tiny transaction. In China, I heard that it is 0.9% (my memory could be wrong, I believe it is 0.5-1%) and it is directly taking out of your cash account. 

If banks run only on cash accounts, transaction fees are minimal, there is really no reason to have cash anymore. In US, we just stuck with this antique credit card system and then re-enforcing it.",melvinma,t2_3asxm,0,0,reddit1

Long distance trade in bank notes was not as big a deal as you're making it. Far locales accepted notes at a discount that, over time, trended towards transportation costs. New York banks, for example, were able to trade at par across the state by the end of the 1850's. 

Similarly, in terms of being able to trust the notes you'd received, the answer is even simpler: there used to be papers that regularly printed the financial status of the issuers of local bank notes. Anything that wasn't trading at par (or at a reasonable, transportation cost derived discount) would be known far and wide very quickly.

Are both of these things additional transactions costs that gum up the works? Of course, but they were caused by regulatory restrictions on bank branching, not by the lack of a legal tender clause. Small unit banks weren't a thing in Canada because their banks were allowed to branch nation wide. There are no transportation costs if you can be reasonably sure every town has a branch for the bank whose notes you're holding, and a couple dozen nation-wide firms are easier to recognize as reputable than a few thousand tiny ones.

Because of these adjustments, the unit banking system (no matter how bad an idea it was) wasn't that tremendous a drag on long distance trade. Large volume trade would usually be handled by commercial bills in the first place (you write a bill promising to pay in such-and-such city in exchange for my bulk goods and give it to me in this-other city now. I take it to a bank or financier of some kind, they buy it from me at a discount, then send it to their correspondent in such-and-such city for redemption). Bank notes COULD be used as loan vehicles (this was really their predominant purpose, actually), but they would rarely travel extremely far from their point of issuance.

These things all changed, not with the adoption of the Fed, but with the National Banking Acts of the 1860's. National Banks emitted something closer to branded US dollars, which were closer to a legal tender status, in that they were universally acceptable for tax and other debts to the US government. At the same time Congress issued a few hundred million dollars in Greenbacks, which were indeed straight legal tender. But neither of these were about driving state bank notes out of circulation, they were about ensuring these new national currencies always traded at par (because it was illegal to discount their value on debt payments). National bank notes traded at par nationally because of this as well as because the US Comptroller of the Currency guaranteed their backing 100% with US Bonds. Clearing systems also arose in the later part of the 19th century to facilitate depositing any bank's note at any other bank.

The state bank notes were driven out of circulation by a 10% tax on their issue. Since national banks did not have to pay this tax, a few thousand state banks converted to national banks and went on with their business.

Similarly, the national bank notes were not driven out when the Fed was founded, but instead in the 1930's when the bonds they were required to use to back their issue were retired (intentionally).

Interestingly, the tax on state bank notes was repealed in the 70's. It's probably formally legal for state banks in states without their own special laws surrounding note issue to do so, but none have tried. Most likely because they'd be afraid of the legal problems that would occur (they're not formally banned from doing so, but the assumption is so widespread they may assume there'd be an act of Congress within a few months of them trying).

Why is all this important? Well, it's kind of not. Just felt like sharing a little bit of information, give you the opportunity to learn about something you didn't already know. Laws and regulations surrounding banking in the US over the course of its history are pretty interesting. Always happy to answer questions if you want to know more.",Mexatt,t2_8n4vku4,5,0,reddit1

> but what are you supposed to do if the issuing bank was 4 weeks of travel from your store?

it wasn't. You wouldn't go to a bank that far. Not even Boston and Charleston would put easily-lost notes on a ship moving tobacco. 

>It was a massive drag on trade, 

Not at all. Opium could flow anywhere as needed.

>Imagine being a retailer in Chicago; would you accept a $5 bill issued by a bank in Buffalo NY? Probably not.

**Definitely Not**. For one, $5 [was exceptionally rare](http://www.antiquemoney.com/five-dollar-bills-from-the-1870s/), and they were only really issued in California. 

Secondly, Buffalo and Chicago were tied by the Postal Service more than 100 years prior (1792). So people would ""write ahead"" and make arrangements before getting onto train, horse, or boat. Letters (and any paper money included). 

Western Union, for example :

>Starting in February 1871, Western Union’s network grew exponentially, allowing customers to send money between New York, Chicago and Boston using the Western Union money transfer services. By the end of the year, we had expanded nationally, successfully uniting the country through remittances. As our business continued to grow, they revolutionized how international money transfers work. 

But *how long ahead did you have to send word before you arrived*? TWO WEEKS:

>In today's world of e-mail and overnight express mail service, the idea of a letter taking two weeks to travel from New York to Philadelphia seems almost comical. **However, in the mid-1700s, a letter might take as long as fourteen days to make the 109-mile trip between the two cities**.

you:

>It was a soft-ban bc the Fed/UST knew that the USD would be the currency that held the most public confidence. 

No, it was because the Fed/UST knew that it had collected taxes in USD since 1793. Nothing to do with ""public confidence"" nor ""competing currencies"" or any other hogwash. 

>and the court ruled that the refusal to accept a $10 was legal because the transaction (the debt) was still settled in USD, which was the point of the law. 

*that* sounds correct. USD is the currency, refusing to accept one denomination is ""ok"". 

>To me, the interesting case will be when some retailer opens a store that only accepts a USD-backed stable coin.

Yes, such as a ""Dime"", ""Penny"", ""Quarter"", or ""Nickel"".

It is very easy to open a bank account in the US.  You need a government issued ID.  Some banks require additional information like your birthday or social security number.  There are tons of places that offer free types of banking.

You can open an account online, by phone, or in person.

Easy.

And for most people living in the US, this is a total non-issue.  The problem is the extreme end of people that can't make this work.  Imagine a room with 1000 people.  Picture the one with the worst upbringing or lowest IQ or greatest physical disability.  Then remember there are 8.6 million people in NYC.

Illegals/undocumented workers might not be able to get banks.  Immigration is a tricky topic in the US and a lot of people support laws that make life easier for people in this situation.  This is one such example.

Really poor people too.  Nice banks don't open branches in the ghetto.  Poor people don't want to take a bunch of buses to get to a bank to open an account, and then take those same buses to deposit money each week.  Online accounts are great, but you can't deposit physical cash easily.

Along with that 'free' accounts never are.  At least not in the US.  If you have money, you give the bank a minimum amount and your account is free.  The bank uses your money to make themselves money.  They are happy.  Poor people can't do that.  Banks that Target poor people make money by charging fees.  Upfront fees won't work - poor people would say no.  The fees get hidden.  Overdraft fees or they will require N transactions per month, but catch you by using calendar month instead of 30 days or something.  They will also apply transactions in the way that screws you the most.  If I have $20 in my account and deposit $100 today and you cash a check I wrote you for $80... They will apply the check first, so I am at -$60 then charge me an overdraft fee of $30... Instead of $40 the bank says I have $10.  Only I don't know it, so the next day I try to spend $20 and well, you get the idea.  And ATM fees ... I have a good bank so I get reimbursed ATM fees.  When I go to an ATM, rarely, I take out my daily limit, because why not.  I get $500 and I pay $0.  I'm luck.

If money was tight and I only had $60 I might take out $40 and have to pay $3.00 to get the money.  That's a crazy high percent.

HSBC has a basic checking account that costs only $1 per month.  But it has a $2.50 for ATMs that aren't HSBC (plus whatever that atm charges you), and $35 for insufficient funds.

Anyway, what stops corporations from selling your buying history if it’s linked to your number? A persons phone number is one of the most identifiable piece of information a person can have.

I’m traveling to Asia at the moment so I can’t give a full rebuttal. You and I largely agree in principle however my argument would be there was a vast difference between ‘monetization’ in policy and ‘monetization’ in practice. 

My view comes from a brief period in the early 00s when i was briefly involved in academia and I had the chance to work with John Nash (yes, that John Nash). What Nash was working on the last ~5 years of his life was searching for the ‘perfect money’ and he was *obsessed* with monetization as it is/was the foundation of financialization. His view was that, policy aside, monetization was a phenomenon that started  in the US in the 1850/1860s as proto-monetization and developed into full monetization - in the US - in the 30s w the end of gold translation and ended globally with the breaking of Breton Woods.

I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again.

It's next to the city's only major public transportation hub, as well as nestled next to the city's largest, and I mean largest by an incredible factor, area of overhead highways which have for decades served as defacto shelter. 

Formerly this area was exclusively ghettoized, subsidized housing, small industrial businesses, abandoned buildings, and industrial level warehousing. Cross cut with interstate rail tracks and overgrown lots. Now this area has waterfront restaurants, upscale boutiques, and comissioned (imo extremely ironic) ""graffiti"" murals on every wall.

This happened over the last 5 years this friend has worked there. And I have witnessed these new, hip stores switch to cashless vending at the same time they've invested their revenue into ""Restrooms For Paying Customers Only"" signs and waterfalls on the inside walls. 

If I'm trying to eat a nice meal with my friend, I certainly don't mind the smaller number of panhandlers outside, or often unkempt homeless eating the muffin they just bought with scrabbled together change. And I'm sure a lot of people don't mind it a lot more than I do.

I'm typically a market forces prevail, capital E economics guy. But it seems to me if you gentrify an area, and let's be real... that's often achieved by leveraging ones wealth and influence over a much poorer opponent, you should have to bare the full, economic cost of that gentrification.

Also people in 'risky' but legal occupations: the classic one in the US is strippers and porn actors, who are routinely denied even personal banking services (i.e. unrelated to their work except as the place their wages go). 

Most of these people also don't necessarily live totally cash in hand, but usually use non-bank or informal financial institutions - classically, they will get paid with a cheque and then go and literally cash it at a business like a convenience store or bodega (this is what the 'cheques cashed' sign is for), but the person or business providing this service takes a cut (which is generally much more than a bank will take; but a bank won't touch some of these customers and others are wary of getting stung by fees if they can't meet minimum deposit limits etc). Some states have maximum fee levels, but some don't; there's more [here](http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2015/0115barr-figart.html).

The main take is that a significant chunk of people, often economically vulnerable people, exist in a very different world to what most economics considers ""normal people"" to be doing, and it's one of the reasons why some otherwise sound policy has problems reaching the very worst off. A rate rise or cut doesn't hit them the way it might a current account holder; regulations to make credit easier to obtain don't, etc etc. - and they are only relatively recently studied because, sadly, economists mostly didn't realise they existed in the modern era for a long time. We mostly come from if not affluent then at least not grindingly poor backgrounds, and it's unthinkable to us to not have a bank account or a chequebook, or (even if we don't personally have major lines of credit open) be unable to access credit at all in any amount except at a payday lender.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding between how Americans and non-Americans view rights.

Rights are not ""provided"" by society or the government.  They are inherent in being a person.  You have a right to free speech - not because the government said so, but because you are a free individual that has the power to speak.

You do NOT have a right to a good or service, with rare exception.  If the government brings a criminal case against you, you have the right to the lawyer because the government is the aggressor.  But if a private citizen does, you don't.

You don't have a right to a bank account.  The bank is under no obligation to open an account for anybody.  They can choose who they want to do business with.  Just like you can choose what bank you want to do business with.

>If the situation is that you don't have a right to a bank account, and there is no drive to change that, then this ruling is absolutely fair, especially if there is no cheap way to maintain basic banking.

The ruling absolutely isn't fair.  The poor choose not to have bank accounts, and as a consequence, choose not to be able to do business with companies that don't take cash.  The cost of the account is irrelevant.

I personally don't carry cash, so I am also choosing not to be able to do business with a cash-only business.  It works both ways.

An extreme example - I choose not to purchase a Ferrari, so I am not allowed to use the Ferrari dealership for oil changes even though I like the quality of their service.  Your argument is that I should be given a basic Ferrari so that I can get oil changes at the Ferrari dealership, because Ferraris are too expensive.

This is just not accurate.  A quick google shows at least a dozen US banks with free, no-minimum-balance checking accounts.  Even ADP, who processes basically every paycheck for everyone that is legally employed in the US (exaggerating but it's not far off) offers a free debit card where your paycheck can be deposited that has no monthly fees and no fees to withdraw cash, etc.

> Also people in 'risky' but legal occupations: the classic one in the US is strippers and porn actors, who are routinely denied even personal banking services (i.e. unrelated to their work except as the place their wages go).

Just false and misleading.  ""Routinely denied?""  Prove it.  People in professions that someone might find morally objectionable like the porn industry are often denied business loans and other business relationships with banks, but that has nothing to do with personal bank accounts.  Most banks don't verify employment to open a personal checking account, and some of them don't even ask in the first place.  For example, [this article](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/banks-porn-stars-your-moneys-not-welcome-flna1C9967366) talks about problems porn stars have had with banks, but it specifically calls out: 

>*""Porn stars and adult entertainment industry insiders do note that the troubles they've experienced are tied to business—not personal—accounts. That may be because personal accounts are opened under their real names, which typically don't raise an eyebrow, while business is done under more well-known pseudonyms, which is when people take notice.""*

Generally all you need for a checking account in the US is a name, an address, a SSN, some money to put in it, and the willingness to be ""on the books"" with your money.  The only factors denying people *access* to checking accounts in the US is a lack of one of the first three.  Everyone else that chooses to operate cash-only are doing exactly that, choosing it.  They all have reasons, but those reasons are usually because they want to break the law.  Waiters and strippers that don't report their tips as income, illegal immigrants that are working under the table, etc.  These are all people too, but it's not fair to say someone is ""unbanked"" and blame the system because they're *choosing* not to use a bank account.

I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again.

>Cash continues to be the most frequently used payment instrument, representing 30 percent of all transactions and 55 percent of transactions under $10. While online shopping continues to grow, 77 percent of payments were made in-person. 1 For these in-person payments, cash accounted for 39 percent of the volume.

>They don’t mandate businesses to accept all credit cards or crypto so why make it mandatory to accept cash.
 
Credit cards require credit. They are also serviced by private companies that make money from them. Requiring a credit card for purchase is requiring people to be of a certain standard set by a private company. Cyrpto isn't recognized by the government as a formal currency. Cash is the base thing of monetary value that is guaranteed by the federal government. Other things of value are not, but are based on recognized value by a third party. I guess gold could be used, but there's a reason why cash is fiat currency and why people are not paid in gold. 
 
I don't think companies should be forced by law to use a specific payment method. However, unless there is a more ubiquitous method of financial transaction that does not rely on a third party's ""judgement"" of your creditworthiness or to hold your money at your expense, what else is there?
 
I can see compromises for specific situations. In Amsterdam, they have a general gun ban. However, stores that are robbed at a high frequency allow storeowners to carry handguns while waiving the waiting period, gun club membership, and other red tape.
 
I don't disagree with the concept of it. I disagree with where it could lead; an overall adoption of cashless without proper regulations and systems put in place to mediate the change. The major roadblock in that is that there is no government option for banking services anymore. We would all literally be forced to use a bank. We're not forced now. I can get a paycheck and take it to a check cashing place. Pay all of my bills in money orders. Live a life with out ever needing a plastic card tied to a corporation. That ends with 100% cashless. It wouldn't even take that many companies to switch for a vast majority of daily necessities to become out of reach.

Discounting? Very simple way of handling it and making it public. Businesses give discounts all the time if you have cash. You can also add hurdles depending on your type of business such as have one line for people paying in cash and all other registers/terminals only take card. Institute rewards programs which reward people for using cards, etc. By wildly broadcasting a policy of supporting cashlessness, you still reap many of the benefits of going cashless though at a reduced level. 

In any case, the businesses that are going to want to make the switch to cashless are those whose primary clientele are cashless themselves already. That's why Sweetgreen wanted to go cashless and not your local bodega. When Sweetgreen originally decided to implement its cashless policy, less than 10% of transactions it did were in cash in the first place. I'd also wager a guess that those holdouts probably weren't part of the underbanked population.

They don't.  For example, the first one on the first list from the first google result is the Capital One 360 account, and it has no fees and no minimums at all that I can see.  It is an online account, but it comes with a free book of checks as well, apparently.  Which brings us to-

> It doesn't matter if they exist if you can't afford internet service and the closest branch is a hundred miles away.

Free Wi-Fi exists in every Starbucks and McDonalds and millions of other establishments.  Free internet and computers to access it exist in every public library.  The federal and many state governments give free smartphones with data plans to people from low income households who can't afford their own.  Lack of internet access is a problem, but it's not the problem causing people to be unbanked.

The FDIC report you're referencing even specifically addresses the reasons those 7% don't have bank accounts on page 4 of the [executive summary PDF](https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2017/2017execsumm.pdf), so I guess we can put this to bed right now, can't we?

>* _More than half (52.7 percent) of unbanked households cited “Do not have enough money to keep in an account” as a reason for not having an account, the most commonly cited reason. This reason was also the most commonly cited main reason for not having an account (34.0 percent)._
* _Almost one-third (30.2 percent) of unbanked households cited “Don’t trust banks” as a reason for not having an account, the second-most commonly cited reason. This reason was also the second-most commonly cited main reason (12.6 percent)._
* _As in previous years, higher proportions of unbanked households that previously had an account cited “Bank account fees are too high” (29.9 percent) or “Bank account fees are unpredictable” (24.9 percent) in 2017, compared with unbanked households that never had an account (21.1 and 17.0 percent, respectively)._
* _Higher proportions of unbanked households that were not at all likely or not very likely to open a bank account in the next 12 months cited “Don’t trust banks” (36.2 and 31.5 percent, respectively) in 2017, compared with unbanked households that were somewhat likely or very likely to open a bank account in the next 12 months (24.7 and 21.0 percent, respectively)._

ffnyk5n,t1_ffncqzk,2020-01-26 20:58:16,Economics,"How is ethereum centralized? 

I would say it is decentralized from the bottom up. First, people have the option to accept or not accept updates rolled out by the developers. Failure to update the nodes by a significant number of people results in a hard fork. We saw this happen with ethereum classic. 

Second, the true area of decentralization is decentralization of computation, not protocol. In that area, ethereum rocks. As long as you have three mining pools that each have less than 51% of the network computation, you are safe from 51% attacks. However, ethereum is moving to proof of stake soon, and that means that the decentralization of the network's computation will be replaced with the distribution of the token.
Look at this article: https://consensys.net/research/measuring-blockchain-decentralization/ 

So, now let's look at distribution of the token: https://www.clovr.com/page/crypto-whales/
If eth moved to proof of stake, and a single individual held 51% of the token, then yes, Ethereum would be a centralized chain at that point. But that is not the case. In our case, we see under 2% of ETH is held by the richest account, which probably is an exchange wallet with thousands of users that own that money together. 

So no, you are categorically wrong on every single level to call ethereum centralized. It is a decentralized system from the bottom up with checks and balances that ensure that no single actor can control the currencies monetary policy, computation, or design. Not even the creator of ethereum (vitalik) can bend ethereum to his bidding without the permission of the people.",,,1,0,reddit1

Some of these big cities might offer some of the best  and high paying work/jobs in the country if a person is qualified but these metropolises are turning into near dystopians and the divide and resentment between the have and have nots is quite disturbing to hear about.

Just some personal experience I’m more left of center at times with my views butI  live in a rural part of Virginia and here it’s Low cost of living Walmart’s/Dollar General vibe. I’m basically living near the poverty line even with a 40hr 9h job but luckily in a good situation living in newly built housing with a disabled sibling and have the personal amenities we need and want.

I’ve thought about moving and getting training for something better but I couldn’t imagine moving to a large city even with greater opportunities the dystopianism that cities are turning into is frightening. The divide and resentment between poor and rich is frightening.

I might not have the greatest life or traveling the world/country eating good food or driving a nice car but I’m comfortable where I’m at. Though I wish things were better for the lower economic half of the country I really do. People need to move away from cities and go to LCOL areas, we need more opportunities in these LCOL areas.

And cash is less of a hassle at the end of a shift too. Sure it takes like MAX five minutes to count up a till/float. And if your CC payments balance with your payments it takes basically zero times. But that's only IF your CC payments balance.

The worst part of any night was if the CC balance was off. This meant searching through sometimes hundreds of transactions/receipts to find the one transaction that was accidentally off by cents, or closed to the wrong till, or someone pulled their card early and wound up accidentally charged twice.

Really doubtful that businesses can offer a compromise? A business is a business.

Do you think that there should be zero compromise on the business side, and just force consumers, the reason *why* there is a store, to conform?

We have modern cash registers that handle counting and verification. No. You're making up imaginary costs.

jbrxvpe,t3_11o5bgv,2023-03-11 06:10:05,Economics,"I’d like to share a personal anecdote involving the topic: 

I work in sales and I’d say I’ve been quite successful by most standards. 

Several years ago I was recruited and relocated for a job, six months into the new job I started feeling quite ill; foggy headed, falling asleep at work, unfocused, irritable… just generally unwell.

My performance suffered and I started missing my quotas. My boss met with me to figure out what was going wrong. He had been very impressed with my CV and initial performance, but now he had to document that I was not meeting expectations and would be receiving a formal warning. I let him know that I was feeling very unwell and had been seeing multiple doctors to try to figure out what was wrong with me. 

I could immediately tell that was probably the worst thing I could have told him. Everybody in management was avoiding me and about a week later I was summoned to a meeting with the HR director and was placed on some kind of “action plan”. If I didn’t hit my next quota, they would be terminating my employment. I asked if my boss had told him about how I had been feeling unwell and that I believed that is why my performance was subpar. He basically asked what my diagnosis was and told me that I would need to provide medical documentation for any of it to be relevant. I explained that there was no positive diagnosis yet and I was waiting on appointments with various specialists.

Three weeks later, I was terminated.

Two months after that, I finally got my medical diagnosis, basically I had a benign hormone-producing brain tumor which could be treated with various medications and hormone therapy. I felt back to my old self, and I took the same type of job with a competing company.

I filed a disability discrimination complaint and there was an “investigation”. Like most complaints, no determination was made and I was given a “right to sue”. I contacted attorneys about filing a lawsuit. I was told by most of the attorneys that my damages were too small for them to want my case because I found a *better* paying job so soon after my termination. I was also told that the way I filed my complaint made the case more complicated and less likely to succeed. 


If I could “do it over” I would get an employment lawyer involved much sooner and not be so open with my employer. Or, just move on and not bother with filing a complaint.

I have been a union officer at my firm for the better part of 8 years (recently quit because I’m getting a lot of heat for dumb things like how I drafted emails, not what I said). I hear a LOT about bad managers and have to explain what is and isn’t inappropriate for a manager to do or demand of employees.

I dealt with bullying, ableism, and gender discrimination from a narcissistic boss for 7 years and I’m still dealing with it. Highlights include telling me that being followed by men was “part of the job,” not putting a stop to ableist jokes during meetings (a coworker gave me a necklace with a Xanax pendant and her running joke was “call HR, she’s crazy” and would hand people the phone), guilt tripping me for taking leave or always asking personal questions about why I needed it (so I never took it), telling me I couldn’t joke with clients, nitpicking my personality, clothing, mannerisms, and facial expressions, telling me no one liked me, while simultaneously pretending she was my friend. During the pandemic, when I was so isolated I was struggling to eat, she would berate me for poor performance. I went from being in the top 10% of the firm to sitting in front of my laptop for 16 hours a day, trying not to have a panic attack, completely *unable* to work.

I never reported any of it because I was already a social outcast at work and didn’t want to make it worse. When we had to go back to the office after COVID, I needed a service dog. Basically everything they did was illegal, including requiring me to carry liability insurance for him and telling me they would fire me if he distracted anyone. The real issue was that they didn’t understand why suddenly I needed an additional accommodation after I worked there for 9 years without one. I had to explain that my PTSD had gotten substantially worse due partly to the pandemic, but also due to the behavior of this boss. They didn’t believe any of it anyway, but my dog comes to work… probably because they were doing the same thing Hobby Lobby did to an employee with a service dog (“you can’t bring him because someone might trip over him or he might break something”) and is getting sued by the EEOC. I’m sure their lawyer was like “yeah y’all have to accommodate her unless there’s a problem.” They even asked if he was likely to start barking/alert if a client was “yelling in [my] office,” because evidently they’re more concerned about someone complaining that he barked than me being able to escape a situation that would trigger a panic attack. My response was to point out that it *sounded like* they wanted me to tolerate a hostile workplace.

Anyway, I’ve had him for 6 months now, not a single problem—except that I feel safe at work, and started reporting the abusive behavior. So far, HR has said everything was fine, but I think they’re starting to see what I’m talking about (making friends with subordinates to get them to work harder, but taking it personal when we don’t go to her parties and retaliating; throwing around her power, micromanaging people who imply she’s racist/ableist, and in my case, bringing up one private complaint vs. getting open support from 5-6 people to prove I am “unprofessional”).

jbtjye1,t1_jbswrbg,2023-03-11 16:34:08,Economics,"It's not a simple binary.

Society needs to have a sustainable rule set backed up by a functioning system of redress. No system will likely ever be perfect, but the idea is to minimize the fuck ups and to minimize the amount of harm fuck ups create while also maximizing the effectiveness of the system. If a system consistently leans too far in favor of one group over another, then even if in theory everyone is equal under the law, in practice you create two classes of citizens.

Even without the assistance of the courts and legal structure, employers have a lot of advantages over employees. Not only can they generally fire them on a whim, but firing an employee is basically always a much bigger burden on the employee than the employer. Losing a single employee is rarely devastating to a company that's otherwise in good health, but losing a job can turn an employee's life upside down. Employers generally also have more resources at their disposal to litigate than individual employees. Interactions between you and your company also typically happen in environments your company controls, which puts them in a position to control what, if any, evidence is available, since they can very easily prevent evidence against them from getting to court.

So then if the courts and the law are set up so that benefit of the doubt is by default on the side of employers, then you can create an almost insurmountable barrier to justice for wronged employees. You're preventing employers from being punished, but you're ensuring that employees get punished. Someone is getting punished no matter what.
