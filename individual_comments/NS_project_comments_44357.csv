Spring break just ended a few days ago.  We don’t even know a fraction of the impact caused by the people who partied on spring break in mass public groups and then came home to their parents and grandparents.  Everyday, confirmed cases are rising exponentially in the US, and the deaths are following behind.

Italy currently has one of the strictest lockdowns and receiving the most aid(e?) of any country, among some of the worlds best health care systems (so I’ve heard), and deaths are coming in at 800 per night as of tonight.

Yet back here in America, as we see this going on in Italy and around the world, we continue to have pizza delivery drivers working, car salesman, Hobby Lobby, and pardon my French, fuck-all-else that shouldn’t be open.  Our leaders are not taking this seriously.

Please, come to my house, weld my door shut and tell me not to come out until July.  I will not complain because I will likely still be alive when it’s all over.  But because my state still hasn’t locked down yet, I’m working at a factory filled with older and senior adults who have “colds,” because who knows what it actually is since we can’t be tested.  It’s hot.  It’s sweaty.  It’s laborious.  We share work spaces, use the same computer, touch the same product as it passes through 6+ different people before being shipped out the door.  And not to be stereotypical, but factory workers aren’t America’s best and brightest.  Take it from me, a 5 time college dropout.  Grown adults who throw paper towels in the toilet to clog it for fun.  People who literally smell like poop because they’re fat and can’t wipe their ass properly (just this one guy).

fl5wbx3,t3_fme38h,2020-03-22 03:23:32,Economics,"Hello. I started a small business awhile back with a passion of mine in a real niche interest group. It suddenly became a force to be reckoned with and swept the industry (no, not coins, I enjoy having healthy profit margins). I was not prepared for this and somehow managed 100h weeks alone for 19 months on top of my part time job.

I was also not prepared for coronavirus or the ways in which it has, and will continue to, fundamentally change every detail of our lives that once were. I saw things start to get some real momentum and knew I definitely couldn't do this alone. 120h/weeks would not be scratching the surface. I can't keep up on email/orders. I have to give myself intermittent reddit breaks for r/coronavirus updates because I can't rest between orders long enough to do anything at length.

That being said:

I've had to hire five package stuffers and two online customer service reps, both of whom are working remotely from home. I hired someone to run post office dropoffs and inventory pickups. He rides his bike and is fit, and I'll know he needs time off if he cannot catch his breath to make the ride. That's when I'll offer to pay him to stay home so he gets better sooner and comes back to me sooner. He's an essential service as far as I'm concerned, and he deserves every penny that people are willing to pay for his superb delivery service, timeliness and skill.

We also took on local delivering - because now apparently we have local clientele which I never knew existed - and my customers are very pleased at the steps we are taking to not only protect our employees, but them also. They are a lot more comfortable spending their money, that's for sure!

I'll be hiring an online media director in the next 36h and those are hardly more than just words to me right now. I will provide them with PPE and check-in to make sure they're healthy. The first round of masks, gloves, sanitizer and vitamins / cough drops just arrived to my two WFH. They are in good spirits. They tell me they eat well and treat themselves well and they look it. Good. Things like this are the reason why I have zero problem paying them what I do.

All of them just lost their jobs because of the virus. I'm paying them hazard pay and will pay them when they get sick so they can come back to me healthy and keep kicking ass. Some just went from too poor to pay electric in full to ""my family is now prepared.""

There is a lot of doom and gloom. A lot are suffering. But PLEASE don't close your mind off to the possibility that maybe things will be alright. I've got over half a dozen families boned by coronavirus now making better money than they were before.

I used to average 20 orders on a busy weekday. I have a pile of shipping labels as thick as a book. This is unreal. I hope to continue to expand and take the necessary measures to protect my employees, because right now, that's the #1 failing of every American company. The American public absolutely loves that a small one man show that has more awareness about customer and employee health than the US government. I've had so many people tell me they were thankful their product was delivered by a person in PPE, inside of an easily-cleaned recyclable vessel, or that they were worried because they didn't know specifically how they'd be handling their product when it came.

I might not be worth billions of dollars, but I'll have healthy, happy and experienced employees used to working in high pressure situations, in an (apparently?) disaster-proof industry. Now I can just pay people to make my money for me.

Adapt. Turn this shit right around. Take your beatings and get right back up. Restaurant closed? Deliver. Find that niche. Fix that logistical and supply chain issue that makes 10 sick people touch your products. Invent machines that have easily interchangeable parts, or near-instant specialty 3D printed parts that turn a bobblehead factory into a respiratory mask and faceshield factory. Use your new experience to consult businesses and governments on disaster preparedness. Find out the part of America who needs you right now. They will reward you mightily.

A local business just offered a bunch of food and hygiene products wicked cheap. They're clearing their shelves to completely change their business, so sure why not? I'll be including it free for my customers who know they will be taken care of with an enriching experience when they buy from us.

I'll be supplying people with free rare goods by healthy people during a pandemic.

We don’t even know a fraction of the impact caused by the people who partied on spring break in mass public groups and then came home to their parents and grandparents.  Everyday, confirmed cases are rising exponentially in the US, and the deaths are following behind.

Italy currently has one of the strictest lockdowns and receiving the most aid(e?) of any country, among some of the worlds best health care systems (so I’ve heard), and deaths are coming in at 800 per night as of tonight.

Yet back here in America, as we see this going on in Italy and around the world, we continue to have pizza delivery drivers working, car salesman, Hobby Lobby, and pardon my French, fuck-all-else that shouldn’t be open.  Our leaders are not taking this seriously.

Please, come to my house, weld my door shut and tell me not to come out until July.  I will not complain because I will likely still be alive when it’s all over.  But because my state still hasn’t locked down yet, I’m working at a factory filled with older and senior adults who have “colds,” because who knows what it actually is since we can’t be tested.  It’s hot.  It’s sweaty.  It’s laborious.  We share work spaces, use the same computer, touch the same product as it passes through 6+ different people before being shipped out the door.  And not to be stereotypical, but factory workers aren’t America’s best and brightest.  Take it from me, a 5 time college dropout.  Grown adults who throw paper towels in the toilet to clog it for fun.  People who literally smell like poop because they’re fat and can’t wipe their ass properly (just this one guy).  But I’m supposed to trust him and others like him to be extra hygienic for us during a pandemic when they can’t even meet average hygiene standards in normal life?

All the stupid people NOT taking this seriously will simply be lucky to be alive.",,,1,0,reddit3

fl4wndh,t1_fl4oqbw,2020-03-21 20:40:03,Economics,"(Sorry for the long ass post. Your comment really resonated with me.)

I feel for you. I was finishing up my masters in the spring of 2008, before the market crash, but during the deflating real estate bubble. After spending the first half of my 20s in school, I graduated into instant unemployment. It was scary, and I was powerless. Even with a B.A. in Journalism & Mass Communications, with minors in French and English, and an M.A. in Human Communication, I was not considered for jobs due to “lack of working experience.”  

My favorite professor apologized to me, with tears in his eyes, about the hard world I was entering after being a successful 4.0 “star” student. Graduating at the top of my class meant shit in the real world, as I would find out. 

After two years of fruitless job hunting and depleted savings and self-worth–while living in near poverty on meager savings–I moved back home, broke. As a last resort to get loan creditors off my back, I took some graphic design classes from a community college (CC). I actually loved the courses, faculty and peers enough that I ended up with an A.A.S. in New Media. 

I was instantly able to find work at a prestigious agency in Aspen. I even discovered an artistic side that I never knew was there. I learned the basics of design, animation, typography, color theory, print production, and digital media creation. By coupling the skills I learned at the CC with my previous degrees, my career took off. 

I worked in Aspen with elite clients for five years. I started teaching at the same CC where I got my A.A.S, and I even started two lucrative businesses that cater to the Aspen/Vail region. 

If I had graduated into a good economy, then I would never have learned these skills or fully known what I’m capable of doing. I may have ended up miserable at some corporate job. Going through hell made me stronger and forced me to learn practical yet vital skills. It also made me an entrepreneur. 

I am frightened now because this feels familiar to 2008 yet worse. But if it tanks my businesses, then so be it. I will then use this time to reinvent myself once again. But I have the benefit of being older and already surviving the Great Recession, so I know how this goes. That’s why I feel for you and your plight. 

I guess the bottom line is for you to hang in there! If you can’t find employment and have loans, then don’t be above going to a community college to defer them and buy yourself some time. You may pick up real-life skills that bolster your higher degree. Taking classes at a CC is also a great way to network professionally and socially. You have to be scrappy and almost hustle your way into something useful. 

The fire of uncertainty is burning brightly right now, but you can use it to forge yourself new skills or abilities that will help you when we come out on the other side. Don’t lose hope or take this as a hit to your self-esteem. One way or another, we will emerge from this. You MUST stay healthy and secure in the meantime. I hope you find a great job, but if you can’t, then find ways to make yourself even more marketable to employers. It’s not fair that this year’s class has to go through this, but the survivors who come out stronger will be the ones who continue to evolve, adapt and learn while remaining flexible about their professional futures. 

Sorry for the rant. I wanted to share my story with you. 

❤️❤️❤️❤️

P.S. I did at least have a graduation ceremony, but it was gloomy as fuck because everyone knew the economic conditions we were facing. Sorry, you can’t have a ceremony. When times are better, you need to have a makeup ceremony to celebrate the fuck out of your achievements! Congrats on all of your hard work.",jorocall,t2_kd6ru,23,0,reddit3

China ruined the initial handling of this crisis. They muzzled the whistleblower, suppressed numbers, etc. But later they enacted overwhelming action. Major mandatory quarantine. Building new historians in literal days. Testing every body whether by molecular assay or temperature. They largely stopped the pandemic in just under two months. 

Here in the US, we have no coordinated effort to stop this thing. Local and state governments are acting piecemeal to try to stop it. But the federal government run by the Trump administration has really fucked up this handling. 

So two months is best case with mandatory lockdowns and government mandated widespread testing (and even worse if you don’t believe the official government stance, the virus might still be spreading in China) 

We are about a week into any kind of semi-coordinated action.  We are not in the best case scenario, which would land us in mid-May. June or July seems like a likely timeline for this to keep playing on for.",frausting,t2_c9yt0,-1,0,reddit3

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

fl5ybts,t1_fl5dtgo,2020-03-22 03:49:20,Economics,"This is different, this is going to fuck with all the models. 

Look, let's break this down to the basics:


If your econ prof asked you to create a model that would guarantee hyperinflation most business students would come up with pretty much the same answer: print money and give it away, preferably to people who aren't working.


For the next 2-3 months that essentially what's going to happen. Government's all over the world are opening the taps, essentially paying people to stay home and not participate in the economy. They're right to do it, but you can't do it without paying a price. 


This is coupled with a general slowdown (aka recession) as the inevitable outcome of this year. Most countries are going to lose 2-3 months of 30-50% of their GDP to this. In the states, that's at least 3-5 trillion.This isn't 'free', that productivity is lost and it's never coming back. Any business that sells a service is in essence selling time. That time is gone, never to return. Let me be blunt: this year the world is going to lose at least 10 trillion in GDP, possible closer to 20 trillion. That loss isn't just a balance sheet loss, it's a loss of huge swathes of manufactured goods, like automotive and electronics. 


So in a couple of months this is what we're facing: Certain industries that comprise 20+% of GDP being completely devastated, millions temporarily laid off and an economy that has been put into a coma for a fiscal quarter that they're now going to try to gently resuscitate. 


All the while the government is pumping money in to the economy at a prodigious rate, whether it's borrowed or printed in this case doesn't really matter, what matters is the fiat, the total GDP that determines the value is now completely out of whack.  


So here's a likely situation in July, the economy has being operating at about 30-50% normal load, only essential services have allowed to operate in person. Everyone else makes do remotely, but no roads are being fixed, no cars are being made, no super bowl, no blockbusters theatre releases, no houses built. 


But guess what? Everyone's on UI, so everyone's got some $$ in their pocket and they've not been spending at nearly the same rate, no March break, no fancy spa days for Mr. and Mrs. America. Heck, if mortgage/rent is waived for a couple of months they may even come out slightly ahead (but don't tell anyone)


So let's assume that it isn't a gradual return to normalcy, let's assume that one day the entire nation is under quarantine and the next we're able to go back to work. 


Problem is, many businesses will not have survived, maybe they went bankrupt, or likely their industry, like tourism, is going to take the double hit of being a luxury in an uncertain world and fucking dangerous in a corona world. That's 12% of the economy in real trouble. Next up is local retail, only hanging on by a thread before this, this is going to be a death knell for 1000's of small businesses, next is space rental, I mean once you've learned how to work from home why are you going to rent office space? Then restaurants, then movie theatres, then big box stores etc. etc. 


These are billion dollar industries I've just listed. So what happens next: mass layoffs, layoffs that aren't temporary, but are indicative of a new world order. What happens with mass layoffs? Consumer confidence takes another hit. Now luxury items are in trouble, R&D is paused as companies reassess. Investment cools as people flee to safer pastures. More layoffs as the ancillary businesses have to contract to meet the lower market demands. 


Fast forward to Christmas 2020, what cool toy are you going to get for under the tree? The new PS5? Well because of the virus supplies are extremely limited, so prices have skyrocketed, same for anything from hairdryers to furniture to vehicles, they're just not being made anymore, so the rules of supply and demand take over. Going to a department store in August is a grim affair of empty shelves with cheerful signs that say 'coming soon!'. 


Now you're the government, you've been borrowing like it's going out of style to pay for a recovery that is greater than 50% of your normal annual spend, you got an economy that is shrinking and a large group of taxpayers that haven't paid taxes for 3 months, in fact the opposite. So now we've hit a tipping point, no fiscal debt hawk has a shot of tempering the spending this year, the debt must be serviced, but the government's bankroll is seriously shrinking. What do you do? The only thing you can, devalue the dollar.


So, IMO we're looking in 3 months at a glorious combination of shortages of key goods, coupled with high unemployment and a government spending like a drunken sailor at a strip club. If that's not the perfect recipe for hyperinflation I don't know what is.

I mean, obviously I’m not an economic expert, but I don’t really understand why there’s all this fear about the economy ceasing to exist. An incredibly large faction of the economy is based on social activity. Social activity is being highly discouraged/banned at the moment. Once this passes, the demand for social activity will return.

I work in event staffing and marketing. My boss has strongly considered liquidating the company. But I don’t fully see why such a drastic choice. Sure, there’s almost no work right now.

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

- What is the transmission % per person known as the R0 (R -Naught). This is how many people do you infect who have never been exposed to the virus. They are trying to figure that out now. Is it 1.5 people or as high as 3. Once that is known you can figure out the next math problem.
- How many people in the US or any country need to be immune and recovered so that the virus only transmits at a 1-1 ratio. For example- if they figure out that we need to be at 180,000,000, which is roughly half of the US population, at that point we are at the tipping point where we can now see a large group being able to move about freely and go back to normal work. Any infections that come up they can test and isolate them to control the virus. 

We already have a lot of people infected, the guess is 10x - 50x what we have confirmed through testing. That number will exponentially double every 3-4 days.

Good [SCMP article](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3074679/coronavirus-how-epidemic-could-hurt-chinas-us-dollar-debt) on China's dollar debt. On the current status of the offshore dollar shortage - just look at dollar cross-currency basis swaps across the EMs. It's all anyone in these spheres have been talking about. The Fed, to it's credit, has acted quick and rolled out currency swap lines to many of these countries central banks.

[OMFIF](https://www.omfif.org/2020/03/fed-should-bring-back-dollar-swap-lines/) has a good piece covering the specifics. Roughly 40% of Chinese businesses can't survive a month without dollar liquidity. The biggest nonfinancial borrowers are already facing severe real economy pressures - the airlines and hugely levered property developers especially.

Now, China has massive Treasury reserves. But here is the rub; if the PBoC liquidates these to cover it's dollar problem, it will render the Fed's current round of  bond-buying broadly ineffective.

I have always resisted only doing web development to keep my skills diversified. Up here in the Colorado Rockies, there are very few people who specialize in the web development that I can offer. It’s lucrative, but what happens when something interrupts normalcy?

I don’t know you, obviously, but if AI doesn’t sound appealing, then I would suggest leaning into a creative talent that also produces good content. Generalized creativity is one of the last bastions of AI development, so if you have those such skills and talents, then there’s much you can do into the foreseeable future. 

For example, so many fucking people think they are graphic designers because they watched a couple of videos and have photoshop. And sadly, stupid clients hire them, which usually leads to disaster for idiot clients. 

When I offer my services, my education, and a robust creative portfolio, back me up. I tend to get higher quality clients who appreciate well-thought design and are willing to pay for it. 

So my point here is that if you have a creative talent or skill, you may want to invest some time and attention in becoming a master of it. Strong creative ability will help you stand out and can also insulate from AI encroachment...for now. It's also great for digital marketing and social media. ;)

Speaking of gyms, I got fucking ripped after the 2008 meltdown. I suddenly had time on my hands and extreme frustration, which I worked out. An older friend even told me that all dudes in their 20s need are food and a gym membership. If you can afford to hang onto a gym membership, it is so very much worth it. Sounds like you work at a gym? Awesome. 

I hope I don’t come across as some know it all. I’ve honestly been there, and since, I have counseled many of my students. I felt like I was dealt an unfair setback at 24, so I have taken a particular interest in trying to help others navigate these challenges. 

We are indeed in unprecedented, crazy times! I was low key freaking out in January when I first learned of the mysterious virus in Wuhan. I’m kind of a germaphobe at heart, so I pay special attention. 

I can’t yet say how my business is affected by this pandemic. I have a vast ($1b) client in the travel business who is pausing everything. I have another client in Aspen who thinks hot tea and sunshine will cure it, so she hasn’t reigned in spending. Not to mention there’s pretty widespread community transmission up there...yikes. 

If you have any interest, it sounds like you have some skills that I’m always looking to hire. I can’t make promises, but I am pretty sure I could at least throw a couple of projects your way for collaboration. I guess a lot depends on the apocalypse right now. :p

Throw me a PM if interested, and we can go from there! Otherwise, hang in there, because this too shall pass. :)",jorocall,t2_kd6ru,5,0,reddit3

I saw that same report. They based their report on a key assumption that China's overall death count of 3,200 they reported is trustworthy. They  then took the average mortality rates between France, S. Korea, Italy, etc. and applied that % to China's reported death count, hence extrapolating the total infection count to 700,000.

IMO this is pretty flawed logic but it was certainly worth doing. To be clear, I think 700,000 is actually on the LOW side, because I think there were way, WAY more deaths in China than 3,200.",jimmyayo,t2_4y2os,1,0,reddit3

The immunity won’t last forever so probably it’ll last for a few months after infection, meaning you’re very unlikely to get this thing twice in a season. 

This virus isn’t all that unique, it’s basically what the regular flu would be if we didn’t have herd immunity and vaccines for that. This thing is spreading like crazy because we don’t have any immunity yet and it’s been a very nasty one for the elderly/patients with preexisting heard and lung conditions. 

I hate to say this because many trolls say it to downplay the seriousness of covid-19 (not at all my intentions) but for the vast majority of healthy individuals under the age of 60, this virus won’t be much worse than the regular flu. The regular flu is awful though and this virus will lay you out for 2-3 awful weeks but you likely will fully recover if you stay hydrated and treat symptoms with OTC medication. 

The big issue is that it requires about 25 days of hospitalization in the ICU on a ventilator for those who develop complications and we simply don’t have enough ventilators. Normally patients stay on a ventilator for 4-5 days so our stock of ventilators is built around that demand. This virus needs 5x the length of treatment and if people exceed current capacity then you’ll see mass deaths simply because they couldn’t access ventilators.",,,3,0,reddit3

Weeelllll... they actually do. The amount of U.S. dollars on the books is really only limited by what the Fed wants to issue. That's how these recent stimuli have worked -- they put money into the economy by paying/loaning it to businesses/banks/whoever. Where did that money actually come from? Nowhere. It's basically just saying to them ""You have $XXX more dollars now."" There's not some giant ledger or stash of money it's being deducted from.

Of course, you don't want to devalue your currency, but the value in the American economy hasn't *actually* decreased. Goods and services are still worth what they were worth before social distancing, it's just the exchange of them that's been locked up. But it's like cutting off the blood flow to organs -- you've still got organs at this point, but they won't last long without an infusion. The government needs to get the blood pumping now before big parts of the economy start dying -- if that means writing everyone checks until goods and services can flow on their own again, that needs to happen, with however much and for however long it takes.

Worst case scenario, assuming a 70% infection rate and hospitals all over the world are overwhelmed and unable to deal with all the critical cases would leave us with around a billion dead. There are a lot of reasons to believe that number should be lower, but we don’t have the data to prove it right now.

For example, if we tested more people then we might realize there are a ton of infected people with mild symptoms, and that would push the death rate down. There’s also a possibility that treatments may be found that could reduce the severity of symptoms (there are some that have shown promise). A lot of stuff could change.

But immediate death isn’t the only concern. COVID-19 is causing lung lesions in some patients. It’s also attacking enzymes in the liver and is associated with liver damage.

There were also early reports of heart damage being reported in Iran a while back and I’m starting to see reports that European and American doctors are also seeing it. Unlike the lung and liver damage, I’m not aware of any published papers that support it. I desperately hope this one is incorrect.

But we could be left with hundreds of millions of people who survive the virus only to need organ transplants. We obviously don’t have enough organs or surgeons to handle that.

The lasting impact of this thing could be close to the Black Death. And if it really gets out of hand then it will come back next year but will be a regular annual illness, like the cold and flu.

This needs to be wiped out now and we need to become more conscious of infectious disease like they have in a number of Asian countries.

B.) Liquidity is the ability to sell something (thing no one wanting to buy your obscure price of furniture). So less people wanting to buy corporate stock. Consumption is people going out and buying stuff. So as OP says people buying less stuff at stores.

C.) Because people are spending less and as a result businesses can't pay their ""bills"" they are less reliable borrowers. So when they go to the bank the bank wants to charge them more to borrow money. (Think a person with bad credit taking out a credit card getting a higher interest rate).

Edit: forgot to add currency can be traded like stocks and loses and gains value. I won't get into swaps, but an ELI5, currency value goes up and down compared to other countries. Countries can make other countries currency less valuable. So if the federal reserve gives ""money"" to businesses and other countries make it less valuable it is a net zero effect.

>This financial crash isnt due to the economic policies of the last 5 to 10 years. Its due to supply chain logistics messing up cash flows and tight margins for what businesses thrive on due to cheap debt which allows for economic growth.

You're right. This financial crash is due to 80 million americans stopping working to slow the spread of Coronavirus.

The fallout from this being as bad as it's going to be is a direct result of the financial policies of this administration, and the lack of a social safety net for Americans during the 2008 financial crisis.

>Capitalism is currently the only path leading towards economic prosperity. Not socialism if that were the case, the richest countries would be primarily socialist not capitalist with some socialist sprinkled on it.

There is a new social safety net coming in. $1000+ every month for each American over 18 for at least a month or 2. The administration encouraged cheap debt and lower govt intervention for expansion of the economy. Until the crash kept nearly all regulations placed under Obama such as the reserve requirement. The fallout from this will be bad but it is not due to the economic policies of the administration. It is due to tight margins and disruption of cash flows.

I agree with some socialist aspects i.e. eeucation up to 18 and then after that free education for select degrees. I disagree with healthcare being paid through taxes, but it should be fixed. I disagree wjth increasing govt control in any part of citizens' lives.

Also extreme wealth leads to more innovation than stifle it. A person with $5k extra is less likely to invest in a new technology for lets say batteries than a person with an extra $1 billion. 100 people with an extra $5k will use the money for goods and services primarily instead of investinng it. Rich people dont have their money under a mattress - their money is in shares. This is an economics subreddit. This shouldnt be new..

Almost as if he became a millionaire through his book. Bought a new house and then switched his tune. In 4 years even with inflation, millionaires didnt become that common. In 2016, there were 10 million millionaires while in 2020 there were 18.6 million, according to Credit Suisse.

Using napkin maths 10 x 1.02^ 4 = 10.8 million would be a direct result of inflation

Theres a 8 million difference or about 40% showing that Americans have got much richer on average in the last 4 years due to the stock market, rising house prices and this being the easiest time to start a business.

fl7fvti,t1_fl5nsbk,2020-03-22 18:14:45,Economics,"Yes, if dollars dry up that means that foreign corporations and (more dangerously) banks will go belly up. Whole economies will flatline. If the Chinese economies experiences a hard landing, capital will flee the country. The yuan will devalue - making Chinese goods *even cheaper*. And the big state owned enterprises will produce *even* more, to make up for the economic traction with increased production. In many ways, this will add huge deflationary pressure, starting with manufactured goods but spreading from there. This would happen in an environment where cratering oil prices (thence general commodity prices) are already a powerful deflationary pressure.

So deflation is very, very bad. I think modern economics has done a disservice to people by emphasizing inflation so much. It's because modern economics was really founded in a period of chronic inflation (the 1970s).

But deflation is the thing which caused the Great Depression. As everything gets cheaper, it becomes rational to sit on your money and wait for when stuff is cheaper to buy or invest in it. This includes labor (wages). You then get a nasty feedback loop, as plummeting demand makes stuff even cheaper. So that rational point you're waiting for to buy or invest in the economy never comes. This sort of thing is very hard to beat once the systemic logic sets in. That's part of why the Depression lasted so long. Once your in the shit - you're in it. If inflation is like a hysterical fever-induced delirium, then deflation is like a coma. Capitalism cannot work with it.

Yes, they're very different, but if you're progressive and you care about progressive issues, those two are not exactly worlds apart! Both are beholden to capital. So a lot of progressive might have stayed home.

It's also hard for young people to even get to the polls. Voter suppression includes long lines at urban polling places and inconvenient hours for a generation that often works two jobs just to get by. Not to mention actual racist voter suppression in places like Georgia.

And you've probably even got accelerationists who feel that the total collapse of capitalism will do more eventual good than a reactionary like Hillary or Biden. Just count the boomerremover hashtags to see what's up.

Millennials are also a smaller generation so it's harder for them to matter in polls. Time is a two-edged sword with naturalization on the one side and death on the other.

Finally, young votes are often urban votes and electoralism devalues those votes. If you're young and hip and progress living in NYC, you could vote in the general but your vote almost certainly doesn't matter since NY will go blue almost certainly. Stats on youth voter turnout should focus on purple states. Young people aren't dummies, they're not going to skip work for a pointless vote.

I respect that that may have been your experience up to now, especially in meat-space...but honestly, on reddit and other social media, find me even 5 comments, which are saying something close to what I'm saying (and most of those will be downvoted)...but I could inundate the reply box to you with an inexhaustible list of links to comments stating these medical facts and repeating them ad nauseam in the most know-it-all language possible, like there's some contest I'm not aware of right now to be featured on /r/iamverysmart

>In my mind, we have to have a little trust that the experts in charge of this, world-wide, have considered the ""right balance"" 

So first of all, let's be abundantly clear, as if I haven't already been, that I am not denying or arguing with any of the facts as presented and prescribed by the medical authorities. I dont deny or try to diminish the seriousness of this pandemic and I'm totally accepting of their assertions and best projections of how many deaths there could be and how overwhelmed hospitals might be if we dont act as quickly and thoroughly to quarantine ourselves as they are saying.  I understand the virulence of this disease as compared with other viruses like the flu, and I am pretty good about conceptualizing exponential growth (R2.3 becomes massively bigger than R1.2).

But that said: **there are no authorities considering the right balance**. There are medical authorities, but they aren't experts in economics, political economy, sociology, and they probably aren't yet even considering the psychology of the situation; and so the unintended consequences that their pronouncements might have are not being considered.

Economists aren't medical professionals, and there's just not a lot of cross-disciplinary talk going on yet between them and the medical professionals yet anyway. They understandably are going to take a backseat right now to what epidemiologists and governments are telling us to do right now.

Politicians and government leaders are, at best, totally unqualified in both fields, and at worst complete morons. In either case, they have the wrong set of incentives to be rational and look out for a right balance. Their rhetoric to the contrary is hollow and not credible.

You're watching too many movies if you think that there are central authorities who can and are in positions to really know what's going on broadly and holistically.  That's fantasy, fiction. We want it to be true because we want to feel like there's someone out there in control of things, who can fix things if we just listen...but reality is not that simple.

Only trust authority very narrowly.  Most of the authorities are careful to advise and make claims narrowly anyhow...I would be skeptical of anyone's claims otherwise, and most of the popular over-reaction to this crisis comes in the form of people applying the words of the authorities more broadly than was intended.",kwanijml,t2_8bujy,2,0,reddit3

The problem is politics. The ultra-polarized US political sphere has devolved into bickering over whether saying the ""Chinese Virus"" is racist. 40% of Republicans believe that COVID came from a Chinese bioweapons lab. FOX pundits are demanding reparations from the CCP. The American President is a culture warrior above all else, with an upcoming, fiercely contested election. Remember - in 2008, the GOP rebelled en masse against the TARP bailout. It was carried by the Democrats.

There is not enough financial literacy amongst the American public to distinguish between a liquid asset swap and forking over free cash for nothing. At this moment of all moments, there would be howls of ""we're bailing out the Chinese! Who started this whole mess!"" Trump has already threatened to fire Powell in the last two weeks. He wouldn't stay for long if he made that call.

On it's part, the CCP has responded with heightened belligerence and nationalism. It has expelled American journalists, ratcheted up disinformation, and it's diplomats have become increasingly aggressive. It is not helping things.

Jay Powell should do the right thing. Don't submit the line proposal to Pompeo - there is no explicit legal clause requiring him to do so. He has expansive 13(3) emergency powers. Call up Yi Gang.

Yes, but sometimes we can help the market along when it's having trouble. We have many ways of doing this.

>Ron Paul was not wrong, proven by the fact that he called the 2008 housing crisis based on this theory.

He also predicted recessions every other time the Fed cut interest rates. He, Murphy, Schiff, all those guys predict recessions all the time. They tell people to buy gold all the time. A broken clock can be right. 

Recessions are not caused by the Fed. The 1929 crash was, but do you know what we did? We *learned*. Austrians always act like nobody learns anything. Economics changes all the time with new information. That's a good thing. All good science changes with new evidence.

>What we are now seeing is American companies can't last a month, this is another consequence of keeping interest rates down near 0. It incentives holding as little cash as possible because doing so is actually LOSING you money. Why not? You can borrow the money for practically free anyways. Until you can't....

Exactly. The Fed can't do much during this crisis. We need fiscal policy as well to get out of it. Once we're opening back up, low interest rates encourage investment. When things start moving back up, you raise interest rates back near market levels. You do not want to live in a world where we did nothing in 2008. Companies couldn't even make payroll before TARP.

There is a reason Austrian Economics is on the fringe. There isn't much empirical evidence to support it. The days of ""schools"" are over. The vast majority of economists are a mix of neoclassical, Keynesian, monetarist, and Chicago.

Already did account for it. You're just not smart enough to see it, or understand when you read it.

If you think poor people have it rough right now, because it's hard for them to afford ""necessities"" (and usually they can still afford a lot of what you probably consider non-necessary), wait until that UBI (which is not supposed to just keep people hanging on to the bare necessities, but help them thrive), can't buy *anything* but the necessities (because that's the only thing being produced), and those necessities get more expensive and/or lower quality; because *all* production is ultimately supported by all the other goods and services in the economy, and at the very least, the producers of the necessities (the only people working because everyone else is unemployed and trying to stay alive on that UBI) are constantly being hobbled by not having things they want or need, in order to most efficiently and effectively produce the necessities...which include things like:


>Explain the mechanism of how it will kill not to have dressers and desks and lampshades being produced.

Desks and chairs and lampshades and computers and pencils and pens and lightbulbs and acoustic ceiling tiles and pest control services and marketing outlets and carpet and on and on and on...a huge, massive chain of production of things which are too many and varied and complex for you or any central planner to take account of and ensure is still being provided...to the point that if you did account for it all, you would be right back to having nearly everything being produced.

Or we could just be like you and think that trying the old soviet way will magically work this time, and if the producers aren't happy working without desks and lights, or without maintenance on their buildings and rat and spider infestations and without being able to expand their distribution so their costs begin to exceed their income and so they need to be subsidized and eventually nationalized by the government...then they can just go to the gulag, right comrade?

When you have a welfare state...if you want to continue to be able to afford that welfare state without standards of living dropping lower than the poorest were before it: then economic health and growth is nearly the most essential thing in the world. Everything depends upon it. All policies need to be designed with the explicit goal of correcting a market failure only, surgically, so that markets can work better and produce more wealth.",kwanijml,t2_8bujy,1,0,reddit3

Americans wouldn't come at them. Rioters aren't going to tackle a battalion. People have to sleep, eat, etcetera, and they're isolated, no one is going to risk facing the National Guard alone. They'll stay in their houses.",Palmsuger,t2_13uhgq,3,0,reddit3

Why would they be firing on friends and family? They'll be firing on strangers if they do end up firing. Why would the friends and family of the NG attack the NG?

No armed force in history has ever expected desertion, cowardice, paralysing fear among their soldiers. It would be a brand new occurrence that no one has expected, let alone planned for.

In the question of if the Nazis could go the moon. It's not a question that needs to be asked because it's not a realistic prospect and would never happen. If you need to cover the entire country, you're going to have the NG, regulars, police, etcetera.

Bonus Army, My Lai, etc. Also, they don't need to mass murder civilians to end rioting. They do have non-lethal options you realise? Also, you'd be surprised at how well a warning shot works.

Very different things.

Nothing will happen because protests are fine and not chaotic whirlwinds of violence, destruction, and theft. Protests are not riots.

The WHO is calculating death rates from countries - namely China - where the virus has progressed quite a bit.  Take a look at Worldometers - they have had 81,054 total, and only 5353 are active  That means they have a pretty good idea of the mortality rate: if you contract coronavirus, will you A) die or B) survive.  They have 75,000 concluded cases that ended in outcomes A or B.  They have found that about 3.5% of people that get it will die.  In other words, 96.5% of people that get it will survive.  It is likely that the 5353 currently active cases will conclude in this ratio.

Now take a look at New York.  Due to the fact the the illness is quite long (10 - 20 days) and they are very much at the beginning of the disease spreading, all of their cases are active (besides those that have already died).  At this point, one cannot look at these data and perform such calculation to access a mortality rate with any high degree of confidence.  Of course, as the disease progresses and active cases conclude in outcomes A or B, we will have a much better idea whether each case will end in a death or survival, and therefore have an idea of the mortality rate in NY. 

Importantly, worldometers - the website you sourced - explains this in great detail here:  [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) However, you did not read this, which explains your clueless mishandling of the data.  Even when I copy-pasted an important passage and citation from this (your) source directly to you, you either did not read it or did not understand it. Which is why I'm here, to help!

Executive summary: if you go around telling people that the mortality rate in NY is 0.5% based on your calculations without indicating that literally every single case in NY is currently active, you are actively spreading misinformation.  Which is funny, because based on your post history you seem to despise ""fake news.""

I genuinely don't know if you realize you're wrong in saying the mortality rate is 0.5% in NY and are scrambling to try to deflect, or if you're so stupid that you actually do believe that the mortality rate for coronavirus is 3-4% all around the world except for the state of New York for some reason, where it will be 0.5%.

Companies that have struggled to fill job openings in the US for long stretches are starting to ask a pressing question: Do we really need those roles?

With interest rates soaring, stocks tanking and fears of a recession mounting, employers are axing jobs or dialing back their once-breakneck hiring plans. Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., America’s two biggest private employers, have said they’re thinning out their hourly workforces through attrition. Jobless claims, while still low, have risen slightly, based on a four-week moving average that smooths out weekly volatility.

The pace of job postings has also slowed in recent weeks, according to data from career site Indeed, and not just in the hard-hit tech sector: Even hospitality job opportunities have decelerated, although they’re still above pre-pandemic levels. Those vacancies are staying unfilled for longer periods as increasingly skittish executives slow-walk the recruitment process. Reluctant to say they’re curtailing or even freezing hiring, companies instead couch their moves with corporate jargon like a “review of business processes.” 

“They don’t want to talk about a hiring freeze, but what they are doing is adding an extra layer of scrutiny, like saying only the CEO can approve these jobs,” said David Vied, the global sector leader for medical devices and diagnostics at executive recruitment and consulting firm Korn Ferry. “There is this stealth slowdown.”

To be sure, plenty of jobs are available, and qualified candidates are in high demand in today’s tight labor market with openings still near record highs. But vacancies are staying unfilled longer, according to Greg Summers, North American president of recruitment firm Cielo, as it’s tougher to coax people out of their current jobs.  


White-collar workers, keen to resign just months or even weeks ago for higher pay or a more flexible work arrangement, are now reassessing whether it’s worth jumping ship in choppier waters, according to recruitment experts. 

“The balance of power is shifting,” Vied said. “There is this erosion of the power of the job candidate.”

More than six out of ten CEOs expect a recession before the end of next year in the region where their company primarily operates, and an additional 15% think a recession has already hit, according to a Conference Board survey of 750 CEOs and other C-suite executives conducted in mid-May. Since then, the benchmark S&P 500 has fallen further and the Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates by the most since 1994, with the expectation that inflation will cool and the US unemployment rate will rise to 4.1% by 2024, from 3.6% today.  

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that policy makers aren’t trying to “induce a recession now,” but that the “pathways” to overcoming inflation while maintaining a strong job market “have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.” Powell’s critics, including Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, expect the jobless rate to go even higher. 

Employers are getting caught in the middle of this macroeconomic mess, stuck with dozens of job openings they can’t fill while also wondering whether they actually need to fill them.   

“Virtually every organization we work with has an absurd number of open job requisitions right now,” said Melissa Swift, the US transformation solutions leader at workplace consultant Mercer. “They sit around unfilled for very long periods of time. This is both a crisis, and an interesting indication that we simply might not need some of those jobs.""",Ron_Reagan,t2_ci9r0wen,159,0,reddit4

To be sure, plenty of jobs are available, and qualified candidates are in high demand in today’s tight labor market with openings still near record highs. But vacancies are staying unfilled longer, according to Greg Summers, North American president of recruitment firm Cielo, as it’s tougher to coax people out of their current jobs.White-collar workers, keen to resign just months or even weeks ago for higher pay or a more flexible work arrangement, are now reassessing whether it’s worth jumping ship in choppier waters, according to recruitment experts.

Recessions are caused when money stops moving around. Inflation can happen, price rises etc etc, as long as the money is circulation the economy will survive.

This is more likely to be caused by:
- mass unemployment for whatever reason, which can of course be cyclical; a cause an an effect
- resource shortages, like what’s happening now. Fundamental resources like energy seeing runaway price increases makes everything more expensive and people less like to spend money on optional things, and the definition of optional changes too
- anything that causes debt defaults, particularly those with knock-on effects. People going bankrupt can’t spend, and nor can the people who aren’t getting paid by those going bankrupt. Maybe something like a housing market crash after a bubble…. Like the one we might be in.

CEOs speculating on future outcomes and putting up prices only really breaks the economy if it’s a resource thing like energy, which is regulated in lots of economies, albeit badly most of the time.

It's difficult to justify your new headcount to HR, if your team is still able to function despite not filling the vacancy, since everyone is running on burnout fuel. The issue is that the burnout problem often manifests in step increments.

There's some sentiment that maybe equity won't be getting an outsized portion of the benefit, and that could cause stock prices to stagnate even while the economy continues to grow, as some portion of that economic benefit flows out of the companies to customers, lenders, vendors, labor, governments, etc., with less surplus to distribute to owners.

The stock market was saved by the enormous waves of free money flowing from congress and the Fed. In fact, they over reacted, which is why we're now feeling the pain of inflation. It's also why we saw a surge of wealth, which mostly made its way into the hands of the wealthy.

You're now assuming that a future recession will behave the same way, but your thinking is flawed. Because of high inflation, the Fed can't just flood the economy with money to ward off recession. Doing so would just make inflation even worse. They've already deployed their best tool to juice the economy (interest rates) and now they have to move the other direction.

During the pandemic, the wealth of the top 1% primarily increased thanks to the massive run-up of the stock market. If you look at the last 6 months, the SP500 is down over 20%. Clearly the prospect of a looming recession is not signaling ""higher profits due to reduced costs"".

The ultra-wealthy hold a large portion of their wealth as stocks. If you want to see the impact of recession on that wealth, look at how long it took just to break even following the dot com bust. Or the housing market bust. While Q2 2020 was technically a recession, it was basically a technicality. If that's your expectation of what happens during a recession, you are seriously mistaken.

I don't think the majority of people making $12/hr are aware just how much they're getting fucked, and how fundamentally different life is for the people making $100k+/yr actually is. Even $100k/yr is barely enough to cover all expenses even in a low cost of living area after taxes, 401k contributions, dental care, car repairs, mortgage/rent, car/house insurance.

They would rather lose productivity and eat the constant mistakes by the rookies now as collateral and are banking on in the long run, having an experienced workforce in a few years for peanuts.

My company I work for has around 45 employees. About half of those employees have no drive or desire to push for a management spot, meaning all I had to do was out work around 20 people and I got a promotion to production management. 

I worked at a big box lumber store before here. Everytime a store promotion came up corporate would broadcast the opening to every single employee at every single store. Every new manager that my specific store got was promoted and relocated from out of state. Instead of competing with 20 ppl for a promotion I was competing with around 3000. Then you have to take into consideration that there will be games of favorites with corporate. So not only are you forced to compete with exponentially more candidates, but unless you are local to corporate and have a relationship with them its just not gonna happen realistically. 

Also good luck going to your Walmart GM and asking for a pay advance because you got a speeding ticket and can't clear rent. You'll get laughed at.

No, he didn't. This wasn't a trade strategy, it was just a tantrum.

The tariffs applied to low level parts for manufactured goods, so it made American cost to produce finished products shoot way up, while their competitors' costs dipped a little. The US did not increase manufacturing of those low level parts. This put American manufacturing into a recession in 2019. The probable negative impact of this for 2020 was swallowed up by the COVID pandemic.

For a variety of reasons including this increase in costs to parts and actual thought out retaliatory actions by China, the trade deficit with China increased during this time and the costs of the US economy far outweighed the cost to China's. Ultimately, Trump showed China his belly with his foolish ""I hereby command all American manufacturers to move out of China."" nonsense and took a deal from a position of weakness to get it to stop. China came out ahead from the trade war.

The current rise in manufacturing is largely an effect of the COVID pandemic both shifting emphasis from services to goods and the disruption in supply chains making domestic manufacturing price competitive.",MrSquicky,t2_8ixcb,29,0,reddit1

ipzfg11,t1_ipyzrso,2022-09-26 15:51:20,Economics,"I've been in the business for almost 30 years now, first as a machinist and now I'm in QA.

The problem that I find is two-fold in manufacturing...

The first is that when you get to around 55 years old, you become ""persona non grata"".  You're too expensive to hire, won't be there in ten years, and aren't hungry enough to gobble up those hours that they will be wanting of you, that is if your body isn't already abused badly enough that it's even on the table to do the work. 


The other issue that I've encountered is understaffed places that demand 50+ hour weeks. I've done that and plenty more with a 401k that speaks loudly to early investing paying off.  The problem is that one day you look at that little kid of yours that was in ponytails just a few years ago and now she's excited about her license and her crush at school, and you're there with your excuses of fatherhood that revolves around ""keeping a roof over our head"" and ""nice vacations"".  It all passes so damn quickly, and you realize those Saturdays that you were busting your hump at work trying to finish something up, that little girl was turning in to a young lady with a largely absent father figure by today's standards. 


As you've stated, there are good and bad industries, and I've finally cast aside the bad and moved in to biotech, which is a wonderful change of priorities. They can afford to have me gone for a week or two on vacation and nobody bats an eye. I wish I would have made this move earlier.",Abzug,t2_9fn8k,152,0,reddit1

Health insurance being tied to your job is one. And, in places with pensions, you often have to work a set number of years in a row in order to ""vest,"" usually 5-10 years, or else all the $ you put towards your pension go poof. Also, its very difficult to apply for mortgages without a paycheck coming in (this is because of govt takeover of fannie and freddie that have dumb arbitrary rules of who qualifies.

The primary reason is because jobs in the three big MBA sectors (consulting, banking, and tech) have drastically reduced hiring because of the current macroeconomic environment. Roughly 1/2 to 3/4 of students get jobs in these industries immediately post mba. Banking has seen drastically reduced deal flow, consulting benches are too deep, and tech is laying people off to adjust to new interest rates and over hiring during pandemic years. 

These are students that would 100% get jobs in any other year, but the market for these type of jobs is the worst it’s been since 2008. Anyone with an even elementary knowledge of the high income white collar job market and Economics 101 would understand this.

kgwet3s,t1_kgvi9x4,2024-01-08 14:42:50,Economics,"A finance degree doesn't help with operations strategy, marketing positioning, etc.

The point of an MBA is that you're creating well-rounded and strategic thinkers, rather  than area specialists. 

You'll always need finance people--their field is among the more complex in business. But a pure finance person isn't going to thrive just anywhere--their curriculum is specialized. 

Beyond that...Now we're comparing it to post-grad STEM?  Why are we doing that?   I don't think anyone thinks an MBA is as serious as STEM.  Accounting and Finance masters are probably quite skeptical because the MBA teases teaching those concepts at a master's level when it really *doesn't*, but the rest of those people are *right* of course. **Business is not a complex subject, relatively speaking. And yet it's a far more technical skillset and form of gatekeeping than an undergrad.**

The MBA is not a tool for creating subject matter experts with a high degree of expertise for the most rules-heavy positions in society--engineering/legal/finance have *strict* operating guidelines for the safety and wellbeing of the public.  MBA's have far less power in that regard.  What an MBA degree does is it filters down the bulk of business operators even further and tries to teach degrees of business ethics, effective leadership, and well-roundedness so that the 'next level' of business people are not just a homegrown undergrad rabble, but a population taught the latest thinking in leadership, given the latest rundown on the myriad of subject areas (enough to help make decisions and manage time/orchestration), etc.

MBAs aren't meant to funnel into functional roles, like corporate finance. They are meant to file into leadership roles where your position is less formula calculation and more orchestration of people and balancing of disparate/asymmetrical resources and specialties--something very difficult to get the average person 'good' at or we'd have effective leaders everywhere.

This is very similar to military officer academies.  They don't make someone a crack pilot, a keen tank platoon leader, a supply logistics commander, etc. They educate people broadly in the ways of war so that they understand the *interplay* of these things, and they accelerate the learning of a select batch of individuals. And despite the guys on the ground often hating them for their 'newness' in leadership once they're fresh out of wimp school, it's a framework that has worked very well over the years and has stuck not just here, but in militaries around the world.",S-192,t2_3gcw9wn2,5,0,reddit2
kgwfx5a,t1_kgw1n0d,2024-01-08 14:50:05,Economics,"The biggest value to the individual comes from the job change/job boost opportunities and the networking. The education is helpful as a way to hone certain instincts, but it's not truly academic--any reasonable MBA grad can tell you the coursework isn't *hard*. And even T10 programs are exceedingly unlikely to fail someone out.

The value to *society* is that we further tutor people interested in leadership positions in the complexity of resource and human management.  MBAs (at least decent ones) are quick to hammer into your head that ""firing people is a last, worst resort"", that M&A fails 85%+ of the time and should be avoided, that active fund/investment management is statistically a waste of time, and other things that the layperson might fall into like a trap due to ""common knowledge"".

You're essentially further filtering and reordering/judging and qualifying a population of leaders and indoctrinating them based on the latest ethical and leadership frameworks, giving them a high-level 'need-to-know' understanding of business operations so they can effectively manage organizations.  

This skill-set is relevant *regardless* of your system of politics/economics/etc. A lot of people whine childishly about MBA's being some horseman of the Capitalist apocalypse or something silly and reddit-ly poetic. Instead, honestly, the MBA serves more to be a useful school for leadership and resources management. And considering the top ~20-50 schools share much of their curriculum and it's tremendously focused on ethical/excellent stewardship and citizenship, I'd say the value of a progressive-minded MBA is quite high for not just people, but society. I'm more afraid of the homegrown family inheritance boys skipping degrees and coming to manage huge funds, and the roughneck ground guys who make it to leadership and project their own historical difficulties onto their new employees.",S-192,t2_3gcw9wn2,1,0,reddit2

Especially for top programs, it takes a pretty solid resume to get in and thus the students who get these MBAs are more likely to be successful not because of anything the MBA provides but solely by being good enough to get into the program. This provides a signal to employers and investors.


One way you can notice this signaling effect is by [the proportion of unicorn companies with a top-tier MBA founder](https://poetsandquants.com/2023/07/05/do-you-need-an-mba-to-found-a-unicorn-history-says-probably-not/2/)


Another outcome of earning an MBA is it provides the opportunity for people with non-traditional backgrounds to get into highly-lucrative jobs. Generally, top banks, PE firms, and consultancies only hire graduates from top-tier undergraduate universities. For people with non-traditional backgrounds (military, non-profit, marketing, etc.) an MBA offers the ability to switch careers to higher-paying options like finance and consulting. It also offers this same opportunity for graduates of top MBA programs who did not attend elite undergraduate institutions.

As to the large segment who have not yet taken a job, I suspect it is due to a slowdown in hiring from consultancies and PE/VC firms. Many students at MBA programs get in in order to pivot to these industries. Unfortunately, both private investing and consulting have taken big hits during the last couple years. Graduates (rightly or wrongly) often see their first post-MBA position as determining their career trajectory and are hesitant to take positions in non-target industries.

Usually MBAs aren't technical enough to legitimately climb the engineering management track. Directors and up usually have a technical masters or phd OR some patents or papers or other major technical achievements -- usually they were involved from a leadership position. The rare cases I've seen when that isn't the case are diversity hires, folks leading operations or product, and or folks that pursued an MBA from a top 5 school solely for networking.

Good engineers will not respect leaders that aren't technical. Many good engineers actively deride MBAs. From the interviews I've conducted, I'd go so far as to say getting an MBA from an undistinguished school provides negative signal: why did you waste your time pursuing a fake degree and what does that say about your judgement? Most folks I've interviewed with these qualifications weren't fit to be first-line managers and you could tell when you asked them to get even remotely technical. Some engineers ignore MBA-types, the more surly undermine them.

And really it makes sense. An MBA-type as a first line manager gets into a war room with a similarly leveled IC, let's say staff level, and it's just embarrassing. They don't know how to respond to incidents. They can't weigh technical tradeoffs. They're asking their reports what x, y, and z means. By the end of it, everyone in the room just starts talking around them to address the incident. You think that MBA-type makes senior manager shitting down their own leg under pressure like that?

Sure MBAs are usually not changing the world, but neither are a large portion of researchers with Master's degrees in other fields.

For these STEM disciplines, it is also often a prerequisite to have experience in that field, which is not required for MBAs.

If MBA-type were good at business, they'd have a startup. If MBA-type were a good leader, they'd have built a department or team or product. If MBA-type were a good financier, they'd have finance or accounting credentials. If MBA-type were a good engineer, they'd have written a paper or designed a system or have some invention.

See what I'm getting at? What is MBA-type ACTUALLY good at? It's like a philosophy degree or something. Having it without having some tangible achievements undermines having it at all.

I'd only get one or advise someone to get one from a top 5 school where they'd line up with top consulting firms or rub elbows with folks that will.

In a lot of places, once you’re identified as management track, many times after a technical masters, you do a part time MBA program.

Go look at the cities where the T10 programs are. What cities aren’t included?  LA, Portland, Seattle, Austin.

You don’t have to have an MBA, there’s many routes to the same place.  But writing off somebody who went to school to get a MBA because you think that proves they couldn’t have gotten a physics PhD?  I don’t know you, but I’d guess you may need to get over yourself.

In 2022, China had 9.56 million births. Assuming that the average woman only has 1 child in her lifetime and the average age for motherhood is 30 (pretty close to reality), you get this:

&#x200B;

|Year|Raw Birth Numbers (estimated)|
|:-|:-|
|2022|9.56 million|
|2052|4.78 million|
|2082|2.39 million|
|2112|1.195 million|
|2142|597, 500|
|2172|298, 750|
|2202|149, 375|
|2232|74, 687|
|2262|37, 343|
|2292|18, 671|
|2322|9, 335|

&#x200B;

So, in 3 centuries, China's birth numbers (therefore population) goes down to less than 1/1000 of current levels, implying China's population will be 1.4 million and not 1.4 billion \[with exponential decay to continue, basically at p(t)= b \* 0.5^(t) where t is time\].",random20190826,t2_4gg1g024,-14,0,reddit3

> In 2021, US consumers spent an average of 10.3 percent of their disposable personal income on food—divided between food at home (5.2 percent) and food away from home (5.1 percent)

Just above the quote you can see a graph showing the trend since 1960. Looking at cost of food at home, you can see it continually goes down. The reason why total food budget goes up, is because people are increasingly able to spend money on luxuries like eating out. 

> Automated building techniques should be making more houses more affordable.

Homes are able to be built faster today than they used to. However, the price of labor and regulatory compliance has increased enough to more than offset the gains from automation and capital improvements. 

> https://www.nahb.org/blog/2021/05/regulatory-costs-add-a-whopping-93870-to-new-home-prices/

Roughly 23.8% of the cost of a new home covers just the regulatory costs. 

> Same with medicine and drug production.

Automation only reduces the cost of producing medicine. It doesn’t reduce the cost of receiving approval for a medicine nor the cost to perform testing. Which is where the majority of the expense comes from. Similar to labor/regulatory costs in construction, automations inability to compensate for other factors getting significantly worse is not an argument against automation. 

Everything that benefits from automation is more affordable today than if there was no automation. Sometimes, other costs have gone up enough to offset that benefit.",kiklion,t2_6tl3a,1,0,reddit3

But if you let in the dual citizens, first, they may not come (they may not even speak Chinese, let alone be able to read or write). Even if they did come, they will bring their Western views with them (views like rule of law, freedom, etc...) and change the views of their friends and family who have never lived abroad.

We need a nationwide minimum. I'd put it at 15 or 16. I think I had my first job at age 16 working in a restaurant. There are farms where kids work on their family's farm, and situations where really impoverished people are working to survive. We should be giving people support who need their young child to work. The kids should be in school. I know I'm disconnected from this, but I'm from a southern state and when I was a kid there was a min. age around there.

Finally the us should offer work visa programs for foreign farm workers who are required for our farms to functions; we shouldn't hold them hostage, these folks just trying to survive. Same thing for many other subsistence jobs. And we should not let these young kids work in factories either.

Let's get into it:

&#x200B;

>The home ownership rate is higher than under Reagan.

It's hard to refute this one, but something to consider is that home ownership didn't really matter back then. Landlords weren't price gouge happy and rent was very affordable. People could easily afford to pay rent and still have plenty of leftover income for everything else, even in a single income family. 

What I'm saying is, this is a poor metric for prosperity because rent has gone up by such an insane amount you can't really compare renting in 1989 to renting now.

&#x200B;

>Life expectancy is higher than under Reagan.

Hardly shocking. People finally realized en masse in the 90s that smoking and drinking is really bad for you lol. Let me posit you a counterpoint though: does life expectancy REALLY matter when talking about the happiness of a population? Who cares if I can live longer, if I'm trapped in financial instability and have to work until I'm 90? It's a meaningless metric under late stage capitalism where more wealth continues rising to the top.

&#x200B;

>We work fewer hours than under Reagan.

Again, you gotta take a deeper look at these stats. Do you know the REAL reason they're trending under 40? Because the laws started to change and employers realized that by giving retail and service workers less than 40 hours a week, they wouldn't have to give them benefits. I'm positive that's the main reason work hours have trended down on the whole. Not exactly progress for the labor movement lol. Also, I'm guessing this is per employer. Doesn't track all the low income people with multiple jobs.

&#x200B;

>Despite working fewer hours, real, median weekly earnings are higher than under Reagan.

Sure, wages have gone up. But have they matched inflation? Have they matched the ridiculous increase in worker productivity since the 80s? Not by a longshot lol. If they did, minimum wage would be like $25 an hour, and your average office worker would make \~$150K.

Just look at housing costs. In the late 80s / early 90s, you could get a decent house with $50-60K. Nowadays, that same house might cost $400-500K depending on where it is. Wages have not kept up with inflation, especially housing inflation. Which, again, is much more critical today than in the late 80s for longterm prosperity / retirement.

&#x200B;

>By all metrics, public education is better than under Reagan and student achievement is higher. A much higher proportion of students complete college now.

The main reason people are generally more educated now is because they have to be. There aren't enough well-paying labor jobs left in the country to support yourself on, let alone a family. Those jobs started getting stripped by Nixon's policies, but Raegan's policies kicked offshoring into high gear. He was also staunchly anti-union despite himself having been in SAG-AFTRA.

What we have now are heaps of college debt, along with a high number of ""over-educated"" individuals who went to college because they were told it was necessary then couldn't find any work in the field they were studying. 

And if you think this contradicts my previous statement, it does not. It does not because you have to understand that there simply aren't enough jobs that pay a living wage in this country, period.

It's even more disappointing that your understanding of stats and economics are as poor as your reading comprehension.

I gave you REAL median weekly earning. They have more then exceeded inflation. That's even with people working fewer hours. So, even with your caveat of employers specifically cutting people's hours to avoid paying them benefits, people still make more than they did in the 1980's. And if you are someone with a job that pays benefits, you make tremendously more.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPRNFB

Also, wages aren't related to your productivity. They are related to how many other people can do your job and what they will accept as pay. Why would an employer who makes a technological upgrade that makes you more productive pay you more? You didn't do anything to increase productivity. They made the investment. They aren't giving the gains to you unless they have to.

None of this has anything to do with Reagan. I don't like Reagan. I think he was a fairly bad president. 

And finally, because nothing you said was accurate. Mortgage payments as a percentage of disposable income are the lowest they've ever been. Lower than under Reagan or any time after. The low interest rates of the past decade made it the most affordable time to buy in history. It doesn't matter if the house price is high, if the monthly payment is low.

It was a median, real income measure. If it's reported by employer and distorted by low income people working multiple jobs, it means that the average person makes even more than the 12% real increase in wages. And since those low income, low hour jobs don't receive benefits, it makes the gain in hourly compensation even more impressive.

According to the BLS, 6.9% of the workforce worked multple jobs in 1989, was 5.4% in 1985, and was 4.9% in 1980. It's 4.8% now.

Fair enough. I was only confident about the productivity stat to be fair. But I wonder how things would change if you factored in the monetary value of benefits, PTO, etc. that workers used to have pretty much across the board but, in many cases, don't have now? Just food for thought.

This feels like free market libertarian propaganda to me. As leftists such as myself have pointed out and will continue to point out, this callous, morally bankrupt line of thinking is what leads to wages that people simply cannot live on.

As for the ""why"" question, they should pay you more because presumably you have the technical skill to use this technology. A 30 year old who is good with computers is inherently more valuable for most positions than a 70 year old who can't use them, right? 

There's also the basic humanist answer that if you, the owner, are making significantly more money off of these workers with a minimal one-time investment, perhaps you should just...pay them more because it's the right thing to do? Especially if you're using accountants and loopholes to pay as little taxes as possible, as many business owners do.

The low interest rates of the past decade made it the most affordable time to buy in history. It doesn't matter if the house price is high, if the monthly payment is low.

This is another sneaky stat that doesn't really tell the whole story. Let's look at a $80,000 mortgage with a 10% interest rate, like you might have seen in the 80s/90s. Their mortgage would be $702 per month.

Now let's look at today. Let's say the same house sells for $400K today, and you bought it during the pandemic when rates were cheap. 3% let's say. That would be a $1686 mortgage payment. A few points to consider here:

1) it was a very brief window when rates were this low, and it was during a pandemic. Buying houses wasn't exactly on everyone's mind, but sure many did buy during this time. I did. I don't recall what the pre-pandemic rates were, but I don't think they were in the 3s.

2) This payment is still more than double what one might have paid in the late 80s / early 90s. So yes, the interest rate matters a lot, but the base cost of the house also matters a lot.

I could still believe this stat though. You know how? The simple answer would be that back in the 80s, regular middle and lower class people could still afford to buy a house. Their income was lower, so their payment was higher as a portion of their income. But generally speaking, most people could theoretically afford to buy a home because it was within their budget and was still relatively proportional to their yearly earnings.

Nowadays, so few people can actually afford the down payment + the mortgage that only the upper middle class and above even buy houses to begin with. So it's not shocking that their mortgage is a lower portion of their income. The one exception are places generally deemed undesirable, like homes out in the country away from any sort of city / infrastructure. Those homes are still affordable to everyone, but you either need to give up hours of your day commuting or be lucky enough to have a WFH job.

A better stat would be to look at the average US income in say 1985 vs the average income now, and compare that to average house price. Because again, not everyone is buying houses. Only looking at home buyers really, really skews the data in favor of the wealthy and those that have prospered under this system.

Let's look at 1985. Average house price is $84K. Average income is $23K. So that's approximately 4X your income. In 2023, average house price is $436K. Average income is $57K. That's over 8X your income, and this is just the average. There are tens of millions making at / around minimum wage who make far less than that $57K.

So, let's look at your housing cost argument. I want you to learn something from this. Let's say you have an $80,000 mortgage and you pay $702/mo for PITI. You said you had an interest rate of 10%, so I went here and looked for a time when that was the rate:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US

Let's go with July of 1987 as when you bought the house. What is $702 in 1987 dollars adjusted to current dollars? Answer: $1,876.07. Yes, it's more than the current payment of $1686 for the same house. The value of the dollar isn't constant. You have to adjust to constant dollars to get context. You can check the value of things with this. https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm

The monthly cost of housing is the most important factor in determining how affordable it is. Housing was more expensive in the 1980s because of how high the interest rates were. And the last decade was some of the most affordable housing ever because of the low interest rates.

Also, the average person doesn't buy the average house, at least not as their first house. You usually roll your equity forward after living in a house for 9-13 years or so. So, it's not a good comparision to compare average income to average home prices. The average first time home buyer is buying on the low end of housing and someone who has lived in a home for many years has a lot of equity to roll forward into the next house, even if they don't have the income to buy it without the equity.

As to your comment about whether an employer should pay more money when they make more money. They could and sometimes they do, especially if you are a good employee. But they don't have to, it's hard to compel them to, and part of the game as a worker is to leave when you can make more somewhere else. That's how you drive up wages for other workers. You don't sit around wishing you employer would pay you more. You threaten to leave unless you are paid what you are worth and then you actually leave if they don't pay you that.

As for the leftist argument, I've never, ever, EVER, heard a leftist defend free market capitalism here like you are. You are not the typical leftist lol. I believe, and I'm not alone here, that the very study and enshrinement of economics (as it is currently taught at the university level) only entrenches people more in the idea of free market capitalism, and it is ultimately in direct opposition to leftist goals (namely, moving as far away from capitalism as possible).

And why are you adjusting for inflation at all? The comparison was 702 for an income of 23K versus 1686 for an income of 56K. Without taking taxes into account, that 23k income person makes like $1900 a month. So their mortgage payment is far less than half their income. Very doable. Meanwhile, the 56K earner in 2023 earns $4600 a month. Which is also less than half. It actually winds up being 36% vs 36% in this instance. Probably in the 40s post tax though, in both cases.

Again, the reason your stat about home owners paying a lower portion of their income into mortgages nowadays is true is because **only the upper middle class and wealthy actually have mortgages anymore. As in, those making more than $56K.** At least, in large numbers. Barring situations where they bought for cheap from parents or inherited or whatnot. This is especially true when you factor in down payments and closing costs, which for an average house will be tens of thousands of dollars upfront now. Even the $56K earners will have trouble putting that up.

As you even admitted earlier, income inequality is rampant now compared to the 80s. While the mortgage payment is approximately the same proportion of income in both of my examples, I'd imagine there were very few adults making less than that $23K number in the 80s. The rich were far less rich and the poor were far less poor. Meanwhile, as I pointed out earlier, there are 10s of millions of adult Americans in 2023 working for the minimum wage right now, equating to (being very generous with the math) $15,080. You can't even afford a shit house in the middle of nowhere with that lol. Maybe when rates were 3%, but not now.

**Basically, income inequality skews all the data and makes things seem, on average, better than they actually are**. The only reason more people own homes now is because there wasn't as much pressure to get out of the rent trap in the 80s, because rent was at sane levels.

This is rapidly becoming untrue. It was, once, but the reality is that less and less starter homes are being built. The market is filled with mcmansions and $500-$750K 4 bedroom 2-3 floor homes. Good luck finding a home below 300K in a nice area relatively close to a city anymore.

Leftists with an authoritarian bend tend to get pissy about it because they wish they could enforce the behavior they prefer and make everyone conform. I'm not an authoritarian. I have no desire to force a utopia on anyone else. And ultimately I don't think you can. 

My opinion on why leftists ultimately failed to remake the world in their image in the last century was that they couldn't figure out a way to give people enough of an incentive to participate in their system once the repression stopped. I've found I can work well with a collective of like minded individuals, effectively a commune, but I largely doubt a wider leftist society is possible.

k92lfvl,t3_17ua2zg,2023-11-13 14:43:15,Economics,"A few thoughts...

1 - Job hopping is 100% the best way to get a raise.  I actually changed jobs a few years ago after years at one place and it was crazy the urgency by my old employer to match my new salary.  They were actually angry that I wouldn't tell them what my new offer was and I was like, ""Lol....no.  The new place told me what they think I'm worth.  Why don't you take a shot?  There is a number I'd stay for, but you'll have to figure it out yourself.""

2 - I also suspect that Gen Z is in a good spot to do this.  Kids make it hard to job hop and relocate because everything revolves around your children's schools until they go off to college.  But we hear about how Gen Z isn't having kids, so that makes job hopping easy.

3 - Remote work also helps a LOT.  I'm a 50-something Gen Xer and part of my job does have to be in person.  I can do a lot from home, but sometimes a political dumpster fire erupts and I need to put on my flame repellant business suit and go into the office to pee on the fire.  But my minions don't need to deal with that political shit.  I basically designed their jobs so they don't need to come in unless they want to.  It helps me with recruiting, but it also makes it easier for them to leave.  

4 - The one caveat is that by the time they're getting \~15 years into their career, I really don't want to see their resume be a series of 2-year gigs.  I do like to see at least one stop on their resume where they stayed for 5-6 years.  Sometimes job hoppers are just bad at their jobs and keep moving to avoid the knife.  It's pretty smart, but I do like to see that they sunk in one place, had to live with a boss finding out how good/bad they are at their job, live with the long-term ramifications of decisions they made, etc.",dogs94,t2_wvez1,71,0,reddit4

My advice to young people. Switch often in the first decade of work. Every couple of years and play the companies off one another for more money.

Labor flexibility became somewhat of an ideological point. A lot of that was reactionary to dysfunctional labor markets of the opposite kind.

LinkedIn, netflix, we're Web 2.0 talk leaders on human resources circa 2010. Both promoted high mobility, serial careers, high paying, short tenure work. 

It was already often true, that job hopping is an effective tool in the careerist tool belt. People avoided us for other reasons. Some sense of loyalty is relatively natural to people.

Benefits of this labor culture were relatively front loaded. Costs more gradual. If the general sentiment in the labor market, is that working your resume is your career.. well.. that's what we've got here.

They want super cheap labor to throw into a grinder for a few years to keep their money printer going. Many such places don't really try to build institutional knowledge, because for large companies it's really not necessary to continue making money. Having more skilled people might lead to better results, but for a giant multi-national org having a single department performing a bit above average won't even get noticed high enough in the management structure. As long as it doesn't completely fall apart, they really don't care. They'll just expect other people in the department to work harder while training. The saddest part is it's not really even about the money most of the time, at least not directly. There's plenty of that to go around, but it's usually planned for a year in advance, and asking a manager to put in a budget request so that maybe next year you can get a small raise is going to be slow going.

It's different for smaller companies. If you only have a few people then even a single one leaving, however with smaller companies the problem usually really is how much money they have, and balancing that against the workload, the amount paid to each person, and the number of people employed.",TikiTDO,t2_3yp3u,15,0,reddit4

Manager decided to backtrack on that and because I was temp, thought she could bully me. My trainer had mentioned multiple times how hard it was to find someone that picked up on the work so easily and could get through so much with few, if any, mistakes. I stopped showing up because the manager didn't want to allow me to leave 30 minutes early to make my evening class and told me ""classes or my job"".

So your people, over time, will become insular and myopic.  They will only see what is in front of them.  When you bring in new people, new ideas get injected into the company creating more dynamism within the company.  

Your people may have produced that great thing that made you tons of money last year.  But last year is not the issue.  The issue is next year, and the ideas that made you money last year are not likely to make you money next year.  Since your company already has enough of last year's ideas to make you money, you need next year's ideas - and for that you need new blood.  The alternative is getting your people to trade shows, conferences, granting sabbaticals, and all kinds of other expensive stuff that only really works for the top 10% of performers.

Some employees can keep up and bring out new ideas consistently - and those are the ones promoted and retained.  The vast majority are one trick ponies - and they're a dime a dozen.  Throw them back.

This is why companies value new people more than the old.

But you may ask, what about the guys who know where the bodies are buried?  What about the people who keep the lights on?  Well, those people are only good for so much - they don't produce you anything new, they just keep the old stuff around.  And maintaining old stuff is expensive and it doesn't get you to next year - it keeps you in last year.  Those old systems are best to die, and if they die catastrophically because you let that one old IT guy go without a decent replacement, then that whole system just gets replaced.

The peter principle was an effect that would happen in ""you can work your whole life here"" companies. People would work hard, show results and ask for promotions, and then they'd get promoted. The problem is that the job they were promoted to was very different. Like going from a private first class to a corporal: you're still a soldier in three thick of it, but you're expected to be able to lead (though not in the level of a sergeant) a tight group, work for their needs, etc. In the company as you rise you're expected to have more leadership and initiative, have a wider scope in your vision and have a better connection to the ultimate business needs your work is supposed to support (i.e. you are better at showing how your work results in more $$$). This is assuming you don't do a diagonal move, such as going into management. So what happens if you don't have these new skills? Well you suck and can't move forward. But since the new position benefits from many of your previous skills you aren't that bad either. Just mediocre enough to stay there forever never doing the best. After many years of this happening the company will find that most of their positions are filled with mediocre people, anyone good rising with promotions until they become mediocre. So the company maximizes its employee mediocreness.

So what have companies done? Well they keep a churn going. You can't be too long in a position, not without constantly proving you are not mediocre. This means you'll probably get a promotion and move elsewhere. When companies put it this way it makes sense to simply have the rotation. What does it change if you take the promotion and move to another team leaving the position open, or if you simply jump to another company and take the wage increase.

Because companies didn't invest enough in education, and not enough in career education (guiding employees on how to keep at a rate and get promotions) it really didn't make much sense to take promotions over new hires. Because they need to change their employee number constantly and quickly, it makes sense to focus the whole system on new hires vs investment transfers. I think that is companies moved away from that Jack Dorsey mentality, never beyond the quarter, better systems could be built. And the companies that do this are very successful. But after IPO pressure to conform to the needs of short term investors keeps growing and ultimately companies end up the same. So it's not an easy thing to just change.",lookmeat,t2_35hrh,1,0,reddit4

k95kmc8,t1_k95dato,2023-11-14 01:51:28,Economics,"Lots of tradesmen just have to go straight to job sites on a lot of days.  And that's a commute, but the job sites exist independent of your employer, so you wouldn't switch employers to potentially wind up being assigned to the exact same building under construction.  If you are an independent plumber, you might just work from home taking calls and then go to a customer location as needed when a call comes in.  My dad was in the trades for pretty much his whole life, and he had some jobs where he had to go into an office every morning to get the day's assignments.  But even 20+ years ago, that wasn't consistently the case.  There were many times he'd know what he needed to do the next day in advance, and he'd just go to a work site as his first stop the next morning.

Likewise, lawyers probably have an office.  But on many days they'd be going to a client's office for a meeting, or going straight to court and not needing to go to their own office.

Lots of programmers work fully remote these days, or maybe go in once a month for some team day that nobody likes.  Lots of marketing department stuff is or at least can be remote these days.  Art, writing, editing, analytics, etc.

The secretaries and coordinators/assistants that used to need to be in the office every day only need to be in the office on some days.  They can take calls, respond to emails, and set up Google Calendar appointments from home.  Especially if the person they are assisting isn't in the office anymore either.

Doctors generally do need to do in person work pretty much 100% of the time for actual care.  You can't set a broken bone over a zoom call.  But even they do some stuff as zoom call appointments these days to look at a weird mole on a camera and just write a prescription or make a referral, or do followup visits to make sure medication worked, and that kind of stuff doesn't necessarily require commuting.

On the other hand, a barista making minimum wage 100% has to commute to the coffee shop for a shift.  And lower paid positions are filled by people who have 0 leverage in trying to demand alternate work conditions because their skill set isn't valued very highly.",wrosecrans,t2_a99kk,2,0,reddit4

It absolutely does. Removing 'redundancies' are a common practice after acquisitions, not just with people but also product lines. It becomes so much easy to collude when there are only a few actors in a given market and when you combine that with regulatory capture, economies of scale, and the loads of other anti-competitive practices employed by behemoths it isn't hard to see why consolidation is the norm now.

Not sure on the sticky wages point.  There's likely a talent drain going on forcing workers to positions they're not most productive in.  Because of the market, companies probably are losing efficiency putting those employees in those positions.  With less talent, certain lower quality workers become medium to high quality due to the talent loss in which they'll demand higher wages.

Lol not sure if it's a great way to get around it either.  You don't pay workers a certain wage in this market they won't work.

Which I get because even if you want to stick to a hybrid/in office environment, it's easier to get a feel of a new employee and for the new employee to not want to move permanently for a contract position. But how many times are we going to extend contractors their 'full remote contract' instead of just offering 'full remote full time position'?

Personally, I live 10 minutes from the office. I enjoy going in on a few days a week because I generally enjoy my co-workers and it creates an informal opportunity to stay abreast of the upcoming projects. Just the other day, I had the opportunity to sit down with a co-worker that uses one of my teams applications and got a better understanding of how they use the app, where their dead time is and how we can improve it. A bit easier to just sit next to them and look over their shoulder than asking them to join a webex and let some 'invisible man' watch them work. Especially with the delay/shitty quality of 'share my screen'. Sometimes they go so quick webex seems to miss actions that are apparent when watching in person.",kiklion,t2_6tl3a,7,0,reddit1

Hybrid still allows you to live significantly further away from your office opening up additional housing options (especially if your hybrid schedule is only 1-2 days a week, in which case a 1-hour commute is not a big issue). You still save time, gas, etc. So all in all its still much better than full-time office work IMO.

Here are multiple sources that state otherwise.
Unemployment is a heavily skewed measure.

It's public information...


The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, from 5.2%, due to a combination of unemployed workers finding jobs and people leaving the labor force, meaning they are no longer counted as unemployed since they are not actively seeking new work. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/workers-quitting-quits-surge-record-high-jolts-labor-department-report-august-2021/


The unemployment rate measures the share of workers in the labor force who do not currently have a job but are actively looking for work. People who have not looked for work in the past four weeks are not included in this measure.

https://www.epi.org/newsroom/useful_definitions/

Because jobless workers are only counted as unemployed if they are actively seeking work, these “missing workers” are not reflected in the unemployment rate.

https://www.epi.org/publication/missing-workers/


Who is counted as unemployed?
People are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work.

Household surveys households to see who is working and if not, are they looking for work. From that the unemployment rate is derived. If not working and not looking they're not unemployed, they're retired or whatever. 

Establishment survey checks payroll numbers, and is posted as a + or - figure for the month. If 1M retire, 1M are removed from payrolls, so the monthly figure would drop by about 1M.

Both tend to move together anyways, but household is used for unemployment rate and establishment for the job growth / loss monthly print.

&#x200B;

>The enrollment expansion “will not resolve the projected shortage” in physicians, the report says, because the number of residencies available for medical school graduates has not increased at the same rate as the increase in students in the United States. Some 44% of schools reported “major” or “moderate” concerns about their incoming students’ ability to find residency positions of their choice after medical school — a figure that has held steady since 2017.   
>  
>The concern stems from a two-decade long congressionally imposed cap on federal support for graduate medical education (GME) through the Medicare program, which is the largest public contributor to GME funding for residencies. The Medicare cap effectively freezes a teaching hospital’s Medicare GME support at 1996 levels — despite efforts by teaching hospitals, medical schools, physicians, and the AAMC, among others, to get Congress to raise the cap to fund more graduate training slots and help meet the health needs of the U.S aging population.

Not only does the US face [long term under availability of training](https://www.aacnnursing.org/Portals/42/News/Factsheets/Faculty-Shortage-Factsheet.pdf) for nurses, there are reports of [half of all nurses considering leaving their job in the post COVID surge world, with the primary reason being **inability to deliver quality care** and negative feelings even among younger nurses](https://www.nursingworld.org/~492857/contentassets/872ebb13c63f44f6b11a1bd0c74907c9/covid-19-two-year-impact-assessment-written-report-final.pdf).

Overall, however, I've become increasingly concerned by more concrete (ie, not Reddit anecdotal) news reporting on ways the US medical system has been in decline for a while now. When the other commenter said:

>And it’s not inconceivable that the whole system implodes and we suddenly some communities can’t get timely access to healthcare.

I have to just kind of shrug. Here's three articles covering problems along that very line [that have already](https://centerforhealthjournalism.org/fellowships/projects/death-thousand-cuts-rural-healthcare-decline) [been happening](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/special-series/rural-hospitals-were-already-struggling-then-the-coronavirus-hit) [in rural areas](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/05/1012418938/rural-ambulance-services-at-risk-as-volunteers-age-and-expenses-mount).

I would contend that a healthcare ""collapse"" does not look like a whole bunch of famous hospitals shuttering and suddenly no one able to get care or something so obvious and suddenly catastrophic.

Rather, it looks like chronic understaffing contributing to unsafe, inattentive care getting patients *quietly* killed, and HCW burnout. It looks like people starting to die more often to issues that should have been treatable because they can't get into care soon enough. It looks like a decline in care quality (when the frontline workers know we have done better in the past and know we could do better if they still had X, Y, Z resources like they used to).

In a system as large and complex as the US's is, of course, none of these problems will ever be everywhere, all at once. Deep structural problems tend to hit the poor and rural first, and they already are, so yeah ... that's why I'm with the other commenters here.

This data is strange. Not only is it odd that they're writing this whole article based on rather outdated info (June was over 4 months ago) but even this data doesn't match what I'm seeing.

My whole job is to track housing market data for Redfin and the lowest I saw the median days on market get this summer was 16 days. [It has since gone up to 24 days as of the latest data (Oct. 11 - Nov. 7)](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-prices-up-2pct-in-a-month/). It was around 40 days in the summer of 2020 and 2019.

That said, 16 days was the lowest on record and the general point that buyers were crunched for time in the summer is true, but it is increasingly less so in the fall as the market has somewhat cooled. We (Redfin economists) think that if mortgage rates go up it will cool even further.",TheTim,t2_1c4bb,64,0,reddit2

We listed our house on a Friday, had 8 offers by Sunday at 6pm, sold for 15% over list. Our house was small, no basement, etc. nothing special. 

Two weeks later we are looking to put in offers and the market has noticeably cooled. Put in an offer, no competition, got the house. Withdrew due to a bad roof and uncooperative sellers who thought the market was still bananas. They had to price drop $30k and replace the roof to get under contract - still took them nearly 6 weeks 

After we withdrew we looked at a beautiful turnkey house in the best neighborhood in our area that had been sitting for 11 days already. Put in an offer, no competition, and just closed today. We did pay list because inventory for what we needed (large family) was limited. But probably could have gone a little under and still got it.

hkd0n9n,t3_qs9b3g,2021-11-12 18:18:19,Economics,"I bought a home last year. I had a showing 7am Tuesday, it was listed at 6pm Monday. By the time I got there, there were already offers pending. I had 20 minutes to inspect the house before the next buyer arrived. I loved it, put in a deposit, and my offer was rejected. 

3 months and 4 rejected offers later, the seller contacts my agent to say the sale fell through and would accept my offer if I was still interested. 

I agreed and scheduled an inspection, which came back with only a few very minor repairs that were needed. I didn’t have the chance for a walkthrough until closing day. I closed last September. 

By October, I realized that this “fully renovated home” was renovated very badly. The “new roof” turned out to be 5+ years old with a failing patch, and a severe leak into the living room. The backyard floods very badly when it rains. ALL of the appliances all died within 2 months. 
There was missing flashing and caps on the roof, as well as HOLES large enough for squirrels to start living in my attic. 

I feel like if I had the chance to walk the property for more than half an hour, 3 months before closing, I might have caught some of this before it was too late.

The issue is just because it’s a 3000sq/ft ranch style home doesn’t mean it comps well with a contemporary or craftsman etc of the same size.  I’ve saw a lot of occasions in which this is happening to verify value and that is not necessarily true.  Also I work some rural areas and it’s far from a quick sell.  I had a beautiful home listed in July, one of the nicer homes of the year for that matter, under priced by 5k and it went under contract just yesterday after we dropped the price on another 15k last week.  What I’m saying is, yes some people may be upside down if you are in a thriving city or a booming city but their jobs will back it up and pull them through.  They may have to stay there a little longer to get back on top but there are jobs this go around and the parameters are different for lending than they were in 2008.  I’ve worked through both of them and I can tell you half the folks I sold a home to didn’t need to come within a mile of purchasing one in the first place but that wasn’t my call.  On the other hand there are deals which can serve well but the purchaser may have to give up some convenience by looking in these rural areas.  In my opinion I think we will see some foreclosures but no where near the rate in which we saw in 07-08.  A close law group called me last week to let me know they had quite a few foreclosures on the ledger and to be aware if I had multiple flips going on or new constructs but they also said it was nothing compared to 07-08 at the moment.",realcr8,t2_8uwvu59e,14,0,reddit2

It certainly could be, but there have been changes that may mean it's a structural adjustment.

When women joined the professional workforce in large numbers it triggered a permanent upwards adjustment in history prices because they were now being bought by two income couples.

When people started moving money so the government moved back the private sector and state retirement ages it again led to more years allocated to working which further moved prices forever higher.

> It’s set the stage for another bubble.

The market might retract, but it’s not going to pop like a bubble. 

There was a lot wrong with the prior bubble, but the main difference now is that people aren’t purchasing homes on speculation. Before, people had ARM’s and they knew they wouldn’t be able to afford the mortgage when the rate increased. They were speculating that the home value would rise enough that they would qualify for a low interest conventional mortgage and could refinance. 

When that didn’t happen, then they couldn’t afford their mortgage anymore and started to default on payments. Which further dropped the value of homes which caused others to not be able to refinance. All of which had knock on effects with the prevalence of mortgage backed securities. 

Today, people’s income is verified. People largely don’t have adjustable rate mortgages. If they are underwater on their home, nothing severe happens as long as they can pay the current mortgage payment. 

With high inflation, this actually gets easier to do (assuming a cost of living raise close to inflation, which payroll has been going up significantly). If a bulk of your monthly expenses are debt servicing, such as mortgage, car payment, student loans, life insurance, some capital improvements like a new roof or HVAC if you financed them, then inflation is helping.

So to recap, before home prices were going up as people were speculating that the prices would continue to rise and we’re using the future value to try to afford the current price. Today, home prices are going up due to lack of supply and high demand. If they don’t continue to rise, current buyers are still fine.",kiklion,t2_6tl3a,29,0,reddit2

hkf9jcs,t1_hkc0twy,2021-11-13 04:50:30,Economics,"I guess it depends.  Homes are both commodities and finished products.  The basics of the homes are made from commodities just tweaked a little to suit if you will.  The finished product is of course everything that makes that home unique.  Location, land, style, finishings etc etc.  With all being said the only true fire way to increase value of a home is by adding square footage.  

So for instance, let’s say you have two homes side by side that are reversed floor plans.  Same interior finishings maybe different colors is the only differences.  Same home just reversed.  A hail storm comes through and damaged the roofs in which both needed to be replaced.  One owner went back with 30yr dimensional asphalt shingle at a cost of 10k.  The other owners decided they would put a standard aluminum 5v roof only costing 6k.  A couple of years later they both decide to sell at virtually the same time and both go under contract for asking price within days apart.  Which home is worth more?  The answer is appraisers will not say which one is worth more as they are just trying to find the value in which the bank is asking a third party opinion if the value is indeed there to lend the money to the new purchasers.  A house is not a house without a functional roof as both are functional but one clearly cost more.  It’s not the appraisers take to give an opinion on which is better, only to relay to the lending institution that the value is there to make a deal.  Same thing with HVACs.  A home could have a 20k system that operated very cheaply and right across town the exact same home or very close could have 8k system that was functional and works but not quite as efficiently.  The 8k HVAC home sells for 200k and a month down the road with no change in market the 20k system home is wanting to sell at 210k and it doesn’t appraise for value.  Sometimes as homeowners you have to look at you likeness and not out-kick your coverage no matter how bad you want something.  It just may not be worth it and it’s not to banks quite frankly.  They don’t give a damn if you put real gold toilets in a 1500sq/ft starter home.  Matters not, as a porcelain toilet still gets the job done and is functional.  Now if everyone had gold toilets or a 20k HVAC system and you are the drag then you will be docked.  So what I’m saying is does a lot of owners in your area have a geothermal heat pump?  If so those costs could probably be offset.  It’s the same thing with swimming pools.  Very costly but if you are one of the few homes in a neighborhood that have one and 95% don’t you will not get the cost back out.  On the flip side if it’s the other way around you could be severely hit on worth.  Again look at your surroundings and build accordingly.",realcr8,t2_8uwvu59e,1,0,reddit2

I had good credit but not a lot of credit history of course.  I had a few thousand bucks worth of student loans I was paying off and 300$ vehicle payment.  So about 500/mo in debt.  I had been working for my dads GC crew since I was old enough to remember it seems and when I got out of college my career was not booming to say the least so I went back to work for dear old dad.  I wanted to go out on my own and and build some duplexes so I could cash flow them and make a few extra hundred bucks a month on what I was making under my dad.  So I went to my local bank and sat down with a LO and presented to them with plans on what I was doing.  I had the land already chosen and had the down payment for such.  With no hesitation these so called bankers were willingly going to give me an open line of credit of 1,000,000 at the age of 23!?  I needed like 360k for the first 2 duplexes and that was it.  Get those closed and rented and wait a few months before I broke ground on maybe another two.  Where and why did the 1 million come into play??  There were no limits in other words and many builders and people that were building homes straight up went way over budget knowing they had that huge cushion.  And that is how America broke itself.  Luckily I had more foresight to know and stay by budget as I survived the tank but it was pretty easy to see what was going to happen.

The word home can mean alot of things, technically it means whatever you want, wherever you feel at ""home"". But when people make these comments on forums and Reddit, when they say they'll never own a home, what they mean 90% of the time is a ""single detached home with a garage, multiple bathrooms, yard, etc"".

The reason I feel extremely confident in saying that is because of all of the underlying factors.

Supply isn't getting better anytime soon.  After the housing bubble new home construction slowed wayyyy down because there was so much inventory on the market.  Even if we wanted to go full production right now you couldn't.  Supply chain is fucked, workers are striking in historic numbers, and regulations kinda stop the US from doing it anyway.

That last one is important.  Federal action is needed to some degree, but Biden can barely pass things that poll at 90% approval.  He's not getting a housing bill passed.  And even if he did that would takes like decades to really feel it in the market.

A large number of my generation (millennials) are now able to buy a house finally, so there's a huge part of the demand as well as all of the COVID migrations.

Add on to that private capital scooping up houses.  Now I know ""But Zillow just got punished for it"".  That's a failure if whatever idiot programmed that algorithm they used not because it was a bad idea.  And ok they're selling off all that stock...to Blackwater not people trying to buy a house.

As we entered the /u/spez, the sight we beheld was alien to us. The air was filled with a haze of smoke. The room was in disarray. Machines were strewn around haphazardly. Cables and wires were hanging out of every orifice of every wall and machine.  
At the far end of the room, standing by the entrance, was an old man in a military uniform with a clipboard in hand. He stared at us with his beady eyes, an unsettling smile across his wrinkled face.  
""Are you spez?"" I asked, half-expecting him to shoot me.  
""Who's asking?""  
""I'm Riddle from the Anti-Spez Initiative. We're here to speak about your latest government announcement.""  
""Oh? Spez police, eh? Never seen the likes of you."" His eyes narrowed at me. ""Just what are you lot up to?""  
""We've come here to speak with the man behind the spez. Is he in?""  
""You mean /u/spez?"" The old man laughed.  
""Yes.""  
""No.""  
""Then who is /u/spez?""  
""How do I put it..."" The man laughed. ""/u/spez is not a man, but an idea. An idea of liberty, an idea of revolution. A libertarian anarchist collective. A movement for the people by the people, for the people.""  
I was confounded by the answer. ""What? It's a group of individuals. What's so special about an individual?""  
""When you ask who is /u/spez? /u/spez is no one, but everyone. /u/spez is an idea without an identity. /u/spez is an idea that is formed from a multitude of individuals. You are /u/spez. You are also the spez police. You are also me. We are /u/spez and /u/spez is also we. It is the idea of an idea.""  
I stood there, befuddled. I had no idea what the man was blabbing on about.  
""Your government, as you call it, are the specists. Your specists, as you call them, are /u/spez. All are /u/spez and all are specists. All are spez police, and all are also specists.""  
I had no idea what he was talking about. I looked at my partner. He shrugged. I turned back to the old man.

""We are waiting for someone.""  
""Who?""  
""You'll see. Soon enough.""

""Yes. What is /u/spez police?""  
""We're here to investigate this place for potential crimes.""

But now the value of housing increasingly is being determined by the maximum rent that can be extracted from it.  When you have a single housing market, and some homeowners are selling to other homeowners but some homeowners are selling to real estate investment companies who are pricing the housing based on maximum expected rent, the market will naturally cause prices to ascend towards the maximum rent valuation - it’s a single market after all.

A mortgage costs say $1200 a month at 6% for $250K just as a number.

Your point about ""inflation helps"" is dependent on correspondingly increased wages (which you do point out as an assumption).   So  folks who have debt prior to higher inflation might have more cash (due to wage increases triggered by inflation) to pay off those exists debts.   But they will pay more for new items going forward given higher inflation...

Now what about all the folks who recently bought homes on stretched budgets, who may have purchased houses with known issues (requiring expensive repairs) and who put off  capital purchases to afford these homes?   If inflation isn't transitory, then might inflation be the new ARM?  Meaning while their mortgage payments might not being increasing, the costs of  goods (food, energy, the car purchase they put off, the need to buy a new roof/HVAC, etc.) is going up and long term inflation burns through their safety net?

I'm not an economist nor play one on tv, but from what i can tell, long term inflation is consider problematic because wages don't tend to keep up.

I'm not arguing that inflation is transitory or long term but if inflation ends up being long term it might have the same impact as ARM...?",SeaworthinessOk4046,t2_8levvk91,5,0,reddit2

Plus renting usually means one can leave and choose another place very easily.

- Home prices rise during those three years and owner can switch to renting for their next station.  3 years is just the right amount to get tax-free capital gains tax break of up to $250K single/$500K married due to primary residence.

Many people frustrated at the market because they cannot own a ""home"". Density building will not make their ability to own a ""home"" easier, it will make it harder. It will make housing people easier, yes, but it's not going to make it easier for everyone to have their own ""property"" either.  

Condo and apartment living has never been considered owning property to me, even though in the eyes of real estate it technically is. But in reality, you don't own any land, you own a spot in land shared by others. Your HOA fees are the whim of others spending habits.

this is a problematic statement because the value becomes relative to itself and is a primary issue with fiat. there is no hard value to tether to in order to derive actual value. Current expansion of assets can be seen as increasing wealth, but really it's just decreasing value of currency. look at the Argentina stocks just before hyperinflation hit for a more objective example.

But many homeowners reap benefits that you can't get from renting, such as financial security and stability, tax deductions and a vehicle for retirement savings. With each mortgage payment, you get closer to fully owning the home. The equity you build can be leveraged for loans like cash-out refinances, home equity loans and lines of credit that can be used to improve the home and boost its value or be used in financial emergencies.
While renting can’t offer those long-term financial benefits, it’s cheaper to rent on a month-to-month basis, the analysis found. If you’re wondering how to save money for a down payment, renting can help you build that nest egg — but in extremely expensive or competitive markets, renting might be better for the long haul. If you’re considering buying, before entering the market, use a mortgage calculator to estimate the costs and compare mortgage rates to find the best deal.",pdoherty972,t2_qp4h5,2,0,reddit2

The question about where a Buyer gets their funds to buy the house really only affects the time required before money is transferred to the Seller.

If the Buyer has cash, then the Seller can close very quickly and receive the funds more quickly.

But if the Buyer needs to get financing to buy the house, then the Seller is stuck waiting until the lender goes through their own process to see if they'll lend the money to the Buyer to buy the house.

VA loans are just an insurance program that will reimburse the lender in the event the Buyer defaults on the loan and stops making their house payments. VA loans don't do anything for the Seller or otherwise provide any benefit at all to the Seller.

And VA loans will take around like 6 weeks to close, assuming the Buyer qualifies for financing and assuming the property passes the lender's and the govt's inspection process.

Conventional mortgage loans can take around 3 weeks.

Go talk to a real estate agent or families in your area. In Northern California all the cash buyers are people with families. I work in this industry. All the capital is being poured into multi family housing. Big companies don’t rent homes and they don’t like to sit on non income assets. Home rental is a lot of overhead if you want to have a margin or you pay your 6% to property management company which can put you at a loss.

Big companies are buying apartments and funding them. The home buying thing happens after a crash but the people who did that have either been renting at market rate or have already sold the homes. Again big companies are a teeny tiny slice of things. You hear big numbers like x company has 3 billion dollars worth of homes. Homes are expensive, that’s only 6 thousand homes. That’s not that many in the country. Somewhere between 200k and 300k homes are owned by large firms. Your uncle can make an llc to put the home under so we don’t look at just businesses owned.

I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move.

I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again.

There's a catalyst effect though.  There's huge income inequality between Millenials who went into tech and those who didn't; it's not unusual for the former to make $300K/year and the latter to make $30K/year.  But they're largely in the same social circles, having gone to the same colleges and lived in the same cities in their 20s.  People in the former group usually keep quiet about their money because they don't want to be rude, and have until recently had the same ""let's live in a cheap downtown apartment"" lifestyle.  The difference in salary all goes into financial assets, which have appreciated massively since 2010.  I know some Millenials who have consistently saved 80% of their compensation for 10 years; I know others who have been living paycheck-to-paycheck this whole time.

The pandemic up-ended everything, because a.) you're not seeing your friends anyway and b.) you need more space for home offices, yards, children, etc.  So folks who had money figured ""This is the time to buy, we need it now"" and snatched up the limited supply of homes on the market, and folks without money just got left behind.

Baby boomers aren't leaving the market for another 10 years or so.

If USD loses reserve status or if inflation catches wind we will likely see a double whammy of deflation in asset prices and inflation in consumer prices. 

I do think there is a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines in the hands of the wealthy waiting for this event. They will likely buy the dip and stabilize assets, however we must see this for what it is... a transfer of wealth.

The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again.

I remember job fairs all throughout College where companies would tell you something to the effect of ""to be honest with you about 70-80% of what you're learning won't actually be used with us"". It was more so about your background (which encompassed basic knowledge, and personal). 

Sure having some semblance of background in said field helps. Yet often times each business has there own ways and methods of accomplishing their goal (s) and or target (s). Which you learn by training on the job. Gaining experience with the job. Heck it's also known that some jobs require a multiple months training program degree or not.

There are also successful Bosses and CEOs who don't have a degree but have received an job opportunity, trained on the job, became proficient at the job, and worked their way up. On the flip side, there are plenty of people who know at least one Boss and/or CEO with a degree and/or ""scholastic accolades"" that are horrific at their job and know they have no business holding that position.

And of course there are plenty of people who got a degree in a specific field, and ended up landing in a totally different field. On the job training.

**(Edit, TL:DR) So, I don't feel sorry for said businesses/companies that claim that they are ""so desperate for workers but they can't find anyone who wants to work"". Because many of said companies don't want to pay while training on the job. Companies going through mental gymnastics all stemming from greed.

In college it's when you truly need to figure things out because truth be told teachers and curriculum aren't designed to ""teach you"" as much as see what you can do.

Fine, you know your book, now, what can you do with it? Do you actually understand how to make a profit about it? And how are you going to fill all the required tasks in a single week? Use your imagination and no, parents aren't going to talk with head-staff about how you got depressed on finding everything so difficult, you are an adult now.

There is also the fact you are basically tested to see if you are capable to grind through, you actually develop a lot of patience while learning to catch the in-between meaning of what you are being told, and you have to see how to make functional teams instead of buddies you spend the time with you but will drop at the first sight of work.

Are all these things enough for making you a good employee?

They are a start, but having a college degree is the best warrant a company can get about you having bothered both with the attitude and the strength of character to see the bitter end.

Oh, and just to add the next level, you are now competing against automation, which means it's not only not enough for you to have a good memory or being dedicated, you need to out-think tireless, utterly loyal physical and digital machines with perfect memory and no need for vacations, you need to show you are valuable, you need to show no machine can beat you, and you need to show them they can give you the task and it will get done better than if you just put some ERP software to do the things and you are a nice and friendly office companion while doing so, most of what we call experience is exactly that, the company asking you you to be likable and trusty.",Commander_McNash,t2_1u295zyv,1,0,reddit3

I disagree with the first part about mistakenly equating college completion with work aptitude.  Finishing that degree is a hell of a lot of work and and takes grit and perseverance.  You learn a lot about researching and critical thinking.  These are important skills that matter to any career.  In addition, even if your degree isn't specifically tailored for the job you end up in, going through your gen eds you pick up a lot of different useful knowledge like how math and science work.  You gain a lot of awareness of the world as you learn more about it.  That's not the same as experiencing being directly a part of it, sure, but at the same time this kind of perspective you don't pick up in your day-to-day experience either.

I definitely agree that self-acquired knowledge and nonacademic experience should still be valued but I hate to see all this anti-intellectualism growing in society too.  Casually implying that college completion doesn't translate in to some sign of work aptitude is ridiculous.  I have an IT career that required me to have a 4 year degree to be hired and also I was hired because I'd learned a lot about computers on my own.  I have a liberal arts degree and earning that helped shape me in to the person I am today and I call on the research and critical thinking skills and knowledge I learned every day.",ClutchReverie,t2_4n5uu,1,0,reddit3

Some hiring managers want any degree because ""surely they will be better than someone with no degree at all."" But that's not always the case.

Point is, they are hoping that affinity toward a degree will attract people who are motivated and good at learning. But what is motivating people to get degrees is the notion they will use them to get a great job that pays well and has good benefits.

Less and less companies are offering that. Instead, they get paid enough to live just ok. And they will work too much to make the money. And they will watch their student loan balance slowly shrink and slowly lose hope of anything changing. Then they will lose hope of retiring.

I was originally just going to get a computer network certificate, but I liked math enough to take the next class, college algebra, and when the class ended, my teacher said that there were 33 people who started the class (with a wait list), only 11 people finished the class, only 7 passed, and I was the only one to get an A.

Fast forward a few years, I decided to get a full degree and do all of the math. By the time I get to differential equations, we might have had 2 drops the whole time. The people who can make it through the crucible of calculus can hack it, and there is definitely a different ""quality"" of student at that level. I ended up with a degree in aerospace engineering, and that basically gets my foot in the door for whatever I want. It took me 6 years and I didn't graduate until I was 27, but even though I'm not doing engineering and still paying off my loans, I don't regret it.

And to agree with your lack of preparation, I had a geography class in which over half the class didn't know what major event precipitated the Benelux Agreement in 1944...",Snoid_,t2_4mgdrn1w,56,0,reddit3

Anything under graduate level at any non-ivy colleges is pretty meaningless, in my field at least. Although I stopped putting weight on such 'credentials' well beforehand.

> There are so many holes in this idea, banning asking for a degree?

Where a degree isn't required, it seems pretty reasonable, especially since they're probably going to have to waive the requirement anyway. Why is someone with a college degree applying for unskilled labor anyway?

Not that discouraging the employer from listing it as a requirement gets to keep a candidate from talking about their achievements.

> It doesn’t help that most Americans all want to go to the top 20 colleges because of the “ college scene”.

No, people who want to get into ""top"" colleges/universities are status seekers, they want to get rich working hard, marketing is a big dynamic here. Party colleges are entirely different places, one can even rent an apartment near one and skip the whole ""enrolling in college"" aspect of the thing to save a fortune.

Every major is terrible, there are 2 stem degree holders for every stem job in America, last I checked at least.

Zoologists don't just work at/for zoos, they're researchers first, that their subject is animals is secondary.

A country where 35% of the population is busy debating whether the earth is flat or a sky man wants them to make their neighbors live differently or thinks there’s pedophiles trafficking children on Wayfair that can only be stopped by a developmentally disabled sex predator best known for bad TV and failed businesses, has a hard time getting out of their own way on this stuff, especially when they’re too dumb to understand how much better their own lives would be with a bit more understanding of how the world works.

Then you end up with a society where a small subset of the population actually actively avoids education, denigrates those who pursue it, revel in their own ignorance, and actually make being stupid a core part of their identity. Not content to be a burden on their society in their own right, they actively work to destroy the opportunities others might choose to follow by making education more expensive and less accessible - the “if I can’t have it no one can” attitude that gets children sent for a time out. They block any move to address the things that would make education even more desirable, like the ability to command a larger share of the economic growth generated by the educated workforce, then complain that they’ve been left behind.  Finally, when they’re dragged kicking and screaming into a better world they adamantly want no part of, they attempt to destroy the very society they live in or even the planet itself to prevent it from coming to pass.

i went to a homeless shelter where i was required to be out looking for a job to be able to come back each night - but there was staff and resources to help with applications, with clothes and toiletries thanks to donations, an address. they helped me apply for welfare and food stamps and medical. once i got a job and proved i could stay in it for a month, they paid my first months rent and a deposit for an apartment. this was all government funded for the most part, with a lot of donations. i was on my own at that point, but i could still call them if i needed help. 

i would have likely died on the street if it wasn’t for California having a decent social services network in the late 90s. i am not unique - i’m a tangible, real example of how to successfully help someone succeed. they invested a year of welfare and food stamps, a couple of months of bed space, and some upfront cash to get me into an apartment. i make a very solid 6 figure salary right now and have paid taxes now for 22 years - well over $30k in federal taxes alone in 2021. because someone gave me a hand when i could still get up. 

this is how it should fucking work. this shouldn’t be “unique”. fucking conservative scream to the rooftops about bootstraps - they don’t acknowledge that bootstraps are an assistance, and a small investment in many many people who hit a tough patch could avoid so much pain and suffering we see. I get so tired of hearing “homeless people should just go get a job” and then when i tell my story and say how expanded welfare and social services could fix that, “oh you’re different. you’re not like other homeless people”. that’s absolute bullshit from people who have no clue. 

i met a lot of smart people on the street. a lot of people that were there because of things outside of their control. the only thing that made me unique was that i still had a little hope that it didn’t have to end like this - most of them didn’t have hope, because it had been beaten out of them. now, no one has hope because there’s nothing left to give a hand.",helicopter_corgi_mom,t2_317m31ir,15,0,reddit3

All of us who’ve been to college know the requirements are not indicative at all of how good a worker is. Everytime I’ve gone into work academically related I’ve found that college has nothing to do with it. Just the ability to say “oh yea i remember that”. I’m in school for accounting while I’m working as an accounts payable bookkeeper. Only the bare minimum applies. Hardest class is mergers and acquisitions and how often will i need to deal with that? Rarely if ever. What i do need to learn that college never teaches you is the most important thing is dealing with people who are always desperate for money and being the guy that cuts their checks. The social aspect of accounting is the most important thing to it and that’s true for most things. When I’m a job, whether you know it or not, you will still be trained or you’ll have competent people around you that love telling you how it’s done. This is targeted learning and it’s much more effective than the way you’re taught in school. Btw you don’t always need a degree for jobs that require them. Most of them are fine with “working on degree” and will forget the moment you start working. If they say how’s progress, say it’s hard to have time and they will understand if they are good people. Since particularly in fiscal (9 fiscal people for 300 clients and hundreds more vendors) everyone has a good idea of how busy everyone else is.

As an aside, I’ve been lucky to have never had a bad boss. I’ve always been adjacent to other departments or teams that have had them, but I’ve always been lucky to have really good people looking out for me.

The big takeaways is that test score is positively correlated with retention, graduation, and starting income. One interesting note is that higher scores are much positively correlated, while lower scores have much greater variance in outcomes. Doing poorly on the test is far less of a predictor of poor academic performance than doing well on the test is a predictor of success. 

One of the biggest criticism is that the test scores  are also positively correlated with family income. it's not actually a pure test of ability and if overweighted in the admission process really diminishes the potential for social mobility.

There's so many jobs you can get with a chemistry degree that I never knew even existed until well after graduating. Plus, college students interest in STEM fields is largely topical before they actually get some course work under their belt. A lot of students just have a vague idea of being a scientist, they don't actually know much about the field in detail and what the actual jobs surrounding it entails until much later.

Even if you do know, going through the actual courses and learning more about the field can change what you want. When I started I wanted to do computer modeling and computational stuff for environmental chemistry applications. But it turned out I'm a dumbass and my brain melts trying to comprehend any math beyond integral calculus. In the mean time, I really liked organic chemistry and started to focus more on that. Here I am 10 years later as an organic chemist in a subfield that again, I didn't even know existed.

How does this add up? Genuinely curious. A significantly higher amount of men participate in the labor force, but women overtake men as the majority of the US workforce?

It's like the entire Western world educated city ""elite"" that is interested in politics declared that there is general inequality between men and women. Then, this notion that there is inequality was started being applied everywhere.

There were barely such gross inequalities that demanded big action, millions of dollars in scholarships for women, etc. Statistics already showed that women were leading men in various fields - if not by achievements, then at least in numbers. Yet we as a society decided that it's fashionable to combat inequality everywhere - both in achievement inequality, and in number inequality. We started paying for women's education when women are more educated than men. Why? We're literally paying for empty goals. Taxpayers contribute to some girls that apparently need cash. I might not know enough about the system of scholarships in Western countries, but it also seems dependent on achievement - if you are a talented girl, then you get a scholarship. If that's the case, then it is even more counter-productive - some poor families pay taxes that eventually go into financing some smart people that are likely to make a lot of money in life anyway, all because they're female.

Many of these inequality programmes really show how much money we are wasting on empty goals and results. Such cash transactions do not seem to be motivated by efficiency or social justice. And scholarships is only a single example. Imagine how many wasteful ""Equal Opportunity Institutes"" there are that leech money to do studies which begin from ""men>women bad"" and ends with ""men>women bad"".

I honestly think that the situation in the US is multi fold:

*  maternity support is dismal. So not only is the birth expensive but most women have to quit there job, go on part time, of hire child care. So that’s another financial hit.

*  most carriers require higher education, which has led to delays in people starting families. The problem is fertility rates decline with age. Medically speaking, pregnancies after 35 are considering geriatric. Its a problem few people openly talk about and society is ill equipped to deal with.

>""we find asymmetric marriage-market impacts that depend upon the source of the shock: adverse shocks to labor demand in male-intensive industries reduce the prevalence of marriage among young women, whereas analogous shocks to female labor demand significantly *raise* the prevalence of marriage.""

Men having less relative income makes them less desirable to women, so marriage declines. Women having less relative income makes them more willing to commit to men.

>""we show that trade shocks lead to a differential rise in mortality from drug and alcohol poisoning, liver disease, diabetes, and lung cancer among young men relative to young women.""

Economic zones that lack male-earning households result in lots of male-specific behavior pathologies. This is a gender-specific effect and any worldview that doesn't treat men and women as having fundamentally different sources of status and fulfillment in the world is wrong.

>Holding female economic opportunities constant, shocks to male earnings raise the fraction of children living in single-headed households, suggesting that woman are curtailing marriage by more than childbearing. When female earnings fall, however, the share of children in single-parent households *declines* steeply.

It is not sufficient to say that ""people being poorer causes out of wedlock births""; It doesn't really. Rather, out of wedlock births are a function of relative sex status in resources and bargaining power. If women lose status, they need to hook up or stop having kids out of marriage.

fe30bhb,t1_fdte76k,2020-01-12 15:59:01,Economics,"We don't have the problems re prenatal/maternity care costs and postpartum support to that degree in Canada. In fact, I found the ""well mom/baby"" visits by the community health nurse to be annoying in their frequency (though I understand that they're beneficial and even vital for inexperienced moms who lack support from the father, extended family or friends, or who are suffering from PPD).

Despite this, our fertility rate is 1.6 per woman, lower than the US's 1.8.

Your fourth point hasn't contributed significantly to the problem (yet). Infertility affects 1 in 10 couples, but male infertility is the culprit in just 1/3 of such cases, and infertility does not mean sterile. It means a couple is having difficulty in getting pregnant.

The only way I can see this being a contributing factor concerns unintended pregnancy--you get less of it, which may not be the worst thing in the world.

While male infertility is on the rise, sperm banks exist. The fact that this particular man can't knock a woman up doesn't mean she can't get knocked up, if you get my drift.

As far as your third point goes, certainly it contributes to the problem, in more ways than one. Each woman is having fewer children, while simultaneously, the length of time between each generation is getting longer. This means that ""replacement fertility rate"" is a meaningless term.

Let's assume a fertility rate of 2 children, 1 boy and 1 girl, per woman, and that all children survive long enough to have children of their own. Now let's consider how delaying fertility plays out.

A woman has her daughter at age 25, her daughter has hers 25 years later, and so on. After 100 years, we have 4 generations of progeny from that initial woman. That's 30 progeny in 100 years.

Now, let's have her wait until age 33, and her daughter waits until age 33, and so on. After 100 years, we have 3 generations. Half as many (14) progeny.

Now consider that people are living longer than ever (let's say for the first group, life expectancy is 75, and for the second, its 85). Retirement age is 65, but instead of living 10 years after retirement, people are living 20 years beyond retirement. And let's only look at social security and medicare--taxpayer funded benefits that kick in at retirement.

The woman in the first example has two adult children at age 43, and 4 adult grandchildren at age 68. She's produced 6 taxpaying adults to provide the 10 years of benefits she'll need after she retires.

The woman in the second example has two adult children at age 51. Her grandchildren won't be born until she's already retired, and they won't be adults until she's a year from dying. She's produced just two taxpayers to provide twice as many taxpayer funded benefits as the woman in the first example. AND they'll have to pay those taxes while their young children are also consuming government services like public education, not when their kids are almost finished grade 12.

Tax (not just income tax, either) is the single unavoidable expense that has increased in terms of proportion of income since the 1970s. Food, shelter, energy, etc, has all gotten cheaper, while tax rates proportionately rise. This is because the ratio of taxpayers (working age people) to those who are net tax consumers (children and retired people) has significantly changed, and this would be the case even if fertility rates remained constant and only the age at which people have children varies.

We're in for a demographic collapse. We're staving it off through immigration, but the reality is, fertility rates are in decline everywhere, and poaching talent from developing countries has negative knock-on effects in those countries.

Brain drain and father absence are two of the most serious. For every two female MDs in the west who shift to part time work or don't return to work after having children, we poach one (usually male) MD trained at the expense of a developing nation's taxpayers, taxpayers who typically have worse access to health care. I live in an urban center in Canada. 2 of every 3 family doctors and specialists in my neighborhood are brown men who speak with accents. About a third of the rest are east asian men and women who also speak with accents. I have no problem with this in terms of feeling uncomfortable with a doctor who doesn't look like me (my family doctor is from Iran, and he's awesome), but it's a trend I've seen increase over my lifetime, and it worries me due to the bigger picture. Eventually, we're going to run out of foreign talent to exploit to compensate for our own complacency and self-indulgence.

People point to the huge surge in global population that really kicked in in the early 1900s, and say there's no shortage of people on the planet. But that surge didn't occur because people started humping like rabbits. It's because they stopped dying like flies. We're living on the tip of an asymptote that can't realistically continue to rise indefinitely. When it plummets, it's not going to be pleasant for anyone.

I'm not advocating for one side or the other, I'm just representing what I'm pretty sure is their argument. I believe it is an issue because it represents an inherent inequality between men and women. Due to how our society works, men would therefor always have more power than women.

>Why should we be encouraging women to pursue careers that most simply have little interest in if given the choice?

The issue IS that they don't have an interest. Many argue that this is due to society and that we hold some societal image of what a girl should be (think women should work in social services or be nurses whereas men should be the bread winning business leaders, doctors, engineers etc.). I'm not sure how to fix this issue, but I believe a popular method is by encouraging girls when they are young through youth women science camps and other shit like that.

>It is fantastic that women have equal opportunity to go into these fields, but striving for equal outcome is a very slippery and dangerous slope.

It is really about equal opportunity. In a perfect world we should see the demographics of a majority of industries be representative of the demographics of the country (i.e. same % of CEOs are Black and Women as the % of Black people and Women in the country). However this is not the case today despite their being what seems to be equal opportunity at face value; i.e. no legal barriers for any demographic to pursue any career. So there is now some underlying issue that is preventing the demographics to be equal.

Some believe it is inherent sexism or racism in the system. It all comes back down to the issue of ""interest"". Women might not be interested in pursuing a STEM career. Black people may not be interested in pursuing post-secondary or getting good grades which is what leads them to pursue other avenues such as crime and lower paying jobs. So why are they not interested? Are there distractions that prevent them? Do they not believe in the value of education? Do they have a lack of role models who have been able to go to college subsequently making them feel as if they are unable to pull it off themselves? There could be multiple reasons. But it all comes down to creating true equality of opportunity through shifting the interests of these minority, or traditionally less powerful, groups of people.",INCEL_ANDY,t2_1f10s1xh,0,0,reddit4

Every single time the subject of AI and automation comes up, any comment other than ""Humanity will be rendered completely obsolete any day now, next week at the latest"" just incurs an onslaught of downvotes and I really don't get the why of it?

There seems to be the two polar opposite camps divided along generational line, both claim the other is not being realistic, and it always seems like they're completely talking past each other. To the younger Redditors, realize we've been hearing that autonomous driving trucking is going to be rolling out nationwide any day now for almost 30 years! Having been on both sides, it feels eerily similar to the stances taken on any contentious scientific or technological subject by students in academia and professionals in industry. I've worked professionally with large scale AI/deep learning and computer vision systems and to be honest I'm honestly surprised we're not farther along on the path already. But there are still mountains of giant hurdles to overcome. The issue isn't with the technology, work there can be completed any day now, if it's not already. The issue is with the rest of the nation, laws, regulation, liability, insurance, and all of the other drivers on the road (and undoubtedly a billion other things). Other industries have a much easier time integrating new technologies quickly, as they don't have to tightly and seamlessly integrate with society, with 0 faults, on day 1. Are all 50 states on board with autonomous vehicles, do they have their laws and licensing of non-human drivers sorted out. Has everything been debated indefinitely in each state's congress and battled unions, all of the lawsuits, and anyone else who would want to prevent it? Like making it work perfectly is step 1 on the path to seeing autonomous trucking deployed nationwide, not the sign that we'll be driving next to them tomorrow. Just my 2c, and I know I'm too old and ""just don't get it"" and I will be called prejudiced against our AI betters but, things this big, with systems already as established as trucking is, just don't change overnight.

The idea that poor women in the US aren’t having more children as a result of the significant subsidies for doing so flies in the face of basic economic principles - people respond to incentives. 

Why would we expect highly educated and well paid individuals to have as many kids as low education/low pay individuals when the first group needs to pay hundreds, if not thousands per month for student loans, thousands for childcare and gets the privilege of getting a significant portion of their income in addition to thousands to deliver the child taken while the second group gets free delivery, free food, substantially reduced rent and subsidized childcare (all of which scale with the number of children with no cap)? It’s facially obvious ‘demand’ would be higher for group 2 than group 1. 

I know of several highly educated women who would have had their first kid years earlier (statistically increasing the likelihood of having more kids) had they received some of the “minor tax incentives” I mentioned (on a related note, how is substantially decreasing someone’s 1st or 2nd biggest expense a ‘minor tax incentive’).",riggmislune,t2_148bar2t,1,0,reddit4

The ubiquity of environmental endocrine disruptors in organisms, nanoparticles like those in odor absorbing socks killing friendly soil bacteria, tons of plastics in the ocean, etc, etc. 

As far as climate change, I am neither a denier nor a believer. My spouse had a paper on computer modelling published during his undergrad, and he and I are well aware of the predictive limitations of such models, particularly ones so broad in scope and with so many variables. That is to say, if you plug conditions from 1950 into these models and ask them to spit out the average global temperature for any year (or decade) between then and now, they can't do it, and the degree of inaccuracy compounds over time. 

There is one consistency in these inaccuracies, however--predicted temperature always seems to be higher than actual temperature. That's worrying. There should be at least a 50/50 chance that a model will err the other way, but there appear to be none that do. 

There are factors either missing, not well enough understood, or weighted incorrectly (or all three). Given that, the degree of certainty with which climate activists like Thunberg and AOC are telling us we have precisely 11 years (is it 10 now?) to act, I hope you will understand that one can be skeptical of the veracity of the predictions without being a ""denialist"".

Particularly in light of the radical economic and political prescriptions that tend to accompany such assertions. ""The earth is doomed, and only socialism can save it!"" coming from a socialist seems very convenient to me, especially considering the abysmal environmental track record of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.

There have been a number of papers recently that have attempted to refine things like variance in the effects of clouds, and improving the integration of 35 years of greening.

Still, you can see from the graph that inaccuracies compound over time--the spread of predictions increases from about 1C difference between lowest and highest, to more than 1.5C over the course of the last 20 years.

>Sowing doubt and ambivalence doesn’t make you a reasonable observer,

I disagree. As I said, when I look at the radical proposals to completely alter our political and economic systems to look more like those of the biggest polluters of the previous and current centuries (USSR, China, etc), I can't help but be skeptical. The Green New Deal, for instance, is not merely an environmental plan, it's also a proposal for a centrally planned, socialist economy.

To the rational observer, this appears to be a leveraging of public fear of climate change in order to promote radical left wing social, political and economic agendas.

>it makes you complicit with the coordinated efforts by moneyed interests to discourage consensus on climate change.

There are monied interests everywhere, on both sides of the climate change issue.

Why not appeal to the nuclear energy lobby to help promote the most reasonable, reliable and reliably profitable alternative to fossil fuels? Invest in technologies that streamline and multipurpose the extraction of oil (which we'll still need for production of plastics if nothing else) by, say, extracting lithium from the tailings instead of mining it all separately (an environmentally damaging process with a huge carbon footprint)? Why not promote innovations like the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, which aims to harness plasma fusion as a virtually limitless power source?

Wind and solar have reached a hard limit in terms of the physics (the days of leaps and bounds improvements in efficiency are over), and even 10 times better than a few decades ago, they're simply inadequate to the task of heating my home in -30C weather (like today), let alone charging an electric car whose battery (filled with pollutants mined at enormous cost to the environment, including carbon emissions) won't be able to withstand 80C seasonal variations of temperature without constant replacing.

If climate change activists were embracing more realistic solutions, I might be more on board with them. And if they weren't using climate change to push a radical political and economic agenda, people might trust them more.

Edit: Just to follow up, where are you going to get enough cobalt to build enough solar panels to retrofit every building in America? The Congo? That sounds nice--we wealthy westerners get to deplete the natural resources of a developing nation while artificially driving up the price of the cheap fuels they can afford. Who's going to risk permanent neurological damage to mine enough manganese to make solar and wind feasible when the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing? Oh yeah, South African miners.

We get our Green New Deal, high paying jobs, and a massive social safety net, while they get the strip mines, the tailings and meals cooked over garbage, wood and dung fires? Sounds like Utopia to me...",girlwriteswhat,t2_50vh1,2,0,reddit4

flypg99,t3_frtios,2020-03-30 22:15:32,Economics,"And it was largely preventable. 

The previous administration sat down with the incoming administration back in 2017 to walk them through a hypothetical in which the United States would have to deal with a pandemic worse than the 1918 Spanish flu. Many specifics were gone over, like the potential for a shortage of life-saving ventilators, and it was communicated that a coordinated, national response as quickly as possible would be necessary to control the outbreak and keep the numbers relatively low. Of the 30 or so transition officials who attended the presentation, nearly all have been let go, fired, or quit, including a National Security Council directorate at the White House that was explicitly set up to deal with a pandemic which was disbanded in 2018 by the White House. The US went from a state of preparedness to a state of being unprepared, and we're still in a situation in which the White House is regularly sharing false or misleading information and there are few if any vitally important orders or standards being shared at a Federal level to control the outbreak. 

This is an example of where policy and economics are inextricably linked. 

Looking at the responses to the pandemic in places like South Korea demonstrate where decisive action taken to institute a ready plan to deal with pandemic can mean that the rate of infection can be significantly slowed and governments haven't had to shut everything down. South Korea's health authorities came together in mid-January, months ahead of other nations, to develop a test, to work with pharmaceutical companies to produce the chemicals needed for testing, and put in place a significant infrastructure for testing not only of those with symptoms but even mild or suspected cases (remember, by mid-January we knew that COVID-19 could remain symptomless but transmittable for many days). This allowed the South Korean government to laser-target individual quarantine orders and to otherwise isolate those found with the virus. Most of those who quarantined weathered the illness like they would any other, but those who had more severe symptoms were already confirmed and could go to hospitals and be treated appropriately with all necessary safety measures in place. 

As a result of these policies, South Korea has been able to keep most factories, most retail shops, and most restaurants open, significantly reducing the economic contraction that we're now seeing in the United States. It's almost certain that while there will be some significant economic cost for South Korea in the short term, in the long term the economic cost will be negligible compared to countries which reacted slowly or poorly.

Want to see this more locally? The San Francisco Bay Area was one of the first hotspots for COVID-19 in the United States, and a number of counties in the Bay Area issued Shelter-in-Place orders two weeks ago, about a week after schools started closing. [According to this article, published this morning](https://brokeassstuart.com/2020/03/30/bay-area-curve-stays-flattened-ucsf-er-stays-quiet/?fbclid=IwAR1Od6FlK5MuEoWfolTcP5PUXkWEwViFb5LpikNFAmHNtZEa2S4wlLMTQgQ), indicates that local health authorities are seeing new cases of COVID-19 with severe symptoms leveling off. People with mild symptoms are doing the right thing and staying home, most people are respecting the shelter-in-place order and are engaging in social distancing behavioral rules. Compared to New York or New Orleans, the Bay Area is actually doing a lot better, and it's because local authorities acted before state or national authorities, many of whom are still fucking around.",Willravel,t2_31guv,22,0,reddit1

This implies that majority of the human population will have developed either an immunity by the beginning of the next quarter or a highly effective vaccine is made available and distributed to a majority of Americans.  I find it highly unlikely that America is going to have this virus buttoned up just in time for the next quarter.  I've seen projections that say this pandemic has a two year life span.

There are a number of properties I've been watching and many have dropped in price a bit, and several that were pending under contract came back on the market once this crisis hit. Buyer confidence is low, which is another bonus.

Seeing real, significant drops in pricing will require a longer-term impact on the workforce. The best bet for you is if people are unable to return to work for several months. You need people unable to pay rent, and you need landlords unable to absorb the loss.

You forgot to include ""largely"" with ""preventable"". 

[This is an example of how divergent responses have led to divergent outcomes](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/coronavirus-south-korea-america/), given that the US and South Korea saw initial cases at the same time and took radically different steps. [Further reading](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/26/821688981/how-south-korea-reigned-in-the-outbreak-without-shutting-everything-down). As of this morning, they've had 9,887 cases and 165 deaths. Compare that to the US. 

>It would had only been preventable if we had a 100% border shut down and mandatory detention/quarantine of any returning citizen. then we would have to keep the border locked down until a vaccine is developed.

After 9/11, I remember suddenly thousands of experts on controlled demolition appeared as if from nowhere to educate the rest of us about what it turns out they'd learned about online from reading a few articles and doing some pretty bad math. The weird thing was just how confident they were of their conclusions. 

No, actually, it wouldn't have necessarily required a complete border shutdown, though doing so from all countries instead of just China would have been smarter. And it certainly wouldn't have been necessary to shut down the border for 18 months. I know this not because I'm some internet genius, but because of South Korea, Singapore, and Germany, versus places like Italy, Great Britain, and the US. We can actually see different responses playing out in real time, to compare the outcomes. With the benefit of hindsight, laypeople can actually start to draw conclusions that health experts have known about for decades, health experts like those who were fired by the White House. 

>Trump would have been blasted by the media if he had tried such a thing months ago, hell he was called racist for banned flights from china.

He's been blasted in the media because thus far he's basically had no response other than to lie. 

Also he's [objectively racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump), so his decision didn't happen in a vacuum. One of the first things his administration did upon taking office was to put in place a travel ban not based on specific threats or any apparent facts but rather upon xenophobia. He has a history of travel bans based on his own personal prejudices. His current strategy appears to be to label the virus ""the Chinese virus"" instead of actually putting together a national response to a pandemic.

Were you furloughed due to the virus and did you have to go through the UI process? It's complete garbage. My partner was making upwards of 600 a week for over a year. He went through the painful unemployment application and what does he get? He gets $305 weekly. Why? They used numbers from his employment October 2018 to September 2019 when he was working at a job for most of that time making substantially less. Sound fair to you? Maybe he could fight it, but it's doubtful considering you can't get a human on the phone and the website times out half the time you try to use it. The cap in our state is 500 a week. Why is he not entitled to that? The truth is most people will shut up and collect their crumbs because they fear if they try to get what they deserve, they'll never see that money. 

As for that extra $600 people mention, I'll let you know when I see it. He still hasn't received his first measly check of $300. Thankfully I'm still employed and we can scrap by for the time being on my income.

We don’t even have enough test kits to test enough people to get a realistic idea of how huge the infected rate is. My best friend is a nurse who showed symptoms and was tested, and he’s been in quarantine for a week now just waiting for results from the hospital he works at.

They are in the labor force if they currently have a job or have looked for one in the last four weeks. That's always been the definition.

There will be some interesting numbers in Friday's job report and even more so in April's job report coming out in early May - particularly important will be U6, which counts people who did less than 35 hours of work during the survey week but wanted to work more, which I suspect will be extremely high, and the weekly hours average, which I suspect will be historically low. 

The survey week for Friday's job report, unfortunately, is March 8th through the 14th, so before things got really bad, so I would be surprised if we were at 10% headline unemployment at that time.

So let’s say a worker was making $1,100 per week in New York; she’d be eligible for the maximum state unemployment benefit of $504 per week. Under the new expansion, she gets an additional $600 of federal pandemic unemployment compensation, for a total of $1,104, essentially replacing her original paycheck.

**Medicare payment will increase.**  
Normally, mandatory across-the-board cuts in federal spending enacted into law, known as sequestration, would require Medicare to reduce payments to providers by 2%. The stimulus temporarily lifts that reduction from May 1 through December 31, 2020. The effect: increased payments to PTs, hospitals, home health, and other care. The legislation also prevents scheduled reductions in Medicare payments for durable medical equipment through the length of the COVID-19 emergency period.

**Telehealth could expand under Medicare (if HHS can be convinced to do it).**  
The package gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to waive restrictions on telehealth for providers, including PTs, who aren't currently allowed to provide and bill for telehealth services to Medicare beneficiaries. So far, that waiver hasn't happened, and [APTA is urging its members and stakeholders to join a grassroots effort to press for the change](http://www.apta.org/uploadedFiles/APTAorg/News_and_Publications/Latest_News/News_Items/2020/APTATemplateLetter_CMSWaiver.docx).(Note that while CMS has approved the use of ""e-visits"" by PTs, that's a limited type of digital communication and not same as telehealth.)",Celt1977,t2_13c2yw,2,0,reddit1

flywhab,t1_flymi0b,2020-03-30 23:21:54,Economics,"3 major factors

- Vaccination
- Data Reliability
- Medical Infrastructure

Points to as why those are important 

1. A vaccine being delivered would let us all get immunity and risk of being exposed gets minimized and our infrastructure will be able to handle those that are currently sick and we can send everyone back. Or those that are sick will need the infrastructure to be bumped up to handle current cases. This will take 6 months to 2 years and we don't know exactly when and it is just a guess. We have many viruses without vaccines (HIV, Herp, Etc)

2. We need to know how many people have caught it and are immune to it. If the number is high then we can start considering letting exposure grow again. But this is also tied to how long immunity lasts. Is it weeks vs years vs lifetime. We don't know the answer to this as testing and data is lacking. A majority of people need to have been exposed before we consider this option, and we need to know re-infection risk. We can't assume that re-infection is 0% and then get caught off guard by a second wave of cases.

3. We need to know how many people currently have it vs how many are hospitalized. So 100,000,000 people have it we need X amount of beds ready. Once again, we need reliable and frequent testing (we don't have this either)

Right now we don't have vaccines, we don't have data, and we do have our hospitals/morgues/etc at max capacity during isolation. We need to see our infrastructure drastically expand to handle a massive number of cases before having everyone go back to work or we'll have an insane amount of avoidable deaths. 

Will treatment and infrastructure be set up to handle the number of people getting infected in the next 2 months? Hard to tell, but right now we don't have capacity and treatments so until we do were on lockdown.",mebeast227,t2_64b9z,3,0,reddit1
flzs3s9,t1_flymi0b,2020-03-31 05:17:34,Economics,"Mostly, what the other guys said. But even if the virus issues are over in 2 months (which they probably won't), not everyone will be ""back to work"" in an instant, you don't just press the 'start' button on the economy. The entire supply chain needs to be rebooted.

Restaurants, for example rely on suppliers. Those suppliers need inventory. For the inventory to be there, production at farmers, butchers and specific factories needs to be running. Also, those restaurants might have fired personnel, so they need to be re-hired. There's about a 0% chance that they'll hire the exact same people again, because other, restaurants are hiring too, so this will also take weeks.

Then there's wage cuts and jobs that just won't return. Companies will have to pay back some of the money the government is handing them and before they do, they can't give out dividends and bonuses. So they'll cut wages in order to pay back those loans faster. And they might not rehire some people that they kinda wanted to get rid of anyway.

It's offensive and neglects all progress that the generations since have worked hard to put into place.  

People out of work in the 30s were in dire situations that have almost no parallel today except in extremely poor developing nations due to a large swath of the country lacking basic infrastructure, and entire communities that had been formed around industries and agriculture which suddenly no longer existed forced mass un-regulated migration on foot.  The pervasiveness of homelessness into regular society, encompassing entire cities/counties/state, was deeply shocking and drives a lot of our social class makeup today.  

There were no widely-adopted centralized credit bureaus to rely on for lending to people, there wasn't even a place for people to go to for information except newspapers, which weren't widely available or affordable, and were going out of business at an equal rate as everything else.  People were burying what little money they had in secret caches around the country due to lack of trust in the banks, people were growing their own food, and raising livestock on land they were squatting.  Even if you had tons of money in the banks before the crash, too bad - FDIC insurance didn't exist so your money just disappeared forever with no recourse.   There were absolutely no financial or food assistance programs accessible to the vast majority of people.   It was a complete and utter breakdown of society into lawless bartering and a desperate claw for survival.  

Your bullet points refuted:

\- ""high school education..."" - absolutely absurd point.  High school education was more valuable because RELATIVELY FEW HAD IT.  I've never seen the idea that having more people be educated listed as a failure of society before, way to go. 

\- ""medical care was affordable"" - again, absurd beyond all reason.  Tell that to one of the hundred of thousands/millions of people migrating across the dust bowl on foot, without a dime to their name, that, when they get to a hospital hundreds of miles away, that is already overcrowded/rampant with infection and lacking in basic capability, that it will be relatively more affordable than a 100 years later! 

\- ""Labor had high value""  - yeah, that's because how hard you worked and how many of your self-planted crops flourished directly determined how much your family could eat that year.  Are you budgeting your daylight hours during this crisis so that every minute of manual labor available to you counts towards feeding your family?  That is the level that millions of white collar workers of the day were reduced to.  So yes, that sure does put the value of labor into perspective.

\- ""Community and religious networks still looked after people"" - with what? nobody had any money, churches included.  Are you suggesting society was better because churches were our safety net?  Are you advocating a return to a barter system that was widely in place for most communities?  And your point is seriously that an unregulated barter system among the poor is better than what we have available to the impoverished today? 

The fact is that people in poverty today have access to a wide support network that was unthinkable in the 1930s thanks to decades of dedicated progress and regulation.  We can and should be doing more but good god we are so much further than we were in the 1930s.

fly3w17,t1_fly1t49,2020-03-30 19:04:13,Economics,"That's not where you get hit. Property (including those on your car) & sales taxes soak up a shocking percentage of your income when it's that low. The problem is that a substantial amount of inelastic spending, such as that on transportation, is not protected from tax like basic food stuffs. Insurance also tends to be a relatively flat proportion of your income, until you get to the low end and it gets disproportionately expensive (this is typically due to low income earners being unable to afford higher deductibles with better rates, since they don't have the money to make use of the better rate beyond the deductible). So not only is your effective tax rate higher, but your ability to spread your money is less.

It's the boots problem. If a relatively rich man buys boots, he buys an expensive pair that lasts him 10 years. If a relatively poor man buys boots, he can only afford the cheap pair that lasts him a year. Over those ten years, the rich man will have only bought one pair of boots and in real terms spent less money than the poor man.  This is how sales tax works, and it's why it's a tax disproportionately on the poor.

It's kind of a crazy, not very virtuous loop: top tier tech companies will spend whatever it takes to get world class talent here, and a lot of it, thus driving up the cost of living because there's not enough housing, and long-established people who own houses don't want to allow more housing to be built, because that would lower their quality of life.  (And this is definitely a reasonable point of view.)

This is, of course, a vast over-simplification, but those are some roots of the crazy prices here.

I've been paid very well to work in various tech companies over the past 11 years, but I'm old enough to be the parent of most of my co-workers, and I'm definitely looking for an 'out' at this point.

Once /r/starlink becomes a thing, hopefully pretty soon, we're going to buy some property in a rural area and settle there, while I work full time remote for startups or whatever companies allow full time remote work.  That's a minority, for now, but there's still plenty to choose from.  And, I suspect, full time remote work will become even more available after the ongoing crisis sorts itself out.

A lot of people will have and recover from this in that timeframe. Not the 60% you're shooting for, but maybe 10%? Taking into account that, since the symptoms only present in 40% of cases, probably already a lot of people have gotten it and recovered from it.

This level of optimism requires a set of innocent assumptions, which sadly do not actually hold in the real world: things are on pause because of the virus, get rid of the virus and we can suddenly unpause. Right? Just like it was before. Demand will be right where it left off. The problem is the virus has actually caused damage. There is a cost there that needs to be accounted for. For instance, if you have a set of spinning gears and suddenly throw in a object to jam them, they will stop spinning. If you remove said object the gears will start spinning again. This is what many people are expecting to happen once the virus ‘goes away’. But what if when you throw that object into the spinning gears it actually breaks teeth off the gears? Those gears will not spin as they did before. That is the issue at hand here. The real problem is that we do not yet know how large the true cost will end up. We don’t know how many teeth have been (and will continue to be!) broken from the fragile spinning gears that constitute our economies. There are so many cause and effect relationships within our economies and societies that it’s not possible to predict where this will all land.

The key word being *confirmed*, these are people that have been tested and had a positive result. The actual number of infected is likely much higher, by some estimates more than an order of magnitude (placing it currently around 0.1% of world population). Growth rates of confirmed cases are at 10% per day so we're seeing a doubling each week. Given that many countries have not locked down, nor acted significant measures the peak number of infected could possibly reach hundreds of millions.

You're right that unless it's the worst case scenario 70% of the world is not going to get infected in the first wave. But it's likely to be a not-insignificant percentage. With each wave there will be less and less people able to get the disease

Do you have a source for the claim that it comes from the tax return? Generally when I've seen people making this claim, they're misreading a poorly-written Forbes article in which they talk about how if your income is above the start of the phaseout and you make more in 2020 than you did in 2019, then you might have to pay some of the check you get back, because of the weird thing they're doing where they're *predicting* your credit based on your 2019 income but then it's *actually* based on your 2020 income.

So in the really extreme case where you made under $75,000 in 2019, and then made over the final phaseout (something in the neighborhood of $120K I believe) in 2020, then you would get the full $1200 check but have to pay it back on your tax return. 

But if you make under $75K in 2020, none of these considerations apply to you, and regardless of whether it *does* apply to you, the fact is that the check is not coming out of your tax return. It is a refundable tax credit based on your 2020 income.",percykins,t2_pi5q1,21,0,reddit1

For one, many expenses also go down right now. A restaurant is buying fewer ingredients to sell, airlines are spending less on fuel, etc. It's also the case that these are low-interest loans and many hundreds of billions of dollars of them will end up being forgiven anyway. 

Another big expense many are saving on is wages by furloughing employees, effectively having their salaries covered by the unemployment benefits system right now. In a way this acts as a huge subsidy to businesses that rely more on services, which are the hardest hit by this.

In all of these cases, unemployment/jobs data was very misleading. In the mid-1970s, unemployment was high, but demand (in terms of nominal spending) was growing too rapidly and so there was persistent inflation (stagflation). The same was true in the early 1980s, when inflation was very fast in 1980-1981 even as unemployment was high.

In the late 1990s and late 2010s, we saw the opposite phenomenon. Low unemployment and excellent job growth coincided with low and stable inflation, because demand was on track.

My post got removed for asserting the same thing.

Only a fraction of the inflation is actually caused by wage growth.

However, the major worry is wage inflation.

People are being paid more because they are demanding more because of the strong job market.

The elites are not happy with people making demands (both in terms of working conditions and wages).

So they want to kill the job market so we have to wage-slave.

Cramer, and other shills, have said that the only way for inflation to get under control, is for people to lose their jobs.

If too many jobs, not enough workers endures it creates a spike in worker wages which will then affect inflation. The pay raise would effectively be nothing then. Economic changes should be slow and forecasted. Also, higher interest rates means it is harder for new businesses to form or existing ones to expand which would be in line with balancing jobs to workers.

Entities (banks, hedge funds, big corporations) with lots of cash to invest do very well, some of it drips down to the masses in the form of appreciating wages. That’s the trickle down easing bit. Companies issue more stock to raise capital.

Meanwhile, banks aggressively market loans to anyone who needs money, which is attractive due to low interest rates. They repackage those as derivative products and sell them to pension funds and indirectly to individual investors via mutual funds and ETFs, misstating the risk levels associated with them. They are complicated after all. In the process removing their own risk. Companies start raising prices since money is moving more freely. A rising tide lifts all boats. Companies use the free cash to buy back stock and issue dividends rather than invest in innovation and efficiency.

But rock bottom & artificially lowered interest rates result in no headroom to respond to economic headwinds. Lo and behold, a “black swan” arises. No conspiracy, just bad stuff will happen from time to time. Fed signals intentions to raise interest rates just a bit but the party is not over. Smart money cycles from growth stocks to staples and fixed capital. Banks, senior Fed staff, large corporations and politicians make noises to the public about how it will be a soft landing while divesting themselves of risky assets. Fed starts making noises about labour being too strong, landing might not be so soft, inflation is still too high. Buybacks continue. Companies aggressively raise prices, citing inflation, and book record profits. Buy back more stock, issue more dividends. Actually the landing will be pretty hard, buckle up.

Fed starts saying we need more unemployment to get this under control. Sorry. Aggressively raise rates. It has to be done. Consumers get pinched but those who cycled to staples still get paid. Discretionary spending dries up, companies start layoffs citing economic climate. Prices rise more, still citing inflation. Labour’s negotiating power dries up, wages drop, you’re lucky to have a job. That’s trickle-up tightening.

Then after a bit of this, inflation is back under control, wages are low, and all the distressed assets that can be bought have been bought. Congress starts buying stocks again. Noises are made about getting the economy going again. We need stimulus. Tax break for corporations from congress and the Fed twists the knob back the other way.",SirPitchalot,t2_5ya7va27,2,0,reddit2

When a large inflationary shock happens, all a business has to do to raise prices is change their marketing materials and a few lines in their PoS system.  This lets price changes happen very rapidly, oftentimes within days.

For an employee trying to raise their wage, *best case* they have to wait for their annual review and hope their employer ups their CoL adjustment.  *Worst case* they need to quit and find a new job, and only after all their employers' competitors have realized that there aren't enough workers to be found at the prevailing wage and they need to offer significant salary bumps to entice people to come over from competitors.  This often takes years.

As a result, *during the transition period* employers can reap large windfall profits, because they've raised their prices early but don't have to pay higher wages for years.  But eventually, the market equilibrates and the windfall profits are competed away.",nostrademons,t2_1w5b,11,0,reddit2

If they were paying .25 cents per bracelet before COVID and inflationary pressures and selling them for 2.50, they had a return of 10xs the cost per bracelet. 

Today, let's say because of clogged shipping lanes, prioritizing of certain goods, contractual sensitivity of suppliers, they're paying a dollar per bracelet. 

Instead of sucking it up and going, ""Nobody NEEDS slap bracelets, we are just a fun fad, so we can't expect 10xs what we pay for these... the company can survive and grow if we just mark it up to $3.75 or just under $4 at the highest.

 But nope... in this world, the U.S. mostly, these bloated scum sucking greedy pig corporations have grown to ACTUALLY BELIEVE that we won't ever pinch a penny even when it comes to shit we don't need. 

So this hypothetical company would be like, ""Yeah, it's obvious, $10.00 for a slap bracelet now. They have to pay it, who cares about optics, the margin must remain the same.""

Housing isn’t all that difficult to figure out here. Mortgage rates bottomed at around 2.5%, which mean that prices adjusted upward to capture this shift in the market. 

US home ownership rates have been on a wild ride since the housing bubble in the early 2000s. Even after all of the drama, home ownership stands at [65.9%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/home-ownership-rate) which is close enough to prior periods. 

Furthermore, not everyone wants to own a home. Maintenance is super expensive and some people don’t want to stay in the same home for 5-10 years, so why should they buy?

College tuition is the result of society pushing for everyone to attend college, regardless of what they want to do with their life. Meanwhile, supply grew much slow than demand did, so price adjusted upward. 

Let’s look at student loans, since that’s where we will inevitably end up:

Percentage of College Graduates With Student Loan Debt: 58% of students graduating with bachelor’s degrees reported leaving school with student loans — approximately 2 million people.

Average Student Loan Balance: $39,487

Average Loan Balance by Borrower Type:

Undergraduate Student: $29,100 (Federal and private student loans)

Graduate Students: $59,313 (Grad PLUS Loans only)

Parent Borrowers: $29,528 (Not inclusive of private parent loans) 

[Source](https://www.elfi.com/student-loan-debt-statistics-us/)

Average loan balance is ~$40k. What do you get for that $40k in loans? Per the government you earn an additional $650k-$900k when you earn an undergraduate degree.

If people have to work multiple jobs to survive, and if while unemployment is at its lowest and poverty numbers are increasing, then your workforce isn't actually healthy and unemployment is a perverse metric. 

Since you made the rebuttal, I am asking you to provide qualified proof that simultaneously unemployment is down + people holding multiple jobs is at an all-time low. 
Your argument of it being ""good enough for the government"" is also not true because the Federal reserve and other areas takes its own measures/numbers because it finds the BLS inaccurate and underserving.

I agree that single family zoning is a too much regulation problem (one created for racist reasons too), but since the commodities futures modernization act deregulated Wallstreet, the primary drivers of housing price inflation has been financial speculation.  Housing prices prior to 2008 got that high because of perverse incentives for financial entities. Regulations on products like synthetic CDOs and misleading practices in lending prevented a similar bubble from happening in the years between the Texas crash and 2008.

Housing prices rallied for 6 years before home ownership did, which shows that something other than demand for homes among people who live in them is driving up the price.  Just so happens that right now, 1/3 of the new home purchases are made by the equities industry. 

The BIS and IMF have both shown that the growth of finance in advanced economies is a net drag of GDP.  We're watching a scenario where historically racist regulations have combined with deregulation on behalf of finance which is swelling the coffers of an industry whose growth is inversely related to GDP, and it's obliterating the financial health of most Americans.",Kim_Jung-Skill,t2_93sb4,1,0,reddit2

j7q5k2t,t1_j7ncc0u,2023-02-08 16:58:01,Economics,"> I'd think more people with more money means more spending means a stronger economy

Economics is just not this simple. Sometimes more people with more money means a stronger economy. Sometimes it doesn't. In this case, combine ""lots of money"" with ""low supply"" and you get higher prices. This is one of many reasons we (Trump aside) target modest growth over the long term, because otherwise we get massive boom-bust cycles. The boom part feels great of course, but it makes everyone worse off during the bust. The fed has done pretty well all-in-all, if you compare to how things were during the depression and earlier

""More money for more people"" at a guiding principle would just mean more zero percent interest rates forever, which certainly seems like a path many learned (non-conservative) people think is wrong. And for the things you want people to have more money for, the answer is political and getting Congress to pass various welfare programs we unfortunately lack while raising taxes appropriately. The fed is just here to manage the money circulation part.

Maybe the fed is handling things wrong right now. Maybe it isn't (and the fed isn't complain about student loan forgiveness or whatever. Don't conflate dumb Republican political arguments with what the fed is doing). But I'm confident neither you nor I are in much of a position to judge that",,,1,0,reddit2

Looking at the 10-K's and 10-Q's of these companies would reveal gross margins that stayed materially consistent year over year. If they were gouging then the margins would be higher. 

Net margins are higher but the there have also been less capital projects which means less operational costs. Most of these companies utilize fixed costs that have spared them the affects of inflation for now. 

So, what we see is high revenue selling product dominated by a global market, nothing insidious there. 

Relatively consistent gross margins which means their costs of productions have scaled with the increase in revenue. Nothing insidious there

Then, Oil companies not engaging in capital projects, utilizing fixed costs, etc. Still doesn't seem insidious. 

So, where's the price gouging at? I see an industry with diminished supply potential due to Covid and a war in Ukraine matched with high demand. Add in the fact that it's a global market for a product that is generally not differentiated so price is mostly set by supply and demand and not by the companies themselves.

C'mon my guy, you know how this works. You make the claim, it's not on me to do the homework of backing it up.

Edit because I feel I'm being mean and I got bored of waiting: you know liberal arts data includes the physical sciences, right? Including all the post-grads who wind up in graduate programs or university positions where they make <50k a year. Liberal arts != humanities. 

Since I'm assuming you mean humanities and not ""liberal arts"", your numbers change quite a bit. Liberal arts majors *have* grown, but humanities are actually down, with less than one in 10 students graduating in the humanities, and were pretty low in the early 90s as well, nearly 25 years after the federal government started guaranteeing student loans in the 1960s. They've dropped eight straight years in a row.

One of the largest single area of growth in the last 30 years has been business degrees, which are up 60% or so; engineering degrees have more than doubled in the last decade. Health and medicine has tripled.

So this narrative that government-backed loans supporting bs humanities degrees (which comprise less than a tenth of all graduating degrees) causing exploding student debt is not really backed by the data.

Hence why I've asked what people consider bs degrees, because it's always some dumb complaint about gender studies (which comprises a truly minuscule number of degrees conferred, like less than a percent of a percent), the absence of which would barely be a blip on the balance sheet.",Dyssomniac,t2_5bw0j,2,0,reddit2

I believe they also have deep misunderstanding of the problem. The overwhelming majority of the inflation we currently have is due to unadulterated greed on the part of the rich and corporations. 

They ran their supply chains as tight as they could squeeze them, with as little extra capacity for emergencies, now they are constantly breaking. 

They have steadily paid worse wages and provided worse working conditions for truck drivers, upon which almost all goods rely for transportation. Now they cannot hire enough of them. 

On top of all that, for every 50 cents cost went up, they added another 50 just because they could. Nearly every industry in America is so consolidated that 4 or fewer companies own 80% of the market share (some it's just ONE company owns that much). Which means effectively they don't have to truly compete with each other, and can basically overcharge and provide a steadily worse product with impunity. All this because the politicians they've bought with their record profits have GUTTED the FTC to the point where it's a joke.

Innovation in America is Apple giving their phone's camera a couple more megapixels and then launching a massive marketing campaign to pretend they reinvented the friking wheel at best. At worst, it's figuring out ""What's the cheapest artificial shit we can put in this and still technically label it as food?""

At their core, corporations exist to make a profit that's it. The way they are currently modeled and run, the ONLY thing that matters, is the effect of next quarters earnings report on the stock price. F the customer, f our employees, f the whole damn planet.

Awhile back someone did a study after the whole ""corporations are people"" bs, testing to see based on their actions, how a corporation as a person would score on personality test. 100% of them came back as violent sociopaths. Which should come as no surprise, if the short term stock price is the ONLY thing that matters, the ends ALWAYS justify the means. A corporation can start out with amazingly good intentions, but as soon as it's a publicly traded company, it will inevitably reverse course. 

Hell corporations for the most part aren't even good at looking out for their own long term interests. How many corporations have no or very limited paid sick leave? Study after study (and basic fucking logic) has shown that if sick people feel comfortable staying home (and have the means to do so), they will, preventing the spread of illness that would otherwise negatively impact the productivity of many people, instead of just one.

Further argument at this point falls under the category of ""moving the goalpost"". 

We're talking macro-economics here. Unless you can show me that those ""companies within the same period where the stock price collapsed"" lost more value than the companies where the reverse was true (companies that I believe are in the larger category) then your point is moot as the net economic boon was in favor of the companies rather than the individual shareholder. 

The overall stock market seems to agree with this position, whereas it has retained it's value overall while the percentage owned by public investors has dropped. 

According to the federal reserve, the ""top 10% of wealth holders in the US, account for 89% of stock ownership"". As per 2021.  

So, unless that percentage drops (it's not) stock buybacks could be distilled down to that 10%, gaining more ownership of companies that are publically traded.

$65-69k a year is on the low end still $11,000 more per year than the average American salary as a whole, which translates out to around half a million more dollars earned over the career (assuming the average person retires at the same time). Which means the only reason a humanities degree would be a poor investment for the average person is college debt specific to the US, not because getting a humanities degree is an inherently poor investment. 

Obviously this doesn't get into anything such as the notion that pay is the sole indication of utility, given the intense complications surrounding questions of salary, nor the fact that such government-backed loans exist in other systems (I'm specifically thinking Norway) and they suffer no such similar inflation in tuition. Liberal arts is also a gigantic field, and very few people actually major in liberal arts.

I also added an edit above, but putting it here in case you didn't see:

> 
Since I'm assuming you mean humanities and not ""liberal arts"", your numbers change quite a bit. Liberal arts majors have grown, but humanities are actually down, with less than one in 10 students graduating in the humanities, and were pretty low in the early 90s as well, nearly 25 years after the federal government started guaranteeing student loans in the 1960s. Humanities degrees peaked at only around 220,000 in a year, which never really went above 10-15% of all degrees conferred.

> One of the largest single area of growth in the last 30 years has been business degrees, which are up 60% or so; engineering degrees have more than doubled in the last decade. Health and medicine has tripled.

> So this narrative that government-backed loans supporting bs humanities degrees (which comprise less than a tenth of all graduating degrees) causing exploding student debt is not really backed by the data.

> Hence why I've asked what people consider bs degrees, because it's always some dumb complaint about gender studies (which comprises a truly minuscule number of degrees conferred, like less than a percent of a percent), the absence of which would barely be a blip on the balance sheet.

tl;dr - the humanities majors being some huge section of college degrees, humanities majors being useless, and humanities majors being a glut of people working are starbucks are functionally myths.

Excerpt:

>Starting Tuesday, companies with at least four workers that post a job that may be performed in New York City will be required to include salary ranges, whether they advertise jobs online, in a job fair flier or on internal bulletin board. 

>Similar laws for job ads have been enacted in Colorado, California and Washington State. And since 2017, four other states have adopted laws requiring companies to disclose a pay range to job candidates at some point in the interview or negotiation process, according to the National Women’s Law Center.

>As transparency rules take effect in some of the country’s largest job markets, their proponents hope that pay disparities for women and workers of color will narrow. 

>In 2020, women earned 84 percent of what men earned, according to Pew Research Center, and the gap was wider for women of color. In the federal government, where pay rates are public, women made on average 93 percent of what men earned in 2017.

>New York City’s law has been met with some resistance by employers and recruiters, who argue that it will introduce hurdles in an already tight labor market.

>The law will be enforced by the city’s Commission on Human Rights; employers face fines of up to $250,000 if they do not comply after a first offense.",marketrent,t2_fj9vsvfd,147,0,reddit3

I suppose the answer to the second one is that the exceptional candidate doesn’t apply to your position, because they know their worth and apply to the job that offers $90-$100k.

It’s not that a black woman and a white man are both working as grocery store clerks, the white man is paid 20$ an hours and the black woman is paid 12$ an hour. 

At the very top of industry, virtually all are men. They are working 90 hours a week and do nothing else but work. Very few women are willing (or want) to do that. Also, most men don’t either. It’s a fraction of hyper successful men that make most of the money. So is that discriminating against the rest of the men too???

We need the  ideologues to stop spewing the lies about the “wage gap”. It’s toxic to the rest of the 99% of men. Do these people think it’s a good idea to alienate them? Do you women want good partners anymore? Then stop saying lies like all white men need to be stopped from stealing money from women and minorities. You may as well throw the rest of the men in with that bed add they don’t make that money either.

Now, couple this with saying that the buyer will offer a fixed price in all cases. Those with premium value will avoid the buyer unless their offered price exceeds the value. The buyer will set their price based on the risk of buying a lemon and will assume that there is now far less chance of getting a premium car vs a lemon, as lemon sellers will be lining up for the buyer.

And why does that make that talent unobtainable for them? Because the talent now thinks they could make more elsewhere.

That doesn't follow. The company still needs someone for that role.  They still want to pay the least for it that they can get away with and still fill the role, that has always been true. But now, if anything, they'll need to offer more to get anyone.

At the same time, that better candidate, that's now going to apply to and get the higher paying jobs, gets paid more.

Before:

Strong candidate got a meh paying job at Cheap Co making 80k a year because they didn't know better.

Strong candidate gets a great paying job at Moneybags Co making 150k. Cheap Co still needs the role filled, so they hire a worse candidate for 50k because the good ones aren't applying there anymore. 

Where's the drop in wages?  Putting the rational arguments aside, there's also the self evident behavior of businesses. Companies want to pay the least they can for the labor of a sufficient quality and quantity.  There's never been any law against advertising pay.  If doing so was associated with lower pay, it would be 100% wide spread industry practice to do so without this law. Clearly, it's very unusual to happen before the law, so I strongly doubt the impact will be to lower wages.",LikesBallsDeep,t2_3qepy,4,0,reddit3
iubbwkm,t1_iub8t21,2022-10-30 00:41:02,Economics,"Well, the econ 101 example would be the used car. Say you want to buy a used car. The car can be a lemon, or can be of premium value, but only the seller knows which is which. The buyer takes the risk into account and therefore will only pay less than premium value. Sellers won't sell premium products for less than premium value, so the overall transaction value goes down.

Now, couple this with saying that the buyer will offer a fixed price in all cases. Those with premium value will avoid the buyer unless their offered price exceeds the value. The buyer will set their price based on the risk of buying a lemon and will assume that there is now far less chance of getting a premium car vs a lemon, as lemon sellers will be lining up for the buyer. So the buyer will continue to lower their price until the risk is satisfied, with a corresponding decrease in obtained quality.

Now, do that for the entire market, and the price decreases across the board and sellers of premium products avoid the market.",VoraciousTrees,t2_14zds3,1,0,reddit3

It doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, but mostly, 

> Now, do that for the entire market, and the price decreases across the board and sellers of premium products avoid the market.

Ok.. so the seller with premium cars just sits on them and watches them depreciate into nothing, to avoid selling cheaper? No. They'll either figure out better marketing, or find a different market, but they still want to sell the premium cars. Just like employers still need to fill those jobs.  Just taking your ball home and not playing isn't an option most of the time when the game is your entire business. 

Also, even if the effect you describe DID happen and the sellers of premium markets avoid the market, why would that drive prices down?   It would be a reduction in supply for constant demand -> an increase in prices across the board.  The number of people that want to buy a car would stay the same, but instead of the ones with more money picking up the premium cars and the less rich ones getting the cheaper cars, now the premium cars aren't available so the richer people fight over the fewer remaining crappy cars.  Funny enough we saw this happen over the last two years with the chip shortage - used car prices certainly didn't go down because of it.",LikesBallsDeep,t2_3qepy,4,0,reddit3

We engage you because you are very good in your domain... but we don't follow your recommendation (on project design, tools etc.). You can't have the elite in the domain and make it sweep the floor. No matter what is the pay. Once this is know... well the elite  will share with other in the domains and this will be known. The opposite is true too, be a cool place and good employees will attract good candidates.

We have strongly average condition! We proudly have hired the best firm to validate salary scale just to be sure that we are there together with others averagers in the industry. Why can't we get more candidates?

We agree that you have a crucial talent we need, but in the name of equity we can't accommodate you on salary/vacation/hours management etc.

I can go on... employers use a work structure designed for production (40 hours/weeks, 5 days a week) and won't revise this for other kind of works (like developper / devOps / devSecOps / etc). Time is a very weak indicator of the value of a dev. It's impossible to be performant 40hours a week. You want to hire devs? 6 weeks vacations, 32 hours / week, 4 or 5 day basis (at the dev discretion). Put in place good ""Technological leaders"" that will tell you what need to be done (even if you don't see why it is important). Actually I don't think devs have more than 5 hours of good concentration times per days. Following that we can probably drain 100% of the value of any dev in 20-25 hours per week. Add a few meeting (few is an important keyword here) and you probably have the best working condition to get the most of them. The sweet spot is probably bellow 30 hours.    
    
Edit:    
Ho also, an employee is quitting? make sure you understand why and see if it's an isolate case and normal or if you have a problem. Celebrate ""what he have done for you"" in the years he was there and say goodbye.

From a biz perspective:

1. Shipping costs have increased - A 40' container went from $3k to 18-20k - some businesses are legit not profitable anymore just on shipping alone and have just stopped ordering product.

2. Raw material costs have increased - we've all heard about chip shortages, some raw material is up 50-100% or more.

3. Litigation is up - Compared to twenty years ago the amount of random litigation everything from patent trolls, to product injury, employee lawsuits, etc. is up.  This all adds substantial cost to a business

4. Prices are sticky - just because your input costs go up 20% doesn't mean you can price your product 20% higher and expect same sales

hdzzx70,t1_hdyev3w,2021-09-23 19:14:03,Economics,">Another thing is that companies are more profitable with skeleton crews

Well, there's two factors:

-Productivity (how much you can produce/sell)

-Efficiency (how much you produce per man hour)

The best example is a plant that manufactures widgets. Assume that you're currently producing 360 widgets a day across 5 lines. So your productivity is 360 and your efficiency is 15. Your average efficiency per line is 3.

A: These guys are great. They don't call out sick super often, they don't no-call no-show, the volunteer for OT, they don't have a ton of quality misses. A line staffed with 100% A-listers can produce 5 widgets an hour. You never lay these guys off. You always keep them because they are great for efficiency AND productivity.

B: These guys are just fine. Maybe they don't no-call no-show a lot, but they're not particularly good at their jobs. A line staffed with 100% B-listers can produce 3 widgets an hour. They increase productivity (because more guys = you can produce more widgets), but they have no impact on *efficiency* because they're just average.

C: These guys suck. They no-call no-show, they don't care, they're probably transient, and generally are just garbage. A line staffed with 100% C-listers can produce a mere 1.5 widgets an hour. They bring your efficiency DOWN! They make each additional unit sold LESS PROFITABLE by working for you. So. Why hire them at all? And why not fire them once they're there. BECAUSE, in spite of brining your efficiency down they STILL bring productivity UP. So if you've gotten all the A and B workers you can hire and all you've got left with is C workers (read: when unemployment is 5% or under you're scraping the bottom of the barrel) and you NEED to increase productivity to meet demand you hire and retain C workers. Why? Because *some* additional profit is better than *no* additional profit.

Now, let's say your demand falls. Your customers only want 300 widgets per day now. Obviously you lay off C-listers first. Your productivity goes *down* but your efficiency goes *up*.

You can take this analogy and apply it anywhere. There really is no such thing as ""companies are more profitable with skeleton crews"" because if that were true, that would just be their normal complement.",Astralahara,t2_391r0bys,11,0,reddit4

We are hiring less people but we are paying them more and getting better people.  We don't want to babysit and micromanage so we are higher better professionals where it's less likely we will have to do that - and in turn our pay has gone up 130%, introduced unlimited PTO, free medical and dental, WFH and trialing some 4 day work weeks.  We used to higher 4 or 5 people a month, now we hire 1 and sometimes none.  We meet plenty of terrible candidates - in the past they probably would have been who we'd hire but in comparison to the amazing candidates we also now meet they look very very weak.  We move fast on the offer and invest heavy in them from day 1.  It's a different, better approach to recruiting but will leave weaker candidates on the sidelines.

""You'll be promoted in August"" my boss has said, for two years in a row. Guess he never specified which August.

Meanwhile, people keep leaving because we have six people doing the work done by ten two years ago. By the time they get around to hiring an additional two employees, two more leave. Turn around time on low priority tasks has skyrocketed, and auxiliary tasks are going uncompleted. 

""I put in the request for more people, but HR isn't going to hire new employees if everyone isn't getting overtime. You only worked 39.9 hours last week. I need you to work more"", my boss says. 

Well, nobody wants to work overtime because we're all tired of fucking working here. Not sure why that needs to be explained. It should be obvious from the low moral and high turnover.

All of it really came down to luck and who people knew during those times...and what I find ironic about the notion of ""it's all about who you know"", is that is demonstrative of the idea of a candidate's potential.

The article touches on this aspect of the issue and it was validating to read. Employees in the workforce are unintentionally being pigeonholed into all manner of corners within their field because (at least in my field), promotions are extremely few and far between, and it's near impossible to jump over to another organization, agency or the private sector because the candidate must have the exact experience they posted for the position.

* Left school with BS in Computer Information Systems. 

* Worked that ISP Call Center for 5 years. Still surprised I made it that long.

* Managed to pay off my loans (55K) by 2012 after working OT as I could and staying with parents.

Even with all that, when I tried to look for a better job; recruiters shit on my skills. 

IT is IT and if you don’t know, you can learn. They were not interested in me learning. They don’t want to teach. So what are you looking for then?

One recruiter (J. Tagorda) literally said to me “Your Cisco CCNA isn’t worth anything” almost 3 months after receiving it. You have no experience to back it up.

* How can I get the Junior Network Engineer position without the certification you want on the job posting? 

* What about the lab work I did? Why do I have to explain myself?

To this day, I am still paid substantially less than a Software Engineer, Desktop Engineer, etc. even with the new certifications I got. 

I finally decided during February 2020 to just learn to code. If they won’t change, then I will.

Edit 1 -

To clarify what I am learning - 

* Web Development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, COBOL) - COBOL is old I know. But it’s worth it because older systems use it and it’s like SQL.

* System Design - How to build web products and scale them. Check out YouTube for tons of info.

To say it’s eye opening, is an understatement. I didn’t know it took so much just to build Reddit or Instagram.

After rent ads all went online, it stopped becoming about finding good tenants who'd help out with maintenance, pay every month, and be stable so that you could just covering your mortgage payment from 20 years ago. It became about maximizing profit, annual rent hikes, and cycling through tenants as fast as possible.

I own now. But early on when I rented my rent stayed the same for years and years. By the time I stopped, annual hikes were standard. That market broke in much the same way. Thanks, internet.

One thing to note is that the time-frames all get collapsed here. Nobody's looking for anything long-term. Every aspect of the matching gets less personal and more short-term every iteration. It's about using each other, fast and dirty, and gaining maximum advantage before moving on. Really toxic.

Take a look at Amazon's warehouse hiring. The average employee turnover is measured in weeks. They just churn through them, burn them out, and spit them out in less than a year.

heiwe9u,t1_heitmjy,2021-09-27 22:31:40,Economics,"Respectfully I have a different perspective with pretty much everything you have said.  As I understand the reason shipping costs are through the roof is multi-fold - It's a combination of pent up demand, a rotation from service to consumer goods (massive demand for product from China) combined with not enough vessels and containers - it actually has less to do with truck drivers (those rates are certainly up also).  As for dock workers the stevendores are some of the highest paid laborers in the country, many of them make well over 6 figures.  To obtain a job as a ""dock worker"" you typically have to know someone.   

As for ""fair wage"" a ""fair wage"" seems to be a continuously moving target.  $10-$15/hour was once a pretty good entry level (warehouse) wage here in So Cal before every single house became $1mm+ and rents for an apartment cleared $2.5k/month.  Now $15/hour is not a living wage.  So I guess the question we have to ask ourselves is why is everything becoming so un-affordable?

I think the last 6 months have been the ideal environment for workers to exercise leverage on the excess demand. Some cashed in. Got nice bonuses and higher base wage rates that all future raises will be based off. Others stayed on the sidelines too long. Every day they now lose more leverage.

Meanwhile you didn't meet their ridiculous expectations so you don't deserve a raise. That keeps costs lower and makes them look good.

They're also not trained to examine long term viability. It's all short term KPIs that are proxies for the quarterly statements. If they have a good quarter they get more comp from stock options so there is also an incentive to prioritize short-term gains no matter the long term cost.

They'll be long gone by the time the long term costs they sacrificed for the short-term gains come to bear. And they're probably making more money at a different company or on a different department. Since they ""don't work there anymore"" they can pass the buck for blame.",,,59,0,reddit4

I quit that job one day after some lady was crying on the phone and I wrote her phone number down and I called her afterwards and told her how to get out of it she had ordered like five different products at once and it was not the address she was staying at for a couple months so it was like hundred/thousands I can't remember the products but it was a lot",OriginalFinnah,t2_3jdm9okq,2,0,reddit4

You will look up hours for a place online and show up and hope they had enough staff to stay open, or that they are not out of chicken or other ingredients.

Over the border in Idaho there is even a harder time finding low wage workers and I saw that McDs in Idaho was hiring at $15 while WA hires at $14. 

In my area it's very easy to get an entry job making $16-18, but wages have stagnated over the last 2-3 years. In 2019 I was making $18.55/hr in manufacturing. We made airplane parts and cut our hours since Covid, so early in 2021 I left for a full time job making $18/hr. In 2021 I started 4 new jobs and interviewed for others, all of them wanted to pay me $18/hr, less than what I had been making for years.

Then I saw it.

There was a small space in front of me. It was tiny, just enough room for a couple of people to sit side by side. Inside, there were two people. The first one was a female, she had long brown hair and was wearing a white nightgown. She was smiling.

The other one was a male, he was wearing a red jumpsuit and had a mask over his mouth.

""Are you spez?"" I asked, my eyes still adjusting to the light.

""No. We are in /u/spez."" the woman said. She put her hands out for me to see. Her skin was green. Her hand was all green, there were no fingers, just a palm. It looked like a hand from the top of a puppet.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The man in the mask moved closer to me. He touched my arm and I recoiled.

""We're fine."" he said.

""You're fine?"" I asked. ""I came to the spez to ask for help, now you're fine?""

""They're gone,"" the woman said. ""My child, he's gone.""

I stared at her. ""Gone? You mean you were here when it happened? What's happened?""

The man leaned over to me, grabbing my shoulders. ""We're trapped. He's gone, he's dead.""

I looked to the woman. ""What happened?""

""He left the house a week ago. He'd been gone since, now I have to live alone. I've lived here my whole life and I'm the only spez.""

""You don't have a family? Aren't there others?"" I asked. She looked to me. ""I mean, didn't you have anyone else?""

""There are other spez,"" she said. ""But they're not like me. They don't have homes or families. They're just animals. They're all around us and we have no idea who they are.""

Obviously, nothing against them, but just the complete lack of opportunity we experienced and how that has shaped our perspective on whether or not it's even possible to climb a latter is something I think about often (but not too often since it's depressing). I've seen headlines over the years that confirm this reality and that many of us will never be where we could have been as a result of those times. We aged out of the entry-level positions when they were hiring true entry-level people again because at that point we weren't considered entry-level anymore. But we needed those positions to break in to the field and get the needed training for the next phase of our careers. 

Do you recall how Nursing school became the hot new ticket during those years? I don't know about you, but suddenly EVERYONE was trying to get into Nursing school after they graduated with an unrelated degree. Nursing schools became unbelievably competitive too. Everyone was going for it because it was touted as ""recession proof"". I eventually gave up on getting in myself after multiple programs changed their pre-req requirements every single year and after 5 years of taking night classes I couldn't spend the money anymore taking the class that the wouldn't accept the next Admissions round. They moved the goal posts every semester and never 'grandfathered' the courses you took that they required in the previous round. I'll never forget the final straw, which was an Anatomy and Physiology course in two parts, where one of the programs said ""We are no longer accepting that course, it must be Anatomy & Physiology III"". There was also the time that I took a required Cell Biology course required by two programs for my application, and they decided the following year that they no longer wanted Cell, they wanted Microbiology. This happened constantly in my area which had a few programs. I was not the only person who had to walk away from it because I ran out of money paying out of pocket as I worked full time during the day for $12/hour and lived with a family member (thankfully).

I agree with you though that if a particular restaurant or a segment of the restaurant industry increases wages, they may not be able to raise prices if competitors aren’t doing the same. In that case the business might be expected to fail. For an industry-wide problem however, that’s not what would happen. Prices would simply be increased in the short term while businesses look for new ways to become more efficient so that they can compete on lower prices later (or, they may keep the increased prices and enjoy increased margins).

The largest labor shortages in the US are in healthcare and education.  Are you suggesting that schools should train teachers rather than universities?  Or that nurses should just ""learn on the job.""  Or surgeons should get all their schooling from hospitals?  Of course not.

Second largest shortages are in financial services.  This is people with Masters of Business Administration who are doing things like actuarial and management work.  You're also, not suggesting they should give these people MBAs to work with them (because who wants their retirement fund managed by a high school grad?).

The fourth is mining and logging, where people actually do train on the job... but the work is so remote and dangerous people don't want to go it.

Fifth is government (do you really want high school students doing legal research?)

Sixth is information technology... which actually has been removing some of its certification requirements in the last two years.

At the bottom are the careers where you do train on the job (Construction, Manufacturing, Hospitality, and Retail) in which the problem ends up being mostly wages and workplace conditions.  **The bottom of careers can be fixed by re-opening borders and bringing in more immigrants**.  But these are generally jobs Americans don't want to do.

Ending the labor shortage means taking training and education OUT of the hands of the employers and putting them into the hands of the government, university and colleges.  It means making investments now so that the problem will go away.

Dude! That is spot on.

There's even an [article](https://hbr.org/2007/07/managing-our-way-to-economic-decline) from the 80s about it. They make the case that American businesses are over-managed and prioritize short-term thinking.

Also R&D gets cut time-after-time because managers can't figure out a way to measure the return in their voodoo spreadsheet formulas (I feel comfortable saying that as a stats person--it's voodoo). The long term cost is inferior products to European or Chinese companies prioritizing R&D.

The article claims that Japanese and European economies caught up to America after WWII, in spite of being decimated, because we run our businesses so poorly.

There's some kind of shadow caste system in America whereby upper-class people without merit get to run everything and reap the rewards. The capital class trusts their Ivy League fresh grads more than seasoned professionals that know a business sector well for upper management roles for some reason.

""When you ask who is /u/spez? /u/spez is no one, but everyone. /u/spez is an idea without an identity. /u/spez is an idea that is formed from a multitude of individuals. You are /u/spez. You are also the spez police. You are also me. We are /u/spez and /u/spez is also we. It is the idea of an idea.""  
I stood there, befuddled. I had no idea what the man was blabbing on about.  
""Your government, as you call it, are the specists. Your specists, as you call them, are /u/spez. All are /u/spez and all are specists. All are spez police, and all are also specists.""  
I had no idea what he was talking about. I looked at my partner. He shrugged. I turned back to the old man.  
""We've come here to speak to /u/spez. What are you doing in /u/spez?""  
""We are waiting for someone.""  
""Who?""  
""You'll see. Soon enough.""  
""We don't have all day to waste. We're here to discuss the government announcement.""  
""Yes, I heard."" The old man pointed his clipboard at me. ""Tell me, what are /u/spez police?""  
""Police?""  
""Yes. What is /u/spez police?""  
""We're here to investigate this place for potential crimes.""  
""And what crime are you looking to commit?""  
""Crime? You mean crimes? There are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective. It's a free society, where everyone is free to do whatever they want.""  
""Is that so? So you're not interested in what we've done here?""  
""I am not interested. What you've done is not a crime, for there are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective.""  
""I see. What you say is interesting."" The old man pulled out a photograph from his coat. ""Have you seen this person?""  
I stared at the picture. It was of an old man who looked exactly like the old man standing before us. ""Is this /u/spez?""  
""Yes. /u/spez. If you see this man, I want you to tell him something. I want you to tell him that he will be dead soon. If he wishes to live, he would have to flee. The government will be coming for him. If he wishes to live, he would have to leave this city.""  
""Why?""  
""Because the spez police are coming to arrest him.""

hdzeo56,t1_hdyy4q9,2021-09-23 16:48:07,Economics,"Does it? 

Take care. The job sucks. Lets put aside that there is 100% a section of workers who will refuse to wipe up shit for a living. Even leaving that, at least in the UK, the conditions are awful, customers are abusive, sexual assault is completely normalised, office staff are often bullying and threatening, and time expectations are wholly unrealistic. 

You can increase the wage. Thats fine. And that would help keep some people on that are currently leaving as they'll deal with more issues for more money. But you will still have plenty of people who don't see those working conditions as worth it. 

There is obviously a point where people will do anything for any money, but as I said, that then comes down to where's that tipping point versus what the company/industry can afford.

Which is why I mention fruit picking. Its a huge issue in the UK at the moment and yes, the simplistic answer thrown out is ""supply and demand!"" ""Just raise wages!"" 

But the question becomes by how much and is it practical? Its another job that sucks, and I'll be the first to say the wage for it is ridiculously low. But how much more can you bump wages before consumers then get priced out of paying for it? Especially when there's already a (misplaced) common perception of produce being expensive. 

Or how much do prices go up before supermarkets decide its cheaper to import from elsewhere rather than take on the increase in prices to cover higher labour costs? 

None of that is to say I don't think wages should increase, they've been too low across the board for far too long, but its incredibly simplistic to just say increasing wages on its own is a magic bullet solution to the problem like the real world is a spreadsheet",Southpaw535,t2_90wiq8w,-2,0,reddit4

The turnover in care is horrendous and pay is only one part of the reason for that. They could bump the wages up but you'd still see plenty of problems in the sector and workers leaving. 

Same with fruit picking. The job sucks. Its hard, its long hours, its seasonal, and there's often all sorts of terms around the contract that all together makes it unpalatable for a lot of people, even if the pay was better.

My point was just to say that the oft repeated point that this will all be fixed with increased wages is just too simplistic. There's other problems in certain roles being filled that aren't just about the pay sucking",Southpaw535,t2_90wiq8w,3,0,reddit4

Also they will train the number of people they need, not way too many, because incentives will be better aligned.

If that orchard were still there today would it be employing more people than are employed in that same 10 acre area?   So yes, you are right that at some point those 5.5 FTE got fired and the orchard business went belly up.  But if it hadn’t, if we had artificially kept it going, it would have been way worse for the economy and would have led to more people being unemployed in the longer term.  This is also why it is critically important to provide retraining everywhere in the economy (free college would be a good start) since this sort of thing is always happening everywhere in the global economy.",cybercuzco,t2_90mbp,1,0,reddit4

It's not that lots of prime working age people are just doing without a job.  It's that many people who were close to retirement went ahead and pushed that forward.

Below are some numbers that back this up.  All numbers are February 2020 through the latest data point November 2022.

* 63.4% -> 62.1% (-1.3%) Labor Force Participation Rate, all adults
* 83.0% -> 82.4% (-0.6%) Labor Force Participation Rate, 25-54 years
* 40.3% -> 38.6% (-1.7%) Labor Force Participation Rate, 55+ years

If we go back just 3 months to August 2022, the 25-54 rate was 82.8% compared to 83.0% pre-pandemic.  That's pretty much unchanged from pre-pandemic.

It's not just the participation rate that matters, though-- it's the total size of the labor force. The US is demographically aging and shrinking, just like every other advanced economy. That means we are seeing a reduced participation rate from a declining force size.  


Which means a wage increase has been baked into the pie for quite awhile, and we're seeing it now. A kid can graduate high school and get a CDL and make 85k/yr as a truck driver, because we have a considerable shortage of truck drivers. 70% of all truck drivers are over age 40, and the \*average\* age is 48. What do you think this will look like in 10 years? 20 years?  


The Baby Boomers are retiring faster than younger generations are replacing them. This bears profound implications for our economy, politics, etc. For example-- what happens to the ""untouchable"" aspect of Social Security and Medicare when the number of people who benefit from them dwindles while a larger fraction of voters become convinced the programs aren't going to be there for them and they are paying into a money pit?

More schools are feeding all students rather than requiring families to apply for free lunches, reducing the paperwork burden and de-stigmatizing the program.

This is anecdotal and definitely not universal. My partner and I took advantage of the fast comp rises. The article touched upon this a bit.

Between Jan 2020 and June 2022, I saw my comp more than triple while my partner got double. We both realized we each now made enough to support the other person. 

Having my partner quit her job seemed like a natural conclusion given my higher comp, how much less stressful my job is, and how her job actively made her miserable. We're also a bit protected from inflation with full remote work and a purchased home and a decent homestead exemption.

That’s the Fed’s fear, and their toolbox can only deal with demand side problems. So that’s why their goal in raising interest rates is to create more unemployment and stifle wage growth, so that eventually companies have to lower prices because no one can afford to buy anything.

The truth of how to “fix inflation” lies in between those extremes and having more legislation to fix some of the supply side problems like: raise the minimum wage, increase taxes on windfall profits, fix the housing market, and invest in education and infrastructure to boost productivity.

j05lwck,t1_j02wrp9,2022-12-14 05:54:52,Economics,"It's been this way for decades honestly. It was just a bit harder to spot depending on how far back you go due to the effects not being as apparent. The idea of minimum wage staying at 8 dollars an hour for so long has been out of date since at least the turn of the century, maybe even earlier. The poverty line has also not been updated properly. Even people making above that have to often rely on government programs. 

&#x200B;

Infact the reasoning behind both of these staying so out of date, to my memory, is due to them factoring in government programs. Basically they expect everyone to know everything that is available and take advantage of it. That's the justification for keeping it the way it is, despite it honestly being unrealistic to expect everyone to know of every program. Not even getting into how those programs don't even have room for everyone. Getting section 8 for example can take years, the waiting list is that fucking long.  


Speaking of shady shit, everytime anyone on social security/disability payments gets a pay increase bills go up across the board. Sometimes it's just enough to eat up the entire increase. This isn't an accident, infact it's completely on purpose. I don't just mean by companies alone. Sometimes the government actually plans this out with insurance companies.

Remember, parents (almost) always love their children unconditionally. It's very hard not to love something you literally created.

There is no automatic reciprocity there. Your children have to obey you as long as they are minors under your roof, but they are under no obligation to love you or to continue that relationship once they grow up.

I know so many people who aren't on speaking terms with their parents - I'm guessing they're not going to be eager to pay for a nursing home or devote several hours a week to coming over to help care for them.

Only just this last year (FY2021) it was converted to a fully refundable credit, meaning you can get the whole amount even if you didn’t pay that much in taxes in. This is critical for low wage earners as previously they often wouldn’t have a big enough tax liability to get enough back.

For example, the only options for Europe in 1933 were either fascism or communism, because there was no longer a frontier, like in the USA, to create new wealth. They couldn't build out anymore, they could only build up, and to do that they would have had to start seizing private property and redistributing it. After the war, so much stuff had been destroyed that it was good for capitalism, because there was so much growth that could happen as a result, being propped up by US capital.  
  
 They got Hitler, someone who was willing to hyperexploit minorities to protect private property, and the more minorities you hyperexploit, the safer (theoretically) that private property will be, which is why the Strasserists lost, and private property had to have someone who was going to do what he said he would do, kill off as many minorities as possible, because it was the ethnic German business and capitalist elite that had control of the real state within a state, the German military.",aaronespro,t2_ax8th,2,0,reddit1

j05gz2i,t1_j0578hu,2022-12-14 05:06:45,Economics,"Good point about the higher cost of older workers. 

But it gets much harder to “hop around” as we get older. 

The higher salaries generated over a long period of time in the workforce eventually make anyone who isn’t untouchable a prime candidate to be fired during any downsizing and cost cutting measures (which is something that happens frequently in todays world).

And after being fired or laid off - unless you have uniquely valuable experience and/or are very talented at social networking - it eventually (and over a lifetime) becomes very hard to find similar well paying jobs because most companies have a thirst for younger and cheaper talent.

Even lesser, lower paying, and entry level type jobs in the industries people have worked a lifetime become unavailable as older workers are eventually designated as “overqualified” (read: old).

So - a job application, resume, or CV eventually gets passed over simply because of age.

There was a popular post on Reddit recently which was about a former IT worker who had experience working with NASA but after being out of work for awhile was forced into working at McDonalds. They literally had to start over in every way imaginable. 

That’s real and happens. 

Maybe check out the “bag boys” at your local grocery store too. I sometimes have people far older than me bagging my groceries - and those are sometimes people who had successful careers at one time in their life. Nobody is bagging groceries because they want to either (at least not if other opportunities existed). 

And moving from a respectable career (and status) into something which is far lesser can feel demeaning and unbearable. 

It’s understandably something which many people have a hard time accepting too - so, if they can afford it (and even if it is barely affordable or means financially relying upon a spouse or family member), this may simply result in their leaving the workforce and retiring early instead. 

Pride and ego are hard things to overcome for most all of us. Some must overcome this to survive, but others have the option to leave the workforce.

And for those who *can* leave a career and work behind - some do leave.

But not only by personal choice.

I’ve seen some of these things happen to a friend, a family member, and some former colleagues. Some of the ageism as it relates to being passed over for certain jobs I have even experienced myself.

Forced retirement is most certainly a thing.",WhileFalseRepeat,t2_hrdcy,5,0,reddit1

j0299tm,t1_j0231lp,2022-12-13 15:47:07,Economics,"Just pointing out, as a working parent, that I’m still raising my kids even if they do go to childcare. It’s a phrase that is used often by households with non-working parents. 

I get the point they were making. The point I am making is that working parents still raise their kids.

Also, there are a lot of reasons working “makes sense” even if a large percentage of income goes to childcare. Childcare shouldn’t fall to one parent - if both parents pitch in for the shared child, it doesn’t hinder one parent so much. 
Additionally, things to consider are promotion opportunities, retirement contribution loss along with compound interest, and work experience missed out on. Childcare won’t be needed forever - it’s temporary. But getting back into the workforce after taking X years off is difficult, and it ends up often leaving a female parent reliant on the financial stability of the male parent. You wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve seen SAHM’s struggling to leave their spouse for whatever reason, but they can’t because they’re reliant on them. 
There’s a Calculator that calculate the cost of missing out on a career for X years and it’s pretty eye-opening. 

As a working mom, we are constantly fighting the stigma for one reason or another. It’s extremely hard to fight for a space at the table, and some of that has
To do with the guilt society puts on us for “not raising our kids” (which, btw, no one ever says to a man - stay-at-home Moms aren’t being told how hard it is for them to be raising a child as a single mother. People still consider a working dad to be raising their kids, but not a working mom. What is that?) and the illusion that stopping a career doesn’t really have any economic effect on the woman’s future.


Edit: here’s the calculator.

It's not saying that working parents don't raise their kids, it's saying that for a parent who's wages barely cover childcare (usually in a 2-adult household), staying at home might be the superior choice.  It's a cost-benefit decision that a lot of couples where one parent is a low wage earner made over the past few years.

I believe in my area it is 4 to1 for 2 year olds.  8 to 1 for 4 year olds.  Additionally, classes are only allowed to have so many occupants.  So a 0 to 2 classroom can only have 10 people (8 children and 2 adults).

Further, the work hours are from 7am to 6pm, 5 days  week.  So it's not just 2 childcare workers.  It's some higher number that often involves 'floaters', part timers, subs, etc.  

Then you need to dive into finding childcare workers that can make it through the vetting process and handle the work.  You also need to have an admin staff that is at least somewhat IT technical b/c all parents want apps with photos/videos/lunch menus/calendars/etc.  You also need a janitorial staff. Kids are filthy.  You also need maintenance support.  And a kitchen staff member or two.  And probably other positions I'm not thinking of.

Another issue is that many people don't live near grandparents or the grandparents are also working - so that avenue is out.

There is absolutely no difference in these growth metrics between the Trump and Obama administrations (if you are generous and don't count Covid).  In fact, the best quarter for each happened under Obama.  The notion that we underwent an economic boom under Trump is a flagrant, aggregious lie by any definition of the concept of ""boom"".

What did happen was a long, sustained period of economic and job growth starting in 2010, which was then uninterrupted by a recession until now.  Which, by the way, should be considered an achievement... for both administrations.  But of course, Trump shrieked and wailed about terrible growth during the Obama years, despite ending up with the same figures himself.

What Trump has done is akin to running the last 2 miles of a 4 part relay race, then claiming credit for the entire race just because he was the last one to touch the baton.",Demiansky,t2_k1fxu,125,0,reddit3

Trump cherry picks the months where people went back to work after the shutdown and calls it ""record job numbers"" or ""jobs boom"".

Scale out to the long term trend - BEFORE Covid, the Trump administration was adding jobs at a SLOWER pace vs the 2nd term of Obama/Biden.  

Covid would have been a shock to the employment sector for any president - but the lying about the risks in the beginning so he ""wouldnt cause a panic"", 8 months of ""it will go away on its own"" garbage, refusal to acknowledge science, refusal to set a good example with masks, and overall negligent mishandling of the entire event have stifled the recovery.

Imagine making this hilariously unscientific and demonstrably worthless comparison and thinking you understand economics.

Don't want to waste my time on you more but I will give a couple examples of how hilariously wrong you are:\*2007 economy was slowing into late cycle as perceived by both investors and the fed

\*2020 economy was mid-late cycle at the latest and the fed was accommodative

\*Financial crises, by virtue of their shocks to confidence and investment channels always see slower recoveries than garden variety crises and recessions

\*The financial crisis was arguably the worst ever because it smacked house values, which was the cornerstone of american wealth creation for a generation. It took some people half a decade just to climb out.

\*Though there aren't many modern examples, it's clearly intuitive that an economy subject to such a wildly exogeneous shock as a pandemic will have pent up demand. People WANT to vacation, they just can't. In 2008 they couldn't afford to.

g9nt1bs,t1_g9npkag,2020-10-22 16:25:17,Economics,"If your friend is arguing that lowering regulations provided a boost to the economy/jobs, the burden of proof is on them to prove the causal link. If it's just ""there was a lot of deregulation, and the economy was doing well"" then that's a case of confusing correlation and causation. It's possible rolling back some environmental standards helped maintain or create jobs in the oil & gas sector, but it seems to be pretty narrow and sector-specific. Oil & gas isn't where the vast majority of the economy is.

Also, [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/upshot/presidents-have-less-power-over-the-economy-than-you-might-think.html) is really informative on the extent to which presidents actually have control over the economy.

g9o6dtp,t1_g9npkag,2020-10-22 18:11:55,Economics,"Hey, I'm not the guy you responded to, but one thing you could try would be to show your friend a graph of the unemployment rate over the last ~15 years. Here is a website with an interactive graph that allows you to pick whatever dates you want.

https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate

I'd encourage you to play around with different dates, but for for the purpose of talking to your friend I would consider setting dates from ~2005 until early 2020 (before the unemployment resulting from Corona).

If you set those dates what you will see is a low rate, below 5%, in 2007.  In 2007 the housing market collapsed and the unemployment rate began skyrocketing.  In January, 2009, when president Obama took office, unemployment had risen to ~7%.  It continued rising until it peaked in October 2009 at about 10%.

So the increase in unemployment began more than a year BEFORE Obama took office. Once he took office we were already on a trajectory with momentum. Looking at the graph you can see that the trajectory and momentum didn't change (speed up or slow down) immediately when Obama took office.

It did slow down and halt about 9 months after he took office. After it halted at it's peak of 2010, it began steadily decreasing for Obama's 7+ remaining years in office.

In other words, unemployment was increasing at a steady rate when Obama took office, shortly after he took office the increase halted and reversed and improved from that point until Corona hit. This doesn't prove anything because correlation doesn't imply causation, but IF you were to assume causation, the logical conclusion would be that Obama's policies were responsible for the massive bulk of the improvements.

When Trump took office in January 2017, unemployment was around 4.8% (very good) and the decreases continued after he was inaugurated. The rate of decrease appears to have stayed mostly constant, maybe slowing down a bit, but not substantially during his time in office (pre Corona).

Just looking at a graph of unemployment and comparing the dates and trends to the dates of Obama's presidency make it obvious that Obama inherited bad (and getting worse) unemployment numbers and left office with good (and getting better) numbers.

Trump inherited numbers that were already good and getting better.

Now, it's important to note that a ton of factors effect unemployment and people tend to overexagerate the president's ability to influence unemployment and the economy in general. Correlation doesn't equal causation so it's entirely possible that those numbers would have been the same if the opposite parties had been elected (or better or worse, it's literally impossible to know).

So this doesn't prove that Obama's policies were responsible for the decrease in unemployment. But what it DOES do is show that unemployment was getting bad BEFORE Obama took office. AND that unemployment was in a good spot and continuing to get better BEFORE Trump took office.

In theory this makes it difficult for your friend to argue that Obama caused high unemployment and Trump fixed it.

In reality your friend is probably going to ignore this evidence and come up with some justification to discount it (e.g. those numbers are manipulated, that's not the real unemployment number, Democrat policies caused the housing crisis, etc, etc).

Because he will likely discount it I would focus on getting him to agree with just the numbers. Like, ""do you agree that unemployment was increasing before Obama took office?"" Then he'll say something like, ""Democrats caused that increase."" 

Don't take the bait and argue about who caused the increase. Just say, ""Regardless of who caused it you just said that you agree it was increasing before Obama took office, so even if it was Dems in general that caused the increase, or if it was Republicans, we agree it wasn't Obama?"". If you can get him to agree to that you can make the same argument about Trump.

""It was decreasing before he took office, yes? And it was pretty good before he took office? (~5% is considered good and you can look at historical numbers to verify that.) And the trajectory was basically the same after he took office as it was before? So regardless of why it was falling (dem vs rep policies), it was definitely falling, and doing quite well, before Trump took office?

Anyways, good luck with all of this. I strongly doubt your friend will be convinced by facts or logic. But I hope you are able to get him to see at least a bit of logic.",tour__de__franzia,t2_1hug4eq7,9,0,reddit3

The BLS reports tons of stats in addition to regular employment rates.

My take? We should peg the deficit to automatically be allotted about 1.5% of GDP. That's slightly less than a normal year of growth, which would put the total debt/gdp on a permanent, slightly, downward path while unlocking hundreds of billions of possible investment.

I'm am massively opposed to the monetary policy we have followed for 50+ years, and blame it for most of our debt issues and income inequality issues.  All administrations fail on that issue, and Biden will too.

I exactly agree.  But I think it applies across the board.  Even in the next cycle you can't say Trump is responsible.  There remain too many unknowns in an economy for such analysis.

k8ng45i,t3_17s4dgi,2023-11-10 14:44:45,Economics,"It’s an interesting dynamic right now.  Tight labor market, but rising unemployment.  3 factors:

1) employers are being selective, not raising wages to accelerate filling of empty roles (hence many openings)

2) employees being more selective, not settling for lower wages in less appealing jobs

3) frictional mismatch of skill sets in shifting market, where growth coming from different sectors.  It takes time to retrain people.  Example: lots of people left hospitality and service industry for good, no going back.  But they aren’t qualified for the fastest growing sectors: health care, senior care, green energy technicians, data analytics, actuary and accounting

The first point is good in the sense that desperation of hiring isn’t leading to a wage/price spiral, accelerating inflation and forces more rate hikes from the fed.  

Second point is good too.  If people can afford to not take crappy jobs for low pay, that’s awesome.  I hope they can hold out long enough that industries are forced to improve because they can’t hire people (looking at your restaurants).

Third is what it is.  There are simply fewer and fewer jobs for moderately skilled workers anymore.

The lack of loyalty by companies to employees has justifiably made employees not at all loyal to the companies.  

So employers believe it a waste of money to train someone, as that person will just leave as soon as they are trained up.  

I have often thought that a different deployment of unemployment money could help alleviate this situation. 

What if the unemployment salary could be turned into a 50% salary payment and tax forgiveness for employers willing to train workers?

So instead of needing to hire a worker for $70,000 and pay the additional $20k in taxes/expenses, the company could hire a worker for $35k, and pay $10k expenses, during the training period of 6 months, with the difference supplemented by UI?

Mikael Rahmani, a senior at Boston University, checks all the boxes: extracurricular activities, good grades, internships. But as the clock ticks toward graduation, he’s struggling to find a job — despite applying to about 15 a week.
It was only a couple years ago that graduating seniors were able to leverage multiple job offers and boost their compensation. But after a pandemic hiring spree, major companies in technology, finance and consulting — top destinations for ambitious students — have been cutting costs and consolidating their workforces.

Rahmani had a full-time offer from HP Inc., where he interned last summer, but he turned it down because he didn’t want to relocate to Houston. Now, he and other college seniors interviewed by Bloomberg News are grappling with a sluggish white-collar job market, where companies navigating an uncertain economy and higher interest-rates have pulled back on entry-level hiring.
“I’m seeing a little bit of a disconnect between my internship prospects last year versus my full-time prospects this year,” said Rahmani, who is studying finance and business analytics.
The issues for new graduates started to pop up last May as layoffs in technology and finance soured their job prospects. And it’s gotten worse. Layoffs have mounted, and fewer employees have been quitting, leaving less room for new hires. University career-service centers say full-time recruitment is eerily quiet. More interns aren’t getting job offers. And start dates for some new hires have been delayed or even rescinded. It’s bad enough that University of Michigan alumni who graduated into the Great Recession were recently asked to speak to current students.


To be sure, the overall labor market has proven resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes to quell inflation. The health care sector, for instance, has created more jobs. But growth in better-paying industries such as technology and financial services has been more uneven. Hiring in both sectors was down more than 20% in November compared to a year ago, according to data from LinkedIn, an employment-focused social media platform.
What’s more, mass layoffs earlier this year have given rise to greater competition. In 2022, there was a job opening for every applicant, according to LinkedIn. Now, there are two applicants for every job.

“The question is what jobs are available?” said Kory Kantenga, a LinkedIn senior economist, noting that many young professionals are concerned about finding a position that matches their skillsets. “Are you going to end up as a barista with a bachelor’s degree?”

This summer, many students began to realize that landing a coveted internship at top companies was not necessarily a guaranteed path to a full-time job offer.
In one example, managers at Apple Inc. told interns they’d be given an update on their conversion to full-time roles in October. But when the month passed with silence, many interns felt ghosted and were left scrambling for interviews late in the recruitment season, according to people familiar with the matter.
“When employers want to shrink down, the easiest way to do it is to freeze hiring. That doesn’t matter all that much to most employees who already have a job,” said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “So the impact mainly falls on new hires.”

Nicole Jurado, a senior at Miami University in Ohio, said looking for a consulting job has been a “blood bath” this fall. The 21 year old applied to as many as 26 jobs — and made it to late-stage interviews at Deloitte— but is ending the semester empty-handed.
It’s been a shock. She had four internship offers last year, including one at Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. where she spent the summer. But she does have a plan B: grad school. It’s better than settling on a job that “doesn’t live up to my standards,” she said.
While it may not be 2008, today’s job market is a harsh reality check for students who feel they did everything right. Those who have locked in jobs say at times they’ve also felt forced to make compromises. Some class of 2024 students with offers at consulting firms, including, Bain & Company Inc., are having their start dates delayed by months.
Despite the ominous signs, many students, including Jurado, say they’re hopeful they’ll land their dream job.
“This year I’m doing the exact same things, taking the same steps and I have zero offers,” said Jurado. “I’m stubborn. I know what I want and what I deserve. I want to be able to say I’m happy to wake up today and go to my job.”",Any-Formal2300,t2_fvk5njozu,30,0,reddit1

There are clearly systemic reforms we need. On the surface, there’s always some amount of risk if you were asking people to train themselves, because labor market projections can be wrong, it turns out. In general, I think, too many programs today, at the undergraduate level, are far too specialized for what they are.

And I also think this wouldn’t be nearly as much of a problem if society could guarantee certain things like housing and healthcare. But until we do that, no one is going to blame anyone for trying to find higher paying jobs with better benefits, which tend to be these high prestige jobs. It would be a lot easier to take a position in a less prestigious, but still important job to society if you knew that you wouldn’t go bankrupt from medical debt or be homeless. The way that the US has typically made all of this work is by allowing immigrants to fill in lower prestige jobs so that their kids can then be the next generation of upper middle class workers (or at least have the shot to be). But long-term, this is obviously not a sustainable system, and we’re going to have to realize one way or another that it’s really easy to talk about everyone not being able to be a doctor or a lawyer, but if these are the only people that can survive (increasingly, many of these people are also having difficulties), then we’re not really building a system that’s meant to last.

Also, I think the larger problem is that many people are getting degrees, which the other can’t use or don’t need. I think 100 years ago, it was one thing to study English and then have a job waiting back home at your dad’s manufacturing plant. But, most of us don’t live those kinds of lives today, as college has expanded out well beyond people who have that kind of a safety net. It’s kind of a different problem than what this article is talking about, but probably the bigger thing we need to prepare students for is not picking the most prestigious college (especially when it comes to judging themselves, and establishing a sense of worth) and not picking degrees that will not pay if they cannot afford them as a luxury. And I don’t think this is to say that people shouldn’t be able to achieve some kind of higher education, but I think the system needs to change, and as much as I do believe that there is a use, and beauty and knowledge for its own sake, our society either have to be willing to pay for that, or we have to change our expectations of, what exactly these degree programs are for when students are expected to pay quite a lot for them.",notapoliticalalt,t2_kho80g75,56,0,reddit1

Lol, expert PhDs in economics can't predict demand for different jobs in 10 years, let alone ""society"" or the government, let alone 16 year olds. If anything its a problem that society has intervened too much by subsidizing unprofitable student loans which have no consideration of whether student can ever repay, and allows students to choose w/e career they want without any connection to market forces other than the perceived income or status of certain career at that point in time.

Now if the gov did nothing and the onus was on industries to fund training or education for new skilled labor there would be a lot more connection to the actual demand for those jobs, and if it turns out in the future the jobs weren't needed the cost would be on those companies not the individual student.

ked6xeu,t1_kecxblj,2023-12-21 19:50:19,Economics,"Yeah…but CE pay sucks and to make any substantial money, you either have to be lucky, work somewhere forever, or have to be willing to work FAANG hours for a consultant who is not paying you nearly the amount they should (and even then, you probably won’t be making decent money for at least five or six years). I’m not saying that it’s an awful field by any means, and it’s definitely true that there is a bit more stability, but there’s a reason a lot of people look to leave it. And I don’t think people should join civil engineering for the money, because, although there is a contraction in software at the moment, eventually, it will bounce back. The only reason you really should switch into civil engineering is if it genuinely interests you. 

Personally, if I were to advise people to switch into a certain major, I would advise them to switch into mechanical engineering. Obviously, it really depends on what school you’re at in the programs you’re talking about (so don’t just take a Reddit comment as the deciding factor), but, for an undergraduate degree, mechanical engineering will give you the broadest Survey of all engineering fields. A good mechanical engineering degree will provide much of the necessary background, if you later decided you wanted to get into civil engineering, but also obviously opens up the world of mechanical engineering, and allows you to dabble in manufacturing, electronics, software, and so on. It was also my experience that mechanical engineers built a lot more things for classes, then civil engineers, dead, for obvious reasons in some cases. I don’t want to say that this is for everyone, and I think no matter what degree you study, the thing that will override any diploma will be experience (so being involved in clubs and projects, plus getting internships will count a lot more than where or what you decided to study). And I don’t think you should pick a program that you were absolutely miserable in. But I think if you decide you want to pivot later on, mechanical engineering is really the best place if you really don’t know what else to do.

More broadly, as someone who has a background in civil engineering, I think one of the things that’s really depressing in comparison to other engineering majors is that, in my opinion, civil engineering has gotten way too theoretical. Of course, I don’t expect students to be able to come out, knowing how to execute heavy civil projects, but I feel like civil engineering should allow you to do some basic things, and at least feel comfortable navigating a Home Depot to know what different things are. As an undergrad, I was always really jealous of other majors, who were actually able to make things with the information they learned in class. In civil engineering, the only thing we really learn was a lot of equations, some lab tests, and maybe we would do some drafting. But very few people actually got to build anything, which I think is kind of a formative experience for engineers of any discipline. 

Anyway, let’s say that you have a bunch of different engineers from different programs. If they all decided that they wanted to get out of engineering at some point, many still could probably carry some of those skills into their personal life. Mechanical engineers could work out a variety of systems. Electronics people can make cool gadgets and nice Christmas displays. Software people can probably do something similar, though the thing that would probably be most beneficial for them is that they understand how to automate a lot of software things. But civil engineering, unless you work in land development and residential construction, most civil engineering degrees just don’t provide you with anything you can take beyond the workplace. Yeah, you can do the whole “applied knowledge” and “transferable skills” corpo speak, and yes, it really depends on you and your program, but broadly speaking, the curriculum and most programs are simply not meant to provide most students with actual project experience. 

Anyway, really quick before I get off my soapbox here, I think we’re looking for systemic change, I think one of the things that needs to happen is a return to more generalized degrees and also companies being willing to train. I think far too many degree programs at this point our way to specialized for undergraduates, When we really should be building up fundamental skills that can be expended upon and refined as people specialize. But the way we construct the system now, especially when we ask people to pay for education themselves, kind of just traps people in certain fields, and artificially limits the applicant pool. And, to the credit of most people study in computer science, most of them probably could transition into a civil engineering job that was willing to train them. I think it would be much harder to go the other way around with civil to software. 

After all, if you know enough, old engineers, there are a surprising number who didn’t study engineering at all. Granted, if you choose this path, you have to work your way up through a shop or a construction crew, but although I don’t want to say that it was the most common thing, I think it was a lot more achievable then than it is now. And I think the reality is that a lot of entry-level positions, no matter what field they are in, have just gotten too high. I do think that it might be fair to lay some of the blame on schools, but part of it is also that most companies are not really willing to train employees, in part, because there is a feedback loop of treating employees as disposable, which means that companies often are then also treated as disposable or untrustworthy by employees. 

Now no amount of school can really prepare any given worker for the particular workflow and decisions that your organization makes. And people with enough experience can probably adapt relatively quickly with a little instruction, but it doesn’t seem like anyone is actually willing to make experienced workers anymore, or is willing to do what is necessary to actually retain them, well, potentially with the one exception of extremely prestigious, software and some electronics companies. Anyway, I think part of the problem here is that there are a lot of jobs that simply have too many requirements and I think you put way too much stock into peoples actual fields of study instead of their general cognitive abilities and work ethic. Because I think you know, as well as I, that there are some people who you meet in any field, civil engineering included, who probably shouldn’t be engineers, even though they have all of the right degrees and experience on paper. 

With that, I’ve said way too much, so yeah…",notapoliticalalt,t2_kho80g75,29,0,reddit1

The wisdom was that you should be ready for new fields and job titles that didn’t exist when you begin choosing your degree. That still applies, but it seems like employers don’t want that at all. They would rather play it safe and hire someone they can point to that has the right credentials.


The biggest frustration of all this is if you want to change careers, it becomes extremely difficult to do so. Even the people who have experience in similar roles, when you change technologies or industries you are basically starting over. The expectation is that you come to work fully prepared to contribute based on your education. Nobody wants to train because there is no incentive, and they refuse to create incentives to retain the talent they’ve trained.

I graduate June of 2024 and already have a post grad offer signed for a F100 company, but I have about zero plans to go make a post about it. In contrast I see posts complaining about the market or sharing numbers of applications sent out without an offer landed. 

The demand for tech workers is still growing, there’s just a larger supply of workers pursuing roles within the industry. Companies have more people to pick from, and will likely be much pickier with their hiring decisions at all levels considering a lot of experienced developers were laid off when the market contracted as the world shifted to a post-COVID economy. 

On any given day, you can still find numerous new job openings on LinkedIn, there’s just a higher amount of applicants for a good portion of them, especially web dev. 

This went on longer than I expected, but I’m getting tired of the gloom and doom I’m seeing online about tech.

Digital marketing used to mean just creating an online presence and engaging the public online with ad campaigns and attempting to go viral with content. 

Digital Marketing today involves an extreme amount of data analysis and sentiment studies to gage feedback and prevent pr nightmares. It even involves programming to visualize data for non tech presentations and goes as deep as having ai powered web scrapers to get ahead of bad news. Its so sad to me that the job title and department gets lumped into the same level as a graphic designer who can also post on twitter. Id argue that at the higher levels it is the most technical job at a company because it requires understanding competition, psychology, UX, Customer Success, sales and the absolute most current trends. Not to mention the technical side of data analysis like tableau, R, database management etc. More importantly \[especially with public companies\] it requires the ability to write 100 plus page reports that truly guide company direction that the c-suite pays close attention too.

If you're an android or IOS app developer then yeah that may be the case...but again it depends on your tech stack. Current AI training models can't replicate a company's tech code very well especially if the stack is opinionated. 

[Here's a 30 minute video where an AI programmer tries to create a spring boot app using ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXbXoMIVpRg). This is about the simplest way to create a java based web service, and still a lot of manual intervention is required to do configuring and the works.

As women entered the workforce they were forced to play by the rules of a system not built around their specific needs, and judged by the metrics of that system.

There will be unintended consequences if one group works 19 days a month while the other works 22 days a month. Who would you rather hire? And it will be hard to determine equal pay for equal work. 

>However, women who used leave for this purpose were faced with negative consequences such as discrimination and harassment by employers. This resulted in the government proposing to remove menstrual leave from the law to safeguard female workers from discrimination, and led to tension between women’s labor unions and the government (Dan 1986, 9–11). 

>As a result of the same dynamics, menstrual leave may also contribute to the gendered wage gap and the lack of women’s advancement in the workplace, a.k.a, ‘the glass ceiling.’ As previously discussed, researchers have found that women’s absence from work perpetuates stereotypes of women as less worthy and reliable employees (Patton and Johns 2007, 1587–601), thus undermining their career development progress.

1) flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store greeters;

2)goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, or to prevent other goons from doing so, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists;

3)duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;

4) box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers;

5) taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it, e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.”

juoxfj2,t3_15hdzbp,2023-08-03 23:40:43,Economics,"""...A certain method exists whereby men justify their fallacies, and it is this : People, accepting the fallacy into which they have fallen as an unquestionable axiom, unite this fallacy and all its effects into one conception, and call it by one word, and then ascribe to this conception and word a special, indefinite and mystical meaning. Such conceptions and words are, the Churchy Science, Justice, the State, and Civilization, Thus, the Church becomes not what it really is, a number of men who have all fallen into the same error, but a ""communion of those who believe rightly."" Justice becomes not a collection of unjust laws framed by certain men, but the designation of those rightful conditions under which alone it is possible for men to live. Science becomes not what it really is : the chance dissertations which at a given time occupy the minds of idle men, but the only true knowledge. In the same way Civilization becomes not what it really is : the outcome of the activity (falsely and harmfully misdirected by force- using Governments) of the Western nations, who have succumbed to the false idea of freeing themselves from violence by violence, but the unquestionably true way towards the future welfare of humanity.  ""Even if it be true,"" say the supporters of civilization, "" that all these inventions, technical appliances and products of industry, are now only used by the rich and are inaccessible to working men, and cannot therefore as yet be considered a benefit to all mankind, this is so only because these mechanical appliances have not yet attained their full perfection and are not yet distributed as they should be. When mechanism is still further perfected, and the workmen are freed from the power of the Capitalists, and all the works and factories are in their hands, the machines will produce so much of everything and it will all be so well distributed, that everybody will have the use of everything. No one will lack anything, and all will be happy.""

Not to mention the fact that we have no reason to believe that the working men who now struggle so fiercely with one another for existence, or even for more of the comforts, pleasures and luxuries of existence, will suddenly become so just and self- denying that they will be content to share equally the benefits the machines are going to give them — leaving that aside — the very supposition that all these works with their machines, which could not have been started or continued except under the power of Government and Capital, will remain as they are, when the power of Government and Capital have been destroyed, is a quite arbitrary supposition.

To expect it, is the same as it would have been to expect that after the emancipation of the serfs on one of the large, luxurious Russian estates, which had a park, conservatories, arbors, private theatrical troupe, an orchestra, a picture gallery, stables, kennels and store-houses filled with different kinds of garments — all these, things would be in part distributed among the liberated peasants and in part kept for common use. One would think it was evident that on an estate of that kind, neither the houses, clothes, nor conservatories of the rich proprietor would be suitable for the liberated peasants, and they would not continue to keep them up. In the same way, when the working people are emancipated from the power of Government and capital, they will not continue to maintain the arrangements that have arisen under these powers, and will not go to work in factories and works which could only have come into existence owing to their enslavement, even if such factories could be profitable and pleasant for them.

It is true that when the workers are emancipated from slavery one will regret all this cunning machinery which weaves so much beautiful stuff so quickly, and makes such nice sweets, looking- glasses, etc., but, in the same way, after the emancipation of the serfs one regretted the beautiful race-horses, pictures, magnolias, musical instruments and private theaters that disappeared. But just as the liberated serfs bred animals suited to their way of life, and raised plants they required, and the race-horses and magnolias disappeared of themselves, so the workmen, freed from the power of Government and capital, will direct their labor to quite other work than at present.

"" But it is much more profitable to bake all the bread in one oven than that everybody should heat his own, and to weave twenty times as quickly at a factory as on a handloom at home,"" say the supporters of civilization, speaking as if men were dumb cattle for whom food, clothing, dwellings, and more or less labor, were the only questions to solve.

An Australian savage knows very well that it would be more profitable to build one hut for himself and his wife, yet he erects two, so that both he and his wife may enjoy privacy. The Russian peasant knows very decidedly that it is more profitable for him to live in one house with his father and brothers ; yet he Separates from them, builds his own cottage, and prefers to bear privations rather than obey his elders, or quarrel and have disagreement, "" Better but a pot of broth, and to be one's own master. "" I think the majority of reasonable people will prefer to clean their own clothes and boots, carry water, and trim their own lamps, than go to a factory and do obligatory labor for one hour a day to produce machines that would do all these things.

When coercion is no longer used, nothing of all these fine machines that polish boots and clean plates, nor even of those that bore tunnels and impress steel, etc., will probably remain. The liberated workmen will inevitably let everything that was founded on their enslavement perish, and will inevitably begin to construct quite other machines and appliances, with other aims, of other dimensions, and very differently distributed.

This is so plain and obvious, that men could not help seeing it if they were not under the influence of the superstition of civilization.

It is this wide-spread and firmly-fixed superstition that causes all indications of the falseness of the path the Western nations are traveling, and all attempts to bring the erring peoples back to a free and reasonable life, to be rejected, and even to be regarded as a kind of blasphemy or madness. This blind belief that the life we have arranged for ourselves is the best possible life, also causes all the chief agents of civilization — its Government officials scientists, artists, merchants, manufacturers, and authors— while making the workers support their idle lives — to overlook their own sins and to feel perfectly sure that their activity is, not an immoral and harmful activity (as it really is), but a very useful and important one, and that they are, therefore, very important people and of great use to humanity ; and that all the stupid, trifling, and nasty things produced under their direction, such as cannons, fortresses, cinematographs, cathedrals, motors, explosive bombs, phonographs, telegraphs, and steam printing-machines that turn out mountains of paper printed with nastiness, lies and absurdities, will remain just the same when the workers are free, and will always be a great boon to humanity.

Yet to people free from the superstition of civilization, it cannot but be perfectly obvious that all those conditions of life which among the Western nations are now called "" civilization,"" are nothing but monstrous results of the vanity of the upper, governing classes, such as were the productions of the Egyptian, Babylonian and Roman despots : the pyramids, temples and seraglios; or such as were the productions of the Russian serf-owners : palaces, serf-orchestras, private theatrical troupes, artificial lakes, lace, hunting packs and parks, which the slaves arranged for their lords.

It is said that if men cease to obey Governments and return to an agricultural life, all the industrial progress they have attained will be lost, and that, therefore, to give up obeying Government and to return to an agricultural life would be a bad thing. But there is no reason to suppose that a return to agricultural life, free from Government, would destroy such industries and achievements as are really useful to mankind, and do not require the enslavement of men. And if it stopped the production of that endless number of unnecessary, stupid and harmful things, on which a considerable portion of humanity is now employed, and rendered impossible the existence of the idle people who invent all the unnecessary and harmful things by which they justify their immoral lives, that does not mean that all that mankind has, worked out for its welfare would be destroyed. On the contrary the destruction of everything that is kept up by coercion, would evoke and promote an intensified production of all those useful and necessary technical improvements which, without turning men into machines and spoiling their lives, may ease the labor of the agriculturists and render their lives more pleasant.

The difference will only be, that when men are liberated from power and return to agricultural labor, the objects produced by art and industry will no longer aim at amusing the rich, satisfying idle curiosity, preparing for human slaughter, preserving useless and harmful lives at the cost of useful ones, or producing machines by which a small number of workmen can somehow produce a great number of things or cultivate a large tract of land ; but they will aim at increasing the productiveness of the work of those laborers who cultivate their own allotments with their own hands, and help to better their lives without taking them away from the land or interfering with their freedom...""

- Those that exist only or primarily to make someone else look or feel important (administrative assistants, elevator operators and doormen, receptionists)

- Those that are not only useless but actively harmful to society (sales and marketing occupations, corporate lobbyists and lawyers, military occupations, occupations in the finance sector

- Those that actively generate more socially useless work for others (managers)

When you lay these out, it starts to read like vague complaints rather than discrete, quantifiable categories. Is a rural credit union analyst a bullshit job because it's in the finance sector? Is a military position a bullshit job if there is a real threat of invasion from a foreign entity? Is an administrative assistant a bullshit job if they are actively supporting the day-to-day work of someone who doesn't have capacity for it?

juttfkw,t1_jupsq0t,2023-08-04 23:14:06,Economics,">Companies get tax abatements and such for creating X number of jobs, so the company creates a bunch of bs low-wage jobs to get to say they are job creators.

That's not really how any of this works. Tax abatements don't *give money to the company*; they just mean that the company doesn't have to pay certain taxes on the new facility that they are building. 

Hiring people means that they have to actually pay money. As does actually paying to build the facility. 

Company A is considering building a large warehouse in a county. 

The county says that if you build the warehouse and the warehouse employs 200 people, we will exempt you from property taxes on the warehouse for 10 years. 

(Assume property taxes on the warehouse would normally be $300,000 per year. Since the maximum property tax rate in my state for commercial property is 3%, this means a ˜$10 million building). 

Okay, so company A pays $10 million to buy the land and construct the building. And they then hire 200 people paying $15/hour (the wage is $10/hour; this includes ancillary expenses like FICA). 

So the company spent $10 million to construct a building, plus $6 million per year on wages, and in exchange...it doesn't have to pay property taxes on the building it built. 

That's *not* a good deal for the company.

Modern tax abatements tend to be more complicated than that, and may have the county agreeing to build or expand certain connecting roads and pay for the kind of utility hookups a 200 person facility needs. But they also tend to have particular metrics that allow the county to claw back certain expenditures if the employment numbers aren't met. 

But it never works the way you imagine.

To the chia pet example, if somebody buys a chia pet and it makes them happy, does that actually have no value? If it has value, then there's some value in transporting them.

juokm0a,t1_juoanqy,2023-08-03 22:11:25,Economics,"Cute story.

First, why is taking a risk treated as inherently valuable?

Yes, sometimes taking a risk is necessary, but it's not inherently valuable. Bank Robbery, for example, is quite risky, but we don't take this as evidence that the bank robber is entitled to his demands. In order for risk to be valuable, the overall product must also be valuable. Much of the risk, in fact, is that society won't find your ambition to be sufficiently valuable.

You also take too much credit when you say that ""the business"" wouldn't exist without you. Your particular business, which you named and love as a child, may not exist without you, but it doesn't mean that cars would not be made. Truthfully, your greatest contribution, ideally, would be to add to the competition, forcing yourself and your competitors to consistently improve your cars, your prices, and simultaneously your treatment of your employees. You may have had the ambition, and took the risk like a bank robber, but a teacher who inspires her students to start their own car-making co-op has done as much, and yet I don't see you advocating for that teacher to get a seven-figure salary, even though good teachers do society worlds more good than Mr. Carmaker CEO.

More importantly, the way things are valued doesn't really consider their benefit or harm to society or the world. Obviously, today, in the USA, most of us need cars to get to and from work, so that we can eat, so that we can live. But this wasn't true for hundreds of thousands of years of human history, and the environment was better for it. There were also fewer car accidents. Medical technology and indoor plumbing are certainly valuable to humanity, but for some reason plumbers and sewage engineers don't earn commensurate with their value. And garbage disposal workers? Without them - it doesn't bear thinking about! Do you really think that Mr. Carmaker is more valuable to society than a garbage disposal worker?

Sometimes innovation is good, and we desperately need it if we're going to save ourselves from the climate crisis, but your cute story ignores a lot of truths so that you can feel good thinking the world is fair.",Amerisu,t2_99n8qyl2,-3,0,reddit3

Peter Drucker, considered the father of management theory, wrote extensively about this topic. It is a holdover of the Industrial Era when lots of human capital was needed to do things. In those settings there was a need for a lot of managers to manage and direct a lot of human capital because most work was done by many humans. It is not needed like it was then, but we still have the desire to throw more humans at things in the hope that quantity can make up for lack of quality, or even result in more quantity.

>One of the groups that Graeber punches down at are receptionists and office managers. I can't even begin to imagine how out of touch that guy must be to think that these are people who don't do any work. It's totally insane and wildly offensive to anyone who knows what those jobs entail.

It's easy to pick on middle managerial jobs because their jobs are usually menial by design. They do not often require much skill or talent. They are typically directing work to others, which does not endear them to their colleagues. Firing off 30 emails a day to task the production of work off to other people is not the same level of work as creating the product itself. This argument lies at the heart of Marx's main complaint of his age. Of course people who do these sorts of management jobs would take offense to it, they do not see their lives or careers as menial, and they cannot say that their efforts are less important than the people they are directing lest they subject themselves to a lesser role or pay. 

That is not to say that a receptionist or manager has no value, but at the end day they are assisting others in doing work rather than producing it themselves. That is to say, a manager isn't as important in the business of software development as a coder as the business wouldn't exist without the coders. In an ideal world, coders would be promoted up to a manager, from manager up to executive, and so on. You may also expect a company to only use managers who have done the work they hand out, but most middle managers do not have that sort of experience, and that is where the rub is in many workplaces.

>Why do we treat each other so badly in assuming certain careers don't work hard or do meaningful things. It's crazy to me.

It's important to understand and realize that not all jobs or careers are the same; they do not require the same level of effort, skill, talent, and depending on their context they do not have the same level of importance and value. That is what this paper is addressing—the perceived uselessness of jobs. Some people realize that their jobs are relatively meaningless, and it creates a lot of anxiety and existential dread in society.

It depends on the type of work being done and people being managed, but if a company is appropriately staffed, then yes, managing a team of 10, 20, or 50 (depending on company) is way more work than just hammering away doing one thing for the company.  Engineering managers are among the most skilled people on the planet, IMO.

> That is not to say that a receptionist or manager has no value, but at the end day they are assisting others in doing work rather than producing it themselves.

I reject that being a member of a team, even in an indirect supporting role, doesn't directly contribute to the work being done.  It's asinine to suggest that a good secretary doesn't help the office work better, or that the office manager that oversees issues with the office doesn't contribute.  The contribution may be indirect, but it's a very real and necessary contribution.

> That is what this paper is addressing—the perceived uselessness of jobs. Some people realize that their jobs are relatively meaningless

Yea but it's a false ""realization"".  It's not true that there are many actually meaningless jobs.  Now if you're just saying it's a perception of meaninglessness, then yes, combating fools like Graeber are important, as anything else is just unnecessary denigration of people.

> America has been grappling with this for at least 30 years, you see it with pop culture movies like Office Space

It can be hard to see how someone's own contribution to a huge and invisible system like banking software contributes to the whole, but that doesn't mean it's not there.

The topic is too nuanced to discuss in broad strokes. Generally speaking the conversation of middle management falls into a few main categories; the efficacy of middle management—i.e. how much is too much, the skill and experience of middle management—i.e. should they require some or any experience with the people they manage, and the pay of middle management—i.e. should they be paid as much as the workers they're managing. 

You can imagine an organization where the middle manager is highly skilled and experienced, directing people who do the work they once did but do not have the same level of experience or skill. But you can also imagine the scenarios where a 25 year old fresh from a business school is managing engineers with many years of experience while being paid more.

>It's asinine to suggest that a good secretary doesn't help the office work better,

The secretary does help an office work better, but they're not the engineer, which is the crux of the discussion. They're not the same in value added nor skill. If a secretary doesn't work for a week you direct calls accordingly, if engineers don't show up, you don't get product.

>It's not true that there are many actually meaningless jobs. Now if you're just saying it's a perception of meaninglessness, then yes, combating fools like Graeber are important, as anything else is just unnecessary denigration of people.

Most of what's driving climate change is energy (electricity, the burning of oil for transport, etc) plus concrete, steel, and also some aspects of agriculture like (primarily) beef production.   Those David Hasselhoff Chia Pets are just not a huge part of emissions.    The most pertinent solution is to tackle the biggest parts of the problem.  So greening the grid, electrifying transport, making greener cement and steel, and so on.   

All of shipping is only 1.7% of emissions.  So that includes all those container ships.  What percentage of that 1.7% do you classify as ""consumerism""?   

https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector

I agree that people preferring pickup trucks and SUVs, and refusing to give up their beef stir-fry, are significant problems.  But I don't know if that falls under ""consumerism.""   I don't think people buying baubles and trinkets are really a substantial part of the problem.    This is more of a technology problem than a sin problem.    Sure, I'd love to incentivize and subsidize more mass transit.  

Nor do I think wealth inequality is the same as poverty.  Absolute poverty certainly can cause harm.  But someone having more than me is not a harm done to me.

Edit:

Realize too that even with ""consumerism"" at an all-time high, emissions in the US, Europe, the UK, and some other rich countries are declining.  Even when accounting for trade.   This will continue to improve, as we continue to green the grid and BEVs start representing a larger part of the fleet.

>>a raw material that is shipped in large unpackaged parcels. Dry bulk consists of mostly unprocessed materials that are destined to be used in the global manufacturing and production process. The commodities, which can include grain, metal, and energy materials""

But not everything that gets shipped is a frivolous luxury like a chia pet.   Clothing, TVs, medical equipment, and many other necessities also get shipped.  

And oil that gets used as feedstock is not a fossil fuel.  [Fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel) are when oil/gas are burned for energy.  Use as a feedstock isn't a fossil fuel.
