Number of hours worked, vacation time, number of night and weekend shifts, number of family or personal events missed for work, and time spent doing things that could easily be accomplished by someone with much less training all feed into the concept of fair compensation.

Hospital administration is where all the money is actually going, and they are the ones deciding to pile more and more responsibility on to those below while keeping pay the same.

There are medical policies in place  that state when procedure, test, or work up is appropriate. There is also usually a hierarchy of things that must first be done before you can receive that certain requested procedure or whatever.

For example, you go to the doctor for foot pain. Doctor wants to do an MRI and sends an auth request to the insurance. The insurance company might have a medical policy in place that states an X-ray must first be done and be inconclusive before an MRI is approved.

What's the point of an MRI if an X-ray can show the MD the source of the problem and determine treatment?

The amount hospitals and big pharma charge for services is outrageous. If you didn't have insurance, a single ambulance ride (let alone the services performed once you get to the hospital) could completely wipe out your bank account. If I think I have $3k in expected healthcare costs for the year, I'm willing to pay $5k to cap my total costs. Insurance companies will disappear once the need for insurance goes away.

For the record I'm 100% for a single payer, universal healthcare system (as long as risk exists I'll always have a job). But prices are just so god damn high, and insurance is zero-sum.

He seriously tried to pass a 99.5% tax on earnings over 100k, and when that failed he actually issued an executive order to tax all income over just 25k at literally 100%.

He outlawed possession of gold by executive order.

FDR was what people say Trump is: FDR was a fan of fascism, admiring Mussolini and regularly corresponding with him. His administration was also infiltrated by Russian (soviet) spies, and they absolutely had influence on him: in ww2 soviet troops were given precedence for American supplies over American troops.

Massive expansions of powers for the president. Massive amounts of new regulations.

His Supreme Court appoints were worse than any fear mongering you'll read about Trump's appointments. They basically rubber stamped anything he wanted. 

And there's the Agricultural Adjustment Act where he had livestock and crops destroyed in order to raise food prices. During the depression.

If everyone suddenly fell under the same umbrella youd have half a dozen balls less to juggle and there would be pretty large overhauls with insurance and laws regarding suing your physicians.

If there is a more centralized system across the board it makes everything easier, compliance included. Streamlining it is the way to go. New physicians would learn the same structure and there would be more focus on the medicine.

Combine that with New York making medical school free and you have a more singular plan that all doctors work and new doctors coming into the field debt free and with a lot more mobility in a unified system.

Youd have more people attending medical school with free college, even if it was just for med students. If you can get the grades then why not make grants for people trying to learn?

I can't tell you how many times I've called for orders on a patient and have the doctor say ""order whatever you want"" and just hang up.

The VAST majority of people with chronic pain should not be getting opioids. Period. You Amy resent that but the only reason you perceive that as acceptable is because drug companies convinced you. There is NO MEDICAL EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER to support the use of opioids in chronic pain.

Seeing as the medical community can’t regulate itself he only path forward is laws that regulate the market.

You're also forgetting that taxes are very high in these income tax brackets, so someone making $200K+ is usually left with ~$120K after state and federal and local taxes. Which sounds very good since that's $10K a month, until you calculate just how much interest is at 6.8% on the $350K you borrowed. So you'll be spending $2K a month just on the interest payments, then paying down your principal for another $2K on top of that. And you'll be doing that for years and years and years and years.

Now $6K after taxes and loan payments isn't unlivable, but considering that you've sacrificed many years of income going to medical school then suffering through residency you're actually not significantly better off than someone who simply worked the last 8 years.

Do you know how you compare to the benchmark wRVUs for your specialty?  We pay our providers based on a P&L model where we basically take their collections and subtract their expenses (base salary, secretary and PA salaries, travel, malpractice, overhead, etc) and we give them half back in a bonus and keep the rest for operating expenses.  This incentivizes productivity and reduction of expenses and IMO is the best comp model at aligning incentives between administration and the providers. Our billing office is responsible for responding to denials, but I would say 80% of the denials come from provider error in documentation so there is usually some follow up or corrective action necessary from the provider to resolve the denial and receive payment.  I think we all have procedural and documentation tasks we have to do in our jobs that if we didn't have to we could be more efficient (or see more patients in your case), but that's the reality in healthcare where people's lives are at risk; there are lots of regulations and requirements necessary to keep people safe and also these are large sums of money changing hands between insurers and the hospitals so I don't blame them for having strict requirements for payments.  My hospital was non-profit and the highest paid employees (besides the handful of executives) were all highly productive surgeons, there isn't some magic pot of money floating around being paid out to administration and in fact salaries, benefits, and malpractice expense for our providers represented over 50% of the total expenses at our hospital.",iamedreed,t2_d9emb,-1,0,reddit2

Did you even read the post you responded to?  The first sentence clearly indicates it's about 'for-profit health insurance'. 

> Healthcare costs aren’t driven by insurance alone,

Of course health care costs are not 100% due to insurance, that's a ridiculous statement to make and your strawman demonstrates your unwillingness to debate in good faith. It's really quite simple: insurance *adds* to the cost of heath care, without providing anything that actually contributes to keeping people healthy. 

>insurance pricing is a highly regulated and meticulously tracked system.

You obviously do not understand the issue. Insurance pricing isn't the problem, it's that insurance companies are incentivized to deny claims (i.e. deny treatment) to people as often as possible, regardless of if they need the treatment or not, generally against the wishes of the doctor who is most knowledgeable about the patients situation. 

>the reason insurance came about in the beginning was to cover catastrophic events, and it still does that just fine.

No, it doesn't do that 'fine', it's grossly inefficient. Insurance companies are not adding money into the health care system, they're leeching money out of it. A group of N People pay X amount of premiums, when one of that group gets very sick that pool of premiums is used to cover the cost. No money is coming out the pocket of the insurance company, their redistributing money from people who don't get sick to people who do get sick. 

The same thing could be achieved by forming a joint bank account where every one deposited their premiums, and then people who get sick use the account to pay for treatment. The fact that insurance companies are profitable demonstrates that you would never run out of money, because total health care costs are less than the total money paid for health care (via insurance). 

Or, you could remember that an entity already exists whose founding purpose was to organize and distribute risk among a group of people by pooling resources (e.g. taxes) in times of surplus in order to protect against catastrophic events (e.g. war, famine, natural disaster, etc).

Each household is issued a health debit account and card, which the government recharges the balance on annually. The government limits expenditures to regulated expenditures which are deemed medically safe. However patients can otherwise spend the balance similarly to cash and pay doctors directly.

There would be no public or private insurance agency which had to debate whether or not a test is necessary and whether the cost that should be paid, as there would be no middle man which rations access to care. Whether or not to have the test and whether it is worth the money is a decision made entirely between the patient and doctor.

The government can also reduce limit gouging by emergency healthcare providers without having to setup a national health insurer to centrally negotiate prices, by simply passing a statutory law which requires emergency service providers to publicly publish all prices charged for emergency services, and to charge patients the lowest price publicly published within the past 3 months.

Healthcare providers which overcharged patients would be criminally prosecuted for fraud, and public health debit accounts would provide a universal guarantee of liquidity and cash for emergency health care expenditures, without the need for rationing by either public insurance agencies or private insurance companies.",qmx5000,t2_1edmncd2,-3,0,reddit2

First, NYU is a top 3 MD program. They already have one of the most competitive applicant pools with a median gpa/mcat of 3.93/521 (99th percentile). Hard to get more competitive than that.   


Second, I don't think this will decrease less than well off families from getting in.  Medical schools carefully craft their classes. They have a specific class in mind of mixed racial, economic, and social backgrounds. They even go as far to hand select people with different medical interests/backgrounds (research, serving the under served, non traditional background, etc). They are very good at weeding out and limiting those who simply have good grades and 'impressive' extracurriculars due to being well off.   


Third, fresh graduates will most likely go straight into the work force. Unlike what you seem to suggest, fellows, residents, and researchers are all part of the work force. After 4 yrs of medical school, fresh graduates go through a process called the 'match' where you get placed into a hospital for your residency. The match is not so kind to those who feel like just taking time off for trivial reasons. Once you are a resident, you are effectively a doctor who is working as much as learning. This is the next step in becoming a 'fellow' or 'attending' (fully trained doctors with no further necessary formal education in their position).

Not every outcome is a cure. Sometimes just 'not being in pain all the time' is a positive outcome worth paying for. Granted it should pay far less than a cure, but it's not nothing.

But if someone can't be helped then why is a doctor/patient interaction necessary at all? They can't be helped. Don't waste time or money in that case. There's no way to spin ""did literally nothing to help the patient"" into ""I deserve to get paid""",,,1,0,reddit2

And you'd be right if you were thinking of CPI or RPI, however claims inflation is a lot higher than either those. Why is that the case? Well what determines claim size? It will be the cost of repairing a car. I'm sure you know that that is a lot more expensive these days than it used to be due to all the specialised electronics, technical expertise required etc.., and it keeps going higher.

What if you get into an accident and injure someone? The insurer will defend you in court. Unfortunately the US is known for its ridiculously litigious society. Lawyers love charging out of the nose and milking insurers for as much as they can, and court awards are spiralling out of control.

Then the court decides the accident was your fault and you have to pay the victim's medical costs. Well those certainly aren't pegged to normal inflation and are a lot *lot* higher.

So the combined effect of court award, repair cost, and medical inflation is what drives your premiums up. Even if you haven't had an accident your premium will go up in line with the cost of an average claim.

In fact, motor insurance margins are so tight that the premiums insurers receive *do not* cover the cost of claims, and actually rely on investment income from these premiums to make some profit.

They delay payment long enough until the study concludes and shuts down. So the hospital spends a year trying to get them to pay until the moment there is literally no study left to pay for the procedures that have been done. At this point the hospital just has to write off these charges some of which are hundreds of thousands of dollars. The hospital just writes them off like they're nothing whereas in a different situation they expect patients to pay similar amounts of money when their insurance denies coverage.

My point was that, in a perfect world, doctors should be able to try *any and all* methods to deliver treatment. But since treatment isn't free, insurance companies need to reel in the types of services providers do to make premiums ""more"" affordable.

So although I can't say what's necessary and what isn't based on the specific individual, I know what's necessary 99% of the time for individuals that present those symptoms. And if doctor's are trying things that don't work, well then that makes people's premiums go up.

This can be solved by issuing every household a publicly funded, universal health debit account, which patients can spend like cash on any licensed doctor or medically safe health care procedure.

Wrong; that's what the insurance companies may say, but that's not what it is. It's a managed and administrated system that extracts a profit by (ostensibly) pooling risk, and then by doing whatever it can to lower it's own costs while increasing it's own income - no matter how much those actions harm or cost anyone else. 

And many insurance companies are not even pooling risk anymore. Many are using basically a per-head payment to primary care physicians (i.e., they pay $500 per year to a physician for each patient for whom they're the primary care provider; the amount is of course adjusted based on age and whatnot), with the requirement that the doctor cover any amounts that vary from this set amount. As a result, the doctor absorbs all the financial risk - because the insurance company has that per-head agreement so they're paying the same amount no matter what. Because this is a huge financial burden for the doctor's office, and there is no kind of affordable business insurance or underwriting to help the doctor's office afford this, many small practices are closing and the doctors move to larger conglomerates, because this pools that risk.

There are many patients who are just in and out of the hospital constantly for their CPS symptoms. Many people just don’t have the patience for what a pain clinic can provide.

> The doctors that work in ER’s are not qualified to treat Chronic Pain 

Well they’re certainly qualified to treat it, the ED is just not the right setting to do so. Treating COS appropriately requires following up with someone over the long term and not getting tons of workup and unnecessary tests. That’s just not reasonable for an ED doc. But that doesn’t change the fact that on a daily basis they are treating CPS patients. Just like ED doctors often treat cancer patients pain (not saying CPS is equivalent to cancer).

> If someone comes to your hospital faking a migraine and wanting drugs to treat it would you then class all migraine sufferers as drug addicts and dismiss all migraine complaints as a drug seeking ploy?

Unfortunately advocation just isn’t that simple. The opioid epidemic isn’t that homeless man with track marks on his arms. It’s the 40 year old housewive with anxiety/CPS who got addicted to Percocet after back surgery. It’s the 25 year old college student who ran into a pill pushing doc who told him his chronic back pain was CPS and prescribed Oxycodone as needed. These days the overlap between drug seeking and true pain can almost be impossible. 

> It takes a multitude of disciplines to treat CPS and though opioids are one line of defense it rarely if ever a cure all. 

Many would argue a multitude of disciplines are what cause CPS. If you have chronic pain that is just your average pain that most humans have but that you have doctor after doctor refer you for more work up it just increases your anxiety about the pain. And it’s well documented that anxiety is one of the biggest contributing factors to CPS.",backtoreality00,t2_13xjln,1,0,reddit2
e4eeznz,t1_e4eec0r,2018-08-18 07:42:00,science,Not just “complex” but absolutely impossible with CPS which is basically the catch all term for pain that a patient reports that we can’t explain based on a clear pathological reason. It’s not like we have a test or imaging study that tells you you have CPS. A diagnosis of CPS is usually made after a long work up is done. But there’s also a lot of evidence that his long work up is a major factor in causing CPS in the first place. A good portion of patients with CPS would improve significantly if their PCP sent them directly to physical therapy/psych/social work or a number of supportive specialties. But most of these patients are sent through anxiety provoking workup that just makes the symptoms worse. I have seen soooo many CPS patient with “bowel issues” who have had countless colonoscopies that were negative and that get more worked up and anxious after every test and symptoms get worse and worse because of that anxiety about more and more testing. Adding in opioids to that complex situation is just a recipe for disaster.,backtoreality00,t2_13xjln,1,0,reddit2

Let's talk about your ER trip for ""dehydration"" because you bring up a lot of interesting points. The cost of your trip is not established by the ER doctor seeing you. The hospital determines billing and costs. They have entire departments set up to manage billing. ER docs are not always employees of the hospital, and in many cases the group they work for is hired and the hospital pays the medical group. The cost of supplies is irrelevant to the problem. Where do you think the money comes from to pay the administrator who checked you in? The nurse who triaged you? The nurse who evaluated you and set up the equipment to get your vital signs? The nurse who stopped by to administer your Tylenol/morphine/whatever. The doctor who saw you in the ED? The staff who cleaned the room after your discharge? The disposal of the sharps used in your encounter? 

I think it is also important to consider that going to the ED because you are dehydrated can be a huge waste of resources. Why wouldn't you just drink some water? 

I know this all comes off as rude. It really is extremely frustrating for people to point fingers when it isn't needed or even in the right direction. ",slicedapples,t2_c5xie,8,0,reddit2

It would be the job of public health (which is seriously underfunded right now) alongside a colossal shift in the philosophy of medicine that revisits the idea of social medicine. My point in the prior comment was that medicine tends to downplay social conditions that generate poor health-those are at the root of a lot of things like obesity, and focusing on only the immediate individual is only part of the solution. It's and important one, but in my view it is unfair to expect doctors to be able to fix something like obesity when much of our society is actively obesogenic. As you can imagine, it is way harder and more political to, for instance, lobby for policies that subsidize processed corn syrup less and fresh fruit and carrots more , but it is necessary for a lasting solution to many health inequalities.

The government actively subsidizes many of the industries that got us so fat. Where I live I can get a week's worth of frozen processed food for the same price as a bag of apples. If eating healthy isn't economically accessible then lots of people will choose to eat the easy garbage because they don't have time or money for anything else. So an issue like that also needs to be addressed by the institution of medicine in the future as well. That doesn't mean it's doctor's jobs, but the organization will eventually need to evolve to have a branch that addresses those social determinants head on.

e4g5le6,t1_e4eebb3,2018-08-19 04:57:46,science,"Yeah and that is very typical. My reason for saying that is semantics. Home builders themselves have to be certified and bonded by an insuraner. You can only be insured if you're certified so you have to go through a 2 year course on say plumbing to be able to do contracted plumbing work. Then another 2 for electrical (maybe more specifically here) then also another 2 for general carpentry to do foundation laying and frame setting and all the trim work. Another 2 years for HVAC, then you have the flooring certification that I believe is a year and painting you basically just have to show that you know what you're doing. Most of the time the actual work is handed off to helpers certified in their relevant fields to DO the actual work but the homebuilder is the point man on every single thing and I think title of homebuilder is a professional one and what I believe your friends do if they're certified and insured is maybe not in all the relevant fields or maybe one. I know in highschool you can opt for vocational schools in the 11th and 12th grade and be certified and insurable by the time you graduate in whatever field you chose and start a construction company that will subcontract out work but in the homebuilder scenario the homebuilder has dictation over what the electrical guy might say whereas in your friends scenario if their relevant field is plumbing/HVAC but not electrical the electrical guy you hire has the final authority on what can be done electrically. These guys who do build homes go through a lot of schooling to do it professionally and on top of that it's hard labor. I have nothing but respect for them and the people that are involved down to the no education level because willing to be there to be a helping hand doesn't take a genius, but it does take a genius or damn near to be able to efficiently and consistently build homes as a home builder certified in all relevant fields.

And if you SUSPECT gout, you can start the patient on indocin or whatever, and discharge them. MAYBE you can order an outpatient procedure. I should also add that she has a positive history of gout, but even without knowing that, the test is overkill. Their working diagnosis was cellulitis. I had to take the day off from work and drive down there, yell at the residents and force their hands to take a damn x-ray. Her presentation, from her history to her examination to her lab work was textbook classical.

Journals are littered with studies showing how unnecessary the aspirate is in most cases. Clinical diagnosis is perfectly acceptable in most cases. In fact, most physicians will only order the aspiration to rule OUT gout, not rule it IN.

Lets assume it's $1 a month or $480. Admin fee is about 12%. That means every 1 dollar put into the system only $0.88 is paid out. For higher risk item percentage taken by admin fee is higher.

Prices are based on rating factors, which determine how prone you are to claiming. These are based on lots of statistics from an insurer's history. Most insurers will use similar rating factors, although there can be some variation. Most common ones are age of the driver, make of the car, postal code, etc..

The actuaries at your insurer would have looked at the data and seen that some cars are more likely to be involved in a claim (either accident or theft) and therefore owners of those vehicles will be charged a higher price. So in that sense there is some truth to that, although I obviously don't know the finer details of your policy (and I don't work in motor insurance or in the US).

The cost of insurance may seem high relative to the value of the car, however the bulk of that cost isn't covering your car (and indeed none of it is if you only have third party liability). It's to cover the damage you could cause to *other* people. ",shizzler,t2_3xf7m,3,0,reddit2

Or did you jump straight to the comments to add an uneducated opinion about your anecdotal experiences? 

>Now lets pretend the I took up a full hour of the doctors time not 5 minutes 

Alright we can pretend anything you want. The doctor may have been in your room for 5 minutes, but how much charting did he do before and after seeing you? You make all these assumptions in your post but they remain assumptions without any factual evidence. A person's salary does not equate to how much they cost a business. There are several costs incurred by employees. Including health insurance, retirement plans, and other benefits not included with salary. As well the administrators who might of contacted you after your hospital visit. As well as other administrators. 

>  I didn't drink water because I couldn't, I was vomiting when I tried.

Alright so you weren't only ""dehydrated"" and likely had something else going on. Did you try an anti emetic? Did you seek out an appointment with your PCP? Try an urgent care? Hospital visits are always more expensive than either of the above two. It is frustrating for everyone when someone shows up with a condition that could likely be handled in an outpatient setting. (As a caveat dehydration can be extremely serious. Though based on your story it doesn't seem you fall into that category)  

If you were uninsured you could easily contact the billing department of the facility and ask for help with the bill. Many hospitals have programs to help patients pay bills when they cannot afford them. As well they may simply reduce the bill for you just by asking. 

>Third, okay you are right. The US has completely normal medical costs, it isn't expensive at all. 

No where in my post was it ever implied that the system works. In fact it is very broken. However you cannot sit here any blame physicians as being the root cause. As this is simply not the case. Maybe take a second and review the information out there explaining why costs are so high instead of pointing fingers at the wrong people. Physicians (along with nurses/PAs/NPs) all work hard to make sure patients improve and get better. They are not the cause of your high hospital bills. So again instead of saying-

Insurance companies come in with a price point that is purely to their advantage. The price is not established based on useful life of the machine or by any other cost based method you’d find in any other industry - other insurance industries included. They set a price and the hospital often has a choice of either agreeing or not getting a piece of equipment that is vitally important to their community.

Just a couple things I noticed about those facts and opinions (because there were both).

1. I've never had to wait for 5 hours for a specialist. And I've heard many stories about horrific experiences in Canadian systems. I'm glad your experience has not been the same as many of your Canadian comrades.



2. The system doesn't facilitate medical advances and better prices. Or perhaps it does and I'm missing something. But where is the incentive to invest in medical advances if the entire market is dictated by what the government feels is proper compensation? 

In a free market system, prices and quality go down as competition increases. Even our current system has limited this process. I can't go get an x-ray without having it go through my insurance. How much can an x-ray possibly cost? It's a machine that can do limitless tests. In a free market system, we would have x-ray technicians competing against each other so we can get the best practice and least cost. 

3. Venezuela (not Cuba, I'll do some research on their system) has socialized everything, right? There are actual doctors and engineers living there who are opting to sell fruit on a free market or be a taxi driver because the free market is more lucrative than a government paid system.


4. I am mad that we pump our hard earned cash into healthcare. Where we disagree is the solution to that. I'm saying, the solution is to spend less and rely on a different system. 

I'm confused on your solution, which is apparently to spend more in order to get fuller coverage? That's the only way to get more and better things, is to spend more. 

Let me know if I missed anything. Like I said, I'm trying to figure this out however possible, making a conscious effort to receive information. Excuse me if my bias is hard to overcome, I'll make efforts to fight that.

Probably from people who've never used it, or from people who have a vested interest in the insurance-led system you have. There are some outliers (eg., Canada), but [most countries with universal healthcare schemes have shorter hospital wait times](https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4243829/waiting_times.png) than the US. This suggests Canada's issue is with it's specific implementation, and not an issue with socialised healthcare as a system.
Also, any wait time is shorter than never if you can't afford it, and are needed less in any case due to the prevalence of preventative care (which is often avoided in the US).

> US still has the best doctors and facilities people flock to

Yes, but they have to be able to afford it first. The US has great Medical facilities and people, but a terrible healthcare system - which includes the ability to actually utilise (eg., afford) it.

There is no citation needed for the transitive property, it's logically intuitive through the definitions. This is what is called logic. Diagnosis determines course of action, this is also axiomatic. If you are twisting the definitions to mean something else you then need to define them, but otherwise this is a simple pretty undebatable concept.

Law of the implement would then be misdiagnosis then. How you are positing difference is unclear. And again, the patient controlling the surgeons hands is pretty disgusting to posit right? I mean, I can't see your face but I would like to look at it when you say this phrase.

You didn't say that. You said **fraud**.  Don't backtrack now. 

As for the majority (or even plurality) being from misdiagnosis?  That's explicitly *not* stated anywhere, and the definition includes treatment plans that could've been far more conservative (eg, elderly male patients with prostate cancer should almost never have surgery to treat it, any ones who do have probably had unnecessary surgery absent significant other factors -- that doesn't mean that it was misdiagnosed.)

So feel free to cite this additional claim, which by the way contradicts your previous one. You previously said it was 2.4 million **fraudulent** diagnosis, that's different than misdiagnosis. 
>You can continue to talk in circles but you haven't offered any rational competing explanation for these 2.4 million unnecessary surgeries, 

Sure, we discussed patients pushing for the surgeries (eg, [Kanye West's mother](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20093405/how-did-donda-west-die-kanye-west/)), we discussed the [law of the instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument), and we shouldn't have to but apparently we need to specify that sometimes people make mistakes. 

A less than 4% rate of unnecessary surgery, when factoring out the first two reasons (2.4 million unnecessary surgeries minus patient pushes and law of the instrument, approximately 53.3 million surgeries done per year, etc) is a lot simpler an explanation (see: [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)) than ""DOCTORS COMMIT 2.4 MILLION FRAUDS ON PATIENTS"" -- which, to be clear, was your exact claim.
>you've tried to explain through saying diagnosis, prognosis, and course of treatment are different, and I agree that they are, but that means nothing.

It illustrates how little you understand that you continuously misuse basic terminology about the subject.

It absolutely requires you to cite that they were intentionally misdiagnosed in order to get them into surgery.

Yeah.... you're doing that obfuscating thing you accused me of.  So lets bring this back around to the central point:

If you want to now change the subject to something else, and not continue to both argue circularly, and change the subject, then you are going to have to state your question clearly, state what you think my opinion is, as you understand it, and state why you think it is wrong and what you think is correct.

That's not *different aspects* of the conversation, it's your central point. It's the first statement you made. 

>These include; a definition of intentionally misdiagnosing pathology in order to do for-profit surgery as fraud.


Yes, you misunderstood what diagnosis meant, and as a result had to be corrected.  Issue tied up. 

>If you want to now change the subject to something else, and not continue to both argue circularly, and change the subject, then you are going to have to state your question clearly, state what you think my opinion is, as you understand it, and state why you think it is wrong and what you think is correct.

Again, you seem to be trying to obfuscate the original issue you put forward.  You made the claim, back it up. 

>Preferably not in a long and incoherent diatribe, but succinct and with brevity, if you think that's within your ability.

Here's the succinct point: You made an illogical claim and are obfuscating in order to try to avoid backing it up.
