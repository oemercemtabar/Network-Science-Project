i9o0jzp,t1_i9n19vk,2022-05-23 10:09:46,starbucks,"The sweet cream cold foam is made with roughly equal parts vanilla syrup, 2%, and heavy cream (not exact measurements, there's more heavy cream and less 2%, but close enough)

My theory is people are getting it when they actually want whipped cream because they think it's healthier (our whipped cream is roughly an ounce of vanilla syrup to I believe 16 oz heavy cream) 

The cold foam is a nice texture, but it's super sweet considering it's about 33% vanilla syrup. It's good on the cold brew if you want a sweeter coffee without adding syrups or sweeteners directly to the coffee. On anything else, it's so unnecessary, especially when it's a shaken espresso (espresso foam and cold foam mix weird) or a hot drink (it just melts down in, at which point you might as well have gotten pumps of vanilla and heavy cream in the drink), and I honestly don't think people realize how many calories they're drinking every day.

The doctor recommended having a fairly simple procedure done to fix it and was covered by his insurance but he REFUSES to do it. Like gets visibly angry whenever the doctor brings it up. 

I've worked there for a year now and every month on the dot he calls complaining about the callus's. Same ones. Same problem. Same answer whenever the doctor mentions it.

Our professor paired the entire class off with partners and directed us to stare at each other for something like 2 or 3 minutes without looking away or speaking. As we were waiting for the exercise to begin, we stood face-to-face exchanging small talk. That's when it happened. Seconds after she declared she wasn't pregnant, the buzzer started and we silently stared at each other for the duration. Yes, I was mortified and apologized profusely before and after. She was very kind about it and explained it wasn't the first time someone assumed she was expecting. She told me then, but I don't recall her exact condition now (it wasn't simple weight gain). Years later, I learned about things like fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, etc.  all which can sometimes cause an extended belly giving the appearance of early pregnancy.

jplm7zb,t1_jplim3y,2023-06-26 15:36:28,starbucks,"Yup typically they can. We actually just did a procedure a few weeks ago on someone with claw toes and they seemed to be repositioning quite smoothly. Not that tenotomies are full proof, but they aren't very invasive and doesn't require anything but lidocaine for numbing. So getting one done doesn't hurt the body like having a more invasive surgery. The only defect I havent seen the doctor try to correct with a tenotomy is a mallet toe, which I think is only cause we havent had a patient want to bother fixing it

Our clinic usually does treatment to them in the order of over the counter product (like a cushion or splints) -> tenotomy-> surgery. Idk if most offices do it like this but it's how we usually do it here lol. Then again, our doctor tries to avoid putting patients in surgery as much as possible (cause surgery sucks)",NamiaX,t2_hhwmzfv0,8,0,reddit3

This happened as I was working alone and I had a line, how I manage is I take one customer at a time, get their food and make their drinks and then next customer doing it this way minimizes forgetting items.I had this one lady come in and she was like the third customer in my line and I have a gentleman at the register that I'm making his food. She buts in and is like "" Excuse me mam"" And I retort "" hey ill be with you in just a minute"" and continue finishing the food.

for things like nails and dogs, I'd say make conversation stretch a little after complimenting.

""any occasion you did your nails for?"" or ""i wish i could get mine done but i work here"" are also natural progressions.

ikfeb04,t1_ikf74ev,2022-08-15 20:12:58,starbucks,"Yeah, like every good barista figures that out within a couple weeks of starting.  You'll make friends with some regulars and chat them up while working.  My favorite customer was a Domino's delivery driver who came in for a venti brewed coffee like 5 times a night.  When it was slow for both of us he'd chill at the hand-off plane or at the front registers and we'd talk while I was cleaning.  He'd occasionally bring us free mistake pizzas.

That dude got the best service ever, because he was chill, friendly, came in a million times a week, and mostly came in when it was slow.  Random NPC customer #653 that ordered a tall VBCF and I never saw them again got a polite greeting and a ""hey, here's your shit.""

ikfgfl7,t1_ikf6ff5,2022-08-15 20:26:07,starbucks,"Speaking as a former partner (made it to ASM before realizing the Siren was draining my will to live), the problem with it is it's just so fake, man.  We all know there's no way you actually care what their answer is.  Maybe you do for the first 5, 10, hell maybe even the first 50.  But by customer 300 you absolutely don't give a shit what their answer is, and if you claim you do you're either lying or sort of a psychopath, no offense.

Like try going up to a random person on the street and asking what their favorite color is out of the blue.  You're going to get the same reactions as those Yelp reviews.  

If you really can't see what's wrong with your approach, flip it around.  Honestly ask yourself how you would react if you went to the Taco Bell DT, it's late at night and you're tired and hungry and just want a taco, and suddenly some disembodied voice is trying to talk about colors with you.  Again, if you think that's ok, you're a little bit psycho and need to work on empathizing with others more.

Good connections can't be forced.  Corporate needs to learn that.  That said, baristas need to learn to read the situation and engage where appropriate.  SMs need to get a lot better about not hiring anti-social douches to what's essentially a customer service rep position, then expecting them to behave like normal, well-adjusted people.  

It sucks that your SM prioritizes their bonus over your life not being miserable at work.  That's a whole different issue.  But the color thing?  Just stop.

ii2japl,t3_walpjq,2022-07-29 01:31:53,starbucks,"The reason corporate approved signs don't work isn't because of the lack of information on them, just as the sign OP posted doesn't work, it's cuz customers don't know what the heck is in their drinks.

They don't know what makes anything most of the time. So saying we're out of something tells them nothing no matter how specific you are.

To be honest I get *more* frustrated when a sign is up and people still ask for stuff then I do when there's no sign and I just have to explain. But really I've stopped explaining what we don't have and I just tell them what we do. If they roll up and try to order a coffee based frappuccino and I don't have roast I just say something like ""sorry I'm out of the coffee base for that but I can make it with espresso if you want"" or ""sorry, I can't make that peach green tea because we're out of peach. However, I do have all of my refreshers you can mix it with or raspberry syrup. Would you like to try that instead?""

They always either have a backup ready or go with the suggestion. Which is better for the metrics than any sign, corporate or handwritten.

Edit: I also must admit, I'm super surprised that nobody made you take this down. With as hard as they're pushing customer connection and all that training we just had to do?

frvq0gg,t1_frvhgzb,2020-05-26 15:51:36,starbucks,"If you know multiple incident reports have been filed and they're still around, talk to your SM about filing a harassment report with your local PD. Do not mention it is because the company failed to protect you. Do continue to pressure managers to file incident reports as needed and simultaneously document incidents yourself (a notes file in your phone is fine).

Your SM will probably tell you not to. Say ""this is a recurring issue that has not subsided despite multiple incident reports, so unless something changes this is my next step because I am currently scared to come to work"". They will probably ask you to wait while they talk to the DM/RM.

If the DM/RM fix the problem and actually ban them (which they absolutely have the authority and legal right to do; a business can ban anyone from private property for virtually any reason), you're done.

If they try and feed you some corporate rug sweepy bullshit, repeat that you and your team have documented repeated incidents of harassment over the last x weeks/months and the situation hasn't improved, so your next step is to escalate to a higher authority. Remind them that the customer's behavior violates the Customer Expectations in the Third Place thing they came up with and had us post in the lobby after the May 9, 2018 meetings. Request that the lot of you call PCC right then and there for advice and options. If they refuse, call PCC on your own time (and ask if they want you to call back with the # for the Police Report you will be filing). Make sure they know you tried to resolve the issue through your SM then DM/RM.

Then visit your local police department (if possible, if you can't be there physically try over the phone then online if the phone doesn't work out) and file a report. Include all the incidents that have already been documented, with dates. Include that you have exhausted your channels within the company. Include as much information about the shitty customer as you can (physical description, when they come in, what they drive, their plate number if you can get it). Give the report number to your SM. 

A single officer will be ""in charge"" of your report. Get their contact info. If another incident occurs, file an incident report with Starbucks, tell your SM personally, and call your officer and update your Police Report. 

Yes, it's a lot of work. Yes, it's tedious. BUT you need to make sure the company will get more bad press for refusing to listen to you and ban the asshole than they would if they banned the asshole and said asshole threw a fit.

-the pandemic is still going strong, and the variants are on the rise.  People get sick and are out, others who have been in contact with those people may have to isolate and are also out.  Often stores are running on a skeleton crew.



-many stores are drive thru only right now.  Cafe and mobiles may be closed, so the only route to get something from us is the drive thru.  People who would normally come inside or mobile order and run in to grab it are now going through the drive thru, adding to the line.



-after school hour is often a mini rush in stores near schools.  High school kids come through, and often have separate orders in the same car, and often those drinks are things like frappuccinos that take more time to make.  Parents on their way to pick up their kids have the same idea that you do, to grab a drink to sip on while they wait for their child.



-this one is already improving, but around the holidays is particularly busy.  Many people are off work, out shopping, and visiting family.  There are many, many cars where someone is making a coffee run for the whole family, and they order 4+ drinks and food.  If every car in front of you is like this, it's going to make your wait time much longer.  Plus a lot of people who don't often go to Starbucks come out for our holiday drinks.



Add these things to the fact that the pandemic has caused a massive shift in the workforce, and like OP said, you have stores all across the service industry that are understaffed and undertrained.  It's a perfect storm.",Ashesremindme,t2_1204mg,7,0,reddit1

One thing about blond shots is that it foams way more than regular shots, so be prepared when ordering it in a frappuccino or shaken espresso, as the blending/shaking makes lots of foam.

Giving your vaccination records to the school, they are required to keep it private if you have a reason for medical or religious exemption. Medical privacy laws still exist there. Some private schools don't allow exemptions, but that's their right as a private entity.

The issue is the court case that protects these privacies is Roe vs. Wade, the same case that protects the right to abortion. The mandates being passed don't allow privacy or exemptions, which erodes the basis of that case were it to be challenged. 

My issue is with calling people who are against the mandates anti-vax, when it has nothing to do with being vaccinated for many of the people against it. I strongly believe in being vaccinated and wearing masks. I am concerned with the potential erosion of Roe vs. Wade and labeling the people concerned about that as Anti-Vax. Equating people who are against non-exemption vaccine mandates and vaccine cards with those who are against vaccines and masks is a dishonest way to dismiss legitimate concerns by marking them all as crazy.

It's why so many American states are pushing more anti-abortion laws with legal punishment, the vaccine mandates have changed legal precedents and they're trying to attack that.

I highly doubt the customer was pro-vax. But these attacks on people who are anti-mandate and showing vaccine cards are not anti-vax, people who don't believe in covid/vaccines are anti vax.

The thing that has been bothering me is so many people using the term ""anti-vax"" to refer to people who are against mandates or showing vaccine certificates, when the term used to be specifically about people who didn't believe in the science of vaccines, which is a totally different issue.

Right now in America we have a supreme court stacked with anti-abortionists. And the law protecting abortion, Roe vs Wade, is based upon the right to medical privacy, ""my body, my choice.""

Those precedents are being eroded and the Republicans are taking advantage of that to send more anti-abortion laws through the courts. I am scared of the term ""anti-vax"" with all its anti-science connotations being used by people to reinforce the chipping away of other values we hold dear, the right to choose. 

Sorry for the long read and bringing up a topic that's not as relevant in your country.

Few things. First off, the mandates do allow for valid medical exemptions.

hfqm80u,t1_hfpbp8l,2021-10-07 15:31:53,starbucks,"Medical exemptions mean that you don't get an vaccination card, and can't gain entry to places that require it (example of a temporary exemption: doctors recommend waiting 90 days after having contracted Covid for vaccination, anti bodies in this time period are as high as having the shot, the wait is to give your body a boost at the end of that time period. But having proof of high antibodies does not allow access to many places, you must have a vaccine card.)

Second, yes, I do apologize about it being not as big a deal in Canada, however, Starbucks is an American company, and therefore I think shouldn't be making it policy, that's up to the local government.

Lastly, private entities should not be subverting the laws. You are correct though, that directly will not erode the law, there are several steps of someone taking the vaccine card issue to the supreme court and it being found constitutional before Roe vs. Wade could be challenged. And I am concerned about the Republican politicians appealing to a supreme court that leans Republican. I just don't want them to have any basis to do so on.

In closing, my main point is that all my above arguements are examples of someone who is anti-mandate, not anti-vax, and I don't think the two should be conflated whether people agree with that or not. 

(Thank you for the discussion, it forced me to spend time looking at the exact mandates and laws, the path that anti-mandate family has been upset about is much longer than I was led to believe, even if it is a concern.

hj2ix9a,t3_qlalau,2021-11-02 22:16:22,starbucks,"I'm lucky in that my store is very slow and not usually very busy. Because of this, we usually only have 2 people on opens until about 10:30am, when the rest come in. So the other day, it was my manager and I, and we were starting to get the late morning rush. A line was forming and I had 3 deliveries I was trying to push out because the drivers were waiting on me. Usually people can obviously see what you're doing when you're packing the bags, and nearly always they don't mind waiting the couple seconds it takes us to finish the delivery bag.

I was finishing the bags and this woman and her son were on my till. The son starts saying ""excuse me"" and just started telling me what he wanted even though my back was turned (probably prompted by his mother). So I stop packing, and start taking his order. A caramel iced latte, super simple. I put the cup through to my manager on bar, tell them it will be ready at the end, and go back to finishing the bags. This lady does not. move off. my till. She just continues -staring- at me. My manager notices after about 10 seconds and comes over to ask if she needed anything else. Following interaction:

bitch lady ""Well I'm standing here and I still don't have my drink, she's just ignoring me \*she points at me\*"" at this point I've turned around to see what the problem is.

Me ""Oh, I've put your cup through so it should be ready at the end for you in just a few seconds! :)""

bitch lady ""Are you not going to make my drink? You just turned around and ignored me, I'm still waiting???""

(again, it has literally been about 10 seconds since I finished her order)  


Me ""Well my manager is on bar and will be making your drink for you""

And by this point, he has finished her drink, so she's taking up time by complaining about literally *nothing*

Not to mention, she almost walked away by grabbing the wrong drink

And as she leaves, she's still complaining about my ""ignoring her"", and shouts that ""this is the worst customer service I've ever seen""

At least everyone else in the line behind her was saying how crazy she was and apologising to us on her behalf! We were more shocked at just how illogical she was about the whole thing. We both laughed it off and thought about it for the rest of the day :')",freyavulpine,t2_2z5ww9r1,123,0,reddit3

I had a guy come in. Obviously living in his van at the top of the hill. Would ask for free shit all the time (cups of hot water, cups of ice, salt, etc.) which is fine. I don‚Äôt care. We give it and you gotta do what you gotta do. But one time he ordered a quad espresso, didn‚Äôt tell me about his high standards, and then complained about shit while I was on bar solo with a line around the building.

First was ‚Äúdid you hotwash the cup?‚Äù After I finished pulling the four shots. I needed him to explain it, he fucking wouldn‚Äôt. Kept rambling about other things. Made me throw away the cup and start again. I just washed out the cup with hot water and he didn‚Äôt complain.

Okay, so I started again, but now had a list of other shit to make. Dude saw me pulling two of his shots into the cup and two on the other bar while steam other people‚Äôs milks. He saw me pour two shots from a glass and was like ‚Äúoh, you pulled those into a glass? No, no. That makes them too cold. Those glasses aren‚Äôt insulated well.‚Äù Threw away all four shots again, grabbed a new cup, washed it with hot water and started pulling four shots from one bar straight into the cup.

I was pissed at this point, but I had to make the other fucking drinks using one bar now. So optimizing shit, I started steaming milk on the bar the shots were pulling on. He fucking stops me again. And you know what his fucking complaint was? Me steaming milk on the bar his shots were pulling from. He claimed it cooled down the shots as they were pulling and that they were no good now. Watching me do this whole thing. Watching me pull shots on previous bars with milk steaming. Waited until THEN to say something.

He made me dump them and start over. He wanted me to dedicate a whole bar to his quad espresso. And at this point our dt couldn‚Äôt hold more cars he slowed me down so much.

He could see how fucking frustrated I was tho. Stopped acknowledging him after that and sent him out with the most high maintenance black espresso I‚Äôd ever seen.

A few minutes later they came back to bar and said the same thing. Perplexed, I got the manager involved (who was working on bar) while I went to make a 3rd. As I came back to inform them it was in the oven, the manager had opened the second one in front of the customer (still complaining about it) and peeled back the melted cheese. She then opened the first one and did the same. Melted gouda looks so similar to the egg colour, and doesn't have a strong enough taste that they assumed there was no cheese at all. All 3 sandwiches had cheese.. 

So now the customer pivoted to complaining about the cheese choice and the sandwich being bland. The manager just gave them the customer support number, left them with the 3rd sandwich, tossed out the first two, and went back to making drinks on bar.",A_Vicious_T_Rex,t2_4nsslqv3,7,0,reddit3

I just stared at him and told him the renovations would help us make drinks faster and serve more customers and he told me we should have already been able to do that and stormed out.

I had already gotten the rundown on all the problem customers but hadn't dealt with any of them and was actually specifically warned about this particular  customer. Then on the first day actually closing the store by myself this lady comes in asking for a tall caramel crunch. Didn't ask for any special requests just a standard caramel crunch. The barista on bar makes it and hands it out. The lady looks at the drink and says ""The fuck is this? This ain't what I ordered!"" The barista verifies that she asked for a caramel crunch and when the woman says yes the barista informs her that what was handed to her was in fact her order. The customer then says ""Nah I got one of the big ones!"" At this point she's getting kinda loud so I come over to find out what the issue is. Long story short she wanted a caramel crunch made with almond milk and extra caramel drizzle and extra crunch but with layers. You may be thinking ""Duh. It's already a layered frapp."" No. She wanted tiny layer of frapp then put some crunch on that layer, add a layer of whip, add a layer of dark caramel and crunch, repeat until full. We didn't find out this is what she wanted until after she sent it back 3 more times each time saying ""Nah thats not what the fuck I ordered."" While the barista was making the drink she was talking to me about how she felt like we were being difficult because she was black and how I could I work with the enemy (I'm a black as well).She pulled this stunt for a good 2-3 months. It got so bad that even the SM complained to the DM to try and get this woman banned.The DM handled it by inviting the woman in to find out the exact perfect recipe for her drink (and apparently her friend since she brought her friend with her for the meeting with the DM). She also got like $150 in store credit for ""all her trouble in finding her perfect beverage"" from the DM.

Its entirely possible its the case. To me, this seems like something that if it were in play, should be barista basics level of stuff. But I've never once seen it show up there, nor have I seen information on it to pass on to trainees. Not that I am saying you're wrong in any way, but if its an official sorta thing, it should be in some sort of training module. Otherwise, it sounds like its more just a courtesy to me. From my point of view, there are two points about this:

1. It feels unfair to the rest of the customers to have to wait longer for their drink, because we had to wait a half hour for a MOP customer to show up for their nitro, and thus that customer gets to cut the line for their drink - which is even worse during peak time, 
2. As it stands, we already get berated and attacked for not having a drink ready for a MOP customer as soon as they show up, even if they placed the order seconds before arriving. 

I can understand your frustrations on the topic however. It does suck to not get something you like because the quality of the drink degrades so fast. However I do think that the nature of the drink is inevitable. The drink will go flat regardless of if its made before the customer arrives, or soon as they are at the handoff. Unless they down the thing in one sip, it'll be flat before they finish the drink.",KwaltWilemang,t2_4ha4ta5n,-1,0,reddit3

1. MOP has always been ""cutting the line"" regardless of what drink it is, and before The Great Panini changed MOP handoff, it was already the standard to have baristas hand the mobile orders to the customers rather than letting the customers grab stuff themselves. Pouring a nitro only adds a couple seconds to that process, which isn't time worth saving if it means you're going to be handing out dozens of messed-up drinks a day and constantly fielding complaints about flat nitros. During peak - that's why the MOP position exists (existed? maybe they took the MOP role out of play during covid?). In an ideal world (lol) if the rush is bad enough that bar or cold bar don't even have time to pour nitros, somebody needs to be flexed to MOP. Serving one of the chain's most popular drinks at its intended quality should be (and is, at least according to the training I remember) incorporated into the routines. 

2. People suck and will always find something to complain about. I'd rather deal with a complaint from someone who doesn't understand MOP than someone who I knowingly served a low-quality and incorrectly-made drink to. 

It's true that nitro goes off faster than other drinks melt/cool/separate/whatever, but people still like it, and Starbucks still charges a premium for it. If they can't accommodate serving it as intended, it shouldn't be on the menu. Honestly I'd be satisfied if they just said ""we don't do this training""/""we tried this training and no one followed it"" and took Nitro off MOP as an option altogether. I mostly do cafe orders anyway, so whatever, I'll live. It's just the Nitro Roulette I find aggravating.",hyperotretian,t2_yyxdd,1,0,reddit3

Obviously in more expensive areas, you can't get an apartment for nearly so little. But I live in the south, you can absolutely do that here. I'm like 15 minutes outside of a city that's known to be expensive for apartments relative to the south, and before that I lived in Charleston which is again one of the more expensive areas of the south. 

Again, this wouldn't work in like any non-rural areas in the northeast, it wouldn't work on most of the west coast. But it's definitely a viable option in like most of the mid west or the south.

It doesn‚Äôt take too long to do, but it IS extra work that we‚Äôre not getting credited for via labor hours and unless you have extra staff to have a support person that could make those backups, which many of us don‚Äôt have, it‚Äôs taking someone away from their assigned position (thus not making drinks) to make new base. So yes, having to do that in the middle of a busy peak simply because people want to get two drinks for the price of one is a little annoying.

Make sure everyone is polite to him every time he comes in so that the only complaint he can possibly have is the fact that he has to wait while someone makes his nightmare drink. 

The SECOND he steps over the line, behavior-wise (says anything rude, raises his voice, calls anyone any names, etc), whatever SSV is working needs to start telling him if he is going to treat you all in a disrespectful manner, you are unfortunately going to have to ask him to leave.

Document every single time he says something rude or disrespectful. File an incident report in the ipads -- baristas and SSVs are able to do so.

kbgd6bz,t3_187eey8,2023-11-30 20:49:20,starbucks,"Can somebody please explain a few things to me?

1. Looking at the sheer amount of stuff in this drink how can it possibly all fit into the cup.  I have seen tons of blended drinks being made and there is usually stuff left in the blender.  

2. That is 48 pumps of liquid if each pump is half an ounce that is still 24 ounces.  The shots of espresso are probably 3 or 6 ounces.  

3.  There is no way that all fits into the cup.  So what happens to the left over?  Is it thrown out?  

4. For everyone of these drinks there is probably another 8 oz thrown away. The customer is clearly a gluttonous pig or kid trying to be funny.  But also starbucks is partly to blame for this. 

If this is true starbucks is garbage for allowing such waste en masse. If the baristas want this to stop you should point to the waste generated.  Perhaps starbucks will take responsibility aren't they a company bragging about sustainability.  

My thought when i see these drinks, especially hot ones is that the person might be taking it to work and then diluting it with hot water across multiple cups throughout the day.  I just can't imagine drinking this much sugar and caffeine in one go.  If this is the case maybe they are geniuses.  

I'm not a drinker of these drinks, i love coffee and typically drink coffee black or stained with some cream and sugar.  This blows my mind.  They have to know that it is basically a full cup of sugar.",WhiteDirty,t2_lhxyg,11,0,reddit2

If it helps, we (At least I do) hate them, too. :( And I really, *really* hate when a customer seems to know that it's being forced on our end, cuz it just makes me feel so bad. Like, the other week I'd been chatting a bit with a woman in the drive-thru, and after a bit the conversation tapered off while we'd been waiting for her food, so I took the opportunity to go check on how it was going (To make sure I hadn't missed it being ready cuz it got placed outta my line of sight or something). It wasn't ready yet, nbd, so I went back to the window, and right as I did the shift lead behind me was like ""RasputinsButtBeard, are you making sure to connect with your customer? :)"". 

The lady fucking saw and heard this. She looked SO awkward and embarrassed, and I wasn't doing much better, and then at that point we proceeded to have the most awkward, forced conversation in the world that was clearly being carried by the fact we both felt obligated, and that she felt bad for me.

Honestly, it straight-up makes me anxious at this point and makes me loathe working the window. :( I'm normally fine with customer service, but I constantly feel pressured and like I'm being watched.",RasputinsButtBeard,t2_jhq9g,38,0,reddit4

We also are not allowed to close cafe or cut the line off. So if we have 10-15 cars in line at 1:15 then we have to continue serving till 1:30 on the dot. That means making drinks till 1:45 and staying late to close. (Edit: my shift is also scared of angry customers so they refuse to cut the line off and will continue to take orders up till 1:40... ) It also means we‚Äôre getting skipped on 10‚Äôs and half‚Äôs sometimes and dealing with bitchy customers ALL. THE. TIME. Every old white man that walks in is angry before they reach the register. 

The DM, and 3 other SM‚Äôs came into our store Friday night to do a clean play because things are so bad and we can‚Äôt get any borrowed partners. 

Is it acceptable to just walk out at 2pm as that‚Äôs our shifted time?",MercifulGenji,t2_4va97kr,36,0,reddit1

Like, I'm in an area with mostly caf√©-only stores and there is still a hiring freeze and they have been very slow with business, the opposite of the farther away drive thru stores. 

And we're not truly able to enforce wearing masks, considering we'd very likely be the one to end up with a write-up if someone was being whiny and entitled about it- or worse, they'd send a barista outside or at the drive thru to take their order, sacrificing that barista's health. We can enforce masks unless it's at the drive thru or someone has a MeDiCaL cOnDiTiOn. Honestly at this point I want the DoJ to put out something exempting mask-wearing from ADA protections or requiring a true Doctor's Note- entitled Karens are risking everyone's health with 100% fake reasons. 

My home state is a state where the governor has done jack-shit to protect its retail workers by mandating masks (and the governor has gotten sick from corona too, but only had mild symptoms so he's more adamant than ever that it's not a huge concern), and it's up to the individual cities, which then are doing the bare minimum or absolutely nothing at all.",hecaete47,t2_g5msbcd,3,0,reddit1

I'm not against folks who practice evangelicalism- if your religion dictates that you MUST spread the word and, for lack of a better word, ""recruit"" more people to your faith... Like.. Okay, you do you and you follow your own church, but I'm strong enough in my convictions to smile and say ""no, thank you"" without feeling pressured or bullied. I'm Catholic myself and do not practice evangelicalism (Catholics dogmatically believe that ""spreading the word of God"" means living out Jesus' teachings by being kind, giving until it hurts, opening your hearts and the doors of your church for whatever community needs arise, and doing what you can to behave like Jesus did... And I'm the first to admit most Catholics do this very, very wrong). REGARDLESS of how you feel about evangelicalism, fake-tipping is shitty behavior. Jesus was friends with prostitutes, queers, criminals, dangerously-ill people, etc. He would never have faked somebody out for ""feel-good"" points. He'd be kind and leave an actual tip.

I moved to another country to marry my wife and I went to church with her mother in law. We'd do the Catholic Church and then the episcopal church on alternate weeks. Each week I'd look at the calendar and if I saw it was the Catholic Church I'd think ""ugh, I'm going there again this week"".  Then I thought "" well if that's how I feel... Why don't I just so going there and go to the episcopal church instead? The Catholic Church is five, but I take don't know anyone there and I'd go in and out each week and barely talk to anyone. It was like a trip to the grocery store. It was just a huge church and nobody knew it even tried to get to know me.

The episcopal church on the other hand is a tiny little church where I know everyone, everyone knows me.

I also know any time that Starbucks has had to deal with racism allegations they act swiftly. Of course if one of their employees racially discriminates against a customer or partner that partner should be held accountable and Starbucks should reflect on and take action on how they can be better as a company. 

Which they have. This includes extensive sensitivity training like after the incident in Philadelphia. Sure on some level I am sure the company is covering their ass on a PR level but it is not all for show. As previously mentioned they have also enacted community guidelines within stores to protect any harassment or discrimination which allows partners to request disruptive customers to leave as well as refuse service. 

As a store manager I engage in a weekly inclusion and diversity activity and have a lengthy conversation with the other managers in my district about the subjects we cover each week. Topics ranging from race, sex, gender, homelessness, addiction, abelism etc.

While Starbucks corrects well sometimes (the most recent example being the new equality hiring initiative in order to defeat bias), often these changes come from public outcry that I've seen. Perhaps your store is in a good place, perhaps you have a great DM & RM, perhaps you are lucky. But it's very easy on the lower, hourly level to see how even though there is supposed to be a system when there's a broken link in regards to managers (i.e., go to the DM if the SM isn't doing their job), there can often be enabling the misbehavior and ignoring the lowly worker, and I think that's what a lot of people are experiencing. When just two of these links are broken, it becomes very easy to be trapped in a hellhole as the people above you realize there are no consequences. 

I'm so glad that this isn't your store, but that doesn't discount the enabling and coverups Starbucks does as a corporation in the same way that these issues don't discount your wonderful experience devoid of these problems. The question becomes whether Starbucks actively cares enough to dive into the barista level of things, or whether they rely on their chain of command to report issues back to them. Judging by the amount of actively frustrated baristas and SSVs on all forms of social media, I would elect that they assume things will work themselves out instead of actively trying to fix these issues, but that's just how it seems from my point of view.",jayessdubs,t2_yzqu6,5,0,reddit3

I really do have a great DM who is respectful, kind and lives the mission and values of the company and I know my direct
peer group also works hard to create atmospheres of warmth and belonging in their stores. This whole conversation makes me realize it‚Äôs the exception and not the rule within the organization.
