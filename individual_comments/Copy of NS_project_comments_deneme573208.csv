This is fantastic. This means medically prescribed cannabis helped over 4800 people with their pain, and over 6600 with their perception of their own health/function.

I have found some things that work.

Smoking a high CBD marijuana (Cannatonic) mixed with a medium level THC marijuana (I'm a one hit wonder so I use very little) combined with ropinirole lets me sleep. The pain I experienced is ""translated"" to pressure by the marijuana. I don't know how else to explain what happens, but the pain is gone and replaced with a feeling of pressure. The Ropinirole stops my restless leg, arm and body. Yeah, body. At times my entire body jumps. Lasts a microsecond and I lift clear off the bed. First time my wife saw me do it she totally freaked. Luckily the arm and body jerking is not common like the RLS, which is 24/7.

When it's really bad I eat a gummy. Sometimes I have to smoke as well, but I wait an hour before doing so. That combo works well.

Lyft, Uber, Doordash, Instacart and a whole host of other types of app self employment qualify for hours toward the food stamp requirements. Many people who are wholly unsuitable to be working these job have to do them anyhow, no matter how low the pay. This forced work has lowered the wages of every other person working on those platforms. 

If a food stamp recipient must show 20 hours of work per week, the amount they are making in those 20 hours becomes secondary. They cannot afford to think about any goal other than covering expenses(gas) and getting their hours. When can a single mom get her hours? I shudder to think how many resort to putting their kids to bed and then leave them alone to spend 4 or 6 hours delivering food for Doordash. I know from personal experience that many app drivers simply put the kids in the car and take them along. The kids get left in a car alone for 10 or 15 minutes at a time while mom or dad picks up and delivers orders.

Work requirements are common in US safety net programs.

Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence that work requirements increase program exits by 23 percentage points (64 percent) among incumbent participants. Overall program participation among adults who are subject to work requirements is reduced by 53 percent. Homeless adults are disproportionately screened out.

Having known alot of people and been there before myself I can attest.   It is a combination of income and asset limitations combined with most jobs rarely raise pay enough to overcome the gap in loss of benefit or don't pay enough to pick up a second one

Example:  you can't take a small promotion at work or pickup a second job because the benefits outweigh the gains unless it's a significant jump in pay.

Also, because it counts household income, sending your kids to work can have a similar effect.  Is it worth gaining $400 in income if you lose $600 in food?

Yet, the impoverished are manipulated, incited to protect their oppressors - the tycoons of industry and wealth who control the strings of society. They're goaded into aiming their frustrations at their fellow strugglers, labeling them as 'freeloaders,' while the true culprits - those who engender this brutal cycle of disparity - hide in plain sight.

I was taught all of the lies, and believed them for a long time. But because I believed the lies I also believed that people were inherently equal, which is something they constantly claim without believing. 

But because I believed all humans were equal, all of their positions created cognitive dissonance. Whenever I learned something new, I would change my mind about that subject because my primary goal was always making things better. I believed their arguments because I thought they were telling the truth about them being the best, not because they harmed people. 

I really have a hard time getting into the headspace of people who are against abortion, for example, because while I was strongly against abortion for years it was because I *honestly* believed that life began at conception. Once I stopped believing that by getting more information, I stopped being against abortion in the same moment. 

My HS English teacher actually started the process for me I think. I remember being crazy pro-death penalty, because of course I was. One of the books he had us read were competing essays from different angles on various subjects that were considered controversial, and I read all of them about the death penalty.

One of those essays demonstrated that the stated goals of the death penalty were not even being served by the death penalty. (It does not cause a reduction in rates, it is not cheaper, and it is often inaccurate.) The argument was so clear, and the data was so in favor of it, that I changed my mind minutes after reading it.

Once that started it was like dominos falling one after another.

So all I can imagine is that people who adopt these positions are much, much more interested in something outside of the arguments they claim to make. They don't care about getting people back to work, despite that being the argument, because if that was their goal they would have *already changed their mind.* The goal therefore must be whatever is the consistent through-line of their actual policy, which is just denial of assistance and benefits for those beneath them.",Caelinus,t2_emecd,595,0,reddit4

jlbbgfd,t1_jl97ypz,2023-05-23 17:11:15,science,"I’ll chime in as a current conservative, because I think the above viewpoint would make conservatives defensive and become counterproductive.

Here is a description I think conservatives would more readily engage into, which I think could create better dialogue.

We believe in individuality and accountability of people. Where it’s okay for there to be current momentary suffering, because suffering is a motivator to work harder. And at an extreme, it’s even fair for suffering to increase to the point of death if you choose not to work, because that is the justice of your lack of labor. No one controls you from working but you, and your lack of resources/opportunity is real life justice coming into play. (Individuality/accountability)

It’s not that aid programs can’t be effective, or that conservatives don’t want to help poor people. It’s that preventing suffering without accountability (not working) is inhibiting growth, and at a large scale limiting justice. (God wants us to be good people that work. And the results of our labor are more important than our stationary existence.)

I think there are flaws with this belief, because suffering can only do so much to change someone, and love is meeting people where they are at, not “watching them suffer until they realize their mistake.”

But I think if you want to have a conversation with a conservative, this might create a better framework to ask harder questions. Or to see if they agree with this.",pocketline,t2_qq13w,2,0,reddit4

> If at first you're on food stamps and not working, and then you have to prove/meet work requirements in order to get the stamps, but you aren't working, so you can no longer get the stamps, and then you still don't go out and get a job - 

Actually, it’s a 20 hour weekly requirement. A lot of these people are working just not consistently 20 hours a week. This is especially problematic for people with disabilities, working mothers, people whose employers want to keep them part-time, etc…

> then maybe you didn't really need the stamps in the first place?

Ah, this is a very different argument from the one the post referenced and debunked but I’ll entertain it anyway.

That’s a big maybe…“You’re not dead without it so you didn’t need it” is a rather draconian line of reasoning. But the program was never intended to be just for people on the brink of starvation. It was meant to combat hunger as well as crime and healthcare costs. It was also meant to provide more nutrition to children, which has massive long term effects on their cognitive function, making a smarter and saner society.

> How else are these people living? 

You assume that they ARE living. I volunteer with a homeless shelter and, for some of these people, losing SNAP benefits would be a death sentence. It’s not exclusively for people who would die without it but it still does have many people who would. And getting a job is incredibly difficult when homeless. Try showing up to an interview with no ID, no mailing address, no shower, no professional clothes, etc… it doesn’t go well.

> Some other supporting party must be subsidizing their unwillingness or inability to get work.

We’ve already covered that this assumption is untrue for many and some of them will just die so we’ll skip covering that again and address some other flaws in this thinking.

Again, it’s not just getting work. It’s a reliable 20 hours a week. 

Do you know what people do when they’re hungry and can’t afford food? For a lot of them, the only option is crime. In fact, there’s [research showing that just the disbursement schedule of SNAP benefits cause a substantial difference in crime, grocery store theft increasing by 20% when staggered](https://files.webservices.illinois.edu/6984/carrjillian-paper-10-30-17.pdf).

Sure Republicans are *worse* from our perspective but that's the whole aim. To be ""better than"" the other side, not to actually be good or help us. Notice the Republicans are made to feel the same way about us, that they're morally superior. The two parties serve the ruling class and the ruling class almost exclusively. The capital class writes their checks now. 

The purpose of the Democrats is to play the ""doves"" part in a domestic version of the renowned ""Hawks and Doves"" foreign policy strategy. They are allowed wins for problems that are caused for the sole purpose of giving the illusion of a functioning democracy.

The Dems slowly move right and point at the Republicans to say ""they have gone too far! we must repair the damage!"" and then can only manage to pass stop-gap measures, bandaids and temporary fixes. Anything truly good gets stopped, even just barely, in a way that it's ""out of our hands"" as they say.

Take for example the 2022 pre-christmas rail strike that was planned. Democrats, instead of drawing it up as one bill, split it into two bills. In one bill, all the provisions of the contract that the rail unions were striking against. In the other bill, some paltry few sick days were on offer.

BOTH parties passed the first bill rather quietly, because what the media ran with was the second bill.

Conservative media: The Democrats are trying to push government overreach onto the rail workers. The government shouldn't get involved! Voting NO to show we're pro labor!

""Liberal"" media: Oh no! We voted for the sick leave and it didn't pass! Those darn Republicans! Oh well, get em next time right? PRO LABOR, PRO UNION PARTY AMIRITE?

All this is not to say that there aren't good faith actors in the system, but that good faith actors don't make it far and fall behind in the political game. Thats the consequence of giving the greediest among humanity the most power. The capital class will warp the system to their benefit even and espescially if it means they can leave us behind.

The whole point of our system was that the rich could have their mansions and yachts and nice things beyond what we could have, so long as we got to have a decent living in exchange for our labor. The deal has been broken - and it won't swing our way unless we put up a fight for it. 

***""Well OK Mr Smart Guy, what do we do?""***

Voting can still work if we do it en masse, unified behind a common goal, as a recognizable voting bloc, in conjunction with Dual Power strategies. We would need actual progressives to run and get elected. Starting local and working upwards. Demonstrations would need to be held and they would need to be financially disruptive but peaceful. 

And for those of you so inclined, you would need to find a local militia group like the John Brown Gun Club and join it. Your goal should not be violence, but deterrence and morale for your peaceful-minded compatriots. Should it actually come to needing violence... then God help us all because a full blown violent revolution on our home turf will irreparably destroy many lives and a lot of infrastructure.

This is the most asinine take I've seen in months, congratulations. There is absolutely zero basis for this conclusion. Profit *by definition* involves extracting more resources out of the transaction than the goods are worth - it is *manufactured inefficiency*.

Markets drive efficiency only in cases of scarce resources which are not equally valued by purchasers. We're discussing food, not luxury goods - every human on earth needs food to the exact same extent, and we have plenty of studies stating that the world produces more than enough food to feed everyone. The issue is logistics of distribution, not scarcity of food.

In other words, food does not fill either criteria for efficient market distribution. Instead, it *creates inefficiency* for the purpose of generating profit - the free market cannot distinguish need from want, and buyers who overpurchase or hoard food will be willing to pay more for it, which will be interpreted by the market as ""valuing it more""/""higher demand"" and adjust prices upward accordingly.

The only beneficiaries of a free market system for essential needs with inelastic demand (food/shelter/water/medicine) are overconsumers and sellers - for everyone else it is a net negative, because profit, again *by definition*, is extracting additional value out of the market than actually exists in the transaction.",Gooberpf,t2_yx8y8,8,0,reddit4

jlagoo4,t1_jl9p4ij,2023-05-23 13:50:05,science,"To me, the idea of ""when life begins"" is so unhelpful when we are judging the ethics of abortion as a moral action. because, inevitably, the same stupid line of reasoning is trotted out, and we get so deep in the weeds of the ""exact minute 'life begins"" that it becomes akin to Diogenes bringing a plucked chicken into Plato's school to argue *""See, you defined a human as a featherless biped and I have produced a featherless biped. This is a human""*. Its stupid, and intentionally so. A vain appeal to some definitional abstraction that is not obliged to be true just because humans strung a line of words together. 

We all know, whether outright or intuitively, that a person who has not experienced a single day of lived reality is a different moral entity than a person who has existed for decades. One is an abstraction of a person, a concept. The other is a living, breathing *human* with interpersonal connections, history of agency, and a moral worldview. We know that killing this person would be murder, and that murder is a gravely immoral action. But with an unborn person? If you are willing to make the *exact same moral argument*, its not unlike defining a human as a featherless biped, and getting upset when someone clever comes along poking all sorts of holes in your definition. 

But none of this even gets to what I consider the core of the issue - The pro-life crowd has this belief that their position is the *only moral position*, and that their moral position is *unquestionably* ethical. To me, this is extremely frustrating, because their position has one hugely *unethical* quality (the reduction of female autonomy in a society with a history of reducing female autonomy). But because they have convinced themselves that their interlocuters are literal baby murderers, they absolve themselves of any critical self-reflection that a thinking, ethical person *should do when they curtail the agency of a group of people along some subjective, moral line*. 

So, we end up with two competing ethics - the ethic of protecting the unborn and the ethic of protecting the autonomy of women. Both are imperfect, as allowing abortion will inevitably result in the termination of pregnancy (thus ending life in the pro-life view). And limiting abortion limits the agency of a *majority of citizens* in a very critical way (the decision about how one's own body should be managed). And yet, the 'pro-life' side is, from my observation, totally unconcerned with the dilemma their position creates. They see no dilemma...and how could you when you perceive that your actions are saving babies from a meat grinder. Everything else becomes comparatively minimal when viewed next to that. But with these competing ethics, the pro-choice crowd is the only one willing to ""cross the aisle"" and say ""We understand that this is a serious decision, and not something that should be encouraged for the fun of it"", while the pro-life crowd says ""We don't care how much suffering this will cause, you're wrong and we're right.""

And all of this simply to avoid the unpleasant truth - because of the ethical complexity of the issue, these things should be left to the individual to decide for themselves. Nobody should have *this choice* limited simply because people who lack wisdom decided to strip it away.",rogueblades,t2_4wffd,11,0,reddit4

Life in this context is not referring to ""life"" in the scientific sense, but life in the ethical sense, first off. So it would be better to say ""Human Rights begin at conception"" but the phrase they *use* is ""Life begins at conception.""

Fetus' are of course alive, but to assert that they have human rights at conception *requires* them to be indwelt by something like a soul, as they have no nerves or brain at that stage. But to assume the existence of a soul is a unwarranted positive claim. I would need evidence proving it's existence before I decide to restrict the rights of obviously human people on its basis.

Later stages in the pregnancy are more ethically interesting. But that is a separate issue from the absolutist position they take.

They did one uber eats run to see if that was something that could earn us money in the mean time, quickly learned the $10 wasn't worth it, but the state considered that self-employment and made us disqualify for any unemployment pay. Unfortunately after starting the new job It didn't get much better as my spouse had a medical emergency and spent almost 2 months hospitalized. I totaled my car during that time. Paid a ton in rental fees while waiting on insurance, and now  ""new"" car prob needs new transmission. We both missed 2-3 weeks of work from testing positive for COVID. Then I had my baby over a month early with complications requiring .e to stay in the hospital longer. My spouse has court days due to trying to sue last employer and putting coworker in jail for sexual assault that happened at work. 


I really wish daycare vouchers didn't require you to already be working, I've put almost $3k in daycare tuition on a maxed out credit card while waiting for my application to be approved. I meet all the income guidelines, work 40hrs in medical field, it only asks for like 3 documents (pay stub, photo ID, simple form) so should only take someone 5-10 min to look at, but it keeps getting pushed back. I have to work with 4 weeks of paystubs to be approved for daycare vouchers, but it's so expensive haveing to pay for it before it gets approved. I can't afford to stay at home without pay either. I went back at 6 weeks since I didn't have any paid maternity and had already worked up so much debt from those 6 weeks of bills (baby was over a month early and $10k of NICU bills I'm still fighting). I couldn't have my first day back at work until my kid had their first day at daycare, which they wouldn't let him start until I paid the $1,300 tuition in full first. I've now paid for 3 months while my application for vouchers is still waiting to be approved. I tried to apply while I was still on maternity leave but they kept denying saying I had to be working or had to provide all these filled out forms that we're impossible for me to get when my local management says they aren't authorized to fill it out only headquarters/corporate can, but they are several states away and couldn't fill out the local paperwork, Its all managed by a third party portal with access codes and stuff, Not personalized,  that obviously the local state people aren't going to go online to get, they only want their local forms filled out by hand. Not to mention since I'm at home on leave I don't have access to my corporate emails or contacts (My company actually got purchased/acquired/closed/merged/moved during that time,  So I was completely out of everything, And why I lost all my PTO and maternity leave unexpectedly). They denied me at first for an error they made (I have physical letters that they mailed to me saying that they request documents and the letter itself even says the date that the requested it is dated after the date they said I was denied for not having things by their due date and all the dates are all just mixed up and even the letters arrived weeks apart in the wrong order), but said the only options I have are to file an appeal which takes up to 90 days and recommend a  lawyer  to see them in their appeal court or restart the process which is another 30 days which is more daycare I got to pay for while fighting for things I shouldn't have to be. 


I've had to get state attorney general's office involved 2 separate times within a year to fix issues with health insurance I purchased from the state exchange when they wrongly denied access to care for me and my family. I won both times. But it was a hell of a lot of time and missed work to fight. 

The red tape just makes things so hard for people trying their best. Before Sept-Oct (I've honestly lost track of when it all started to spiral down) of last year things were great and we were debt free other than mortgage. Now we are about $10k in credit card debt, a car loan for a car that needs a transmission, and pending $20k-ish hospital bills and don't qualify for WIC so paying $20 for 2-3 days worth of formula too. Had more programs been available and quick and easy to access when we needed them I would have a much better outlook on our future right now. Ive spent hours filling out pages after pages of financial aid forms for 3 different hospitals, only one excepted it even though they all say the same. At one hospital all I'm asking for is to have a payment plan, I don't even need a discount, just let me split the payment, but I need f re-fill out all the financial aid forms before they allow a payment plan. It's all government run even though it's through a private hospital. Why are some accepting and some declining then? Why do they need months of my bank records just so I can split my bill into a couple payments without going to collection? My health insurance won't pay for my care from when I got my baby checked after the car accident when I was pregnant, saying my car insurance should cover that, but they say they already closed that claim and I have to re-file a ton of papers to try it again, but it's already been months and my doctor told me it will go to collections if I wait longer for the claim to process so I stick it on a credit card. I can't float much longer but on paper make too much for any help, and the help I do qualify runs circles around me, denies, and requires too much time to fight for. Why do I have to fight so much? I take so many unpaid breaks from work to call insurance to see why something denied and for them to re-process it. I eat about one meal a day. Today was 4 perogies. I feel too much financial guilt to eat more. I wish I wasn't a few dollars over the limit for WIC and SNAP, I wish formula  wasn't so expensive. I get breast milk off of strangers online to help. His special preemie formula has been sold out for 2 months, tho WIC has it. This shortage is insane . just 1-3 months of assistance would have us in such a different place than where we are now. 


My dad lost his job of 30+ years during covid, a shop man with very specialized skill set. Took a few months to find a new job at 1/3 the pay. He couldn't get any unemployment due to his SSN haveing errors, apparently already claimed by someone else for benefits? He spent days on the phone that no one picked up. Just busy signals or transfers or automated messages. Reached out to many places but all so booked up or no help. Once he finally got a new job he was back to working 10+ hr days in the shop or on the field and does not have time now for more 8+ hr phone calls hoping someone from the gov office will pick up and know where to direct him.

Nobody should have this choice limited simply because people who lack wisdom decided to strip it away.

Yep, this is the core of the pro-choice argument, and it is why it is fundamentally different. The ethics here *are* complex as they intersect way too much with how people view the meaning of life. I used to think of it from an Evangelical Perspective and because of that my reasoning went to being against abortion, as my assumptions did not allow much else. 

But upon learning the complexity my stance has shifted to pro-choice. Not pro-abortion, of course, I do not think people should be encouraged to have abortions for the sake of having abortions, I think they should have the option and it is not the place of the government to inferfere in that healthcare option.

But the caricature I always hear is that pro-choice people are literally pro-abortion, and as evidence they always find some millennial peer of mine who, steeped in irony, have done something like an abortion party. It is what they did to me, and how they operate: They constantly redefine terms to make circular tautological arguments.

Their argument is basically: Murdering people is Wrong. Fetuses are People. Killing is Murder. Therefore Abortion Is Murder.

The way things are structured is that not everyone needs to work. There are people born into wealthy families who will never have to work a day in their lives. There are elderly people who haven't been able to save enough to keep up with inflation and have to keep working despite being past retirement age. They stand at the front of Wal Mart greeting folks providing practically 0 functional service to society. 

You're being sold the idea that everyone needs to pitch in so that society can function, you're being sold that story by people who do not need to pitch in. 

I haven't had to vacuum since getting a robot vacuum. Doing the dishes is trivial once you've got a dishwasher. A good washer and dryer save you tons of time on laundry. There are robot lawn mowers. There are apps to order food from highly automated kitchens.

There are so many things out there which would make it so that your weekly chores are done in an hour or two. They are treated as luxuries because a stratified society doesn't want the working class to have access to all of the means that make their lives easier.

Farms are highly industrialized, there are far fewer people who need to work them to yield greater crops. We have so many people who would rather not drive to a McDonald's themselves, that they'll pay an uber driver to deliver it. A simple A to B delivery problem that could largely be handled by flying drones. 

Meanwhile there are people out there whose Job it is to work in medical insurance and find ways to deny people care. There are people out there whose Job it is to make telemarketing phone calls to sway your vote. There are so many people who work jobs that are actually a net negative for productivity. 

We are so far beyond the actual need for work that we invent bad work that hampers the good work so that everyone is left working rather than simply enjoying the fruits of our labour, instead the only ones who get to really enjoy it are the ones who were wealthy enough to never needed to labour.

In fact, 86 percent of all SNAP benefits go to households that include a child, elderly person, or person with disabilities. In addition, about 92 percent of all SNAP benefits go to households with income at or below the federal poverty line.

And even taking into the above, many households have earned income.

>Many SNAP households have earned income. Almost one-third of SNAP households have earned income, though only 20 percent of households have gross monthly income above the federal poverty line. The average SNAP household’s monthly gross income is $872 and net income is $398.

Many of their mistakes and problems actually mimicked ones made in profit-oriented societies: unnecessary exporting of foodstuffs (this was especially prominent in the 1930s Soviet famine), bad harvests compounded by bad government policy around how to handle shortages so on.

I'd note I've deliberately excepted famines in states not *necessarily* attributable to a failure of the economic system, like the two German famines during each World War (both due to Allied blockades) - you might say that should apply to the Bengal famine but the British absolutely had the means to ameliorate the situation and refused because Churchill was a massive racist, and by that reasoning the German famines could have been avoided by Germany *not starting the damn wars.*",PlayMp1,t2_evmda,11,0,reddit4

You don't have to keep people in comas on life support indefinitely, especially if the family can't afford the care costs involved. It'd be unethical to force that.

These things are never black and white issues. There are pros and cons, and consequences for every choice made. The abortion debate, to me, is about quantifying harm. Arguing about when life begins and whether abortion equates to murder is pointless. There's tangible negatives that comes from abortion bans...rises in poverty, crime statistics, etc. The potential that an unwanted child might have a problematic home life. The stress from unwilling parenthood and the effects that has on a child's development. How would you weigh all of that against the death of an unborn human? 

I, personally, place more value on the human experience, not the human. An unborn human lacks any history, intelligence, and sense of self. Because of that, I believe abortion is, if not moral, then at least the lesser evil. I genuinely feel that more quantifiable harm comes from banning abortion than allowing it. 

I also believe in bodily autonomy. The woman should have final say in what happens to her, above all else. It's unethical to force people to use their bodies to save others. If you need a new kidney and you know someone who would have a compatible one, then you still need their consent...we can't just force them onto a table and take it. In the case of abortion, this means the unborn loses something they need to live, but I still hold the mother's bodily rights above this.

More to the point, we're not really talking about your typical US citizen who identifies themselves as a member of one of those parties: Republican party leaders and congressional members, on the other hand, are espousing this type of policy, and continue to mislead their base as to its effectiveness. Further, they have a history of firmly standing against the interests of the very constituents who voted for them, while again misleading those constituents to believe it's Democrats who are ruining their livelihoods.

That is exactly correct. There are many parts of society you have clearly never visited. You would be blown away at the depths of desperation and suffering certain communities of hard-working people have to endure. As you get older, you will become more aware of the aspects of life you have not yet experienced.

Regarding your question, it's challenging to find a specific number for annual starvation deaths in the United States. This is partly because starvation is often a result of other underlying issues, such as homelessness, poverty, or mental health disorders, and it's not always listed as the direct cause of death. Someone who is severely malnourished will likely die from a heart or liver issue rather than from all their muscles failing simultaneously. To understand what death by malnutrition looks like, [this is a pretty good brief summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_States#Health_consequences). The number of Americans who aren't getting enough food [appears to be jumping significantly this year to 25%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/one-in-four-americans-food-insecure/) because of all the cuts to food programs. It looks like the number of people who are categorized as dying purely of malnutrition in the USA is less than 1000 per year, but millions die from poor health as a result of poor nutrition. 

That article also does a good job of explaining how food insecurity makes it much more difficult to work. For instance, if their car has a major malfunction they have to choose between eating or fixing the car. If they rely on their car to get to work, they will lose their job for choosing to eat. 

It is also important to keep in mind that the number of people currently dying of malnutrition is much lower than it would be without these programs in place. You are pointing at the solution and claiming there isn't a problem. If we stopped feeding people through government programs, then we would have hard data on how many people are not starving to death because of these programs. Do you think this is a worthwhile approach? Just to ensure no one is failing to die who you believe deserves it?

Obviously someone who is malnourished is not going to function at their best, which makes it much harder for them to contribute to society by working. Taking away their food until they make enough money to feed themselves is deeply irrational on top of being cruel.

Vitamin C is absolutely the cure for scurvy.   Sum up all the other vitamins, and they ARE the cure for a whole host of deficiencies.   Calories ARE the cure for starvation.

Because you didn't burn 1700 through the day (or suck at counting calories). There is literally no alternative short of losing limbs and such.

Uhh… the term “minor” has an accepted legal and colloquial definition as “under the legal age of majority, 18”.

Tell me honestly. If I said “I have minor children”, would you think I meant “under 7”? Or would you take that to mean “under 18” like it is defined.

Just explained why this is false.

No. You changed definitions. Everyone else understands what minor means and that it’s not “under 7”. Everyone else (including the federal government and SSA, btw) understands that people receiving disability insurance through SSI/SSDI/VA are not all disabled people.
