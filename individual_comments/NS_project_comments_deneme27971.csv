It's not about woman hating. I'll lay out the issue with the company focusing on the women in the company:

There's nothing wrong with women being engineers and I think you would be hard pressed to find a man that feels they shouldn't be.

There is something wrong with unqualified women being shoehorned into engineering positions due to gender politics.

If, and I said, ""If"", the women were unqualified and shoehorned into their positions (which is possible) then this represents a men's rights issue because they were placed in their position over more qualified men who were discriminated against due to their gender.

The bridge was inspected two days before the collapse and the inspector left a voicemail about cracks in the bridge.  That's what gets me.  The real failure here, the one that cost human lives, was that the traffic was allowed to continue to drive under the bridge WHILE it was being built and stress tested.

What's your point? It *was* a terrible movie, regardless of the gender issue. It doesn't matter what the actors did or didn't say about it, it changed nothing. The movie was bad.

She made the construction of this bridge a gender issue? When? I've seen this claim made twice now, without a single source to back it up. 

Secondly, even if your claim is 100% true, some other person being sexist does not entitle you to attack someone based on their gender. Not in this sub. Not anywhere with people that can rub two brain cells together.

Because: you want to put your career first, because dating could cause animosity in a workplace where patient's health should be the main focus, etc. Eventually some of them will start to accept your viewpoint even if they don't personally agree with you. And their changed opinions will start to radiate out into the wider workplace. It may take months or years, but stand your ground and they will eventually accept that you have a right to your opinion.

EDIT: another option would be, if your hospital or workplace has a newspaper or newsletter, write an op-ed about dating in the workplace. State why you think dating someone from the workplace is a bad idea (or at least why you think it's a bad idea for you personally and your career), and invite people to offer a response. Make it a human resources issue about workplaces generally, rather than an issue about just one person. Get it out there, get people talking about it.

'Good morning, x.

I hope to be able to speak to you later about a series of incidents involving myself and a coworker. 

The incidents have encroached upon sexual harassment and have resulted in retaliation towards myself from individuals not involved, possibly due to slander. The resulting hostile working environment has heavily weighed on my mental and emotional health, and the severity of the retaliations have only increased in recent days, affecting my ability to provide care and focus on my tasks. 

The seriousness of the incidents, the possible consequences to myself and my career, and the environment in which I now find myself have lead me to schedule a consultation with a lawyer specialising in these cases and to speak about the meeting I am requesting. 

I hope you can empathise with my distress and take steps to assess the situation to figure out what has been said and to whom, and that you won't take this lightly due to the genders.

I did it once as a child and was punished for it and told that it was illegal and could land someone in jail (I was just a child and those idiots overeacted, I had no ill intentions, I just had this little tape recorder and I was recording all kinds of things for fun, like a normal fucking kid does and they lost their shit thinking I was trying to cause trouble, it's fucked up how they deny children their innocence and project all kinds of shit on them, like flipping their shit because a 9 years old girl is having fun playing with her tape recorder or falsely accusing a 5 years old boy of being a sexual predator because he was playing house or doctor when a 5 years doesn't even know what sex is, but it won't stop these crazy folks, especially the radical Left Feminazis, from projecting sexual shit on innocent 5 years old boys and falsely accuse them of being sexual predators or Brock-Turners-in-Training). If it's illegal to record or film people without their consent and he does he, he could go to jail for it.

Someone once said: ""So, if someone recorded you without your consent, it is considered a gross infringement on your privacy, and you can initiate a lawsuit against them. If you win the suit, expect to receive a handsome amount in damages.""

Also even if you can record someone, according to law advice lawyers, you still have to prove in court that the voice on the tape actually belongs to the person you are claiming and not someone impersonating them, show that the recording device you used was capable of making an accurate recording, prove that the recording is a true and accurate representation of the conversation (this is usually an issue when the recording cuts in and out because of, for example, wind blowing through the microphone, which could cause the conversation to lose much of its context), and verify that the recording has not been tampered or altered in any way. 

So you see, recording a cracy married chick who is sexually harassing you is not as simple and easy as some people think it is. He should ask the authorities what is legal and illegal and what measures he can take to legally prove that he's being harassed. The last thing he wants is to go to jail, a lot of men experience prison rape in jail.",312Michelle,t2_2fcotuis,0,0,reddit3

You're likely to get zerged by downvoters just as my remark is above. While I agree with everything you said, that wasn't exactly the concept behind my post.

I was speaking about the fact that feminists decry men who express any sort of preference for any type of woman, and they are attempting to indoctrinate their less radical sisters to that ideology. 

Admittedly, it's an attractive ideology for the lazy, selfish, and entitled women out there. 

Western women already have ALL the cards and all the choices when it comes to child bearing and raising and indeed, whether or not a child is even born. The only choice men have is whether or not to have sex. 

The choices I was talking about though have to do with just not playing the game. Simply avoid women who express current day feminist ideas. Ask them flat-out what they think about things if you need to. 

These feminists do not want men to be entitled to choose a woman that they want to be with because it makes life more difficult for them and it takes power from them. Your power is your ability to choose.

Feminists don't want you to have the choice because it means that when they decide it's time to get a sperm donor and 18 year mealticket, they want to be able to choose from the entirety of the male pool, not just those cucks and stooges that are desperate enough to sleep with them.

Do not be a desperate stooge. Choose women who agree with you, they are out there, I promise you they are!

So, that's is what I meant by having choices.

Replace feminists with other people, and you've got it right. 

As for the definition of good, it is a largely subjective thing. People aren't taught anymore how to recognize what they want and expect in a relationship, so when the inevitable breakup happens, they just blame the other person and refuse to learn and grow. 

I've accepted that I'm likely going to be single the rest of my life simply because I find myself in an environment where my definition of 'good' simply does not exist in the form of a single woman. Doesn't mean I won't discount the possibility that I'm wrong, just that I've recognized that the traits I'm interested in typically result in a woman marrying young, and staying married.

I don't know how to be encouraging to you in a way that won't sound either patronizing or as if I'm talking past your concerns, so bear with me with what I'm about to say:

You have to put yourself out there and be in a positive and receptive mental state. 

Physical appearance is only reasonably important to women when they are young and even then, a rock star personality can convince them where a Bradd Pitt appearance may not exist. 

I do know that looking back over my life, my best times with women were when I was in the best mental state - when I was happy, outwardly projecting ""good vibes"" (for lack of a better term). I also know that I didn't always project the most positive energy, and it was during those times that I found it hardest to find a date/hookup. 

When I was splashing around confience and positivity, getting laid was like taking candy from grandma.

That is DEFINITELY a thing that you have to ""fake it, til you make it"". 

By that I mean that even if you are not feeling particularly confident or even super positive, you gotta fake it, even if you feel super awkward in doing that. The reason is that you consciously telling yourself to be positive literally changes your brain chemistry (little by little) and makes it easier for you to project that the next time, and it goes on and on like that until you just do it more or less automatically. Fake it til you make it.

Maybe I'm getting caught up in semantics, but I believe that emotional availability isn't what you should try to exhibit, but rather emotional maturity. I wouldn't even try to limit interactions with women with those terms either, as you come off as two-faced if you act differently with men vs women. I've always treated people the same regardless of gender, I've just found that my tendency to be a serious, factual person scares off a lot of people. 

I've always been different from the general population, even growing up.

hyz5ww4,t1_hyy4c8q,2022-03-01 23:14:39,MensRights,"As a person on the spectrum who spends a lot of time with others also on the spectrum, I would suggest this. If you have to change yourself in order to suit others just to get a date, those others are not worth your time or energy… and a massive amount of energy is expended in order to try to fit in. 

I know several people on the spectrum who have not only managed to get dates without having to turn themselves inside out, they even married and had families. Some of those people (myself included) ended up marrying someone else in the spectrum. Some of those people found loving, caring individuals who understood their differences. Some of those people did learn different coping mechanisms so that they did eventually fit into their relationships more easily. 

Whether you’re neurotypical or diverse, a long term relationship will involve change, it will involve compromise. However you need to find someone willing to accept you for you first, when you’re actively in a relationship and find that certain behaviour you do annoy your partner, you’re more likely to actively want to work on changing that behaviour yourself. Many on the spectrum don’t necessarily notice or realise when their behaviour causes issues. That’s why communication is important. If your partner of however many years tells you that you leaving the toilet seat up pisses them off, then you need to listen. However, by the same token, if you tell them that their behaviour in leaving their dirty dishes on the table really aggravates you, then they should show you the same respect in working on changing what they’re doing also.

I know some pretty average looking men in their 40s and older who have easily ended up in relationships with much younger women just because of their confidence. This is despite not exactly being flush with funds. 

Sure, it helps when there’s an extrovert, it helps to be handsome or even just generally good looking.

Honestly, it's the most backwards, anti-feminist thing to do to treat us like poor, incapable ladies who need handouts in order to make it. I know someone who worked in our college admissions office and got to see applicants' test scores, and she noticed a trend where the few females who were getting accepted had a significantly lower bar to pass than male counterparts. Shocking, then, when most of the students who then struggled academically were female. This absolutely does not help against the stereotype of ""underqualified female engineers"" and - in my opinion - almost creates more resentment against women in STEM. I've worked my butt off to get where I am, and I don't want to be given a job just for being a woman and to have male coworkers initially doubt me before they work with me. Too often I've seen underqualified women taking up space that other people have worked hard for and I honestly think it harms BOTH men and women. Ugh.

If you want some data a male professor needs 80% more publications, 260% more citations and 72-83% higher H index compared to a woman to get a professorship... many unversities informally only allow hiring female professors and a few do so openly... the Dutch one is a good example.... no men allowed for 18 months to apply for any acadmiec job and women who are hired get 100,000 euro bonus for research and. mentoring.... they are being legally challenged for this

NORWAY parliment (Iceland and Sweeden did the same thing, affirmative action cant be used on men... feminsits in iceland went berserk when a small admission grant was propsed to men in nursing in a university where 98% of nursing students were female so it was stopped and in Sweeden feminsts sued (while simulataneously calling for that kind of thing for women lol))

But, is there any middle ground here?

Let's just say there are two kids, A and B.

Kid A had all the best tutors, teachers, went to a private school, came from a wealthy home, etc.

Kid B did not have any of those things. A crowded, overdunded school, no resources, no money for tutors, etc, but still managed to find success.

If kid B gets within striking distance of Kid A on the metrics of consideration, whatever they are, would it be so wrong to pick B, considering the fact they accomplished so much more with so much less?",confusedbonobo007,t2_16a13r9l,0,0,reddit4

There’s an argument to be made that if you’re presented with a man and a woman who both seem equal and you’re told to hire one, *the existence of the mindset you just espoused* makes it likely the woman is the weaker candidate.

If you’re considering hiring the woman because she’s equal and women need a break, did she get that same consideration at every other step of her development? Her past promotions and jobs? Her scholarships? Her admissions? Her school grades? And then it turns out that studies show that the school system actively inflated girls’ grades and deflates boys’.

A post about racism in which I said the following:

>Well nearly 1/4 of homeless people are mentally ill. And the rest  probably end up there after a few years on the streets. They probably  end up seething with hatred and resentment. Racism and sexism are easy  tools to use to lash out against ""normal"" members of society. They are  low cost/high impact.

1) Identify yourself clearly. Let them know that you work there. Make note of the time and date of the interaction, show the time on your watch.

2) Inform them that they are trespassing on private property and that you would like them to leave.

3) If they refuse to leave, remind them that they are trespassing on private property and that you will call the cops if they don't leave.

4) If they still refuse to leave call the cops. Continue filming until cops arrive. Make note of the time the cops arrive on scene and the officer's names and numbers.

5) Record conversation with police officer and be polite.

I live on property that I own which is right on a riverbank. 20 times a day some group of drunken fucking idiots floating the river decide to use my property as a take-out point (and leave shit loads of trash behind them).

Last year I had enough, So I put an electric fence wire around the property.  Sitting on my deck enjoying sunset one day, a group of stupid drunken women get out of the river, start climbing the bank, and reach out to lift the wire so they could go under.  

I yell out ""that wire is electrified and you're trespassing, I wouldn't touch that if I were you.""  Twat doesn't believe me, grabs the wire, gets about 9 fucks shocked out of her.  Then calls the cops and tries to get me charged with assault.

*These* cops weren't douchebags, but one was a woman...They had a good chuckle, told the woman she had been properly warned about trespassing AND about the fence and charged her with trespass.",,,354,0,reddit1

You should consider talking to your superiors about your ability to record instances of enforcement aka 'doing your job' in the future so that you have this to fall back on in the case of legal matters like this bullshit coming up.  

The signs should then be revised indicating as such that trespassers are recorded/monitored and then the next time something like this arises, record your actions with a camera and immediately let them know they're being recorded before even engaging them.

Any emergency, which may or may not include a crime in progress, such as trespassing, especially after being asked to leave the property, can necessitate a call to 911.

Source: http://www.911.gov/whencall.html

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress

>Important: If you’re not sure whether the situation is a true emergency, officials recommend calling 911 and letting the call-taker determine whether you need emergency help.

I live in a major US city, and have called 311 to report a break-in from the night before, not even an emergency, and they instructed me to call 911.

Unless you can provide a better source for your claim that 911 is only for **life-threatening** emergencies, you are completely wrong and such information could lead to someone not seeking proper help in the future, for their sakes you should probably correct your statement.

But if that cashier was accosted by a black guy both times, posted about both incidents in great detail online, explicitly stated that he's biased against blacks because of previous incidents: ""I don't trust any (blacks) I haven't had a long term relationship with"", and makes very dramatic gestures both times? I'm guessing the cashier is lying, coming in with some very heavy handed preconceived notions, and isn't telling the whole story. 

Do you really believe OP in earnest?

To be fair I really hate all these personal account stories, be they feminist screeds or men's rights diatribes on mistrust.

A few years ago a friend of mine called the fire department because his next door Mexican neighbors  where burning trash during very high winds.  The fire department came rushing out and saw that it was a Mexican family burning the trash.  They didn't even bother talking to the Mexican family, they came over and called my friend a racist bastard.  I'm assuming they would have ticketed them if they'd been middle class whites, but I don't know for sure.

cb1q8ve,t1_cb1p6tb,2013-07-13 07:39:48,MensRights,">No, I'm not correcting myself. The quote you cherrypicked is talking about crimes like people driving drunk and not people sunbathing.

Can you support this with any sources? Where does it say that those are the crimes they are talking about?

It is extremely clear what they mean

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:A fire, A crime, especially if in progress, A car crash, especially if someone is injured, A medical emergency, such as someone who is unconscious, gasping for air or not breathing, experiencing an allergic reaction, having chest pain, having uncontrollable bleeding, or any other symptoms that require immediate medical attention

The website didn't take the time to explain the difference between crimes in progress for which you should call 911 and crimes for which you should call the local number. Could you provide a source for this distinction? I've always been instructed to call 911 by a local precinct when it has to do with a previous crime or one in progress, no matter how minor, which is anecdotal so it doesn't count as a source really, just my own experience, but the website I provided seems to support that.

Do you have a source for your claims, because all you are doing is restating your original claim, and backing it up by saying you were a first responder at a pool and therefore are authoritative on what necessitates a call to police (but you still don't have a source, photo of your training manual on concerning what to call 911 for maybe?), which isn't a source, I'm not going to just take your word on it, because I was a 911 responder for 20 years (I wasn't but I hope you get my point, without a source, everyone is full of shit on the internet). According to you, trespassing by females is not something that requires a 911 call. Do you think the 911 call the girls made was acceptable? Do you think in this situation the police should not be involved at all?

>Some boy in an adult's body who's intimidated by girls sunbathing where they aren't supposed to isn't an emergency. As a general rule of thumb, if it's fitting to go tattle on the girls to their parents then it's not appropriate to call 911 to report something.

Why does the fact that he is a man and they are women matter? Furthermore implying that he is an intimidated man-boy is really just attempting to shame him for doing his duties as a caretaker. Neither of these things are relevant to the discussion.

The **government website specifically on the topic of which occasions necessitate 911 calls** I provided is very clear that a crime in progress constitutes an emergency for which you should call 911.

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress...

Now this last bit was a little rude

>If you are that much of a bitch, keep the local police department's number in your phone or call the operater at 0 and ask to be redirected. But don't trust me, I was just a certified first responder for 4 years at a swimming pool and taught how to deal with crime (call police directly) versus medical emergencies (call 911)

Oh, you worked at a pool, so you still have no source for your claim.

Anyways what is a bitch? Please tell me. Is it a person who won't ""man up"" and solve his own crimes? A boy in an adult's body who calls the police to solve his crime-related problems? Ironically, that's exactly what the girls in this case did, a man told them they were trespassing and told them to leave, and they called the cops. Was their well-being in immediate danger because he is a man and they are women? You seem to be implying that him being male means that he has no reason to call the police if females are committing crimes.

**TLDR** I provided a pretty clear source, all you did was say I cherrypicked it and said you were a pool first responder for 4 years and are therefore qualified to counter that very clear wording on the website. **http://www.911.gov/whencall.html**

Please provide a source for your claim that **crimes in progress such as the one witnessed by the OP do not necessitate 911 calls and do not constitute emergencies, only ""real"" emergencies like the ones you listed do.**

Furthermore, I'm being reasonable and not advocating calling 911 at every opportunity, that's an obvious straw man of the argument I am presenting, verbal warnings and explanations can go a long way to remedy these situations, but when that doesn't work, what is the recourse you suggest someone like the OP take?",,,3,0,reddit1

She calls the cops after letting me in.  I see car in driveway and go out, they're already talking.  One of the cops walks up to me and starts lecturing me about harassing a tenant.  I let him go for a minute or two and then say calmly:  ""you've only heard her side of the story, would you like to hear mine before coming to a conclusion?

2)  If they do call at gun-point, what will you do?  Shoot them?  Otherwise you bet my first phone call after his departure would be to the police.  Where you would be arrested - see section 1

Yes they could of just checked his ID but that doesn't mean he wasn't harassing the girls. It does seem extreme to me to cuff him and put him in the car but I wasn't there. Maybe he was agitated or something.

There is simply not enough proof that he did.  They would never be found guilty of making a frivolous 911 call.  Jesus christ man, think.  This is not like a false claim or rape.  That can be proven by showing a lack of evidence.  Proof of lack of harassment?  Absent a video and/or recording, that is impossible.

The two girls were clearly trespassing.  And the cops fixed that! The cops got the two girls to leave.  If the OP wants, he can press charges for trespass or get someone with standing to press charges.  But this is not something that a DA would prosecute without pressure by the residents.  It is simply not worth the time.

I think the cops were in their right to put the OP in the back of their patrol car while they did an investigation.  I do think the handcuffs were over the top.  He can file a complaint about it but not much will be done.  The cops will get something put in their record.  On the other hand, he risks being sued by the cops for making a frivolous report.

The evidence is that while they were trespassing, they called 911 under the false pretense that a 'creeper' who identified himself as the property manager and told them to leave was 'harassing' them. They commited the second crime to cover up the first crime.  

In my state 3rd degree trespassing (since they didn't enter a structure) is a class 3 misdemeanor (not a 'petty' offense) good for up to 30 days.

The bolded part.

If they had asked for ID, seen that according to his ID he lived there, and then chosen not to detain him, that would be a reasonable course of action.  OP *did* say that they confiscated his wallet, so we know he had his wallet on him.  Presumably it had ID in it.  They had talked to each group of people individually before conferring and locking him up.  There was certainly time to ask for ID proving the guy lived there.

If a female burglar breaks into my house, and cuts herself on the glass of a broken window, then calls 911 to charge me with assault when I catch her... shouldn't the cops ask me for my ID to when I say I live here, and the person is a burglar?

Further, they did not arrest the women for trespassing, or even ask the OP if he wanted them arrested for trespassing, when it's his job to enforce the no-trespassing rule.

[arrest](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrest)

""to cause to stop,"" also ""to detain legally,"" late 14c., from Old French arester ""to stay, stop"" (Modern French arrêter), from Vulgar Latin *arrestare (source of Italian arrestare, Spanish and Portuguese arrestar), from Latin ad- ""to"" (see ad-) + restare ""to stop, remain behind, stay back"" (see rest (n.2)). Figurative sense of ""to catch and hold"" (the attention, etc.) is from 1814.

-----

DerpaNerb's use of the word was appropriate, and your ""correction"" is out of place.

The arbitrary distinction between ""arrest"" and ""detain"" came into being well after the constitution and the bill of rights were codified.  This distinction came into effect as a way to arbitrarily grant the police more power.

If you use the meaning of the word ""arrest"" that was in use at the time that the constitution and bill of rights were ratified, then the original poster (OP) was *indeed* ""arrested"" without a warrant or probable cause.  As such, his rights were violated.

If you are not using it within the confines of the law (as seen here) you will be charged.  Possibly with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

2) It is not legal in Texas.  Texas Penal Code section 9.42 requires ""the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.""  This situation fails that test when the threat is bikini-clad girls.  Pretty epically.

Firstly, you have much less protection on your property compared to within your home.  Secondly, police can enter a property in hot pursuit of a criminal ie. *you* after assault with a deadly weapon.  Or they just take witness statements along with your carry license for corroboration and get a warrant.  If you don't have a license, all the better!  They now have reason to suspect material evidence is being destroyed and can execute a search without a warrant at all.

See how you're now trying to find justification to shoot a couple of teenagers?  Grow up and behave like a reasonable member of society.  If someone is on your property ask them to leave, if they refuse call the police and press trespassing charges.  No need to go Rambo on the situation and get some people killed.",,,3,0,reddit1

I'm more concerned with the false report. Again, in my state:  

It is unlawful for a person to knowingly make to a law enforcement agency of either this state or a political subdivision of this state a false, fraudulent or unfounded report or statement or to knowingly misrepresent a fact for the purpose of interfering with the orderly operation of a law enforcement agency or misleading a peace officer.

They split up to talk to the two groups one on one without detaining either.  When the cop, male or female, is getting his side of the story, and hears that he lives there, it's a part of the job to ask for ID, to see if they can do a simple 15 second check to see if he's telling the truth.

Rape, sexual assault, threats of same, which the girls also cried, are definitely greater in magnitude than trespassing so yes, they should investigate that claim first, if there must be a choice between the two.

However, when the cops separate the two sides, it's to get their stories separately.  The OP said that's what they were doing.  That's a part of their job.

However, when you can verify a part of that story with a 15 second check, that too is a part of the job.  Then she'd know he was telling the truth about living there, which means his story has more evidence than that of the girls.

> This means detaining the alleged harasser.

Telling him ""don't leave, stay over there away from the girls, we're watching you"" style detaining?  That's debatable, but I'm not going to make an issue of it.  However if they should have detained him that way, then they should have detained the girls the same way.

Until they have probable cause of, or witness threatening or violent behavior, cuffs or back of the car are inappropriate.

> if that means someone gets put in the back of a car for a few minutes then I don't see a problem.

If they have no probable cause to believe he has participated in violent or threatening behavior, then I do.

A terry stop is a type of seizure.  A legal detention is a type of seizure.  An arrest is a type of seizure.  To effectuate a terry stop, you only need to have reason to believe a crime may be afoot.  A detention can be used where further investigation needs to be conducted and is to be limited to what is needed to do that investigation and to protect the officer.  An arrest is where the detention has become more than a minor inconvenience.  The division between these three things is not always easy to make but this sounded like a detention to me.

It says right there that no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, and that they shall name the person or things to be siezed.

If you can sieze a person without a warrant, then why, praytell, is there cause for such a warrant?

And seizing a man without probable cause that he's done something wrong *is* unreasonable.

The natural course of government is to extend itself by bites and nibbles.  The government says ""this is right and propper"", and over time, it convinces people that ""well if the government says it is so, it must be so"".

I have to disagree here with that being even remotely ""good"".  If warrants are never needed, then it'd be pretty idiotic to include any requirements on getting them, now wouldn't it?  The section passage is there for a reason.  If the passage is there for a reason, it affects the rest of that ammendment.

The fact that there are requirements on warrants for searches and seizures, in a passage devoted to protecting the people against searches and siezures, means that they *are* necessary.

That there is nothing specifically allowing for searches and siezures without warrants, then, means that warrants are required for *all* searches and siezures.

One cannot make this claim without further analysis. She provides a *potential* explanation, not a fact which is already verified.

This differs from vetting, as vetting implies no foresight was done before applying (more shotgun approach than sniper approach).

The analysis also stops prematurely. Why do women vet more? Is it luxury? Is it a better strategy? Does the vetting of roles play into satisfaction later down the line?

Less obvious is the desired set of skills which has changed over the last few generations: we've become increasingly noisier, more white collar and more ""design by committee"" than before.

But literally since the creation of this account, you have used it *exclusively* to post about situations that vilify men. Literally almost every single one of your posts and comments are about how men are sexist or arguing against the idea that men aren't sexist.


To me, or anyone else for that matter, it's clear that this account was not made with the idea of equally representing both sex's. In fact, I would go as far as to guess that your username is a nod to the notion that it's obvious that more men are sexist or bad in some way than not.


If we were in front of an omnipotent being and rendered incapable of lieing, I would bet my soul that deep inside you, you absolutely believe that men as a whole are inferior to women. You will never admit that you think most men are shit out loud, you'll vehemently deny it in fact.. Your crusade against sexism would have a lot less wind in their sails being so blatantly sexist yourself.. But from the limited bits I've read from you, it's almost undeniable. 


Just the way you talk, I can't literally feel the disdain *radiating* off of your singularly sided words. **MEN ARE NOT BETTER THAN WOMEN** . I bet when you read that line (that absolutely true line) you get a feeling like, ""Damn right"", and as should you. Conversely I can't imagine that **WOMAN ARE NOT BETTER THAN MEN** , an equally correct statement, gives you the same feeling. 


Look, I'll never agree with any ist or ism, for or from either side. You're allowed to have your biased (right or wrong) but it's important that you're able to recognize that no one sex, race or anything is better or worse than the other on the whole. There are just as many fucking deplorable, disgusting women in this world as there are men. There are also just as many good on both sides. 


When you start believing that one group of people are inherently worse than another (be it sex, race, orientation, anything), *that* is when you've begun to cross the threshold of becoming what you claim to be arguing against.

Remember recognition is not done on a per employer basis but on a per site basis, so if you can get 50% of the staff on a single site to join up, the union can force recognition on that site.

That aside, even an unrecognised union can represent you in grievance (or disciplinary for that matter) so you can raise an equality grievance with full representation whether your employer likes it or not. Let me guess, HR hasn't got round to mentioning any of these employment rights to you yet? What a surprise.

For that 99% of the job women are better, which conveniently people like you never bring up when discussing the differences between men and women.

iwbeqhm,t1_iwai1mw,2022-11-14 11:45:25,MensRights,"After I ETSed in the Army, I came home and had some issues with adjusting and reintegration. I ended up getting arrested within a few months and sid a little time in a central Florida jail. A girl had a seizure one night, and fell onto concrete from an 8 foot bunk. For hours they refused to open the door and come get her for medical attention.  When they finally did, she never came back. She wasn't in the infirmary, she was just gone. Another girl gave birth in the pod, once again because no one would open the doors and help. Jails in Florida are awful. Most of the inmates don't have the means, or even anyone who cares about them, so they know they can get away with it. When someone fr otl m a wealthy, caring family is in the pod, they are always treated differently once their family becomes a thorn in the jails side by calling and fighting for their family member to be treated like a human being. 

One girl had been raped repeatedly at a local prison, by guards. She got pregnant, but hid the fact because she knew she could be badly hurt or outright killed if they knew. She got out and had twin girls. She tried to go against the system, but her house kept getting raided, she had to start sneaking out of the neighborhood hood just to catch a ride to work, because if she just left she would be pulled over and often searched. Out of nowhere her license became suspended, she didn't know why when I knew her, but she got pulled over and thrown in jail. 3 times in five years of basically anything means your a ""habitual offender"" and as such can be charged with a felony.  When she got out of prison years before, she had trouble getting her life together, and if you miss an insurance payment in Florida your license ends up revoked and it used to be 250 these first reinstatement, 500 the second, and 750 the third. In those times, she had been pulled over withour a license the DAY her suspension became active. So she started being careful.

 She was doing very well for awhile. Until she requested paternity tests against those prison guards so she could begin getting justice.  She was so afraid. She knew they were going to send her to that prison. Even if she survived, she was silenced. She regretted ever trying together those rapists removed from a place where they raped inmates freely. She just wanted to go home. Her story seemed like too much to me at the time, but she had documentation. ""Lehal papers"" were allowed, and she had slid in some of her papers regarding the whole affair into large packets shipped in my her mother. Unless a guard went through and actually read all the papers, they wouldn't have known they were there.  She cried every night. She was afraid and missed her daughters, she was afraid for them as well, because now the potential fathers knew of their existence. She left for court one day and never came back. I don't know what happened to her. :(
 

A pseudo uncle I had growing up died in jail. They said he fell. When his family got the body his neck was broken and he had LOTS of other injuries, even broken bones, with signs of healing. The didn't have the money, or the means to go up against the system, and no lawyer would touch them as soon as they told them their story.  

In Florida there is a common saying ""Come for vacation, leave on probation, come back on a violation.""  Some of the things I've personally witnessed law enforcement do, even in my own neighborhood, was making me lose faith in humanity. I felt hopeless, like everyone else on that pit of despair that central Florida has become.  I left. Moved away. I'm the sole survivor of my friend group, and I watched my friends slowly lose hope overtime in that place. I have more surviving friends from the military, than I do back home.   Once you start to feel that your voice is that small, that those who are supposed to protect you, are no better than gangs of thugs that enforce local political interests...  it's an awful place, and I was the optimist for a long time, because it took me longer to see it.  


Florida's open records laws regarding arrests are some of the most open in the country. That's why there are so many ""Florida Man"" stories.  Crazy arrests happen elsewhere, but with how the reports are written, and how freely available thay are as soon as they're put in the system... it's just funny how, when they arrest someone, the details of that arrest are made public, where anyone can read every detail of someone's worst day, but every time an inmate dies and it actually reaches the media, the records kept on what happened and how often these things happen are all the sudden ""confidential.""

iwc44im,t1_iwaxjp7,2022-11-14 15:28:58,MensRights,"> Im against prisoners having dignity.

There is *so* much wrong here on so many levels.

1) Not every prisoner is someone who has had a victim.  So from the outset you are building a position based on a false pretense.

2) For people who did victimize someone, the lengths that the other person was victimized has high variance.  Someone who maybe vandalized something is not the same as someone who got arrested for fighting, and that in turn is different from murder.

3) ""What about the victim"" does not actually work in practice.  The very idea of justice only can ever work in ""eye for an eye"" context.  There have been a myriad of studies of this done on relatives of murder victims that show that the death penalty does not actually help with the grieving a loss process.  Your reasoning is innately broken here.

4) Not every prisoner is guilty.  Our ability to determine guilt is always going to be flawed to some capacity.  Your position would make innocent people fare far worse than they already do for improper imprisonment.

5) ""Make it a living hell so they never want to go back"" is, in fact, something we learned doesn't work.  That's why we have made changes that prohibit things like chain gangs.

6) Without a proper rehab program to get people in prison proper life training, skills, and ability to function in society, all you get is a bunch of people who live a harsh life in prison, and that's all they know.  Inducing heavy trauma on people already broken *does not* make people suddenly be functional in society.  This would just increase repeat offenders rather than actually keep crime down.

7)  The war on drugs was built entirely on this stupid premise.  That is a giant disaster that failed on every conceivable level, cost people their lives, helped nobody, cost incalculable amounts of money, and we are *still* reeling from it, and attitudes *just like yours* keep perpetuating it.

Please learn to actually think about the consequences of your opinions instead of just going with what feels good, because shit like this is why we'll never have proper prison reform to help people.  Also maybe learning a thing or two about facts would help you.",Rob__T,t2_bdudg,8,0,reddit3

Was a big push of Hillary Clinton during her candidacy. The platform website isn't there anymore, but there are articles.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/27/opinions/hillary-clinton-women-and-mass-incarceration-crisis/index.html

The article makes many excuses for women comitting crime. No empathy for men with identical backgrounds. Studies show the majority of men convicted of raping women were raped by women as boys. If this is justice, (which I'm not sure it is) why should men not also get a pass for adverse childhoods?

Things are headed this way in Australia with the same narrative. All women criminals have reasons. Men are just naturally criminals. Women don't deserve to be punished like men. I suspect in Australia laws will pass within the decade like they were in the UK.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/17/a-mass-imprisonment-crisis-why-more-women-are-doing-time

Now they are saying we shouldn't even put women on trial for selling drugs in the UK.  Not people based on a certain scenario, women.

I don’t believe gender needs to come into play unless it’s a situation where a male uses his strength to physically overpower and go too far I would say politely.

They example i give is Chris brown and Rihanna. While this situation with Dana white seems mutual and as I said I believe that makes it completely forgivable. They both owe each other an apology. Maybe publicly for displaying domestic violence as celebs but other than that I don’t think he should lose his job or anything close to that.

But with the whole Chris brown Rihanna they would fight each other fairly equally apparently until one day he almost beat her close to death. She never even came close to doing that to him and likely wasn’t hitting as hard as he was. That to me is a clear example of when it’s no longer fighting back and it’s a man abusing a woman.

I disagree with beating them to dissuade similar behaviour in the future. It’s nobody’s “job” to teach somebody a lesson.

They learn their lesson through natural consequences. And people fighting back “the appropriate amount” is part of that. I put that in quotes cause there isn’t some uniform rule, but overall I’d say it’s about intention.

If your intention is to do whatever is needed to protect yourself, 100% morally justified.

But if your intention is to get revenge, or “teach them a lesson” or “prevent them from doing this again.” You’re just finding an excuse to beat the shit out of someone. Which if you’re at least honest that you were in a fit of anger and used them to take it out I think it’s forgivable.

See the problem? You're trying to separate the assault from the defense by some theoretical time slice and claim hitting back isn't defense if it occurs too late. I'm showing that a manipulative abuser can use your thought process to abuse then play the victim over and over. It won't help. 

If I get slapped by a woman and do nothing the first time. When she slaps me a second time, even if it takes me a few seconds to realize what just happened my slap in return is still self defense. She chose to assault me, twice. The first time I let her get away with it as a calming effort to diffuse the situation. The second time I respond in kind because though slaps seem like they aren't too damaging  I spent enough time as a bouncer to have seen two different people get serious eye injuries due to nails or rings. So a slap back is warranted and still falls under self defense even if it offends your sensibilities.",designerutah,t2_4brob,4,0,reddit4

In Brazil he was CEO of Banco Santander Brazil , also the chairman of the Santander Group. Then was CEO of Santander UK. 
He was recruited to turn Lloyd’s around.  He worked so hard he once stayed up for 5 days without sleeping and he had to take time off for a month for his mental health. Due to this His leadership at Lloyd’s  he made their business profitable again, and helped thousands in Britain needing loans. With increases in vehicle and mortgage loans(Lloyd’s is Britain’s biggest mortgage provider )by appealing more to account owners or customers.. And he helped fully restore the banking group to a private nongovernmental ownership at 900 million euros above the value they were paying back the government for. All while eradicating government regulation violations that were present at the the group. Gradually throughout the time of  all these achievements, his salary was sequentially increased.

A non-executive director (abbreviated to non-exec, NED or NXD), independent director or external director is a member of the board of directors of a company or organisation, but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from executive directors, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as corporate officers). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.

It isn't twisting the article at all, it is seeing through the narrative being portrayed in the article. Board level roles are overwhelmingly pushed towards women in order to make boards more gender diverse. This is so obvious and consistent with all statistics about how board demographics have changed over the past decade or so that is [doesn't need sourcing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors#Encouraging_gender_diversity_on_corporate_boards)

You do not have a point as there is no discrimination against women for CEO positions, there is however massive discrimination for women to become CEO's. That so few do is because of how hard it is to become a CEO. 

> I have never said anything to detract from Men's Rights but this article has nothing to do with men's rights the OP saw an attack on men that wasn't an attack on men but an attempt to highlight a specific situation of inequality.

You are not entitled to someone’s friendship or compassion. Much as the feminists chant this within the online dating sphere (and I agree with them on that point, you’re owed being cordial by rights of being human, but nobody has to humour anything above that if they don’t want to).

So what if the guy wants to focus on work and work alone? You are not entitled to demand a certain level of interaction from him that has nothing to do with the productivity of the job!

This reminds me of a situation many years ago but weirdly it was a bloke flinging this at me. I choose to keep my work interactions to work, always have. I have enough friends that I care to have outside work and when I’m at work, I want to focus on getting shit done rather than making superficial pals.

This guy somehow got it into his head that because I wasn’t down for sharing my life’s story with him and kept things curt, I must have *hated* him, and he tried the whole “hostile work environment” angle as well. The guy in question was gay, and tried to push that as the reasoning on my part. Absolutely no evidence of homophobia on my part and not helped by the fact that I had a very good working relationship with several openly gay individuals in that workplace.

Ended up making a complete prat of himself in the HR summons we had to sit when I fenced the question of why he had decided that me sharing my personal life details with him was so important to him getting his job done properly. I never said a negative word about the guy to his face or otherwise. I was just focused on my job. In truth my hesitation was this guy was known gossip and I had continually heard him talking this or that about people behind their backs and I wanted no part of being fuel to his fire.

Ironically after the whole thing was waved away and he was put back in reality, it is THEN I decided “you my friend, are a twat” but still, never influenced my behaviour towards him.

TL,DR; A colleague (27M) joined our firm last year and since then he has had zero issues socialising with the guys we work with but always finds an excuse or says no to hanging out with the girls after work, even if we go out together as a whole he rarely talks to us and its making some of my friends uncomfortable.  
So early last year our firm hired Dan (27M). In the first few weeks he was really quiet and didn't talk much and that's just how we thought he was. Every conversation with him was short and to the point and never deviated from work, asides from pleasantries (Have a nice weekend etc). About 2 months in he started becoming a bit more friendly with the guys in our office and they would hang out every so often and have normal conversations. However, whenever any of the girls in the office tried to do so he would quickly change the conversation back to work or just not reply. Even now after a year of Dan working with us he straight up refuses to socialise with the girls in the office and it is making them feel uncomfortable. He avoids any discussion of himself outside of work related events and future plans and doesn't ask any of the girls either. Where as he is, what I can only assume, pretty good friends with the guys in the office.  
Even on work meals out to celebrate events he is only doing the bare minimum when it comes to conversation with the girls where again with the guys he talks to them like there is no problem whatsoever. I don't know if I'm overreacting but one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. Dan treats us like he treats clients we work with; cordial and strictly about business and its wearing thin now.

And most have a very difficult time handling disharmony.  If a man (or woman) is being too friendly or not friendly at all, its on an extreme, and becomes disharmonious.....creepy.

But most men are not like that.  And since they were boys they were mostly with boys and boys do not work so hard to manipulate a group into a group of harmonious equals.    Group dynamics are based more on what one can bring to the group, and social harmony is not much considered unless there is a serious problem, like constant fighting.

And between those two cultures, especially in a large work group,  there is no way to have balance.   One or the other has to dominate or there is confusion and trouble.

I am used to working in female dominated work environments....but even I am not always perfect at this.   I am well aware of my tendency to withdraw and seek out space to be alone, and I know that makes women feel they are being avoided (they are) and that its due to there being something wrong with them (there isn't...I just need privacy, space and quiet).    And while this is a source of tension, I know I am doing it and so I have strategies to make up for it.

So I don't really feel that anyone here is ""wrong"".   What I do feel is that those people can't work together because one is kind of too male and the other is kind of too female.

juktmdj,t3_113lgp5,2023-08-03 04:40:47,MensRights,"I almost think that the OP (the woman complaining about the man not talking to her) might be a trolling post.  However, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that this sort of thing would happen.  Hell, it probably happens a lot, but posting about it on Reddit (in relationship advice no less) seems a little suspicious.

I guess there's no way to know for sure.  The anonymous profile makes it a little bit suspect as well.

I will say that if this is real, then it's toxic femininity in the extreme.  I'm a tall handsome dude and I used to be really bad at talking to women so I just wouldn't do it and I think it did make women uncomfortable... not as uncomfortable as it made them when I did try to talk and came across like a bumbling dork who had no game.

I really had to learn to play to my strengths and eventually I did figure out how to be charming and to come across as desirable.  
Now as a man in my mid 30's most women are happy if I just leave them alone and I'm happy to oblige them.

I've been in a bunch of trainwreck relationships and my synopsis is that romantic relationships are highly overrated.  At least within certain groups in our population.  My stepbrother was MGTOW for years and he ended up marrying a girl from the Dominican republic who is ten years younger than him and very traditional.  I hope it works out for him in the long run.  He seems happy.  I haven't met his wife yet but from what he tells me about her, he seems to have made a wise choice for himself.  A woman like that is more in line with what he wanted, and he is the kind of man she wanted as well.

Damned if you do damned if you don't... Yes, in my experience, but maybe it's just our postmodern culture here in the west still getting it's footing.  We are growing and changing as a culture and unfortunately the strict political divides have put men and women on opposite sides sniping at one another in a culture war that is blown way out of proportion by social media and the like.

Men were creeps towards women for many many years in many many ways.  Now women are getting the upper hand in some ways and I think that without any institutional foundations in place to ease the transition to a more balanced social framework, the whole thing is erupting into chaos where no one seems to know how they are supposed to act towards one another.",Creatural_Shade,t2_jkd859gp,1,0,reddit2

No one is obligated to be chums with anyone. Do some people just have nothing better to do than gossip about who somebody happens to enjoy talking to? Has the poster stopped to think that maybe she's horribly boring to speak to...?

Work from home has so many synergistic benefits, including reducing workplace sexual tension, but it tends to highlight the inherent friction in relationships through men and women spending more time together. Current society is very good at minimising male-female time spent together through external work, resulting in a home being more a place to sleep and eat than actual cohabitation. It's why Covid was so devastating as relationships had come to rely on that separation.

I can almost guarantee that OP is not part of the patriarchy, dispite their gender and race.  Yes, the patriarchy' is brutal towards men too. That's the point. The ruling class treats lower class men as disposable both in war and work. That's how the cycle of money and power continues. 

Even if you 'have money' you are not part of the ruling class. There are about 20 MILLION millionaires in America so that's not special. You and I and everyone on this sub aren't part of the club. Dismantling the patriarchy also benefits men in general.

Fighting amongst ourselves and with women (you know the other HALF of the population) is what those with power want. We shouldn't be falling for it, nor be triggered into reacting to false targets on our backs.

While his point is historically accurate, it is a [red herring](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Red-Herring) and has nothing to do with whether contemporary Western societies are ""patriarchal"" in that they are dominated by men as a cohort.

The social construct of gender as a whole is indeed rooted in historical patriarchy. However, [as I explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/o1z40x/cancel_culture_is_when_mods_remove_content_that/h2a3zli/) to a [fauxgressive](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/fauxgressive) (pseudoleftist) male feminist who argued that this means contemporary society, in which the gender construct still exists, is patriarchal:

> > Patriarchy does influence gender norms, and it has shaped it.
> 
> Sure, but this doesn't mean they're the same thing. Just because these norms were fashioned back when society was actually patriarchal does not mean it's retained these patriarchal features to this day.
> 
> ___
> 
> > Saying that ""gender norms =/= patriarchy"" isnt entirely correct, don't you think?
> 
> The term ""patriarchy"" is variously defined as ""[a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS930US931&sxsrf=ALeKk02ViA20wcziPW1r-Uein-esp3Tqkw:1624066183432&q=patriarchy+definition&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDu9H_xaLxAhVJTd8KHcvfAZoQBSgAegQIARAw&biw=1093&bih=526),"" ""[dominance of a society by men, or the values that uphold such dominance](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/patriarchy),"" ""[a society, system, or group in which men dominate women and have the power and authority](https://sociologydictionary.org/patriarchy/),"" etc. Additionally, as I explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/haivde/trans_people_of_reddit_would_you_still_be_trans/fv6m1ak/):
> 
> > ""gender"" is variously defined as ""[social norms, attitudes and activities that society deems more appropriate for one sex over another](https://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/),"" ""[attitudes, behaviors, norms, and roles that a society or culture associated with an individual’s sex](https://sociologydictionary.org/gender/),"" ""[roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men](https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender),"" etc. Basically, gender consists of sex-based behavioral norms, attitudes, and perceptions that govern male and female behavior.
> 
> Patriarchy simply refers to male social domination (of women), whereas gender norms regulate the behavior of and apply distinctive rules against both sexes. Not only can the latter exist sans patriarchy or even within a matriarchy, but the former can exist sans the latter, i.e., it's possible in principle for men to dominate women in a genderless society. There is no necessary connection between patriarchy and gender; again, they are not the same thing.

To be sure, women's privilege in family court is not evidence of patriarchy. In addition to being *prima facie* absurd, upon closer inspection this notion proves to be untenable.",WorldController,t2_powbo,2,0,reddit3

I don't feel targeted as a rapist or scum when looking at feminism. Nor am I threatened by the more mainstream goals of feminism (healthcare, wages, justice). Again I think a lot of people get caught up in the trap of listening to loudest and angriest individuals in a group and thinking they represent the entire group.

It's the Zero Sum attitude between the genders that I think gets my goat the most. Women gaining more agency and power in society does not mean men get less. When working for a more equal society we are hurting ourselves by working AGAINST women.

Think of the draft. No it's not right in my opinion that I had to sign up for selective service and women don't. The solution is not to drag women down and make them sign up for the draft. The solution is dismantle the draft for everyone. 

Likewise think of the justice system. Men get harsher sentences on average. The solution is not to give harsher sentences to women. The solution would be to remove bias (gender, racial, and economic) from the justice system.

OP's post was divisive in that way and I disagreed with him. The whole all men are an active part of the patriarchy didn't ring true for me. I don't think of feminism as anti men nor do I feel the need to stand in the way of women and their goals of equality.

Men seeking spousal support should not be viewed as undignified, or something to be ashamed of, even though pop culture tends to portray men who receive spousal support as “kept men,” or as an anomaly that only those who were married to famous women can realistically expect to be awarded.” (From https://www.divorcemag.com/articles/percentage-of-men-awarded-spousal-support-increasing)

We have a similar problem with paternity leave here in the UK - only about 18% of men claim their legal entitlement.  It’s not their “fault” in either case (alimony/paternity), it’s the society we all live in.  Example: my husband took a small share of his paternity entitlement, and paid for it with workplace bullying by his boss and uncompensated increased overtime.  So I think that the “pride” the family lawyers are noticing is, in most cases, masking a sensible calculation of the social price for being known as an alimony recipient.

There have been some high profile scandals, e.g. finding that the top female BBC presenters were being paid a lot less than their male counterparts, which came to light because the BBC was forced into transparency over salaries.

Yeah, because meeting people is so easy everywhere else there's no reason to go to a club to try it. Will they also kick out women who go there to meet somebody or just have a one nighter? They'll kick out the cougars, too, that often creep out young men and predate on them? Or will this place turn into their Mecca?

And you know these ""officers"" will only be looking at the men, who look at women, because that is the only type of looking that considered offensive or predatory.  And, clearly, it's deemed offensive and predatory because society clearly has a very negative attitude towards male heterosexuality and because it's become the norm to just presume that if a man looks at a woman, it is with ill or nefarious intent. They won't be policing this for women looking at other women, women looking at men or men looking at other men(ironically, if a man was to be upset by another men looking at him, he would be shamed as being homophobic).

 Imagine being so intolerant of male heterosexuality, that it's considered acceptable and commercially viable to police men for even looking at women. In what world would men be forced to require a woman's consent to even find her attractive or to desire her attention, yet still also call women oppressed? You will have parades and months to celebrate homosexuality, while openly shaming, vilifying and attacking men for their heterosexuality.

The nation that's gaining a reputation for being misandrists (woke countries)

This is the same nation that had some schools make school boys wear dresses for school

Singled out the boys to stand up in an assembly to apologise for crimes made by men towards women

And ran an advert campaign in cramberra called 'boys will be boys' which was later considered sexist

And once had sheilas wheels, an insurance company that discriminated men and became international until the uk and europe abolished seperate car insurance rates for women

2. Staring is rude
Thats what i was taught growing up, so nobody should be staring at anyone, least of all where alcohol is involved, because two guys staring at one another in a bar or club is likely to result in a fight.

Staring ar someone lustfully is just creepy (be it a man at a woman or a woman at a man), it kinda reminds me of the smiler logo (alton towers ride, google it if you dont know of it)

So for me its unnatural, so i do see their point on harrassment as it is antisocial behaviour

But... How does that get policed
Ie how do you tell the difference between a malicious stair vs an innocent one

Examples:

25 yr old in a club, sees a girl across the club, he thinks he went to school with, but cant be sure as shes older and hair style, colour changed and might of put on a bit of weight, might of lost a bit so face has a 80% recemblance

What if he has a lot on his mind and just staring into space but happens to be a girl other side, he isnt intending to stare at her his just dazed

Now this one is illegal, he could be on drugs and monged, again his no threat to the girl, he isnt thinking of the girl, he just isnt concious of his actions because his drugged up (i suppose the club will welcome kicking him out for licence purposes)


What does amaze me is
In the late 90s early 2000s it was considered more risky to meet people online and unsafe vs a pub or a club, now this article is saying, dont come to the club to pick up a partner

that's why it's always going to be enabled by rich capitalist men at the very top pretending to be white knights who are for things like this bc it reinforces their dominance hierarchy and gives them permission to publicly shame to make examples of their competition when an opportunity comes up to spin a situation to make something innocent appear malevolent, bc it makes them more powerful as well. so it's a win win for women and rich men. 


bc obviously this bar owner who's implementing this system is immune from being kicked out of his own club no matter how many women he approaches or what actual sexual harassment he does. 


rules for thee but not for me is the history of our species, its important to remember that freedom and democracy are the exception not the rule. in every system except democracy, dumb rules exactly like this were used to keep the average guy down with stupid rules like royalty, caste systems and bullshit religious customs. and now the feminist agenda is trying to bring those same dumb types of customs to a free democratic state. 


it's no exaggeration to say bringing violence and the police state into nightclubs is an attack on men's freedom. creepy men who get handsy or aggressive and sexually harass women are already kicked out of clubs or pulled away by men like you and me bc 99% of men AREN'T criminals. only 1% is. so an unnecessary extra - ""don't even look or talk to them"" without asking rule on 100% of men that they're trying to enforce , is only made so they can abuse it on people they dislike.

so first you need to say : ""pardon me ma'am, may i have your verbal consent to speak with you without getting beat up and kicked out ?""

""The fresh policy states that ""Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to 'pick up'"".


when people want to go to a place to not be picked up and hangout with only their friends and family - they go to a fucking restaurant where you get your own table and it's considered taboo for strangers to approach YOUR table and try to pick you up. 


restaurants are perfectly happy to serve your exclusive group of friends just drinks instead of food as long as you're paying their upcharges and everyone expects to be kicked out if they're disturbing guests with horniness bc it's not the place for it. that's what this ""club"" should switch to- a fucking restaurant.


but when people want to meet new strangers to pickup - they go to bars and clubs.


of course people are usually more subtle about it instead of being that obvious about it going up to each other saying - ""hey , we're at a bar/club instead of a restaurant , so we obviously both want to fuck, let's go fuck."" 


sure, some people do the direct approach with the ol ""do you wanna get out of here?"" - and sometimes it works tbh 


other times it doesn't work, so they're simply told no thank you. 


and 99% of the time that's fine and everyone goes on with their lives bc we all accept that we're adults and we risk the slight discomfort of being propositioned if you go to a place designed for propositions... what do they think alcohol - the sole beverage of nightclubs - is for ?



 it's for getting enough liquid courage to talk to strangers and ask each other out. how that's done is usually polices itself by what works individually- very good looking guys get success by doing pretty much anything. less good looking guys have to be a little more personable a little more creative and of course buying women alcohol helps them get success too.


but to single handedly attempt to police drunk people even TALKING to each other ? ya i don't see that ending well. why not just go to a Christian dance at that point? either their atmosphere is going to be so incredibly dry and boring that they'll make the already difficult low margin nightclub business even harder than it already is and go broke.


or it'll somehow work and people will come and try to play their stupid little feminist game to impress each other - for a whole 6 months while the fad is cool- and then move on to everywhere that's not so uptight. 


so it'll hopefully fail sooner than later. bc if this shit catches on it's the end of nightclub culture . creepy guys already get kicked out of nightclubs, they don't need to kick out regular guys just for shooting their shots where they should be shooting their shots.",mindset_grindset,t2_h9cqpgm0,15,0,reddit4

“If you are, for example, staring at someone from afar – if the attention you are giving someone is unwanted, that is considered harassment,"" the club said.


“If you’re being harassed by another person or receiving unwanted attention, please seek them out or tell our staff immediately.


""We adopt a policy of ‘always believe the report’ in cases of harassment and feeling unsafe.


""If we receive reports of any behaviour that has made someone feel uncomfortable, the reported individual will be removed from the venue and the police will be called.""


so basically - you're minding your own business walking up to get a drink, some girl happens to be in your eyeline, for any reason whatsoever she decides she's uncomfortable - maybe you didn't offer to buy her a drink and she's mad, maybe she doesn't like your race, maybe she just hates men- so she immediately waves the feminist white knight police over and no questions asked they jump you and kick you out AND call the police to send you to jail. 


my guess is if this happens a lot then the police will just hangout nearby or outside like they do at hotspots in my town, so it'll be very litteraly straight to jail if you get kicked out. my guess is they'll hire off duty cops for security anyway to basically skip the middle man so these pink vest white knight feminists are essentially police , so if you try to argue or drunkenly throw an elbow as a natural reaction before you know what's going on then you'll have the police throw the book at you for disorderly/resisting arrest. 


so essentially now at this club and others if it catches on- any woman regardless of income, mental health or believability- will have the direct and encouraged armed police state to enforce any ""uncomfortable"" feelings or false accusations they have out of spite or any reason whatsoever.

ilqhdkl,t1_ilq7tta,2022-08-25 14:08:57,MensRights,">Any man that goes to this club is an idiot.

I did a stint as a bouncer in a club during college, and let me tell you that any man that goes to a club is an idiot. They are pretty much money extraction pumps for thirsty guys. We had quotas of who got let in, and pretty much hot girls could walk right past the line. The logic here was that lots of guys would come to where the hot girls are at, and spend a fortune on drinks to try to get in their pants. The girls were aware of this and a lot would just plan on free drinks. Furthermore, some establishments would have paid girls there in the crowd with the express purpose of getting guys to buy them drinks.

So repeatedly Id see a PUA type 'work' a girl all night. She'd literally just walk away from the dude when the local football star showed up, and he'd seal the deal with a nod and grunt then leave with her. All in under half an hour... without buying single drink. Which was absolutely the worst scenario for the club, TBH.

As an aside a girl I was with in college had two roommates who were identical twins. They would openly brag about going out to the club and getting free drinks from guys. If he tried to get their number, they'd give him the number to the local pizza joint. They thought this was hilarious. 

Bottle service was a massive scam. Most of the time the venues just kept refilling the expensive import vodka bottles with cheap stuff from the local supermarket. The 'VIP' room is pretty much the same concept, but for suckers who are known to have loads of  money. Especially the ones that get boozed and cause damage, which they will charge the customer for at an up-charge. 

Even the parking was a scam. One of the venues I worked had VIP parking for $25 bucks. Pay your fee and the guy across the street would undo the little chain across the drive and you got a convenient parking space in a nice grass lot. Thing is they didn't own the lot, and the church that did sent them a cease and desist once they figured it out. 

Working the front doors, you'd better believe we had quota's. 10% minorities, 50% women, 40% white guys. Because for a thirsty dude you want it to appear that there's lots of hot available girls for him to buy drinks for, and if one doesn't pan out there's more you try your luck with. It's akin to slot machines, and I'd say the psychology is pretty much the same.",RunawayGrain,t2_i6tf1,43,0,reddit4

That's most of the West to some extent nowadays, but particularly English-speaking countries, which have it by far the worst imo with the exception of some outliers like Sweden which are equally messed up. Sure, other countries also have problems with feminism, and it has filtered into their discourse and some cases legal systems, but the Anglosphere nevertheless stands out for how pervasive its influence is, and how much it has come to influence nevermind political discussion, but simple daily interactions.

As an example of this phenomenon, France is often seen as a very liberal country, but surprisingly to some, not very feminist. I live in Canada, and it's quite common to see French people immigrate to Quebec (I've been to Quebec and speak passable French, but don't currently live there), and a sentiment that you hear again and again from French expats is that Quebec is far more liberal than France, and feminism ""is taken seriously"" and ""not a joke"". Of course, Quebec is not exactly an English-speaking region, but most people speak English to some extent and most of Montreal is fluent in English, although French is still the native language for most people, so the influence is not as great, and this is reflected in the attitudes. While Quebec is certainly feminist, I certainly find its women more feminine, open, and less angry and judgmental than English Canada's where a significant portion of women seem downright crazy.

Also, I immigrated myself as a kid from an Eastern European country and have always found English cultures to be rather cold, reserved, and restrained in comparison, with few people expressing their true feelings, creating an ideal environment for something like feminism to take hold and thrive. About the only English-speaking regions that are not fully crazy yet in terms of male-female interactions are the Deep South  and states like Florida, where there is a more conservative culture and there are more Hispanics, who are warmer, and tend to be less feminist. In most of the rest of the English-speaking world, normal interactions between the sexes are pretty much a thing of the past.",shydude92,t2_vi41h,1,0,reddit4

Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night.

If want to you feel sexy you can just as easily dress up that way when you're having a wine party, sleepover, whatever with just the girls. However guess what from all the girls I know, they don't dress up in the sake sexy clubbing clothes then. Nor does the majority of girls/women ...  
If it's just to feel sexy you can put on music at home and dance alone or with 1 or 2 friends, then there's no reason to go to that club.

The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind. 

However this is the crux of the problem.
You can either get angry at everyone when they keep on flirting/staring/whatever after you say you aren't interested or at no one. However enough girls will first get pissed at a guy they don't find attractive and then do the exact same with a guy they do find attractive but play hard to get. That's just dumb and inconsistent and even hypocrite behaviour. 
You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. Most guys in clubs just do what they had the most succes with ... Or often what they see others do that are successful. 
Either that behaviour is okay or it's not, shouldn't matter if it's done by person A or person B, assuming they are both strangers to you. However that's not what happens in practice and that's part of the problem ...

> Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night

Because men and women can like to look good for themselves, it can help you feel more confident, show off to friends, you’re dressing for the occasion. That’s ontop of the people who would also do it for attention

Dressing up at home isn’t an occasion, it’s not exciting, you aren’t really doing anything. If you’re going out clubbing, you want to look good, you want to dress up in clubbing attire, you want to dress to match the energy of the people and the music at the event you’re at. You can’t get that same energy or atmosphere in you’re basement with £5 wine and a handful of friends, it’s a different vibe 

Not to mention how it doesn’t really matter, dressing up still isn’t an invitation for unwanted interactions. Dressing slutty isn’t ‘asking for it’, because people are individuals and have their own reasons. Making grimy assumptions is the incorrect way to approach strangers. You probe, you get a response, and whatever response you receive you respect, simple. 


> The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind.

Why not? Personal preference or their individual choices absolutely should be respected. An invitation for one person isn’t an invitation for everyone, that’s common sense. If you ask someone not to stare or make it’s obvious you aren’t interested and they carry on, it’s unwanted, it’s making them uncomfortable, it not unreasonable for them to be told to stop

> You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. 

Doesn’t make it at all appropriate, and it’s not restricted to men, woman can be pushy too

> Either that behaviour is okay or it's not

Not really, it’s not black and white. You can want to interact with person A and not interact with person B, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that

> Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...

And that just boils down to respect

If you’re staring at someone for a prolonged period of time with no response, maybe you should take the hint? 

If you’re staring at someone and that attention is being reciprocated, equally you should take the hint and take it further. It’s just being respectful and having basic communication skills, understanding the ‘yes’ and ‘no’s’",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-13,0,reddit4

So there was at least the patina of people wanting to get together to have a good time. My guess is that Tinder and it's ilk have broken the spell, as it were.

Well, back in school there was the short guy that was always 'talking' to some girl. He 'talked' to lots of girls as opposed to the sports guy who was actually plowing lots of girls. This is the guy that doubled down and mutated into the PUA guys that were buying girls drinks. My guess is that half the idea was to get her drunk enough to go home with him...

VIP service is a scam. At best you have someone of the opinion that they are a big shot and don't want to be bothered by the public. We had an local MLB player guy that frequented one of the establishments I worked. He had a bit of an overblown opinion of himself, hence the VIP room. Frankly, he was a jerk too. He'd get wasted and have a bunch of barfly girls on him like leeches on an old mule. Then he'd do some minor damage. He usually had a huge tab due to the hangers on and the club exaggerating how much the repair bills were, which was the point.

ilvszla,t1_ilsr2x3,2022-08-26 15:46:25,MensRights,"What do you think have always been the standard policy in bars, officially or unofficially, when it came to somebody creeping on women? Unless you managed to find a place absent of security and often fueled by drugs, you were always subject to get thrown out, for anything, really. But if women complained, you did not have the option to stay inside or even argue, that has always been the case. It still is, unless a man is really rich or is with somebody really rich, he's really not in any position to act out of line. In fact there's plenty of places you probably also get a beating from security after being escorted out, even if you really did nothing just because they can, nobody will see anything and the police will do nothing because it's much easier for them to look away when a few testosterone junkies beat somebody up who didn't yet get the memo than having to respond to some bickering every ten minutes.

The only difference is that usually women didn't care what anybody was doing as long as they didn't intentionally interacted with them over and over. And why would they? However a policy this explicitly laying down that women can get men thrown out even if there is no evidence against them and there is no possibility that they won't be believed, and even the police gets involved, will only have one effect: it's going to encourage even women who never cared and still don't care to be ""empowered"" and ruin at least the night of somebody they think shouldn't be there for whatever reason. And if the insanity continues and we actually see laws pop up making ""staring"" and other thought crimes illegal, men will get their lives ruined even by just not looking good enough and standing ""too close"" to an ""empowered"" woman in a crowd of hundreds where dropping a needle would be impossible, like subways.",,,1,0,reddit4

ils67eh,t1_ilr1753,2022-08-25 20:38:00,MensRights,"It’s just being respectful and having basic communication skills, understanding the ‘yes’ and ‘no’s’

You're right about this part. But the yes and nos aren't in English. These communication skills aren't at all 'basic' for some, especially men. It's a skill that needs to be developed and can only be developed through interaction, not being told do this, don't do that etc 
intellectually.


I think it would be good for all men to learn and develop these skills but there is no manual for what these yes and nos are. What is lacking is strong male role models and father's demonstrating how to be a man and how to understand and treat women, a lot of which is obviously thanks to feminism. But because of this, a lot of men don't know how to be men and aren't even allowed to be men except only when given permission from a woman.  'Explicit' permission that comes in indirect so called communication, just basically hints.

Dating and engaging women for men is becoming more and more like being a tomb raider. You have to decipher heiroglyphics you haven't been taught or shown how to read and any wrong turn is booby trapped. 

This is how it feels, basically. Yet women in traditional mens roles get to complain and have the world bend to them. That men aren't allowed exclusive spaces, that any women no matter how unwelcome they are have every right to not only exist in any space men can be, but demand that it must cater to them and overlook their deficiencies. E.g. women 'not being heard' or promoted in certain areas needs quotas to address any perceived imbalance against women. Why is it never asked that women just work on their competativeness and assertiveness.

In the dating and social world where men are typically disadvantaged, it's not hey, we have to be inclusive of everyone and their relative skill socially, like it is now with skills in the man's world. It's no, you're not reading the hints correctly and you have 'upset' a woman, get the fuck out you creep.

I think you are wrong about the feeling sexy part. It's not the vibe that makes you feel sexy, it's being desired. What you are wearing inspires desire in men and that in turn makes you feel sexy. If the same scenario of you and your friends hanging out happened, except a guy you were attracted to was coming, I imagine you would also want to look sexy, but sleepover sexy or whatever. The difference is the man to be masculine to make your time worth while being feminine, getting dressed up and looking good. Not the vibe.

So you having done your part in being feminine and dressing up to go out to the club a guy then has to be masculine and make the move. If you don't like the guy and his 'masculine' in the way he approached you, you can have him removed.


Imagine if there was a club where men could be 'offended' by a woman's appearance and have her removed, it would be extremely dehumanising and disgusting.

 But thats happening now apparently to men and it reflects I think a deeper truth. That a lot of women don't see men as human. I think the constant dehumanisation by women drives up the 'creepiness' of the guy. If a lot of women talked to men like humans and not rapists and murderers in waiting, a lot of men would be able to get over whatever it is that makes them appear 'creepy'

I think the position you are arguing from has some truth to it. But it's also shit from the other side is what I'm trying to portray.",,,2,0,reddit4

As a HR consultant, I would hazard to guess this CEO was too inexperienced to manage people. Employees generally look to their bosses on how to behave.

Note also that the women stopped being too bitchy when men (who could be impressed!) were around. Men behave differently in groups when women are part of those groups, too.

cqxzzvc,t1_cqx771f,2015-05-04 15:04:13,MensRights,"Respectfully, I disagree. I don't expect to change your mind, but I will explain mine:

A) This example does not prove that all-women companies fail because of their gender exclusivity. Maybe (maybe!) this one failed because of the infighting described, but to say that the infighting was a result of hiring all-women is sexist. I could create a company of exclusively women that would be monumentally successful, and I could create a company of exclusively men that would be monumentally successful. This is because the success of the company is based on the individuals, not their gender. To claim otherwise is sexist, and inaccurate.

B) By holding this up as an example of ""see-told-you-so"" to feminists we weaken our message of equality. why? Because inevitably there will be a successful all-women company, and then we will have to acknowledge that with the same fervor that we have 
clung to this one. And the truth is that it doesn't matter (see point A) and has nothing to do with mens rights. Yet in some peoples minds it will be a point against us. By sticking to the main point of our narrative - equal rights for men - instead of trying to whack-a-mole everything that feminists could say we are more immune to this.

B) No ones rights are harmed by this. Some overzealous and confused men's rights adherent will say ""But men didn't have an opportunity to be hired!"" Yes, you are right technically. But we have a much more important and bigger fight on our hands then a small ~5 person company and what they choose to do. If it was an enterprise then yes, it would be an issue, but there are already laws to prevent that. I suggest you refocus your priorities. Men and boys are being killed right now over seas in wars. They are being raped with no community support. Right now there are way more homeless men on the streets in a city near you. Right now more males are being incarcerated for crimes that females are walking from. Talking about a small businesses hiring methodology in light of what is really important makes us look trivial, and the problem of equal rights for men is not trivial.

No, the business failed because she failed to manage.

She seemed to think that her job was to referee all of these conflicts… or do nothing. She appeared to believe that it was necessary for her employees to 'like' her out of what I suspect was an emotional neediness to have one big, happy, all-female 'family'.

She failed to demand that her employees adhere to business standards and conduct themselves in a professional manner.

It is subdivided into 100 *pence* (singular: *penny*). A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the *[pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(currency\))*. At various times, the pound sterling was [commodity money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money) or bank notes backed by silver or gold, but it is currently [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), backed only by the economy in the areas where it is accepted. The pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use and which has been in continuous usage since its inception.

Shit u have to have seen the videos of a dude getting hit by a car & still he caught the charge. Anyway u know u fucked up reporting it as ""man up"" & ""handle it"" is always expected of men.

So here's the advice: hit up the coworker friend. You need a witness 4 sure. It might be to far gone to 'win', but a witness will at least soften the L.

I've been the witness. Work buddy fired & I knew the whole situation. HR never talked to me & just issued the axe. So when he called asking if I'd be a witness & his lawyer thought it would help. I said ""absolutely it's the right thing to do"". I then went to my own HR guy as I still worked for the company (same guy that fucked up the termination). I told him what was asked & if there was some policy I'd violate or something. He said no violation just say what happened. (He then did finally interview me on the situation. Month late but that's his problem.) Anyway a week later literally ""on the clock"" I'm on a call as a witness against my own company! Bosses I'd never met, a mess of HR people, lawyers & a judge. All I did was answer questions & state the facts. Purely a witness. I'm no judge; that parts not my job, so nothing to worry about. 
Long story not short because I'm telling it. Buddy ended up winning his wrongful termination & my company had to pay his salary (including back pay) until he found another job. I kept working for the company for 3 more years. The HR guy that fucked the whole thing was gone in less than 2 months.

Did they ask you to depose before a in house team? Did they give you an opportunity to be heard? No? Then those are retaliation. You have a case.

Since you have already been fired, you need to obtain a lawyer and file a complaint. 

>You always have an option of filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC to complain about the harassment. There are specific time limits for filing a charge (180 or 300 days, depending on where you work), so contact EEOC promptly. 

**Firing you AFTER you made an accusation of harassment is particularly damning.** If they do not demonstrate just cause - including documentation of steps taken to remediate unprofessional behavior - then they are very likely to be in deep shit.

Get started on this *now.* For a major hospital system, you are looking at quite a bit of money. At minimum, you might be able to get your job back, missed income, and interest.

I watched a manager berate someone for a mistake until they were in tears. It maddens that they're all getting a pension now for being abusive assholes. 

[Women have an in-group bias.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8226295_Gender_Differences_in_Automatic_In-Group_Bias_Why_Do_Women_Like_Women_More_Than_Men_Like_Men). Men do not. Yet one more reason that patriarchy theory is not based on facts or science.

Men don't generally work together to help other men. If men are working together, it's usually to promote class interests - whether they be rich or working class. 

However, what I'm wondering is what why aren't we reacting to the scientific fact that women have an in-group bias?

The Woke will accept that the hiring managers at Google have an implicit bias against women they can't seem to purge - or find in the first place - but won't do anything about the **fact** that female hiring managers will automatically prefer other women over the men there?

What difference is there between rape and consenting sex?

Only what  was in her mind at the time.

She can claim she didnt consent. is there evidence she didnt?

The entire thing is a terrible issue because sex is so common and proving what was IN HER MIND is literally impossible, unless there are other factors. This is why judges used to ask ""what was she waering"" back when women didnt wear slutgear unless they were cruising for dick.

Because that is a secondary indicator of her state of mind. As good as it gets. Just like a text ""I want your dick"" is STILL only a secondary indicator, becuase she could text that, but then laugh at him and turn him down if he tries to make a move because she's ""joking"", either truthfully or because she changed her mind and is gaslighting him to save face for herself.

So even a text saying she wants sex doesn't prove that she consented AT THE TIME to the act of sex. It could be that she wanted to, cahnged her mind, so he raped her because he didnt want her to go without him getting laid.

In that case, the text would ""damn her to rape"" because ""she was asking for it"", just like in the history of feminism they complained judges asking ""what was she wearing"" was ""asking for it [to be raped]"", which was COMPLETE BULLSHIT, but which was a cornerstone of their malicious arguments.

But the truth is, most office people have lives, and we all slack off a little. So maybe as long as the bare minimum gets done, everyone looks the other way on each other's slacking. And maybe some people work at a company that makes $500 million a year, and they can afford to hire all these redundant subcontractors, and keep everybody fat and happy.

In AITA
A man is the asshole for dating a single mom and wanting alone time away from the child but a woman dating a single dad who doesn't want to move in with him because she isn't interested in having a child around is fine because they want different things in life.

In relationship advice
I saw people performing mental gymnastics again to defend a woman who would slam cupboard and room doors when upset.


In all subs
A man expressing boundaries is controlling and manipulative but a woman doing it is protecting her mental health.
A man clearly depressed is useless and needs to be kicked out and is a loser but woman with depression needs to see a therapist and needs help immediately.
A woman being abusive to a man needs help because she is obviously having mental issues but a woman who is receiving abuse needs to leave immediately.
Any couple with a toddler having issues and the woman has ppd regardless even if op says the she has seen professionals and hasn't been diagnosed with it

And post anything MRA and be prepared to get hell rained upon you

Edit:

There's a post on Relationships about a guy whose wife is constantly breaking or damaging stuff and he was fed up... Below is the top comment

>Ask her how this happens? Maybe she has an underlying medical issue that is making her lose control in her movements, or maybe she has attention deficit issues. These things can be worked out if you find out what is causing it and work on finding a solution.

Now reverse the genders, the man would be called abusive, dangerous, the guy is careless and needs to pay for the damage and she needs to leave him because he obviously doesn't respect her or her belongings.

Always remember that the surveys that women respond to about household divisions of labor are self-reported. One of feminists' favorite surveys reports the following:

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 45 minutes a day cleaning.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 23 minutes a day shopping.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 8 minutes a day helping children with homework.

Their favourite is post partum depression. That woman can abuse her partner, her child, be lazy and negligent, but it isn't her fault!

They diagnose her like the medical experts we all know they are and absolve her from all responsibility.

By contrast, a man who is having a tough time adjusting to parenthood should just man up, have greater empathy for his partner, offer HER more support and stop complaining.

I know that there is growing sexlessness among young men but they are also marrying far less when they get older and do get into relationships (usually in their 30s). And I don't blame them for not wanting to take on these burdens when the expectation is they just labour for a lifestyle she wants, labour for the kids she primarily desires, and must labour even more so she *feels* like there is a proper split in domestic duties (that actually favour her).

There is no expectation placed on women in the same way and to suggest it is sexist.

On those subs a woman just has to cry unfairness and she gets support. A man must come in with multiple examples to show as evidence he is being slighted and still someone will try to make it seem like the woman is not to blame.",CentralAdmin,t2_5e4v852d,16,0,reddit1

Liberalism is different from leftism in that liberalism is a globalist pro-capitalist ideology, and leftism is a spectrum of a myriad of competing radical and moderate ideas (Most left-wing ideologies focus on economic issues such as labor unions, worker's rights, democratic workplaces, regulated economies, welfare and social programs, etc)

> Leftists swing to the totalitarian right when there stupid ideas don't work and people don't obey. 

Leftism can either be democratic, or authoritarian, just like rightism. Rightism can cover from Social Libertarianism and Constitutional Monarchism, to State Capitalism and Nazism. Similarly varied is leftism. From Social Democracy and Unionism to Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism.

> Genocide usually follows.

Not all left-wing countries have genocides, you're confusing them with communist ones. (USSR with Ukrainians and Germans, China with Uyghurs, Pol-Potism with intellectuals, etc)

> Look at how the Democrats and Hillary reacted to Trump winning they basically poisoned the pussy well. Started the Me2 blackmail movement. They falsely accuse their political opponents and attack their mental health.

American politics isn't everything, bud. Plus, the Democrats are just more moderate capitalists, not communists or socialists. They agree on almost everything except for notably their social policy (identity politics, feminism, gender issues, etc)

One option is to leave the company to start doing your own coding sessions for boys and girls. Or stay at the company and do sessions for boys in your spare time if that's not in violation of your contract with them - it's not competing with them any more, so might be alright.

It's worth asking the bosses why the private lessons have been dropped. That's the interesting question to me, I'm completely unsurprised about boys being excluded from yet another opportunity.

You are Protected in Law under **Section 27 of the Equality Act** - **Victimisation**. 

Raising any concern of bias is a ""Protected Act"" and any retaliation is Victimisation and actionable through both courts and employment tribunals. 

When raising any concern it is wise to state that you are Undertaking a ""**Protected Act - Section 27 The Equality Act 2010**"", as this serves notice to any party that they are obliged to protect you from any form of Retaliation, Harassment etc as they can find themselves being sued. 

**[27 Victimisation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/27)**

(1) A person (A) victimises another person (B) **if A subjects B to a detriment** because—

...   (a) **B does a protected act, or**

... (b) **A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.**

(2) **Each of the following is a protected act**—

...(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

...(b) giving evidence or information in connection with proceedings under this Act;

...(c) **doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection with this Act;**

...(d) **making an allegation (whether or not express) that A or another person has contravened this Act.**


(5) **The reference to contravening this Act includes a reference to committing a breach of an equality clause or rule.**

For example, the concept POSITIVE ACTION: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action

>In Europe, positive action, roughly synonymous with affirmative action, is the promotion of people based on belonging to non majority identity groups in the workplace, educational institutions and positions in society, purportedly without prejudicing the criteria of selection by merit. In the United Kingdom in Harriet Harman's Equality Act 2010 ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

Now, I'm not 100% sure whether this applies specifically to this situation. But people here went all in on complete blanket statements about discrimination (""it's the same for boys and girls""), and now suddenly you are completely certain that this particular section provides the only answer.

I am going to sound very negative with what I'll say next, but please understand that I just want you to realize where you stand. I hope like hell that you are completely exonerated in this case.

With that said, I hate to tell you this, but in your case, as a male being accused in the workplace of something, it's not like an actual court case.

If a woman is making a complaint, she is automatically believed, and it is up to you to DISPROVE her allegation. You will have a considerably more difficult job DISPROVING something that is believed without any actual proof required for that belief. Make no mistake, it will be on YOUR shoulders to prove your innocense, not on her or HR's shoulders to attempt to prove your guilt. That's just how this shit works. It's not fair, it's not even reasonable, but it is what it is.

Further, the absence of photos in your picture gallery doesn't prove you never took a picture, it only proves that it's not readily visible there right now. Forensic analysis of your phone could provide exonerating evidence.

No offense, but you're probably not rich enough or well known enough for your employer to dig that deeply into the case - honest to God, I'm not breaking your balls, I'm just saying. People on the tier of famous athletes, or huge business magnates are rich/famous enough to have forensic examination of their devices done to sort out those kinds of accusations.If HR decies they like her story, there's nothing you can do. They may not fire you for this particular situation because they know they would open themselves up to a potential lawsuit, but they may fire you for some other reason, or present you with the ultimatum of resigning or being fired ""for cause"".

Even if HR drops the whole thing, unless they discipline the false accuser, you will face the stigma of this for the rest of your time at this company. That female who accused you will tell her bosses that she is uncomfortable working on projects with you, and they will tell your bosses, and the whole issue of keeping you two separated will be annoying. Meanwhile, that woman is telling other females her bullshit story, and they will say the same things to their bosses and so on and so forth.

So... best case for you is that they believe you, and discipline her and she leaves. Unless that happens, you probably need to get your resume out there.

I would complain that company policy mandates that HR harass you and investigate you when there is no evidence at all. 

When I say no evidence what I mean is the testimony given was the picture was taken of someone at work but all they saw was the back of a camera, they did not see the other side. They did not see the photo app up, they did not see him press the picture button. They couldn't if the camera was faced at them to take their picture.

All they have is someone holding a camera nearby and then putting it away.

So with conclusively no evidence HR then told him his job was at risk for doing something they have no evidence of. After that, they ignored my attempt to protect myself by providing actual evidence of the claimed event not happening.

It is the legal responsibility of the company to provide a safe and harassment-free workplace and that is going to be very difficult when HR is the one doing the harassment.

So while I agree with you that maybe this subreddit should be for strict activism, it is refreshing to you just express a very observable and widespread opinion (that women gossip heavily) without being called a woman hater. But of course there are always people like you to insinuate that we are XOXO

But one can also argue that it is a mens rights issue (although a small one) because it discusses gendered behaviour. When one gender performs an action it has a reaction on the other one. 

For example it used to be common place amongst men to use pretty aggressive language when talking to one another (""come on get that report done so we can do to the pub, you lazy shit""). Men do not mind and it is quite common. Of course this does not work well for  women in the workplace,who on average prefer more neutral language.

Similarly when women gossip and bully themselves but also form solidarity together in public effects the way men interact with them in teams. for example I had to sit through a painfully bad presentation presented by a female college in my team meeting, most of the team are female. When I or my other male team member showed any sign of constructive criticism we were shunned and all the female team members showered the presenter in compliments.

Maybe women, like men, need to adapt their most natural behaviour in the workplace in order to achieve a more functional team structure, or maybe i need to learn the ways of the queen bee and start validating and gossiping too. Who knows...

They failed, miserably. They almost immediately started fighting with each other, calling each other names, and gossiping about their teammates. They never got a shelter built, and they never found any food. By the end of the second day, the women's team was reduced to blubbering, crying, and complaining about how unfair and hard it was.

dy2bi22,t1_dy21bbx,2018-04-27 15:23:39,MensRights,"There are some interesting paradoxes at play.   

Take a small-to-medium sized group of men and set them to some task and you'll find a degree of cooperation second to none.   They will naturally organize themselves into hierarchies of ability* without the need to create leaders/rulers, and an honor system will develop.   If disputes arise they will be solved quickly, sometimes (though not usually) with physical violence, after which the competing parties will [make up](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).   

Take a group of women and set them to some task and you will find a long, drawn out attempt to establish consensus about the most trivial of matters, combined with a great deal of passive-aggressiveness, malicious gossiping and repeated cycles of emotional turmoil.   Conflicts often take the form of Machiavellian social violence.

But what happens when you put the two sexes together?  

In the case of men, competition dramatically increases.  In the case of women, *solidarity* dramatically increases.   So the exact opposite effects for either sex.   If one woman is harmed it is viewed as an attack on ""all women"", whereas if one man is harmed it is viewed as an attack only on that individual man.   

Whereas men band together to protect women (sometimes at the expense of female autonomy), women band together in solidarity *against* men, evidently for safety and protection.   This would seem to be a protective evolutionary mechanism that, with the feminist movement, has now become profoundly dangerous.   

*Hierarchies of ability are different than institutional hierarchies.   The former are meritocratic and do not require coercion; different people are better at different things, so it makes sense for people to have different specialities.   Institutional hierarchies are usually based on violence and coercion, though may also include meritocratic elements.",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,22,0,reddit4

If you're somebody who has been targeted by these sorts of groups in your lifetime, you'll see what I'm talking immediately.

If you see people who don't hang out with others or interact with other people there's usually a reason for it. Some people just want their own space which is totally fine, but particularly with larger societies it can end up with people self-segregating to the point that they don't even realise what the rest of the world thinks of them and have little knowledge of the outside world.

It's a collective label. It is a term that describes a group of people who share a similiar ideology.

They are grouped together because they are, in fact a group.

>There's no memo that goes out and there's no specific person calling the shots.

Then the group designation is meaningless. if all feminists are only individuals with no ""memo"" or central ideology then the label is completely useless and serves no purpose because it conveys no useful information about the person or group. 

In order for the word to have meaning there have to be distinctions and ways of measuring what is and is not a feminist. A term that can mean anything, means nothing.

This is a rhetorical scam called a motte and bailey doctrine which feminists will attempt to pull all of the time. They will claim that feminism is not a hivemind or has no teachings/dogma/central ideas/etc as a means of deflecting criticism for the bad things done by their group (we'll call this proposition A). Then they will turn around and make claims about how feminism fought for the vote for the women, or how feminism is all about equality, or feminists don't hate men, etc. (Proposition B).

Note that both of these claims are contradictory. If there are no central ideas or tenets of feminism and it is all just individuals then feminism cannot be credited with women getting the vote, nor can they say that feminists don't hate men or anything else.

The reason they do this is because if feminism is portrayed as a group of individuals then the ideology cannot be held to any standard and it gives them a way out for any responsibility for the things that they do. The downside to this however is that, as I mentioned, it renders the entire concept and authority of feminism useless and irrelevant.

Which is why they will quickly switch to the other side when they need to speak with authority. That however opens them up to being disproved and held to standards. Which is then they quickly retreat back into ""Feminism is just about equality"" or ""There are many different ways of being a feminist"".

It's the typical behaviour or any cult or religion when it gets called out on it's doctrines or dogmas and their effects.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV5JoFLnikg

>There is no vanguard feminist organization.

There is, however, a central ideology and core tenets adopted by nearly all feminists. There are mountains of feminists texts and scholarly work one can read. You can look at the most supported and vaunted feminists and see what they say, advocate for and think, you can look at the organizations.

You can look at all of feminism and see VERY clearly what their goal is and what their ideology stands for and represents.

Here is the thing, what the women did to you was definitely wrong but we live in the #metoo world now where a woman's word is taken as gospel no matter what.  I learned my lesson a long time ago when dealing with women in a corporate environment... I had to arm myself for the next encounter.  From then on whenever I was in a meeting with them I always recorded with video what was said (kept my phone in my shirt pocket) and saved the video.

Now 99% of the time conversations were good but the 1% that were not were career ending if I did not have proof of what was going on.  I had 2 encounters that if I did not show what actually happened I would have been canned, some other male co-workers did not have as good luck.  Is working with women wrong? Definitely not, but there is a reason rich and powerful men in public view companies no longer mentor women... or even have lunch with them 1 on 1.  Think about it.

I was sexually harrassed working at a dental mfg lab about 10 years ago. My immediate supervisor noticed I wasn't responding to any of her advances (she was already dating a guy who worked in the lab I might add) and after a year in that office I was fired.

My choice to involve a female lawyer who I met through a family member (one of his in-laws) was a mistake on my part I admit. But the male lawyer I met several years later for a different case said he would have taken that case in a second. ""I do female on male sexual harassment cases all the time, they're no different than usual"" he quipped.  

The female lawyer told me, after months of seldom returning my calls that it ""just wasn't a case my office would normally take"". So much for prompt honesty.

I'd have understood if she told me that from the get go but neglecting the case until I could no longer seek justice seemed despicable to me.

>There are no billionaires in the legislature you realize, but you'd have to really stretch to argue that this means they don't have power and only have ""Influence"". They control society through lobbying, and as the post notes, women have the second largest lobbying complex in the world devoted to their interests. This is the key part:  
>  
>Men do not have such a lobby. The interests lobbied for are stuff like war, oil, and so on. In the same way as we are oppressed by oligarchs abusing campaign finance and so on by those organizations forcing through their special interests at everyone elses expense, feminism oppresses men by forcing through womens interests at the expense of men.  
>  
>The trick you are pulling is to argue that because men fill the roles of ""Oil lobbyist"", that makes them balanced out with women holding the role of ""Lobbyist for women"", but that's simply not the case. The oil lobbyist cannot use the funds at their disposal to begin arguing for mens issues. They can use them to argue for the interests of the oil company, and that's pretty much it.  
>  
>I also think the actual sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists is largely irrelevant.

So. Men when they lobby act on behalf of their interest group, individuals of which are both men and women, at the expense of another group, individuals of which are both men and women. That is, men's lobbying isn't gendered. Women, however, can uniquely lobby in favour of women at the expense of men. That gives women, specifically, additional advocacy on their behalf. Thus, that's more power for them.

In other words it doesn't matter if the lobbyists for any given cause are all men so long as they represent the interests of a group that's comprised of both men and women at the expense of a group comprised of both men and women. Women aren't unrepresented nor are they uniquely targeted simply due to the lobbyists themselves being male. But men are most definitely not represented at all by feminist lobbying - in fact, the lobbying is done for the benefit of women at the expense of men. And men have no such male equivalent.

Anyway you're basically arguing from the perspective of what the lobbyists ultimately represent and how much power this ultimately affords each sex instead of the sex of the lobbyists themselves or the sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists. Your interlocutor in that thread almost exclusively focuses on the sex of the lobbyists and the sex of the politicians without really considering what they stand for, which I think is a myopic take.

I think Karen Straughan noted this behaviour is something paralleled in chimpanzees, too - males form coalitions to enforce the interests of their entire group onto out-groups. Females form coalitions to enforce the interests of females on the group. Males have no such ""male coalition"" for males.",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,3,0,reddit1

Yup, what you should have done (*for the future or in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation*) is the following:

* Document everything, record every conversation that you can, print out every email & keep a written daily record (get a journal with number pages that can’t be removed & each day write the date & list every event which happened that day - it is actually admissible in court as supporting evidence).

* At least once a week, but preferably daily or as frequently as the occur, bring the subject up to your manager & schedule a meeting with HR to review each of the transgressions that you have documented in your notebook.

* Write a written summary account of every meeting or conversion that you are in which relates to any of the following: Any incidents of harassment you have experienced, your attempts to report said harassment, the managers or HR persons response & especially any conversations about your performance of your job duties - then email it to your manager, their manager & the HR dept & BCC a copy to an email address that you control & the company can’t access (because they will end up locking you out of your email account).

* Avoid using any terminology that could be perceived as hostility, frustration, sarcasm - remember a judge is going to be reading every single document which you bring to court in support of your claim & any document the company can find which will make you look bad. You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.

The goal here is to be the annoying as fuck squeaky wheel & make it obvious that you are documenting **everything** (*just for clarity & to prevent any misunderstandings of course - don’t ever actually say that you plan or intend to sue them,* **again** *You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.*)

They **want** you to quit because they know how much harder it will be for you to get a lawyer to sue them if you quit.

So don’t let them win - make it a game of figuring out how much of a nuisance you can be (*innocently of course*) until the fire you.

Quite frankly, most companies will fire you not long after you start documenting everything - because their position in court can only get worse from there.

They are trying to harass you into quitting & the longer they let you document that fact, the bigger your settlement will be - so (*& I’ve witnessed legal counsel advise this exact thing*) it is better for them to trump up some bullshit reason for firing you than let you keep collecting more & more evidence of their wrongdoing.

- Yes, i'm office based. This isn't really a surprising thing, a huge amount of jobs are office based, including (based on interpretation and OPs history) his job in question. If it were manual work, it would be a different kettle of fish, as there are substantially less women in those areas.

- Studies do not generalise, this is misunderstanding how studies work, exactly the same way that most people misunderstand how statistics work. Actual scientific studies simply provide information, and a summary of information found. They are intended to inform you, not to tell you what to do. If a study finds that men are more likely to be in a car accident than women are (note, not an actual study, just pulling a scenario out of my head), it is not telling you that you should only be in cars where men drive, it's giving you the information so you can make an informed decision.

- Your lived in experience is a small sample size, as you yourself have stated. If you apply your lived in experience as a whole to an entire set of people, then you are applying a bias. Even if you have had prior experience with it, you are still applying a bias, and biases historically result in poor results. Apply your same bias to something like skin colour, and see how that works. ""Well i've worked with 3 black people in my life and they all worked less than me, so I refuse to work with black people now"". It doesn't sound good does it? It doesn't sound good because it's inherently incorrect. If instead you'd added in qualifying information, it becomes much less biased, and much more appropriate. ""X people who belong to Y location over the period of Z years have proven to me that {insert possible bias here}, I therefore aim to limit my interactions with X people, to reduce risk. I've also improved my ability to detect when people are {insert possible bias here}."". Qualifying information is incredibly key, and applying a bias, even if it's based only within your life and on your personal life experience, on a _single_ criteria is simply wrong.

- I have no idea what you're trying to say with attracting insane women 2 out of 3 times. I don't know where you've got the 3, I don't know how you're taking interpretation of data out of this, I pulled a scenario out of nowehere to show an example of incorrectly applied generalisation.

- Applying a generalisation is mostly applying a risk factor. I can take an example from my field, to simplify this matter. There are multiple published studies regarding working with third parties overseas, which explain the difference in working standards - particularly for indian overseas teams. I can use the information within this study to inform me that when i'm working with an indian offshore team, I need to have incredibly clear documentation, I need to ensure that anything I write has no assumptions in it, and no vernacular specific to my country, as this can introduce risk. This is not a generalisation, this is using the information within a study (and in some cases, from experience) to prevent risk, which is perfectly acceptable.

- You have not said that gender was your only data point, but in the context of the post, it was the only data point you provided.

- If you don't work well with female managers, there are two interpretations of this (without knowing any additional data points). Either there is something inherently wrong with the female gender, or there is somethign inherently wrong with you. If you provide additional data points (age, marital status, job description, role, location, company type, etc etc etc), then separate assessments can be made.


I do find it slightly funny that based on a very limited interaction, you determined that I need to work on interpretation, particularly because i'm in IT.

- I never said there weren't qualifiers. I'm saying that in the context of this post, the only qualifier provided was gender, which is not an accurate qualifier when left on it's own, it's a bias. You've then doubled down and stated ""the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualifed"", yada yada. This is actually a completely incorrect statement, there are no studies I can find that would suggest a woman is incapable of leading a group of engineers. There are less women in engineering, compared to men. You're more likely to find an incredibly competent man, because there are more qualified men. That does not mean that the vast majority of female managers are not experienced or qualified, just that there are less of them.

- Go and read the rest of the article that you copy pasted your generalisation definition from. In this case, you've copied it from a clinical study on hydrocephalus. In fact, the funny thing is, if you google generalisability, you'll find its application is prevalent for medical purposes - and much less so outside of anything medical related. There's a very good reason for that.

- I already agreed that you applied your lived in experience only to yourself, I also stated that you're therefore applying a bias.

- There is no cultural bias to address, because I have once again only provided an example to nail a point in, which is failing to get in for some reason. There is a large difference between applying a bias to a scenario vs applying a risk factor to a scenario.

- Applying a bias for your own safety is entirely incorrect. Take a racial one, as America seems to love racial things lately. You're more likely to be mugged by a black person than a white person - statistics confirm this. This does not mean that you should attribute the bias to all black people, because it fails to account for the _why_. And the why is simple - more black people in the US are in impoverished locations. Your bias therefore should not be against the race, it should be against a location. You're more likely to be mugged in Detroit than California, for example. And once more, i'll hammer this home in case it aims to derail - this is an EASY EXAMPLE TO GET A POINT ACROSS.

- Correct assertion that there are few qualifying bits of information about your future manager. But you yourself have said you've learned to identify that someone will be a poor manager due to decades of experience, so what are your qualifiers? So far, the _only_ qualifier you've ever provided is that they're female. What else?

- Again, regarding female gender as a whole, I will repeat again that this is within the context of your post. ""I will not work for female managers"" - the only qualifier you've provided is that they are female. If you like, I can add that a qualifier is that they're a manager, so now we're down to 3 commonalities: You, female gender and managers. So either you are the problem, the female gender is the problem, or managers are the problem.

Refusing to work for someone BAISED ON GENDER IS DISCRIMINATION BAISED ON GENDER and illegal.

You didn't say ""want"" you said ""refused"". Huge difference. The latter is illegal.

Your refusal to work for someone strictly based on sex is embarrassing.

Yet, you judge someone just on their sex? Sounds very feminist to me.

>Your personal bias, misinterpretation and gaslighting; ""imply that all female managers are terrible"", are extremely feminist.

Your refusal to work for a female manager implies the sexism here, what is even your argument?

""All aspects of employment"" I'll say it again. ""All aspects of employment."" The person you work for is an aspect of employment.

Fucking lol. Saying someone is wrong for sexism means I'm a bad manager.

The leaps in logic is astounding.

Also, truly, from the bottom of my non-exisitant heart, go find a hole to die in. I am fantastic at my job, and have been a great manager when I have the opportunity to do so. I led a project at my old job, and it was the only one to leave on time in my entire time working there. So, sorry, go fuck yourself.

Good question, how'd you know to ask?

The reasons I refuse to work for any manager are lack of:

- knowledge and/or training

- exposure/experience 

- ability 

- leadership

- managerial style

The reason I refuse to work for a female manager is that there are less than 1% of women in my field, of that less than 0.1% are trained managers.

Thus the likelihood of a women manager, in my discipline meeting all of the above requirements, is beyond slim.",Jakes1967,t2_4ddoqxml,1,0,reddit1

No, it isn't. You have a right not to work for anyone for any reason whatsoever.

You seriously think companies have a right to force people to work for them against the person's will because they deem that the person doesn't have a valid enough reason to not want to work for them? What?

> You didn't say ""want"" you said ""refused"". Huge difference. The latter is illegal.

Again, it isn't.

And as I explained, it's not based in sexism, although their gender is a prime factor, it's simply maths. 

Less than 1% of people in my field are female. Of that percentage, about 20% are managerially qualified. Keeping with averages, about 30% of them are good managers.

Thus during the interview, if the future manager is NOT engineering qualified, I give that role a skip. 

>Yet, you judge someone just on their sex?

Wrong, their sex is an indicator. 

>""All aspects of employment"" I'll say it again. ""All aspects of employment."" The person you work for is an aspect of employment.

>Fucking lol. Saying someone is wrong for sexism means I'm a bad manager.

Nope, you're a piss poor manager, as you assumed sexism, without any investigation 🙄

If you're irreplaceable after 2 weeks, it implies delusion on your part, or piss poor hiring practices on their part...🤣🤣

That's protecting EMPLOYEES, not EMPLOYERS.

Did you even read the links you post? It literally opens with:

""Sex discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee) unfavorably because of that person's sex.""

It even states that it applies to employers with 15 or more employees.

And the Canadian one literally states:

""to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.""

Applying only to employers.

You not wanting to work somewhere the CEO is man/woman white/black/asian/native-american/anything isn't illegal.

> Any aspect. Literally in the LAW. Sorry, you are wrong. In the letter of the law, you are INCORRECT.

Any aspect REGARDING AN EMPLOYEE, not an EMPLOYER. You think it's illegal for you to turn down a job? Lmao.

Yes, there is a hard legal case to win, and no employer is going to sue an potential employee for not taking a job. Still within the legal statements for them to do so.

>Since you're incompetent and can't read the law I'm sexist?

How to win an argument. Insults. That's how you know you're in the right!

Discrimination is illegal. Just as you have a right not to be discriminated against, they also have that right. It's called egalitarianism.

Yeah, read. Learn to fucking read, it literally states in all of those laws that they are protecting EMPLOYEES from EMPLOYERS, they do NOT protect EMPLOYERS from EMPLOYEES.

Here's some sources that make that ABUNDANTLY clear:

Oh and you'll notice the last two were the ones you provided, which don't back your statements at all, and instead explicitly define that illegal discrimination involves an employer discriminating against an employee (or prospective employee), not the other way around.

> Yes, there is a hard legal case to win, and no employer is going to sue an potential employee for not taking a job. Still within the legal statements for them to do so.

No, there isn't. There's absolutely NO legal basis. Employers have a legal requirement to not discriminate against employees, there's no legal requirement for prospective employees (or existing employees) to not discriminate against employers.

You can quit your job arguing that you don't want to work for a company owned by a white man (for example) and nobody can do absolutely anything, unless of course you violate your contract by not giving proper notice or whatever.

> How to win an argument. Insults. That's how you know you're in the right!

You're calling me sexist, an insult, based on you being incapable of interpreting the law, and now you whine about me calling you incompetent for using insults?

> Noone deserves to be discriminated against for something they cannot change. Noone. Ever.

Great. That still changes absolutely nothing, the law does not protect employers from discrimination. If you're hiring an assistant and you don't hire them because of characteristics they can't change, that's illegal. If you're hiring an assistant and the assistant doesn't want to work for you because of characteristics you have, tough luck, it's perfectly legal.

An employee can refuse a job offer (not to be confused with a service) for any reason they want.

You have not provided a single source stating otherwise, because guess what, there's no such law.",Okymyo,t2_euv84,3,0,reddit1

So most serial killers shouldn't be discriminated against ? Cause most serial killers are psychopaths and you are born a psychopath .  


Also why are you attracted to pretty people ?  You can't choose to be pretty you are born like that yet I'm sure you wouldn't date someone REALLY ugly.
