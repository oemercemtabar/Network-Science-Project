The list of titles is stipulated by the ABI (Association of British Insurers) who ""standardise"" a lot of how the industry works. Changed jobs a few times/couple of years since, so not sure if they've changed this now. But at least back then, Mx simply wasn't a title recognised by the industry. Even if things have changed since, the comparison websites have to take data that will ""map"" to individual insurers' systems, if ""Professor"" was an option GoCo offered on that list, it might not be able to sync up with insurers that don't have that option.

As for gender, insurance risk/price ratings can legally no longer discriminate from the sense of ""...are safer drivers"", but knowing someone's gender identity (at least per their Driving License) can help **a)** validate their license (your driving license number contains a binary-gender-based formatting - look up ""driving license number format"" to see) and **b)** if your car was reported being at-fault for an incident, the other driver can give a description of who they saw driving... which in the event of a spurious, inaccurate report the insurer can say ""well it can't be our policyholder driving, you said it was a male, we only have female drivers named insured for this vehicle"" (usually at the same time as giving other evidence such as witness statements, till receipts from 120 miles away minutes before the supposed accident, lack of corresponding damage on your car etc).

Young men disproportionately total cars at a rate young women don‚Äôt even compare to. Accidents that total cars are very expensive for insurance companies. You could bump into a Ferrari and it may cost ur insurance200k but dangerous accidents lead to serious injury and crippling someone can cost your insurance millions.

He started by declaring 3 classes, ""Person"", ""Man"", and ""Woman"" (which was already problematic) and had ""Man"" and ""Woman"" inherit (derive traits from) the ""Person"" class.

He defined the ""Person"" class which had accessor pure virtual functions (pure virtual functions are not defined in the class that declares their existence) for last name and spouse, and member variables for first name, mother, and father. Mother was a pointer to an object of the ""Woman"" class, and father was a pointer to an object of the ""Man"" class.

Even more problematic since it assumes everyone has exactly zero or one each of mothers and fathers, plus it's super odd that first name is a variable but last name is a only a function. The variables also had accessor functions but last name and spouse didn't have variables.

Then he made a ""Man"" class and gave it a last name variable and defined the last name accessor to return that, which makes sense but why wasn't that in the ""Person"" class. Then he gave it a wife variable which was a pointer to an object of the woman class, which was problematic again, and had the spouse accessor function return the wife variable.

Next he defined the ""Woman"" class and gave it a husband variable and made the spouse accessor function return it. Then in the most infuriating and denigrating misogyny yet, he defined the last name accessor to return the husband's last name if the husband variable points to an actual object and if not return the father's last name

He didn't even allow us the dignity of having our own last names, keeping our maiden names, or inheriting our mother's last names.

I lost all respect I had for him with that one lesson, both as a computer scientist who knows how to design for a domain, which he clearly didn't, and as a decent human being, which he clearly wasn't.",ArcaneOverride,t2_2oy1apz1,8,0,reddit3

 The difference in premiums charged to men and women varies by insurer and by age. Women from age 16 to 24 pay around $500 less per year for car insurance compared to men. Auto insurers tend to charge women that are 55 and older less than men.

ka9tk9m,t1_ka800t2,2023-11-22 07:16:04,lgbt,"Hm. Not a Norwegian or a Swede, but I am Danish, and in Denmark at least you'd still use last names to distinguish people with the same first name. Celebrities or sports people are therefore often known by their first and last name. But if you're talking about just the members of a specific football team you probably wouldn't bother to include their last name a lot of the time. I don't think anyone in the US would call Wayne Gretsky, ""Mr Gretsky"" either.  Probably would just come up with a nickname for him. So Wayne Gretsky is just Gretsky, but Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, is just Zlatan.

Sorry if I'm over explaining, the very simple concept of how names usually work, but like people like to make bold claims like ""I've never used someone's last name in Sweden"" and just completely misrepresent how their culture actually works.

Now, I'm sure what they actually mean is that in casual conversation about or to regular people you'd refer to them by their first name. I'm sure Americans would call Karen from the office by her first name. But I'm not sure if that extends to Bill, your boss, or Hank, your doctor. Or if you're Hank whether it extends to Jim, your patient. We see AA lot of films in politics where in slightly more formal settings like that they tend to use ""Mr Anderson"" or whatever.

""You'll always have that Y chromosome, you'll never REALLY be a girl""

I know I'm not a cis girl. That does not mean I am not one. A Y chromosome does not make me any less of a woman. My genitalia doesn't matter, I am a girl mentally, and our brains are what houses our identities, therefore I am a girl.

""Your voice is so deep though, aren't you proud of that?"" 

If I wanted to be a bass singer, maybe I would be. However, my voice is something that gives me constant dysphoria, and I do not like it. No amount of ""just accept yourself"" is going to make me change my mind on that. I would rather have a more feminine voice, so that is what I'm going to work on.

""Wow, you're really a waste of a man""

I know. These genitals and vocal cords don't belong to me, they are a curse. I really would've been a lot happier if I was born without that Y chromosome.

I get a lot revolving around even the slightest hint of femininity, like I get told I shouldn't shave. Everytime it'll start off with something like:

""But it'll be a pain too maintain""

I'll acknowledge this and state how I'd control it, and learn how to shave, I then go on about how swimmers, bodybuilders, athletes and other professions require shaving without hinting towards my absolutely gigantic femininity. I'll then be met with:

""But men don't shave!""

Then the conversation will end.

Another thing I hate is that I'm not allowed platonic friendships with girls. As if it's completely impossible to be friends with the opposite gender. Like everytime I bring up a female friend I will get met with stares and questioning about every little detail. Calm down people, i'm gay as fuck! (I don't actually say this, I am still so far in the closet that I practically rule Narnia but my point stands). I guarantee nothing is going on between us!

You know what else I hate?

Gender roles. Fuck 'Em! I absolutely despise gender roles. If I could be kitted out in the most feminine attire possible without fear of repercussion I would do it in a heartbeat. And I would enjoy every. Last. Fucking. Zeptosecond!

New headline: Fuck gender roles, let's have cake rolls instead! 

What even are gender roles anyway! I'll tell you what they are. Criminal that's exactly what they are! But most importantly: public enemy Number One!

Goddamn, if only people knew I absolutely fucking LOVE being feminine and knew how extremely gay I was then maybe some of this would stop. But I doubt it.

It's really when you look back on all this you realise how fucking sexist it is! It's a disgrace! What's so bad about femininity to the point where guys can't even be slightly effeminate. I sure as hell prefer it over being toxicly (is that a word?) masculine. Don't get me wrong masculinity is perfectly fine, hell I'm sometimes a tad masculine myself. But it's that kind of bro culture, or as we call lad culture in the UK that really annoys me. The constant one upping each other, and the degradation and the hypocrisy of ""body counts"". Guy sleeps with like a dozen women and he's a god but a woman sleeps with one other person and people shame them for it. Also don't even get me started on the goddamn hymen check bullshit, the hymen can get torn by fucking exercising! I'm not even a woman myself and I see the stupidity of it, I just wish others would too.

Me: you really need to do something about all those homphobes and transphobes on that discord.

Them : oh, i want to do somrthing, but all the other mods are against it.

(The stuff said on that discord was along the lines of ""Gay pride is just marketing"", ""gays are fucking annoying for shoving their sexuality in everyone's face during pride"", ""i identify as a helicopter"" and ""why shoul i respect anyone's pronouns?"")

The conversation with my ""friend"" continued for a while, as i tried to explain to them why they needed to ban certain people in that community. In the end, i gave un and left that discord and mostly stopped talking to that person.

A few months later :

Them : oh hey, btw, i fixed the homophobic issue on that discord, so you can come back.

Me, not intending to come back : oh yeah ? Did you ban X and Y who were the main offenders ?

Them : no, but one of tge other mods has come out as non-binary.

Me: so you're gonna kick out the homophobes or ... ?

Them : no, they aren't saying anything as extreme anymore.

(I have screenshots of the following, if anyone wants proof of how idiotic straight people can be)

Me : I have an analogy ""OH look, there's this thief, who  we know stole a bunch of stuff because we have CCTV. But let's not put him to jail because he hasn't stolen anything recently""

Them : you wouldn't punish someone the same way for something they'd stolen 40 years ago as you would if they did it today. plus it avoids a lot of drama.

‚Äúif you want to continue to stay on epilim, then you must be on birth control, because you can become pregnant‚Äù

‚Äúi won‚Äôt become pregnant, so i don‚Äôt need it‚Äù

‚Äúdo you want your mum to leave the room so you can talk to me properly?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i‚Äôm telling you, i will not get pregnant‚Äù

‚Äúwell i can‚Äôt trust you‚Äù

‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôre too young‚Äù

exfuckingcuse me? so i‚Äôm old enough to have sex but not be honest???? 

i *still* deal with that shit. like, sir, i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôm asexual. i‚Äôm an adult now, and my sexuality is the exact same, because it doesn‚Äôt fucking change.

They *know* the ignorant and hurtful comments and invasive questions that will come their way as a result of this change. 

But our culture (at least here in the US) is far too rigid about these kinds of things in the first place. If people had that grace and flexibility to try labels, then they‚Äôd be a lot less likely to pigeonhole themselves and feel stuck in the first place. 

I also think it comes from parents fearing that their kid won‚Äôt be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Like they comfort themselves by telling themselves that this is just a manifestation of teen rebellion, etc. so they hold onto hope that their kid will turn out ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in the end, and ultimately, their narrow worldview will be justified.",ariesangel0329,t2_atmpl,2,0,reddit4

I know what you're getting at but I don't really think that this was phrased very well. Like for a lot of people it really is. Just as he thinks sex is always necessary for a healthy relationship, the wording here suggests you think the opposite, that it isn't important for a healthy relationship at all. Neither of these are accurate. Generalizations about people like that don't work because everyone has different preferences, needs, and standards. If your ex said that sex is necessary for any romantic relationship to be healthy then he's wrong, but if he had said ""sex is necessary for my own health"" then that's a different story.

Pansexual means being attracted to people regardless of their gender. Also known as gender blind.

Bisexuals I've met feel different type of attraction towards each gender. Like ""woah that man is so manly and that's attractive"" and ""damn that lady is so pretty and that's attractive"" or ""that androgenous person is so alluring and that's attractive"" 

Meanwhile pan is more like ""hot is hot"". Like gender is not really important if they have hazel eyes and can tell jokes.

hq5k6na,t1_hq4iium,2021-12-27 15:19:37,lgbt,"I guess that's subjective. Long enough to regret it ü§∑ But probably when you stop being young and start being more generally closed-minded and experience-based. I'd regret not having been myself freely in my youth, have experimented and so on. Of course, it's never too late. But some things you haven't done in your youth you won't do them later in life. Society treats you differently; your cognition works differently. Also, you tend to be less sexy and horny, which can close doors.

In my case I've mostly have had heterosexual sex and no one could tell I am bisexual. They aren't surprised if I say so, tho. But having fucked other men at a young age has made me understand things very differently. Like the concept of masculinity and such. I am so much less of a moron in this universe than in the parallel one in which I hadn't had the courage to do what I know I like. So my approach towards LGBTQ is different and more healthy. Also, my perspective has helped others to understand some staff, so I've contributed to make the world better.

 Whenever I get old enough to be more closed-minded and experience-based, well, my experiences will be the ones of someone queer who has actively tried to understand and meet other queer people. Not the experience of someone afraid of himself and people alike. Huge difference, I gather.

I don't expect everyone's needs to be like mine nor every one's needs to be like his, we are all different. I know there plenty of people who think sex is an important part of a relationship,but the issue arises when they make it the biggest part of the relationship,like my ex did. However he certainly expected me to adjust my needs to match his, no thought at all to maybe meeting me half way there, cause he wanted his needs met, including periodically pestering me for blowjobs knowing I have TMJ and it hurts my jaw to do them. He has waaaay to much emphasis placed on sex in the relationship, in his mind a relationship cannot exsist with out sex and it has to be regular consistent sex several days a week too. He expected me to ""fix"" myself so I matched his sex drive cause in his mind mine was lower than his so there was obvi something wrong with me.

I'll wear the one or ones I want people to use.

For example if I'm feeling fully fem I'll wear the purple one on its own expecting people to use my fem name and she/her but sometimes I'm only feeling partly fem so I'll wear the purple and the green one with the expectation that people will use my fem name but use she/they",Reallycre8tivename,t2_amghq2ph,3,0,reddit4

Mentally sure it gives you endorphins and all that and makes you feel happy and good,but it is not a necessity for ones healthy well being.

Anyone's? That is a *bold* claim. I'm not saying it has some special physical affect that other exercise doesn't, but for people that aren't on the ace spectrum it can be very important for our mental health. And it goes without saying that mental health is key to overall health.

>I don't expect everyone's needs to be like mine nor every one's needs to be like his, we are all different.

But you just stated that sex isn't important for anyone's healthy wellbeing. You generalized your own needs and health to represent that of everyone else, and that's precisely the problem.",altmetalkid,t2_sgjzj,1,0,reddit4

ifntohr,t3_vvnx1t,2022-07-11 00:18:25,lgbt,"I think a lot of this comes from people forgetting what this community is about.  

The first purpose of this community is to stand up against discrimination and fight for equality and normalization.

But the second, and potentially even more important purpose is for self discovery. To be able to understand our feelings, understanding that we're not alone, and that we're not broken because of it.  We have labels such as gay or bisexual or trans in order to help us express how we feel.  It's about discovering who we are, and then using that information to go out into the world and live our fullest lives.

We're all valid.  Whether you're gay or lesbian or bi or pan or ace or straight somewhere in-between or somewhere completely different, that's okay, and you're valid for that.  Sometimes I feel like there's a competition for who can be the most gay and the more gay you are the more valid you are, or vice versa. 

As a member of the ace community, there's always been a tension between sex repulsed, sex positive, and sex neutral aces.  And it is important to discuss the differences in experience throughout the ace spectrum, but sometimes people start talking about how sex positive aces aren't valid or that they aren't true asexuals and vice versa, and for what?  They're both valid and important parts of the ace community.  It's healthy to have discussion, but we can't let that discussion turn into attacks against each other.

And i know that these types of disagreements or conflicts exist throughout the entire queer community, it's good to discuss these things.  But when these discussions start invalidating and hurting each other, I think it's because we've lost site on what this is all about.  It's about understanding ourselves and helping other understand themselves and helping everyone grow and blossom into their greatest self.

I hope I didn't ramble to much and this makes sense.  And maybe this is obvious and everyone already knows this, but I think sometimes it's important to be reminded of the obvious and I hope we can all remember to love each other.",TrainBoy45,t2_5fv6x55d,3,0,reddit1

I hate in generell that there's so much hate in the community, we already get so much hate from outside and we all know how it feels to be invalited so why are we doing it to each other?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even tho I'm not bi I also experienced similar things multiple times. About a year ago I used to identify as a microlabel, abrosexual, and constantly got told by other queer people that ppl like me, who use microlabels, are the reason why ppl hate queer ppl because we're making things unnecessary complicated and it's not real. And in generell so many people are so hateful towards people who use microlabels and I don't understand why. They aren't hurting anyone, let them exist.

Now I don't label my sexuality anymore because being unlabeled makes me feel more comfortable and free, if that makes any sense. Now I get told to just pick a label; that I am just bi or pan bc I'd date any gender; that I am straight and just want attention; that I'm not part of the community bc I need a label to be; that i am just questioning; etc.  
And because some unlabeled people (included me) like to use the flag we made we get told by labeled queer people that we're turning unlabeled into a label and that having a flag defeats the purpose of being unlabeled. Like no we also just want to have a pretty flag we can put in our profile pictures or in our rooms to show who we are and to show us that there's a community of people who feel the same way and that we're not alone, why can't we??",,,2,0,reddit1

There is a tendancy, unfortunately, for humans in general, to think their own special little group is better than all others. And it needs to stop.

My personal example would be my ex-friend who was sapiensexual (he didn't care about people's looks at all, only the contents of their minds). Meanwhile, I identify as bisexual/pansexual (I don't care about what's in a person's pants, or what their gender identity is, but I do care about looks to some degree). He was convinced being sapiensexual made him ""superior"" (a lot of things made him feel superior, not just that).

Like, bitch, I think it's cool that you don't care about looks at all. I respect the shit out of that. Why then can you not respect that looks do matter to me? You're you, and I'm me, and there's no ""morally superior"" configuration of brainwaves making up our minds. By his logic, I'd have to say I'm twice as better than straight people and gay people because the pool of people I can be attract to is twice as vast. It don't work that way, you judgemental ass.

Worse, he tried to push onto me the narrative that because looks matter to me at all, that meant I was super shallow and looks are all that matter to me. And I tried to explain that no, he was wrong, to me it's about 60% personality and 40% looks. But he wouldn't listen, and kept saying he knew me better than I knew myself (a repeating pattern throughout our friendship). He just never listened to anyone but himself. And even if was shallow, which I'm not, so what?

Sorry for the novel, guess I needed to vent üòÖ Suffice to say he's not my friend anymore, and I choose my friends more carefully now. The lesson of my story: please don't judge. Everyone is different, and that's okay.",Embarrassed_Read_979,t2_93r41quy,1,0,reddit1

As a white hetero cis man, my gender, my sexuality, my skin color, all of that and more is shown everywhere, all the time, so I don't need to be represented in another special way. I'm also privileged with basically ""all the rights you can have"" if that makes sense, so no reason for me personally to fight for something regarding myself.

Also, even tho there isn't a letter for it, I would still think that as an ally, which should be the logical default, you are semi-part of LGBTQAI+.

I also know that this whole community/movement is not about taking something from me, but giving something to others that doesn't affect me in any negative way, so I can't see any discrimination against myself.

A last thing to add is, sometimes it's not even a bad thing if a heterosexual cis person is feeling discrimanited a little, because then we can at least assume a little how most of you people must feel. I remember feeling like an outsider on my first queer party.

They created specialised communities, resources, and facilities to meet these needs and protect themselves. These resources are useless for cishet people because society already caters for them, therefore limiting them from accessing these resources isnt discrimination.

Safe cishet sex is already taught in schools. But what about safe binding? Tucking? How to use a dental dam? AIDS prevention and treatment? cishets have almost no use for these resources so it doesnt make sense to include them in online communities made to share this information.

Gay bars provide safety from hate crimes and microagressions. Do cishets benefit from this? Are they at risk of being bashed for chatting up the wrong person? Do they have to endure incessant questions about their junk? No, they can go to any bar without worring about that. These facilities solve problems that cishets dont have.

It's not true. Some asexuals do, but asexuality means not feeling (or really feeling) sexual desire towards other people (basically not getting aroused by other people). There are many types of asexuality and it doesn't mean just hatred for sex, masturbation etc. As someone sexual myself I feel insulted every time I hear that.

Like all the facts are there but they would prefer to just have schools hide it away rather than just be honest and give kids a safer environment to learn who they are. I had this argument with my mom after a (not surprising) disgusting Prager U ad played over a YT video (freaking One Topic mind you!) I was watching. Was open to my family and then that wretched conversation which had another piece I hate.

""It is their right to believe in what they want (not talking religion here) and raise their kids how they want"" in accordance to talking about LGBTQ+ discrimination (again about that same PU ad). I mentioned that hate and fear mongering slander shouldn't be broadcasted on TV or streaming services and marketing themselves as educational ('cause we should know that Prager definitely is not). But that caused a rift between me and the last of my blood family who ""cared"".

And finally, ""I won't call you by (preferred name) or (preferred pronouns) because you are my (gendered child) and I would be a HYPOCRITE to act as it I had a (other child gender)"". Like... Why does whether or not I have a penis or vagina fucking dictate how you treat me as YOUR CHILD?! I did not ASK for this gender and I do not want that. You should care about what makes me happy with MY body and MY life and just remember that you had a CHILD. Like shit, I hate this last one so much. And then the SPRINKLED on comment that even my extended family don't need to respect me via proper gender and preferred name and saying they can call me WHAT THEY WANT. Like BITCH I am an ADULT you cannot govern me like this and you are a shitty parent for doing it before. Seriously, I believe in letting kids explore and discover who they are and not make it your own or everyone else's business in what they got between their legs. If ""Becca"" likes GI Joes and wearing camo and wants to be Benjamin then let them explore that, damn it. That may be YOUR CHILD, but that is THEIR BODY for the REST OF THEIR LIVES. They should be free to do what they damn well please with it. Shit! If I adopt a child that feels they are a Samantha and as an adult wants BIG boobs then my only two cents would be hoping she is smart and responsible about it and puts her health first because that is all I want for any CHILD OF MINE.

to things, beings, or concepts,

nominalgenders , scenes, nonhuman, noun/archetypes and neurotypes
 
Some xenogenders seem similar but the definition is what changes it like bungender and
bunnygender, bungender is related to the characteristics of a bunny, bunnygender is related
to the bunny itself
 
In shorten words,
 
xenogenders are just a way to describe gender outside male/female/ether/both.

Then you're totally a lesbian. Not that you needed me to agree or affirm that, just saying. Lesbians can even, controversial as some people think this is, have sex with cis men and STILL be lesbians.

*Technically* speaking I'm pan, but bisexual hasn't been about a gender binary for longer than I've been alive at least, and it just FEELS more right to say bi, so I use that. A sexuality that technically applies NEVER supersedes someone's chosen label.

>I totally understand not computing it though, I can't truly process being attracted to men, even though many people obviously (and rightfully) are.

* I do not want to know your anecdote.

So, you have a story about your own job search, or your own employer. I don't want to know. Individual experiences are very different. That's why we have overall statistics. I have deleted more than 20 anecdotes already.

* Remember Rule II.

If you want to make some long-and-complicated claim then you must provide a cite for it.

* Multiple jobs are irrelevant.

Lots of people claim that employment is high because lots of people are working multiple jobs. This is not true. The BLS do not double-count. If you work two jobs you are counted as one worker.

* Are the statistics faked?

If you want to claim that the stats are faked then you must follow rule II and give evidence!",RobThorpe,t2_gj75p,1,0,reddit2

The US labor force is like ~167 million people, so even with a <4% unemployment rate -- which is around the historical low -- the number of people actively looking for work who can't find it will be in the millions.

If you drill down to people unemployed for more than 27 weeks that's still going to be around 1.1 million people, even though as a percentage they're pretty small.

The BLS' *Employment situation* for September 2023 ‚Äì [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) ‚Äì says:

* men between the ages of 20 and 24 have an unemployment rate of 8.4 per cent (for comparison for men 25 years and older that is 3.3 pc and for women aged 20‚Äì24 that is 5.7 pc);
* within persons above the age of 25, high school graduates have seasonally adjusted unemployment at 4.1 pc while for college graduates this is 2.1 pc.

If one were to combine those two statistics, I would expect they wouldn't be uniformly distributed either.

A couple of things to keep in mind:

1) The US is large and moving from an area of low unemployment to high unemployment to find a job with a certain skillset can be difficult if not impossible if you're living paycheck to paycheck.  

2) Not all job skill translate *or* many employers *feel* not all skills translate across professions or industries.  Employers need someone who can come in and start being productive immediately, not 6 months down the road. 

3) It depends on what jobs are in demand and have low occupancy rate.  A factory worker that's out of work can't immediately start working in an IT job at a computer help desk as they don't have the skills to effectively communicate with customers on a phone, navigate potential issues in the operating system or troubleshoot issues without having the exact steps needed to follow.  Even then, the employee would be much less productive than their peers until months down the road with some experience.   

&#x200B;

That's just a few reasons I can think of.  It's not great, but unfortunately there's not a collective  force between states to work together to allow areas with high unemployment with certain skill sets to influence businesses to expand there or re-locate where the labor is.  As well even cities and the state governments have issues as each city is trying to act solely in their own interest to expand and get more jobs regardless of the amount of available labor they have.",KC_experience,t2_iir2q,2,0,reddit2

With all of the retirements, a lot of ‚Äútribal knowledge‚Äù is about to disappear. That‚Äôs a huge hit to productivity. There‚Äôs another issue, however.

Low pay, cost of tools, productivity expectations, health hazards and knowledge deficits vs knowledge expectations can all be barriers for entry or longevity.

Sure the bottom 80% of the population saw NOMINAL growth...while inflation increased dramatically during the same time frame.

I merely provided my anecdotal experience, but it's interesting to note that a majority of Americans agree with my pessimism about the economy. Which has sprouted a multitude of articles with titles like ""If the economic statistics are good, why do Americans feel so bad?"" 

&#x200B;

Is it possible that a majority of people are just flat wrong about their own life situations. I mean, it's possible... but a lot of other possibilities seems more likely.

I'm sure the economy is great...the greatest it's ever been. That's probably why household debt is at a record high while personal savings rates are at record lows (rivaled only by early 2000s financial recession and mid-2000s GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS)

These are both nominal variables of course CPI is record high; the Fed targets a positive rate of inflation. The important part is the \*real\* wages and incomes are at or near all time highs. Same thing with your debt variables you link later, you need to adjust them for inflation.

The household income is also partly because households got smaller post-COVID, If you look at **rereal** median personal income you'll see that the 2022 numbers are about 1% lower than the all time high in 2019, if that's your definition for ""the economy is collapsing"" then sure, you got me.

Nobody said the economy is collapsing. I said people's purchasing power had decreased.

&#x200B;

My point is that CPI and inflation are seemingly disconnected with the cost of living for the majority of people. 

&#x200B;

Hence, the flat looking lines for the bottom 60%, moderate growth for the 2nd quintile, and meaningful growth for only the top quintile.

>They won't no matter how far they escalate - China-US trade is grossly overstated. Exports in either direction are less than 2% of either country's GDP, so even a total suspension of trade won't cripple either side. In practice, decoupling had already happened in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when exports to the US as a percent of China's GDP collapsed. It's no surprise that this trade war charade has outlived Trump - because of how limited trade is versus how important the public on both sides thinks it is, it's a very inexpensive way for politicians on both sides to gain approval points.

Isn't business exiting from China **the** main component of decoupling? So whether companies decide to move out of China, continue to remain in China, or move into China, is the key criteria for determining whether decoupling is successful or not.

The Japanese government subsidy is about 500 million.

It encourages deprioritizing long term gain and protective strategies to achieve consecutive short term advantage on a per-quarter basis; the least resilient outcompete the more resilient over each consecutive short term period until that resilience is tested - by disruptions, such as a pandemic - at which point the disadvantage of resiliency in non-disrupted environments ensures an insufficient level of market share/economic activity remains with resilient actors to prevent the disruption from collapsing the entire system (absent outside assistance to the non-resilient, further encouraging the dismantling of resiliency strategies and making future disruption more and more dangerous).

igl2y69,t3_w13ljl,2022-07-18 00:47:27,Economics,"Biggest problems with the global economy as I see them:

* Lack of affordable housing in North America. This disincentivizes immigration and strangles the economic potential of the most prosperous continent of the last century. As this market is so huge and real estate is such a large part of this market, this in turn acts as a brake on the potential of the top end of the global economy. A brake which when tapped in 2007 caused the Euro to all but fail and the global financial markets to collapse.
* Lack of regulation of financial markets, especially where they straddle borders. Money moves faster than regulation, and in recent years it has evacuated increasingly via loopholes & tax havens into the richest individuals. This wealth inequality further acts as a brake on the global economy, as the uber-wealthy are rarely willing to invest in the high risk endevours & strategic spending that tends to benefit society the most in the long run (Elon Musk & Bill Gates are notable exceptions to this rule, but even then they can only spend their money so fast and it would likely benefit more people directly if most of that wealth was spent by the government).
* Demographic collapse in East Asia, especially in China & South Korea. Japan has been struggling with this for a while, and the net effect we‚Äôve seen has been a lack of innovation and a slowing of the appearance of novel businesses. Additionally the demographic imbalance tends to be a self-feeding problem if social spending is not geared towards children, as people are forced to pay a premium to have children since so much of the potential socialized wealth is absorbed by white hairs.

* The steady rise of the global price of wheat. Wheat is the most important calorie crop globally, accounting for most of the international market in calories. As this price rises, the poorer & already cash starved nations in Pan-Arabia & central Africa are going to grow increasingly unstable. These regions are important sources of many natural resources, so instability here will have a very immediate effect on other markets. This is of course not anywhere as important as the human cost, with literally millions of people facing famine in the next 3-5 years at the latest if something does not budge with the global wheat market (Russia has to let Ukraine‚Äôs grain ships go).
* The immediate effects of global warming. Rising salinity in water tables, acceleration of the water cycle with longer drought periods, and the expansion of deserts are the most immediate impacts of global warming, and have already had a very real global economic impact.

Tax the working to support the retired.

The plan was *never* to be a government savings account where you pay into it throughout your career, and the government holds your money then supports you in old age. I offer as evidence the fact that payments to retirees began in the same year that the program and its associated payroll tax was implemented.  The ""trust fund"" was a demographic accident. Now that pile is eroding.  

The biggest always true and not terribly significant twist to that is that the excess ""trust fund"" (misleading name) was invested in US Treasuries. This is what people mean when they say it has been raided, but it really just meant it earned some interest.

Soon we will reach a point where we have to reduce payments to correspond with current payroll tax revenues, or increase the payroll tax rate.

igixv5r,t1_igijps9,2022-07-17 15:16:29,Economics,"The government is able to borrow against the social security trust fund (the $3T pile of cash that is what we colloquially refer to as social security). That money is borrowed as government bonds and we routinely pay back the interest on it. When the bonds expire that lump sum of money is given back that was borrowed the same as most bonds.

Im sure there are more, but there are multiple major problems I know of with social security that aren‚Äôt being addressed:

1) the number of people receiving money vs the number of people paying in has gotten worse over time. This mainly just exacerbates the problem as these people live longer and longer.

2) Spouses who didn‚Äôt put money into the system (or not enough to qualify for benefits) can collect benefits off of their working partner. See spousal benefits.

3) Wages for the majority have stagnated for decades which means that the 6.2% you put in isn‚Äôt keeping up with the benefits which get COLAs due to inflation.

4) the money borrowed from the trust fund can only be invested in government bonds which more or less only helps to fend off inflation (on average) with hopefully a very small real gain. Social security is essentially a poorly constructed annuity with massive longevity issues.

The remedies to the problem (assuming we want to keep SS) are:

1) Increase the cap on taxable wages. Essentially we only tax the first $147,000 dollars for social security (as well as the employer contribution). Maintaining the cap on the benefit while collecting this additional tax does mitigate a size-able portion of the problem, but it in no way solves it. Only implementing this is kicking the can.

2) Raise the tax rate from 6.2% in order to sustain the current benefits.

3) I don‚Äôt believe stock options are taxed for FICA (I very well could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think mine were taxed when I invoked them), but I believe this would also have a sizable impact.

4) raise the FRA (full retirement age) significantly to reflect peoples increased longevity.

5) stop COLAs or significantly raise the minimum wage. This will help to mitigate stagnant wages and the affect of them I mentioned previously. This may very well have other unintended consequences of the system and our overall economy.

6) Increase the employers portion for major corporations. This is one solution which will take money from these ‚Äúgreedy companies‚Äù though they will likely just raise prices or flatten wages at the bottom to compensate. (I don‚Äôt support this, but it‚Äôs a possible solution)

Disclaimer: All this being said I am a very big supporter of eliminating social security. I think the people would be significantly better off allowing that money to be invested in something reasonable like a 50/50 index/bond portfolio. There is a reason that pension plans have fallen by the way side and 401(k) and similar plans have dominated;because they‚Äôre more efficient and cheaper to operate.

I do recognize that a significant portion of the population has absolutely no financial literacy and giving them access to potentially millions of dollars on a particular date would not be good for their retirement because they can‚Äôt manage their money properly , but I consider that a form of natural selection. If they‚Äôve lived that long they should no better and if they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs on them.

Sorry to get political. Hope that helps.

Edit: I forgot means testing a method of reducing be if it‚Äôs to those who actually have assets. It‚Äôs been discussed before.

Not an expert in their immigration law. 

AFAIK, EU nationals have the right to live there. Just a matter of renting an apartment. And people with EU permanent residence papers can have a work permit for monaco. My fiancee got one by presenting her French papers and waiting for 3 weeks.  

Unfortunately for her, Monaco has a treaty with France about reporting on French citizens and residents working or storing funds in the principality. Many people acquire Belgian or Italian or other EU citizenship for that reason (Many French people in the r√©gion are of italian ancestry and many qualify for italian citizenship based on that).

The truth is, raising children is hard, often thankless work, and involves huge sacrifices. This is true even in the most supportive of environments.

And ultimately, when given the choice, people are increasingly deciding that it's just not worth it.

And that's for people living in situations/places where social support systems are well established. The tradeoff only becomes even worse for women in societies that don't adequately support children and families.

Kids used to be labor for the family. They were a net-positive economic contribution to the parents income statement, starting at an early age and increasing with the years. Then we started moving to the cities and changed the rules - and the economics.

Now, and with the best intentions, we use urban-centric regulations that restrict the work children are allowed to do, we price them out of the labor market with artificial wage controls and we monopolize the vast majority of their time for the decades between 5 and ~~15~~ 25.

Further down the line, in a modern tragedy of the commons, we have shifted responsibility for care of seniors from the family to the larger collective, further diminishing the value to the family of having children.

Thus, children are no longer the future in the urbanized West. With children representing an increasing economic drag on their parents it's no wonder that so many young adults are making the entirely rational decision to forego the expense of having them. Instead, children have become  expensive entertainment and socio-economic status symbols and that ain't enough incentive to perpetuate the species.

Point of fact: women that do have kids are having the same amount they've been having for decades. The reason the overall reproductive rates have crashed is because of the explosion of childless women which was about 10% in 1970 and at least in the US is just over 50%.

This guy gets into the weeds with the historical trend and economics:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwIeDuHwXJY

Economics - People can barely afford to live, how are they supposed to start a family? The average age of first time home ownership has gone from mid-20s to ~46! If women want to have a traditional family and be provided for, then they're going to have to do so with men MUCH older as the guys their age are struggling economically more now than ever. And the data bears this out. Bumble is calling 2024 the year of the (large) age gap relationship.

Education and getting their bag - Many modern women have been mistakenly convinced to focus on getting their degree and starting a career before having their family. This frequently causes the hypergamy success paradox where the higher up the socioeconomic ladder women climb, the fewer suitable men there are to date (up to), and is a major component why half of childless women are NOT childless by choice as they ""stayed in the casino too long"". 

In the end a ton of women squander their fertility window for 10-15 years of fun, education, and career, and it's not until the wall approaches as their fertility begins to wane they decide to settle down and pencil in a husband and kids. Often to find the men they want are already married or otherwise unavailable. 

This is why my advice for women who know early on they want to have a family, to do so young when they're 18-23 in your physical prime. You'll never have a better opportunity to attract a man and your body will bounce back after birth far easier in your prime. After you have the kids and they're off to school, THEN go get that degree and start a career. You'll be much more attractive to employers when they know you're not going to disappear on them to *start* a family as you're already established.",rpujoe,t2_ung2sof2,2,0,reddit1

In the middle East, it's not as bad as Europe and Asia but religion comes to play. This same applies with Israel that has a stable birth rate despite being developed. God/Allah believes in procreation so they have to procreate.

You're not totally wrong, but this can easily be changed - historically, a lot of cultures have emphasized parenthood as a worthy life goal.

It's also worth noting that this change has happened quite rapidly in the bigger scheme of things, less than a human lifetime. People and economies have had relatively little time to adapt their family planning and reproductive choices to a world where there are so many contradicting narratives about labour shortages and overconsumption. 

The increased value of human labour may cause children to become relatively more valuable. Social media may continue to discourage fertility. Governments might increase incentives for childrearing.

Speaking from the only developed country with over replacement rate BR, and 4 kids of my own. 

It's much easier to have a raise kids when the society supports that, which means that most of your co workers, boss and his boss have kids and understand when one of them gets sick, or the day you have to take off during summer vacation. It also means you're not behind everyone else at work during the summer vacation.

It means getting help from the grandparents, and siblings. 

It means having a large support network of friends and family members all raising kids together to comisserate, share advice, toys/cloths/baby stuff, babysit your kids or just give a hand with chores.

Couple that with significant subsidies for those with low income for child raising costs like kindergarten, a very well developed second hand market (with many items for free) and child raising is not as costly for those with low income. Virtually free healthcare for kids is also a must as they get sick a lot and really you don't want to be taking any chances.

For instance, we bought almost nothing for our first baby, only safety equipment like car seat and stuff you really want new like pacifiers were bought, everything else was hand me downs in excellent or brand new condition. We've passed a lot of those on.

The poorest demographics and poorest countries, opposite of your point, have far more children and significantly higher fertility rates than rich, developed nations.

Income is not the reason. The strongest correlation is the deeply negative one between women‚Äôs‚Äô educational attainment and fertility rates. Surprise ‚Äî when women have the opportunity to build a career, earn money, travel the world, etc. instead of sitting in a house all day being a homemaker, most choose to do so. 

We are in an era where child rearing requires a near complete and total sacrifice of your time. Unlike previous generations, where your children were a labor source and you (definitely by modern standards) abused/neglected them significantly. 

Per the Economist, parents spend TWICE as much time with their kids as they did 50 years ago, and it‚Äôs increasing. In 1965, mothers spent 54 minutes per day on child care and fathers just 16 minutes. As of 2012 (and it‚Äôs increased since!) it is now 104 minutes for women and 59 minutes for men. So despite women now having more options on what to do with their time and careers/work occupying it, it STILL takes even more time somehow than it did 50 years ago, when far fewer women worked and far more women focused on child rearing.

Anecdotally, my friend circle is 27-42 ish living in a very expensive city but we all make great money. We have couples of surgeons and lawyers, data scientists and engineers, etc. and yet nobody wants kids. Why? We all have several vacations across the world planned for this year. Why would we give that up for years of doctors appointments, sleep deprivation, temper tantrums, perpetual colds from your kids bringing home sickness, etc. 

That sounds like so much work and absolutely exhausting. We‚Äôd rather keep the happy hours, vacations, going dancing w friends, etc. it‚Äôs way more fun. Will that change? Maybe, but for now despite having the incomes (I‚Äôd guess the typical couple/household income in our ~30 person circle is about $350k), kids just seem like a massive headache.

Sweden offers 16 months of paid maternity leave. Their fertility rate still fell from 1.9 in 2011 to 1.66 today.

Norway offers 1 year of paid maternity leave. Their fertility rate is one of the lowest in the world at 1.48.

There is no career opportunity cost for them to have children, and that is borne out by the fact that nearly all of them have 2+ kids by mid 20s, and likely will end up with 3-5 total.  The ones in their late 40s now have their children working there (most of which already have young children).  

They don't vacation, have hobbies, etc.  Many have disciplinary issues at our company, primarily from too many absences, showing up late all the time, etc.  Since the work is low-level, they don't generally make much of an effort to do a good job.

Simple. Contrary to what people say, it isn't that everyone wants kids but just can't afford it.

Increasingly, people simply do not **want** to have kids. The desire is not there.  The sexual urge is still there, but not the reproductive one. Or at least, not strongly enough to overcome the desire to do other things. 

Due to prosperity, people also do not **need** to have kids to survive or thrive.

Due to changing social mores, people also do not **need** to have kids to gain a modicum of respect.  And as fewer people have kids, childlessness goes from being rare enough to land you social stigma, to being common enough, and it's on its way to being so common that having a child is gaining a social stigma, at young ages.  (Look at how we consider teen pregnancy as a problem, for instance.) 

When people neither want nor need to do something.... they don't do it.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636191/

‚ÄúIn a 1962 edition of Scientific American, the ecologist John B Calhoun presented the results of a macabre series of experiments conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).1 He had placed several rats in a laboratory in a converted barn where ‚Äì protected from disease and predation and supplied with food, water and bedding ‚Äì they bred rapidly. The one thing they were lacking was space, a fact that became increasingly problematic as what he liked to describe as his ‚Äúrat city‚Äù and ‚Äúrodent utopia‚Äù teemed with animals. Unwanted social contact occurred with increasing frequency, leading to increased stress and aggression. Following the work of the physiologist, Hans Selye, it seemed that the adrenal system offered the standard binary solution: fight or flight.2 But in the sealed enclosure, flight was impossible. Violence quickly spiralled out of control. Cannibalism and infanticide followed. Males became hypersexual, pansexual and, an increasing proportion, homosexual. Calhoun called this vortex ‚Äúa behavioural sink‚Äù. Their numbers fell into terminal decline and the population tailed off to extinction. At the experiments‚Äô end, the only animals still alive had survived at an immense psychological cost: asexual and utterly withdrawn, they clustered in a vacant huddled mass. Even when reintroduced to normal rodent communities, these ‚Äúsocially autistic‚Äù animals remained isolated until death. In the words of one of Calhoun‚Äôs collaborators, rodent ‚Äúutopia‚Äù had descended into ‚Äúhell‚Äù.‚Äù",Codename-Nikolai,t2_7c6azw56,1,0,reddit1

Because the monetary benefits outweighs the costs in those countries, as those kids are free labor for the parents, plus a lot of them become their parents' pension plan as their culture encourages the children to send their money back to their parent, especially when they work abroad.

The largest cause of the urban collapse is that cities no longer generate sufficient benefits to justify their costs and the abrogation of child labor is one of those costs. Oops.

kgeopv8,t1_kged2nx,2024-01-05 08:33:07,Economics,">The proximal causes of falling birth rates, and their attribution to women's educational attainment, is something I wonder a lot about. When I see this topic brought up, the language used is often couched in terms such as, ""Why have kids when you could have a fulfilling career or travel?"" but I'm not convinced that's the calculus being made at an individual level by most folks.

It is the calculus people are making. It's a very well researched question in educational economics. As education increases and in turn potential income and opportunities increase, opportunity costs for having children rise. With the same preferences, a woman will tend to have fewer children as her education rises. It's why child benefits do not significantly increase the birth rate, while subsidised child care is the only really effective way to increase fertility somewhat. The latter decreases the opportunity costs for women to hold a job, which is much more effective than any cash transfer to offset child costs.

>In the US, where the fertility rate is also below replacement, polling is pretty clear that most Americans would like to have more children than they currently do, about in line with where their parents were at--and yet they don't.

The desired number of children cannot be taken at face value. It is a stated preference that simply shows you the upper limit of fertility in modern society. It's the number of children a person wants to have if there are no opportunity costs. 

But there are always costs, which is where revealed preferences come in. Stated preferences have one fundamental flaw, people are inaccurate with providing them, either because they are mistaken, to give a socially acceptable answer or because they have a benefit from stating inaccurately. In the case of children, it's easy to state you want some, but to actually have them and to raise them is another matter, which we can see in the statistics and said gap.

The reduction in children is a dual issue of opportunity costs for children rising and preferences shifting away from them. Social expectations/values for raising children from religion, family and society are generally declining. Parents desire a way higher standard of living for their children as well, like one room for each child. Lastly, there are knock-on effects from the fact that people are raised in small families, which in turn makes people raise their children in small families.",RedKrypton,t2_dxeor,14,0,reddit1

kgg1uwo,t1_kgfo1vy,2024-01-05 15:49:18,Economics,"Indeed, children have transitioned from being an economic asset in agrarian societies to a financial liability in modern urbanized settings.  
  
Historically, children contributed to family income through labor; now, they represent a substantial financial investment, often amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, with little direct economic return until adulthood ‚Äî and often none of this is a net gain for parents. The return on investment (ROI) for parents is increasingly a net negative.  

With each generation experiencing diminished retirement savings, reduced government benefits, and a significant decline in employee compensation and benefits ‚Äî exemplified by the shift from pensions to 401(k)s with decreasing employer contributions ‚Äî the financial burdens extend into elder care. This has transformed into a moral dilemma for the children, whose responsibility it often becomes.  

Thus, the ROI for parents, especially as they live past their physical ability to work, trickles down through generations, compounding the economic challenges faced by each successive generation ‚Äî parent assets being bled dry via end of life care, and longer lifespans, assets that would once be handed down have been replaced with potential financial burden on the children (caring for their parents, etc.).  
  
Furthermore, life was far more viable as a single income family before the necessity of dual incomes emerged. This shift reflects broader economic changes, particularly in housing affordability and wage stagnation. Post-WWII, the 'baby boomers' in America experienced an unprecedented rise in affordable housing, partly due to government initiatives like the GI Bill. This era saw a surge in homeownership and family growth, facilitated by a robust economy that supported single-income households.  

In contrast, contemporary families face a different economic climate. For example, in the Netherlands, the 'Vinex-wijken' housing developments of the 1990s aimed to provide affordable housing but eventually led to suburban sprawl and increased living costs. This mirrors a global trend where housing affordability has not kept pace with wage growth, making it challenging for single-income families to thrive.  

Therefore, it's not surprising to see declining birth rates as individuals and couples make rational choices based on economic realities. While some argue for government compensation to parents, this solution overlooks the systemic issues at play. Addressing these underlying economic challenges is crucial for creating a society where having children is a viable option, not a luxury.  
  
TL;DR:   
Historically, children transitioned from financial assets in agrarian societies, contributing to family work as early as 5-7 years old, to economic burdens in modern settings, needing financial support into adulthood. This shift, along with the necessity for dual incomes and increasing living and housing costs, has rendered child-rearing a more economically challenging choice. The declining birth rates are a clear response to these economic pressures, a sentiment echoed by many in this thread.",feloniousmonkx2,t2_ar6k9,32,0,reddit1

Pregnancy takes a large toll on women. Giving birth takes a large toll on women. Breastfeeding takes a lot of time. None of these things are things spouses can really assist with.

Then some parent needs to take time off for bonding. And if we want to push gender equality, we generally need a system mandating both parents take leave. Which further pushes a mother behind a woman who didn‚Äôt have children with regards to experience in their career. 

No amount of government regulation can negate all of the time spent bearing children and raising them. The government can start paying people significant sums to have children, but then you are enticing some people who shouldn‚Äôt be parents to be parents just for the paycheck (and those ignored children will have their own issues with society in the future) but this doesn‚Äôt even address a mother who cares about their career progression.

Housing affordability is by far the worst it has ever been, *despite* both spouses working. It's really not hard to see why people wouldn't have kids. Who the f is going to take care of the kid, and where? Because both parents are going to be working 9-5+ to age 60 if they ever want a prayer of owning a home or retiring. Hire a nanny or daycare? Often nearly as expensive as one parent's salary. The obvious solution is to just not have children, and it's not even that they want kids and made a tough decision not to. They literally don't have one second to breathe and consider having children as a possibility.

Couple that with the fact that marriage rate has gone down by 60%  and people are getting married older since the 1970s. It's really not particularly surprising at all.

If the government wants to keep this stupid ponzi scheme going, then they need to address the massive wealth disparities and housing crisis in our country.

Otherwise, the problem will ""solve"" itself. Some generation will run social security dry, that generation will die, and the wealth will be somewhat redistributed through the smaller population, and when the current wealth is redistributed through a small enough population that people can finally feel comfortable and financially secure again, and *can own homes instead of trying to raise a kid in some POS predatory rental*, then they will naturally start having kids again.

I do not think this is the crucial factor. I'm not sure why you think we are going to hell, but even about this point, it seems rather to be the opposite. People that live in very harsh conditions tend to have more children. They know that they live in shitty conditions, and they know that they children are going to live in shitty conditions, still they have many of them. The point is rather that they think that having children is going to help them to improve their situation, even slightly. When state is absent, family is all giving you safety and financial support. Instead in safe and advanced society, having children is going to make your condition worse, at least on a purely material level.

However, even if we had excellent local communities and culture, it's not necessary to enjoy them with a child instead of with other adults.  Often, raising a child prevents you from enjoying community events because of the money and time required. 

And further, no one remembers or values you for raising your own child.

No offense, but you'd have to be absolutely daft to think that *isn't* possible. Like, *exactly* like the people in the 80s/90s who made those now laughable assertions about computers.

No.

I mean that people move from the country to the city creating a sort of artificial birth rate. But when you run out people in the countryside, your population drops.

Tokyo has a birth rate of 1, that means in about 50 years the population should drop in half because there wasn't enough people born to replace people dying.

Buuuut, if people are moving into the city, they can replace that population loss.

Let's do some very basic math. The surface area of earth is 1.3e11 acres.  Mostly water, but let's say we somehow find methods of farming water. Today it takes about half an acre to sustain a person (down from 5 acres in the Tutor period!)

Your claim of a billion times 7 billion would be 7e18. So, you believe not only can we farm literally every square inch of the earth, but also get from 0.5 acres per person to 1.8e-8 acres? For reference, that's smaller than a postage stamp

These calculations do not include space for people being able to stand

Edit: i guess you blocked me, but here is the math you asked for

Alright, let's throw out the needs for light, soil, and power. Most crops are at least three feet tall. The average earth radius is 3950mi. I am going to assume we are building up, but the numbers don't actually change much if you dig down because, you know, it's a sphere. Let's say we build a full mile up, this is very generous because trees stop growing at 4500 ft in the Rockies, not enough oxygen. So between 3950mi and 3951mi. You get about 1e18 cubic yards. That's 1 cubic yard per seven people. Or one square yard of 3 foot tall plants to feed seven people. Still not accounting for people standing in these numbers",duckofdeath87,t2_8h74g,2,0,reddit1

Okay so I agree that kids are too switched onto media. 

Infact I feel parents who use ipads etc as entertainment full time as this generations ""go outside and leave me alone"" lazy parenting.

The parents who'd shove their kids into the street with no regards to safety because it's easier are the same as people who expect the screen to entertain their kids.

Thing is, there's a question of ""lesser of two evils"".

 There's huge risk to both, unattended children are prey to predators, bullying and general injury.

Kids on screens are at risk of being exposed to inappropriate stuff (young kids seem to be super into horror games) and having constant dopamine and not allowed to be bored.

If you where to say ""which would you prefer?"" I'd prefer the screen addicted kid because I could control and supervise that over a child just out in the wild, because I'd rather battle a internet addiction than my kid hiding the fact some older kids tried to bully them into kissing them etc.

Letting kids out unsupervised is neglect. If I left a 8 year old in my home day after day, I'd have CPS called because its neglect even though their in their home/safe environment compared to outside. So you can't accept that letting kids out unsupervised was ever a good idea. 

We learn from the previous generations, and now schools/parents teach ""under wear rules"" and don't let kids go around unsupervised. Why? Because fucked up shit happened to many of us and it could of been avoided if we where not left alone in the wild. Just because it thankfully never happened to you does not mean it did not happen.

Parenting today is not perfect, it never will be. But willfully letting your child just go out on their own knowing the freaks and fucked up people around, it's insanity.

This is unlikely to be heavily divorce/custody related as it only refers to women and men living alone (not with children).  Although some divorces are childfree I suspect that is a smaller percentage of the difference here, if any.

Regarding older men and women - this is likely to be a significant factor.  [This study](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/aging%20and%20Disability%20In%20America/2020Profileolderamericans.final_.pdf) on older Americans (which is a real study unlike the linked article) suggests that ""About 27% (14.7 million) of all older adults living in the community in 2020 lived alone (5 million men, 9.7 million women)."" This is a gap of 4.7 million women.  That said, not all of them will own their own homes.  Later in the article we have ""Of the 14.1 million households headed by persons age 75 and older in 2019, 77% (10.8 million) owned their homes and 23% (3.3 million) rented.""  While we don't know if this would apply to those under 75, or whether the split of renters is the same among men and women, if we assume those percentages hold, that means 3.85 million older men live alone and own their homes, and 7.47 million women do, for a gap of about 3.62 million women.

Obviously there are a lot of assumptions but that gap is not that far off from the 2.71 million women in the article.  So it's reasonable to suspect that a majority of the gap (or even an excess amount of it) is due to older women living alone.  Older meaning over 65.",corinini,t2_bbwf3,80,0,reddit2

Let me start off by saying this is all hypothetical and beer talk, so take with grain of salt. But traditionally men bought homes to start a family with a wife and kids. We know with statistical facts that men are single more than ever and less likely to marry compared to previous years (decline in marriage rates) 

With that said, if men are marrying less, they don‚Äôt have a *strong* reason to buy a home. Personally I rather just rent a studio by myself and have the freedom to relocate and move around when I feel like it. Only when I‚Äôm settled down would I consider buying a permanent home. Until then, since I‚Äôm still single and childless, why buy a house? I‚Äôll be stuck in that location unable to up and leave as I please. 

Also men are more likely to relocate for work, so by renting an apartment I can just move states whenever. Until I get married I have no reason to buy a house. 

Im not saying this is the reason men aren‚Äôt buying homes, I think for some men, myself included, it is a reason. 

The title even says women who ‚Äúlive‚Äù alone are more likely to buy homes. Yeah if I‚Äôm living alone, I don‚Äôt need a house, just give me a living room with a bathroom and kitchen, I‚Äôm good.

https://qz.com/1508500/the-gender-wage-gap-is-between-married-men-and-everyone-else

Basically the entire reason there is a gender pay gap is because of the earnings of married men. Does this mean that marriage makes men more able to earn more, or does this mean that men who earn more are more desirable for women to marry?

My feeling is that single childless men tend to live and crave extremely simple lifestyles and tend to be unambitious/value free time. However the same person with a wife/family might be motivated/feel pressure to be more of a provider. Similarly women who are married might be motivated/feel pressure to be the primary caregiver for children, even if she works.

It's when women don't have children and are single that they out earn men. 

https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/single-child-free-women-out-earn-single-child-free-men/

Also probably the reason why single women own more homes than single men is because when a divorce happens the women usually retain more than 50% custody of the kids and often retain the house due to that. At least this is what I am guessing. 

It's know that married men are the ones that make more than any other group and the primary category of men who create the ""gender pay gap"" also if men and women get divorced the man is more likely to get remarried. Probably because he is not the primary caregiver for children post divorce he is also able to financially recover faster despite often losing the house in the divorce. 

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research

https://time.com/3584827/pew-marriage-divorce-remarriage/

Children are basically walking financial suppression for women, and probably a huge reason for the ""pay gap."" Is likely that this is also a reason for a lower birth rate as of the last few decades. Women have come to see that children reduce their earning capacity. It's true as childless single women out earn even childless single men. 

The lowest earning category is single women with children. 

So even when women get homes after divorce, even with that assets the do not recover as well financially from a divorce because of having the children. 

So for a woman having children reduces her ability to earn money. For a man if he has children he is likely to lose custody of them and lose his house if he and his spouse gets divorced. People wonder why people are having less kids or no kids?",thebigmanhastherock,t2_gste2ri,5,0,reddit2

I‚Äôve known quite a few women who would get pregnant and essentially use their kids as pawns to extract money from the men. They would take the money and spend it on weed, cigarettes, alcohol, expensive nice clothes, purses, jewelry, shoes, and only AFTER frivolously spending it on themselves FIRST would they then take the remainder and spend it on their child. Then they would have the audacity to try to get even more money from the man.

Also, when I mention the clothing and stuff, these women already had clothing and purses and shoes that were perfectly fine. They made unnecessary purchases and used the money for their WANTS not NEEDS.

There‚Äôs also been many instances where a woman would cheat on her spouse, have someone else‚Äôs kid, and let the man think it‚Äôs his own. And when he would divorce her, he still was required to pay alimony and child support.

There‚Äôs times where a woman will get pregnant on purpose, trap the man, and when he wants to get an abortion, she‚Äôll refuse, leave the man after having the kid, and extract money from him for the rest of his life. And when the court decides on how much he should be paying, they hold him to it whether he loses a job or not, or has a reduction in pay.

That doesn't make sense.  Let's presume the couple split, and the female gets the house and custody.  You've just upped the number of single men without a house by one, but unchanged the number of single women with house.  Therefore the percent of single men with houses goes down, while percent women with houses remains same, creating a differential of single women more likely to own the house.

Here's a hard example.  Start in a society, there is one family, one single man with house, one single woman with house.

The family divorce, the woman takes the kid and the house.

Now you have a society with one female with a house, one single man without house, and one single man with house (plus the female-child pair not included in the stats).

I suspect it's more of a preference.  Divorced men may not be eager to take on an additional financial burden of owning a home where renting gives you a lot more flexibility at a time when your life is in a state of upheaval.  They may wait until they're remarried before considering home ownership again.

And it's entirely possible that a significant fraction of the single women who own homes acquired sole ownership through a divorce settlement.  Or through death... how man of the ""single women"" are older widows?

It's unfortunate the ""study"" didn't provide any details about these demographics.

EDIT: the [linked Lending Tree article](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/single-women-own-more-homes-than-single-men-do/) has this to say:

> But homeownership isn‚Äôt just a young person‚Äôs game, and factors outside of individual earnings also contribute to homeownership. Considering that women typically live longer and are more likely to report being widowed than men, it‚Äôs likely that some women who are now single homeowners bought that home with the spouse they outlived.

kpm6ukw,t1_kpkvv53,2024-02-09 10:02:03,Economics,"Basically women earn more than men then it swaps to men later on.  
  
This is adjusting for same jobs/degrees too.  
   
The reason is women tend to have better resumes early on during schooling. Better grades, more academic based clubs, and so on.  
  
But then men tend to be better at advancing in their career and pay. Mostly because women often get anchored down with pregnancy. But also because data shows women are more complacent than men in their jobs. This means men are more likely to seek out oppertunities to get paid more or demand raises.  
  
In my personal experience the good female workers tend to excel at their position and think that will lead to promotion while men tend to realize they need to excel at things that show they can do the next position to get promoted. So when I'm hiring for a manager position and I have 2 employees to pick from 1 woman who is the best low level employee and 1 man who is 2nd best but has consistently shown an ability to manage who would I pick to be the new manager?  
  
It's not women's fault I think they've basically been misled as some men have into thinking company loyalty and working hard get rewarded. I have been consistently hired or promoted above female co-workers I would agree are harder workers but the advantage I have is I am a smart worker. I get the same or near same results while also getting skills and development that lead to more.   
  
Also women still are less likely to be the bread winner in a college educated household. So they have less opportunity to negotiate raises or seek competitive offers that involve moving. Families tend to move based on the job of the bread winner.

Engineering Canada had a program to boost women enrollment in 2010 long after I left and the goal was to get it to 30%, they only recently reached that as I looked it up.  You are right the stats are there.  Its not 40-60 in engineering.  But remember I was talking about when I was in engineering - the 90s - years before all the efforts showed any results.

You also want to lump everything into STEM but that really skews things.   Its clear that women are interested in Biology  instead which is just a subpart of S in STEM - they most often outnumber men in biology departments.   Chemistry is up there too.  **Women are outpacing men in medical related fields but its just not true of engineering**: the E.  Talking about STEM isn't really talking about engineering - STEM is wide and varied.   Though I started in engineering and ended up with in Math  and later Comp Sci - I graduated with one women in Math, but there was a maybe 20% women when I was in Comp Sci.

What I can't find is historical info at this point, I got my first degree in '96 so my first year was in Engineering in '92 - **it was possibly higher than what Im guessing was 95% male because my first classes of a couple hundred had less than 10 women in '92**.   And at that time they lowered the requirements for women to get in to the Engineering program and many men were pissed - clearly the men that didn't make the cut were outraged but honestly we all were - we all worked hard to get into a program that was hard for us to get into and no one cut us breaks.

We had a humans rights lawyer come in and give a speech to the first year students in '92.  She was clearly there to make a point but unsurprisingly it failed miserably.  She started by asking all assembled if they every felt discriminated against and most raised their hands - that was not what she was expecting, she was expecting the women to raise their hands but only a couple of them did.  She questioned some of the guys that raised their hands but after getting similar responses she dismissed their complaints and said women are discriminated against.  She would not accept that the special accommodation of lowering requirements at that time to allow for women in to enter the program was discrimination and was one of those that said white men can't be victims of discrimination.   She was booed and cut her speech short.  There was fallout.  But none of the students apologized as suggested and none backed down as they shouldn't.  That's how things were with this topic in the 90s.

Seems more like 99 than 08. Many stupid, over-valued stocks that got steroid injected by virtual gambling coins (literally, in crypto's case). Not sure how the hell Netflix got to a $300B valuation (larger than Disney at some point), but it happened. All the SPACs and start-ups that flew up. The WSB mania. None of these were sustainable in any way. I'm sure it'll have an effect on the real estate and overall job markets, but a lot of rich people got more rich, and a lot of big gamblers got poor. But at its core, real estate and jobs aren't going to crash just based on the trend line of ""what goes up must come down"" - banking and real estate really crashed in 2008 for a very particular reason.

Unless the same thing is happening in the shadows (which it might be, I don't know), then it won't happen the same way. My hunch from the beginning of the pandemic to now was that big corporations saw that a lot of business models are gonna fly through some epic turbulence due to a global pandemic, and they decided to put a ton of eggs in real estate, knowing that in the short and long run, people need places to live, and collecting rent (or flipping homes) is a hell of a business. Of course it ended up running way higher than anyone imagined and probably recedes, but in many ways it also just finally caught up (well, outpaced) median rent. But for a long time, owning was a cheaper monthly cost than renting, which actually made no sense at all.

(Commercial real estate is a different story...)

Pets Dot com and Peloton are more similar stories than the housing bubble comparisons (not as companies, but the rise and fall). Peloton's market cap was $38B at one point. Today it is around $3.6B. That is a 90% loss in 1 year. It was a good idea to catch the subscription boom, with a quick money injection, but doesn't mean much if the core business plan is not executed well or profitable in the long-run. So for all the doom's day recession fears, it'd be nice to be reminded how preposterous Wall St. was from Q3 2020 to Q4 2021. Yeah - I would imagine there are (and will be) a lot of layoffs from companies that were operating at a loss or not creating any tangible, essential products, yet running 12-figure valuations.

Resources are also finite.

hhvgess,t1_hhv3d3t,2021-10-24 15:53:47,Economics,"That's not what Say's law says. Say's law says that if someone creates a product, the only reason he did it is because he wants to sell the product and buy something else with the money he gets. The creation of supply implies there is demand for *something else*, and that demand must be exactly equal to the value of the thing being supplied. 

If we want to apply Say's law to this situation, we have to be careful about what we say the ""good"" being supplied is. In this case, the ""good"" being supplied is the labor. It is not the job on offer. The supply is the number of people willing to provide the labor, not the number of employers wanting to hire workers. And that supply, if it existed, would imply demand (for something)- the workers would take the jobs only because they want the money, and they would want the money only to spend it on something else.

I'm not saying Say's law is right here. I'm saying you are misapplying the reasoning. During the Great Depression, there was a tremendous supply of workers, and no jobs to be found. What those workers wanted the jobs for was not to simply work; they wanted the jobs so they could buy food and other necessities. The conclusion you would draw from Say's law is that the supply of workers implies there is money to be made producing necessities, and therefore employers would hire people to do that. That wasn't happening. There must be more to markets than Say's law. Which doesn't mean it is ""wrong"", but more ""not quite right"". It is an incomplete description of markets.",csappenf,t2_xg8ko,34,0,reddit4

First, a lot of people permanently exited the workforce, either through retirement, death or just a simple inability to work anymore. Covid was responsible for all of it. As a result, a lot of the top positions were left empty which allowed a lot of people to move up and a lot of people the opportunity to find new jobs. The people who left the workforce aren't coming back. The people who got promoted aren't coming back. The restaurant and retail industry won't have a strong workforce until they start offering jobs with competitive pay and benefits.

Second, shipping is severely understaffed. There's so much demand that they need as many hands on deck as possible. They're suckijg a massive amount of the labor supply and that is simply not going to change.

1.	Pre-pandemic, consumerism shaped our society to believe that income needed to be maximized in order to maximize spending. Spending was allegedly equivalent to happiness.
2.	During shutdowns, tens of millions of Americans were forced to abandon the chase for income and sit at home. Fixed income drives consumer behavior towards maximizing happiness through efficient spending rather than raw earning, and these people also had an opportunity to experience the mental health benefits of free time.
3.	Post-shutdown, individuals and households are trying to account for both approaches to happiness. They are willing to sacrifice raw income when it can lead to a tangible quality of life improvement.

Everyone treats to the American worker like they are a solo individual, workers who will work or will eventually starve - that‚Äôs not true at all. Individuals have partners, couples that trade dual incomes for one career supported by one homemaker. People moved in with their parents, or their kids, creating households with fewer incomes than adults. People are turning to side gigs that bring them joy over chasing low wage work for a second or third income.

Pundits have railed on the unemployment benefits as somehow spoiling the labor force into laziness, but in reality these people are not going to chase burger-flipping once they can get $18-$20/hour for it.

Steroids? it was like a few hundred bucks a week, not major money, really not life changing. Nothing compared to the influx of wealth those at the top got to enjoy.

&#x200B;

>stimulus checks

You mean the whopping 3 checks we got in the last 2 years? Again, not exactly a factor, like maybe paid down some credit debt, not anything to live off.

&#x200B;

>making rent optional for 1.5 years

This is a stretch of the truth. There has been a moratorium on evictions. This is not making rent ""optional"". That rent is still very much due, they just can't evict you over it, but the debt is piling up. If you didn't get evicted for not paying your rent for 3 months, you definitely still owe those 3 months of rent.

&#x200B;

>no Fed student loan payments

Again, stretching the truth. They just paused the need to pay, that debt is still there, hanging over people. 

&#x200B;

These jobs that people can't fill were barely worth it when things were ""normal"". The wages haven't gone up in a decade and those wages were garbage to begin with. It was BARELY worth it for me to show up to my job at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, and literally everything has only gotten worse.

A supply of Model Ts might create a demand for the spare parts, though. Maybe. If there is an unmet demand for Model Ts in the first place.  

Yes, the legislatures are trying to increase the supply of workers willing to work for low wages. If workers need more money to buy the things they need, then they will have to take whatever jobs are on offer. Unless workers think the jobs on offer don't pay enough to afford those things. Then the supply of labor willing to work at those wages isn't going to change. I'm not really sure why trying to make poor people more desperate isn't working.",csappenf,t2_xg8ko,14,0,reddit4

That's the most hilarious thing I've read this week. 

>Actual state unemployment rates seem to contradict this claim because we all know that on average, blue states often have more government benefits on offer for people who are not working.

Sure, but what is the labor participation rate? 

Quick search shows (As a baseline example, fairly similar population levels):

Alabama labor force participation: 57%
Alabama Unemployment rate: 3.1%



Washington labor force participation: 64% 
Washington unemployment rate 5.2%


Sure, you can isolate the unemployment rate and Alabama looks like the more functional labor force, but that's pretty disingenuous, huh?

And that doesn't account for poverty rates, aka which state is actually a more healthy economy.

Washington: 9.8%

Alabama: 15.5%

hhzz96x,t1_hhzksvv,2021-10-25 16:02:31,Economics,"That‚Äôs interesting. I thought his technology and military predictions were probably the least meaningful out of all the analysis in the book. Small differences in technology could vastly change the outcomes of some of the conflicts he‚Äôs talking about, but the business cycles and demographic shifts are predictable and will occur no matter the technology landscape. 

When you look at his analysis of 50 year sociopolitical cycles, it‚Äôs fairly compelling. And the predictions he made based specifically on the epicycles of American economic development are very much aligned with exactly what‚Äôs happening today. 

I went back and read it recently, and there is a particular point he makes which leaps off the page. He says that by 2020, the wealth of the global financial elite will have run out of mechanisms for sustaining growth, and that a sudden shock (and he specifically mentions a natural disaster or global pandemic) will stop the large scale churning of the financial engine that drives the global economy, causing the extremely top heavy financialized economy to suddenly crack, and reorganize itself with a strong urgency toward improving the living standards of the working class, which will find itself quickly and for a sustained period in a position of greater power. 

When you get into the weeds of how this occurs, it seems quite inevitable, and really agrees with all that is occurring today. The global supply chain has been violently disrupted, and the sudden shortfalls of products and labor have enhanced the sense that the working and middle class have been losing too much for too long. Suddenly people are demanding not only to get back what has been taken, but overall to get more of the total wealth that has been created. There is now an understanding that the expanding wealth of the mega rich depends on the availability of workers to supply the economy with productive labor, and labor is now much more clearly in control and able to demand that the economy will work more to their benefit as it begins to grow back to its former productivity level. 

It‚Äôs like a ship with hundreds of people rowing, that runs across rocks and gets stuck. In the moment that the workers realize that they are needed to get the ship unstuck and moving again, they also understand that when it does get moving, they have the power and the right to demand that it move in the direction and under conditions that benefit them, and not the people who have been leading them until now.",orincoro,t2_11djf8,6,0,reddit4
hi01swj,t1_hhznhvx,2021-10-25 16:19:45,Economics,"Again: you need to read the book to understand the basis of any of its predictions. I promise you, if you just read the first chapter, you‚Äôll understand what the basic conceit is.

The way you are picking at individual predictions based on the way things look today is precisely the criticism that the beginning of the book addresses very cogently. It argues that large scale geopolitical processes occur somewhat independently of changes in culture or technology. There are inevitable epicycles that repeat themselves when similar conditions are met. The Poland/Russia epicycle you mention is one that he analyzes all the way back to the Napoleonic wars, explaining how Poland‚Äôs position in the Northern European plain makes it a focal point of the balance of power between Europe and Russia. It‚Äôs not about Poland the country. It‚Äôs not about the culture or any individual. It‚Äôs about Poland the historical concept. 

The same for Russia: an individual can influence politics within a cycle, but no leader can change the basic circumstances of Russia on the global geopolitical landscape. When Putin inevitably dies or retires, the circumstances shaping the future of politics in Russia won‚Äôt change. Any changes his power has managed to prevent from being felt in day to day life will simply happen faster and more drastically as political power realigns. 

Historical shifts in power tend to happen a lot faster than people predict because bases of power are built around keeping things the same for those in power. Once their power breaks, change can be incredibly swift. The prussian militarist tradition of Germany that was centuries old was broken utterly in a 20 year period after WW2, for example. No one believed that was possible until it occurred. Similarly, the ascendancy of Poland is not about the polish political system, but simply the facts of Poland‚Äôs current geopolitical situation. As Russia experiences decline, Poland will rapidly grow its influence and base of power in the region. New leaders and a new political culture will spring up seemingly from nothing. History shows ha that this can happen anywhere, and can be very hard to predict based on the lived experience of people of that time.

hi17m13,t1_hhyrh9a,2021-10-25 21:01:33,Economics,"Well, when you phrase it like that it's a no-brainer. In general, economic growth in the European Union has been faster in the east than in the west; the economic weight of the EU (and Europe as a whole) has shifted eastward, and will probably continue to shift eastward. A rising economy and a geography which easily leads to one power consolidating very quickly, combined with Poland being the biggest in the event of Russia kicking the bucket, makes it a clear favourite for a new eastern European regional power.

The problem is that it relies on Poland being kicked out of NATO, and a general dissolution of NATO and the EU and Russia. They're not the basis of strong predictions. If this is rephrased to ""continued decline of Russia and increased economic weight of Poland will lead to it gaining ever-increasing soft and hard power in Europe"" I'd argue that that's already the case.",Wazzupdj,t2_npq6p,1,0,reddit4

You can't separate the two issues. The reason companies could afford to pay fat union wages is because they had no international competition and their margins were huge. It's no coincidence that the fall of labor unions coincided with the rise of, first, Japan, Germany and the rest of Europe, and then China and the rest of the former third world.

Those haven't gone away. In fact the subsidies for home buyers are bigger than ever. The vast majority of mortgages are financed directly by the government through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.

We still have the GI bill.

I referred to the developed world. Mexico didn't have any industrial base in the 1950s. It was a third world agrarian economy.

Surely you've heard about the trend of corporations building manufacturing facilities in places like Mexico and the effect that's had on our economy.

> When the Fed lowers interest rates, every borrower in the country benefits.

That is true but you're ignoring a whole lot of benefits of mortgages to the rich. First, lower interest rates make a bigger difference if you've got a mansion than if you have a shack. The standard deduction is $25,100 for a couple this year. Real median household income (pre-tax) is about $67K so you need to be pretty well off to be itemizing. But if we assume that you are itemizing, that deduction is worth more to somebody in the 39% bracket than to somebody in the 15% bracket and costs the government more revenue.

I support the SALT limitation, though it was done by the GOP to teach Blue states a lesson, not out of a desire to make the tax system more progressive. We can talk about the shame of partisan warfare on half of the population but that is too far afield.

> You go through life thinking that the manufacturing sector in the US hasn't shrunk due to moving facilities and processes to other countries? That's either disingenuous or ignorant.

> You may be asking yourself, ‚Äúwhat is a good profit margin?‚Äù A good margin will vary considerably by industry, but as a general rule of thumb, a 10% net profit margin is considered average, a 20% margin is considered high (or ‚Äúgood‚Äù), and a 5% margin is low.

First, $32 billion isn't even that much.

Second, it slowed down the system responsible for climate change.

Third, it helped bring home *some* manufacturing, but more importantly it helped show us all how dangerous it is to put all our manufacturing eggs in the China basket.

Fourth, it was one of many factors leading to China showing us their teeth and claws which has helped people to learn just how dangerous China is to us militarily and what their global military ambitions really are.

Fifth, it has helped spur home chip fabrication, an extremely important and often overlooked national security issue.  We *must not* rely on China to produce the microchips that go into our tanks, ships, missiles, communications devices, electric grid, weapons, etc. --- lest we open ourselves up to trojan electronics embedded in our nation's critical infrastructure and military.  We must have access to a secure foundry within our borders, ideally at least one that can produce rad-hardened and analog chips (these chips require older processes, like 45nm/90nm.)

Sixth, it has helped put a temporary cap on China's GDP and given them a few domestic problems to concentrate on which in turn has forced them to take at least some attention away from their military ambitions in Taiwan (and possibly elsewhere.)

Taxing Chinese goods actually hurts US companies and ultimately consumers. It‚Äôs actually been a contributor to inflation. 

I work in an industry that orders a lot of stainless steel primarily from China, and this is what we have done. Could we buy American? Sure. Price increases 3x. German, 2x. The idea behind the tax is that is discourages companies to buy from them and lowers our trading activity with them and in turn hurts them economically. Even with the increased tariffs, China still the cheapest by far(for the goods I buy at least), but way more expensive than it was 4 years ago. At the end of the day, the end user absorbs the majority of the cost or companies margins get pinched. Point is trade wars actually hurt consumers the most.

tariffs

subsidies

advantages that would be illegal in the target consumer market - slavery, environmental carnage and lack of regulation, I.P. theft

The best market is one established on a level playing field, with a multitude of competitors. More competitors eventually benefits the consumer. In this situation to obtain more competitors one \*has\* to level the playing field with tariffs and subsidies.

So, apply tariffs, then use the revenues to create strategic manufacturing subsidies to rebuild domestic competition. Trade restrictions is why the E.U. has a car industry still, and Germany a trade surplus.  It can now afford to protect itself from the R.U. with large defence procurement, and before long, decarbonise.

They also let their currency fall to make their goods more competitive, and filed with the WTO. Finally, they lowered tariffs on goods from other countries to compensate.

Most agree the trade war was not a success for the US. Aside from helping us achieve some strategic goals with tech products, most of the actions we took didn‚Äôt achieve the intended outcome and it hurt US manufacturing. Unfortunately this all happened right before manufacturing got slammed again by COVID.

China had issues as well, but since their media is so tightly controlled it‚Äôs hard to figure out the extent. It wasn‚Äôt good for their economy, but it supposedly stoked nationalism which was a plus for the CCP.",PM_ME_BAD_FANART,t2_12w1i7,26,0,reddit1

But the other part of this is... What was rhe point of the tariffs? Did it help American businesses overall? Specific businesses?

Most analyses I have seen make it clear that it was an overall loser for the usa. Loss of gdp, loss of jobs, loss of wages.

For what? Did we protect a key industry we need for defense? For long-term stability?

Trump did this because he was obsessed with the trade deficit.  But the trade deficit on its own is meaningless.

You want a well paying low skill job? There you go.

If I was underemployed right now I'd be looking into trucking without a doubt. A long haul trucker can get close to six figures or even exceed it depending on how much they want to work and so long as you don't have a DUI or some terrible driver abstract, you will get hired.

No young people want to get into it because they think truckers will be a thing of the past in a ""no time"" but that is just not true. There will be plenty of trucking jobs in the 2030s still, plenty of runway left.

Edit: Alright adding this because Im over responding to everyone saying something along the lines of ""Yeah but its actually a terrible lifestyle"" or whatever variation of that. Yes, it is a hard life, thats why its a viable way for someone with no education, skills or career path to literally turn their life around financially in a few weeks time with no investment besides time.

It's a good reason why it's easier to find a job when you already have one.  Especially with government jobs, the process is very time consuming and it doesn't align with the faux cry for workers.

Before '08 there were actual recruiters and headhunters. So much of the vetting process is automated, so it's less work for those HR, but it's still the same amount of work for the job seeker.  Even in SF during their recent tech boom ('13-'17) the infrastructure for hiring simply wasn't there, and those tech firms were just throwing money at job fairs (which are not a terrible way to hire, but I would say quite inefficient), or using university contacts.  That leaves out the supposed experienced workforce they said they were looking for.

They're not disingenuous, they're just providing less fine-grained information.  That doesn't make them useless, nor does it make them misleading.  They just need to be interpreted properly.

Eg, when I see the topline numbers described here, at a fundamental level, I see a matching problem.  That could be down to any number of things:  wage/qualification mismatch, sector mismatch, large labor force decreases (reduces supply but doesn't increase reported unemployment), etc",wutcnbrowndo4u,t2_4izh8,20,0,reddit2

hc6ldut,t1_hc4ogpz,2021-09-09 14:08:14,Economics,"Honestly the best way to get in is to befriend someone who is already in. They'll be able to tell you exactly how to structure your resume and cover letter, and the cover letter especially is radically different and much longer than what is normally used. At least, that's how it is at the national labs. 

If you want a job that requires a clearance your best bet is to find a job doing literally anything, usually manual labor, at the facility you'd like to work at. Then once you have that foot in the door, start applying for jobs at the same facility that require a clearance. Bonus points if you can find someone in the division/department you want to work in and get them to be one of your references. This ensures your resume makes it through the HR filter, and predisposes the hiring manager to have a good opinion of you. 

Realize that for a job that requires a clearance, they have to hire you in at the standard rate. Then they have to either give you a full time baby sitter to escort you around cleared areas while preventing you from accessing anything classified (which means you essentially can't do any of the work they're hiring you for), OR find someplace with no clearance requirements to stick you for the 5 months (if they pay the extra tens of thousands of dollars to get your clearance review expedited, on top of the $15-30k a clearance normally costs) to 2.5 years until you get your clearance. Only then can they start training you to do the shit they hired you for however long ago. So now they're out months to years of time, up to $250k in costs including salary and benefits, and you've actually functioned as a resource drain on the group you've hired into because they still have to manage you while you're accomplishing nothing. And then once you've got a clearance you're pretty free to jump to another team, another paygrade, another facility - whatever. Which means that there's no real guarantee that that investment will pay off for the group that hires you initially. 

I can also tell you that when I got hired without one and had to have a full time babysitter with two other uncleared people, we were just generally in the way of things and couldn't participate in any actual work, constantly stuffed in random offices with not enough chairs because our escorts needed to do actual work, having to ask to be escorted to the bathroom like a fucking child, etc. - it was the worst 5 months of my life. And once I had that clearance I was gone from that group in 6 months because now that I had the clearance I was overqualified for the position.",shargy,t2_169mi2,1,0,reddit2

That said - subjectivity is the name of the game here. It‚Äôs certainly opinion that some of these jobs are bullshit. Who are they bullshit to? Those who subscribe to this theory, or the masses? Is this an objective, measurable metric? An argument can be made that supply/demand of the labor force dictates what is and isnt bullshit. 

Is a survey administrator bullshit if it helps the efficacy of the survey?

Is a PR specialist bullshit if it allows for the continued operations of an entity?

Is a lobbyist a bullshit job because they‚Äôre actually vampires out for blood and will sacrifice their own kin? To be determined. (Yes)

It‚Äôs noted in the overview that the five types of ‚Äòuseless jobs‚Äô are largely in the private sector, ‚Äúdespite the idea that market competition would root out such efficiencies.‚Äù

hc50stt,t1_hc4txpq,2021-09-09 02:56:10,Economics,"Tangential jobs that allowed me to get exposure to Enterprise level hardware and a coding bootcamp combined with having the right social network.

I went to a 3 month camp for JavaScript and python.  It was more focused on front end skills, but i don't really like that part of tech.  I like infrastructure.  So while most of my class mates went on to get mostly front end gigs, I got a job working as a support engineer for a network monitoring firm.  

They sold and used Linux based servers.  I had a pretty good grasp of concepts from my years of consumer level windows tech support (Geek Squad, hence the username).  So i kept the coding up in my spare time building sites, scripts and apps for things I was interested in. All the while digging into learning Linux at work.  

Coding + systems engineer = DevOps or Site Reliability Engineer.  To know more about what a day in the life of these roles mean, i read https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents and started thinking like an SRE at my current job.  While the company i was at wasn't interested in interviewing a support person for a dev role (bad culture in that regard), i heard that there was another person looking for non-senior SRE candidates from a close contact.  They were able to connect me with the hiring manager and i got an interview then the job.

It took like 3 years from starting bootcamp to landing the big job.  There are several failed interviews in that time as well.  The big key for breaking into the tech world without going through the college + intern pipeline is your network.  You have to establish contacts and keep talking with folks in the positions you want.  When something comes up, they can reach out or pass on your name.

The plan was to take 6 months off, pay $15k for a camp, get a job and make better money.  The plan worked.  Just a little longer than i wanted.  The best advice is, if you know what you want to do, find out what it takes to do it.  From there, make sure you are doing something everyday that brings you closer to that goal.

g0mngqu,t1_g0lulaw,2020-08-07 01:27:07,Economics,"I agree with the former for the most part, but as for Russia... that's more complicated. Putin is so popular because his administration brought Russia out of the complete disarray that Yeltsin left the country in. That popularity allowed Russia to flex its muscles again and exert hard power across the former Soviet Union. If you ask me, the neo cold war with Russia really began in 2008 with the war in Ossetia. Shortly after that there were allegations that the Obama administration interfered in the Russian elections and attempted a soft coup (eerily similar allegations like what we saw in 2016, would not be at all surprised if true given [the state department's footprint in Russia historically] (https://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960715_400.jpg)). And then it all went to shit with active proxy wars a couple years later in Ukraine and Syria. The US has always had an interest in containing Russia even after the fall of communism, but yes you are correct that whole time China was building and taking opportunities.

China on the other hand... I don't think anybody has a damn clue where that conflict will end up. The West assumed that opening China up to the WTO and etc would end up with China reforming and becoming more democratic. That has not happened and China is extremely tied to the world economy unlike the USSR and it's successor the Russian Federation (whose GDP is equivalent to Italy and was never properly brought into the worlds economic fold). But China is there and eager to gain more soft power, act as an alternative to US hegemony. I expect a long diplomatic battle across East Asia between the US and China to 'woo' counties into their sphere. The US enjoys the post WWII mantle as master of the Pacific Theatre... but the US is on the decline (its credibility was already slipping from the Bush admin imo, but Trump pulled the rabbit out of the hat for the world to see). China certainly has many, many problems to and their international image is ~~not exactly spotless~~ downright loathsome especially given what's going on in Xinjiang... but they have the initiative while the US seems to be struggling to keep what it has.

That's how I see it. I don't ever expect China to lash out first because [its military is still reforming] (http://english.www.gov.cn/archive/whitepaper/201907/24/content_WS5d3941ddc6d08408f502283d.html), but there is still plenty of room for relations to deteriorate and I don't see anyone in the room who's looking to turn the temperature down (Biden is promising to be *tougher* on China.

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

g0misis,t1_g0mgo68,2020-08-07 00:41:52,Economics,"I entered the spez. I called out to try and find anybody. I was met with a wave of silence. I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

kolo8x0,t3_1ah6nlp,2024-02-02 15:56:06,Economics,"Past the headlines and in the linked article:

*A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts.*

*Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter, noted that not everything in the January report was consistent with gangbuster job growth. She pointed out, for example, that Americans worked an average of 34.1 hours a week last month, the lowest such figure since 2010 excluding the COVID-19 recession.*

*The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them ‚Äî and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation.*

&nbsp;

Julia Pollak was also cited in [USA Today‚Äôs analysis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/25/part-time-jobs-hit-record-high/72331112007/) of 22 million Americans in part-time work:

*Also, about 70% of working men and women over 65 are in part-time jobs, ZipRecruiter says. Because the population of baby boomers in that age group is so large, it‚Äôs pushing up the number of Americans working part time, says ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak.*",marketrent,t2_fj9vsvfd,29,0,reddit4

2020 through 2021 was an exception to this, with tons of stupid hiring where the company would hire people without experience and expect them to still know those skills.  That was a weird few years.

Median: usually considered better than ""average"" (arithmetic mean) because the average figure gets distorted to show larger numbers by a few people who make a whole lot. The median is the person who has half the population making more than them, and half the population making more.

Real: adjusted for inflation

Wages: income from labor. Excludes capital gains if they have stocks, interest from savings or bonds, etc. 

Household income: includes wages, capital gains, and interest income for an entire ""household."" This means both parents' income, and generally people who live together as a family. This is a weird one to look at over longer periods of time, because household structures change over time. Single parents become more common, people live with their parents longer than typical, and having extended family in the same house is  less common.

Nothing will tank the perception of an economy faster than double digit unemployment, or double digit interest rates. Black unemployment? Record lows - 5.3% this time.  Hispanics 5%, only slightly higher than during the best stretch Trump had.

People are crying about interest rates now because they've been irresponsibly coddled with Great Recession remaining interest rates for far too long.  In the grand scheme of modern US history, 5-5.5% is really not bad.

Real wages have increased more than the value of inflation for 9 months straight, now.

Not only has Biden created more overall jobs than Trump, but he's created about 60% more manufacturing jobs then he did, too.

The stock market? Record highs, highs that put the Orange one to shame.  

I'm not sure what other metric to go by.  People cry about expenses, yet if you look at surveys from this year, and then go back to 2018-2019, a similar amount of people complain about being broke, or unable to afford the classic ""500 dollar emergency expense"".   

People in this country just suck at money.

By contrast, rents surged in cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, where prices soared more than 21%; Columbus, Ohio (11.56%); and San Jose, California (9.48%)

So it really just depends on where you live but overall rents have been coming down recently.

I think last year and the first half of this year provided a cooling off point for a lot to re evaluate their investment areas. But inevitably they will begin to expand as investor sentiment gets more optimistic.

1. Whatever inflation is, improving your wages is good for you. High inflation, low inflation, it doesn't matter from your perspective. One strategy to increase your wages is seeking a new employer.

2. ""When the government prints money, [...] the value of it is less [...]."" No. Imagine the Federal Reserve printing a 100 trillion dollar bill. There's basically only [$20 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) or so in existence. They take that 100T note and sit on it. It's literally under Jerome Powell's mattress. This impacts absolutely nothing- nobody notices. The real world rough equivalent of this, is quantitative easing (done in the aftermath recession, which brought much ado about ""the Fed just printing money"")

What *does* impact inflation? It's simple supply and demand. Inflation *is* changes in prices. If your grocery store sees higher costs on beef because the farmer usually feeds their cows soybeans from China (just an example), and the shipper can't find enough containers to ship all the soy, the shipper raises prices on everything they ship until they only have as many people asking for containers as they have containers to use. That means the farmer has to pay more, so their costs go up, so *if* they are going to keep selling chicken, they only can at a higher price. It had nothing to do with the fed, and everything to do with supply and demand at each stage of the value chain.

Don't get me wrong, things like Zimbabwe happen- but if you're thinking about the Federal Reserve as acting remotely like that, you're just uninformed. That's not what's happening.",guineapigfrench,t2_1e09w5w8,2,0,reddit4

You can't just expect tariffs to suddenly swing the balance in production and supply lines. First, you need some domestic overcapacity to exist in order to take advantage of tariffs. Secondly, most manufacturers will bet on tariffs being just temporary, so they won't invest in more capacity, since it is extremely risky if/when tariffs go away. It is not like current US trade deals aren't full of tariffs, restrictions and protectionism (especially for corporations and patents etc.), but manufacturers know those are probably there for the long-term. That is why sudden tariffs can often have the opposite effect of prices going up, but domestic jobs actually being lost at the same time.",lovely_sombrero,t2_wtfvl,174,0,reddit1

> Free trade consists simply in letting people buy and sell as they want to buy and sell. It is protection that requires force, for it consists in preventing people from doing what they want to do. Protective tariffs are as much applications of force as are blockading squadrons, and their object is the same‚Äîto prevent trade. The difference between the two is that blockading squadrons are a means whereby nations seek to prevent their enemies from trading; protective tariffs are a means whereby nations attempt to prevent their own people from trading. What protection teaches us, is to do to ourselves in time of peace what enemies seek to do to us in time of war. - Henry George 1886

I had the same problem trying to explain to my supervisors that while a 25 cent shift differential seems adequate to them, it is in fact far short of their local competitors. I then tried to explain how, as someone already working 12 hour graveyard shifts, the company offering a dollar of differential (and three dollars additional base) is much more attractive.
I might as well have tried to teach my cat to integrate using substitution. 

Their response : 'But this is a good company!'

""Then why do your process operators keep leaving for the two other outfits in town doing the same work but offer higher wages?""

""Because their stupid and they'll regret it.' Was the most coherent explanation I recieved, and all the supervisors laughed at the production managers joke. I find this particularly foolish and hypocritical because said production manager is always going on about how we're a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to our shareholders because money is the most important thing in the whole world, ever.

They had a special meeting on Friday because there aren't enough operators for one of the pieces of equipment. It's impossible to get enough people in to consistently cover because basically a whole crew is gone and there are only 4 operators in a shift, with 4 shifts. Not a big pool of people qualified to do overtime, and nobody wants to spend 7 days a week in there so they've been running a half crew and dealing with 3-4x as much downtime. We're running at less than half capacity because they can't be bothered to pay market wages, and trying to explain that is like trying to hammer the spaghetti of reality through a brick wall of arrogance and groupthink.",Keeper151,t2_dyr9a04,3,0,reddit1

The article even says the downturn in the steel industry accounts for a tiny fraction of jobs in Michigan but it's a wider indicator that trump simply can't get done what he says.

Then you try to equate Hunter Biden being involved with an automotive company and it selling to a Chinese firm as being the same thing as trump sinking an entire industry with his infinite stupidity.

Oh and this deal was back in 2015. Oh and you ignore all the business dealings the trump family personally has with China while trump is supposed to be running the country.

The company sold to a Chinese firm has 6,000+ employees spread out over dozens of smaller entities.

One Steel company laid off 1,250 employees this year as it shuts down operations for good.

The industry has been shedding jobs since trump took office.

75,000+ jobs lost in metal producing industries since end of last year. Estimated 175,000+ jobs lost by mid 2019. 

Michigan alone has seen 2,000+ jobs lost since the tariffs took effect. Manufacturers employ 55,100 less employees than when trump took office.

Costs are up, production is down, jobs are gone, trump has no follow up plan, but don't forget in 2015 when Hunter Biden was involved in the sale of a single automotive company to a Chinese firm which has 6,000-ish employees.

No, I'm reasonably confident this just doesn't work, and you're assuming a perpetual motion machine. You're assuming a company can extract more money from a market than it puts in, *as a result of putting that money in*. I'm not saying that can literally never happen, but I am saying that if you want to rely on this effect to save an economy, you should explain in detail how you think it works.

If you're considering paying your employees more so that your employees spend more money on your product, you will almost always make more money by simply paying your employees less. If the only people buying your product are your employees and their dependents, you will rapidly run out of money and cease to have employees.

If local incentives would cause an economy to collapse, that doesn't change the local incentives. If local incentives would cause a market to disappear, that doesn't change the local incentives. You can sometimes make an argument ""but those things haven't happened, so the incentives can't be that"", but you obviously can't make that argument here because there are other incentives in play.

And I claim that the local incentives you describe simply do not prevent these things from happening. Other incentives do, but not the local incentives of ""if we stop employing people in the US, people in the US will have less money to spend on our products"".

I'm no economist but I know a little game theory, and I basically don't think this is the case. Or to the extent that it's true, the ""because"" is actually ""because people have power over each other and use that to set up decent incentives"". Like, in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, you can get decent results; but you don't get decent results ""because if everyone defected all the time it would be bad for everyone"". Rather, you get decent results ""because, speaking broadly, tit-for-tat is an evolutionary stable strategy that gives decent results"". If you squint you can maybe kind of call that ""because it would end up worse for all of them"", but I think that's a confusing way to describe it.

Of course, even if it is true that doesn't mean the situation you're describing is is well-modeled by them.

China's government invested in their citizens, with wide coverage healthcare, decent education for most people, and relatively equal rights for women. But India, even after economic liberalization, still have an abysmal female labor force participation rate (25% vs China's 62%).

A few percent may not make much of a difference, but for trillions of dollars economies, that‚Äôs a difference of tens, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.

The United States, with the ability of its population to move from where the were born to where they work has always enabled it to be able to optimize its human capital.   Europe, seeing this, established the European Union, with its single currency and just as importantly, the ability of people to move to where the jobs are.   This  is impossible in India due to its caste system, which as Britannica notes, ""has been a dominating aspect of social organization for thousands of years.""   Social mobility is essential for a nation to achieve optimal efficiency, and productivity.    Until India moves away from this caste system, they simply cannot compete.   Of course many other nations have faced discrimination that retarded their growth, the U.S. had its slavery, and afterward racial discrimination, Europe had its many wars between what are now peaceful members.   Neither the US or the EU are perfect by any means.   But India seems to be a case study of a society, unfortunately, too firmly rooted in the past.   Until there is a real and effective effort to eliminate the caste system, India will never reach its potential, and always lag behind the developed nations.  Some will argue that part of India's problem is the tremendous theft of its resources by the British during the time they controlled India.

If they are given a task and don't know how to do it they just won't do it instead of telling you they need help or more instructions.

Both countries practiced what the USA, the EU, and China practiced: neoliberalism, but neither of them could become as developed as the three entities mentioned above. In fact, for similar reasons. Corruption and looting of state assets and government institutions by politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate leaders began to run rampant in both India and Mexico as their economies grew and developed, and as many have stated, India has focused on specific developments without focusing on the underlying infrastructure that makes the whole thing work. Mexico has the same problem, as they make shiny hospitals and highways every now and then, but even the largest cities (like CDMX) have really shitty infrastructure and you see tens of thousands of poor people living and starving on the streets of the supposed ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù megalopolises. I know a scarce amount of the economic history of India, but in Mexico, when neoliberal policies were implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by PRI officials, it enabled temporary economic growth but became largely stagnate since the privatized state assets largely came under the ownerships of corporations that had close ties to government officials (i.e, corruption, not unlike what happened in Russia during the privatization efforts after the fall of the USSR) and they established monopolies and that‚Äôs why the only other ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù are small shops that are mainly for localized areas.

1.India is least corrupt big economy. 
USA is the most corrupt big economy. 

2.Brain drain is less than 1% of indian talents so its also a non issue. 

3.Protectionism is what made China develop so fast indeed we need more of it to develop fast. 


All three points u mentioned had no base. 
You lack even basic knowledge about economy. 


The reasons behind Indias slow growth compared to china:-
1. China is an autocracy they dont need to aquire land neither they have these NGO's stopping the progress example:- just look at bullet train project in india due to lack of state government help for land acquisition and NGOs and godrej literally halted mumbai metro for over a decade such thing would never happen in china or have u ever heard of such thing in china research theres no such incident in china bcz its autocracy no one can go againsts the government not even provinces people or companies. 


2. Too defensive loan and investment strategies. China took huge debts India isn't doing so China's bullet train project was over $1Trillion dollar debt project such thing can never happen in india people would burn the nation down. 


3. China exploited alot in geopolitics took grasp of resource full small countries with debt trap like in south america china took grab of lithium mines. 
India would never do that bcz of high morale. 


4. China always copied technologies and put no regard to patterns they steal every successful pattern. They literally developed their industeies by stealing technologies from other nations.


China's bullet train is stolen from japans pattents and RND. They buikt over a stolen technology. 


Chinas smartphone industry developed from stealing iphone and samsung design patterns and pattents. 

BYD came from stealing tesla tech designs. 

Even their space program fighter jets are part to part copy of american fighter jets and space behicals. 

5. China was less than half the size (demographically) compared to India and theres was little competition back then today things are just different. 
And its simple economics bigger the economy harder it is to grow. 

India at more than twice the size of 3decades ago china. 
Will really be slow moving elephant compared to relatively smalled cheettah china was. 

China developed so fast because it exploited every single exploitable illegal and immoral practice. 

Foxconn works with no regard to human life. 
China owned lithium and cobalt mines are literl child exploitation counderies India could never do that.

Alot of it was by chance. China, too, had massive amounts of corruption, protectionism, and brain drain at Indias stage in the 80s and 90s, what it benefited from at the time was (a) lack of a sizeable industrial competitor that would considerably inhibit it reaching it's full potential (Japan, Korea, and SEA combined are not as big and nowhere nearly as cohesively integrated) , and (b) an era of fast growing Western consumer demand fueling export led growth and industrialization. These two important conditions were, to be quite honest, occurring by chance, and China just got very lucky to industrialize during this era. India is not so lucky; post 2008, Western consumer demand has stagnated considerably in contrast to the 1990s and 2000s, and India has to compete with China, a similarly sized country with a highly developed industrial sector, alongside other aspiring exporters for the ever diminishing gains of export oriented growth. The East Asian development model is past it's best by date.

2.Brain drain is less than 1% of indian talents so its also a non issue. 

3.Protectionism is what made China develop so fast indeed we need more of it to develop fast. 


All three points u mentioned had no base. 
You lack even basic knowledge about economy. 


The reasons behind Indias slow growth compared to china:-
1. China is an autocracy they dont need to aquire land neither they have these NGO's stopping the progress example:- just look at bullet train project in india due to lack of state government help for land acquisition and NGOs and godrej literally halted mumbai metro for over a decade such thing would never happen in china or have u ever heard of such thing in china research theres no such incident in china bcz its autocracy no one can go againsts the government not even provinces people or companies. 

2. Too defensive loan and investment strategies. China took huge debts India isn't doing so China's bullet train project was over $1Trillion dollar debt project such thing can never happen in india people would burn the nation down. 

3. China exploited alot in geopolitics took grasp of resource full small countries with debt trap like in south america china took grab of lithium mines. 
India would never do that bcz of high morale. 

4. China always copied technologies and put no regard to patterns they steal every successful pattern. They literally developed their industeies by stealing technologies from other nations.

China's bullet train is stolen from japans pattents and RND. They buikt over a stolen technology. 

Chinas smartphone industry developed from stealing iphone and samsung design patterns and pattents. 

BYD came from stealing tesla tech designs. 

Even their space program fighter jets are part to part copy of american fighter jets and space behicals. 

5. China was less than half the size (demographically) compared to India and theres was little competition back then today things are just different. 
And its simple economics bigger the economy harder it is to grow. 

India at more than twice the size of 3decades ago china. 
Will really be slow moving elephant compared to relatively smalled cheettah china was. 

China developed so fast because it exploited every single exploitable illegal and immoral practice. 

Foxconn works with no regard to human life. 
China owned lithium and cobalt mines are literl child exploitation counderies India could never do that. 

You see china is built on hardwork of other nations companies and people every single big technologies they have are built on stolen pattents.",engineergamer0,t2_dbm6i3ye,1,0,reddit2

Just from your comment, this bit about 20% Youth Unemployment (was peddled for 16-24 age bracket, an absolute ridiculous category in itself but made even comedically worse by the math used, i.e. they didn't use THE TOTAL people in this category, they used like 1/3 to 1/5 of that. Meaning this bracket's actual Unemployment rate was closer to 7%, equivalent to US's 4-5%).

And the Educated generation being a 1 off is even more silly. This is the first generation in PRC history (really 4000 Years of Chinese history in fact) that is the most educated EVER.

Modern China was build by the generation that was young in Cultural Revolution time, meaning barely having half the Education Years of today's Chinese generation or even a peer semi-developed country. That is the generation that did all what China is today.

To then expect that getting a next generational cohort that is Twice as educated as the last and economic repercussions will be negative is bending over backwards mental gymnastics of Elite Olympics level.

OK. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan. Japan, by the way, was already a developed nation pre-war, and since it largely retained it's knowledge base that have it inherent advantages to recover their position by the 60s, and as the pioneer of the East Asian export development model, they faced much less export competition in the crucial years Kickstart ING their miracle. South Korea and Taiwan are both tiny nations that are strong US allies and are thus privileged with market access and tech transfers. Singapore and Hong Kong do not count since both are wealthy trading entrepots. China also hasn't fully achieved advanced developed status yet with this model (though they seem to have enough escape velocity to escape the middle income trap) 

Now, there's plenty of examples of countries that only developed halfway before stagnating in the late 90s.

- Phillipines 
- Thailand
- Indonesia (though they've started to recover some growth prospects on recent years) 
- Malaysia

Burma and Pakistan are obviously basket cases, which leaves Vietnam, India and Bangladesh. If you notice, Vietnam is not growing anywhere near as fast as China or South Korea were growing at the same level, and Vietnam is also priveleged with a land border with the world's largest supply chin.

This statement is absurd at a meta level. Every low income country has the problems of being a low income country - that's what makes it desirable to transition into a high-income country in the first place.

Instead of using nonsensical crystal balls to predict the future, you could just read up literally any global macroeconomic report to find that India has been growing at 7% for the last 20-25 years. China did better because they grew at 11-12% for a decade or so. Sophisticated math alert but 7% is not as big as 12%, but it is not as small as 4%.

As things stand, India is projected to grow at a steady, albeit not a particularly brisk clip.

kfkyyxr,t1_kfkoao0,2023-12-30 18:00:48,Economics,"I broadly agree. Caste system is extremely complicated thing - in some parts of India (North and Northwest),it is    tied to your ethnicity/ancestry with studies showing that people of different castes have different haplogroups, whereas in other parts, it is purely a social construct. Another reason why caste system is difficult to dismantle is because there is a hierarchy of 100s of castes - not just 3-4 castes as some people think. Each caste feels superior to the caste just below it even though both of these castes may be considered ""backward"".

While caste system is primarily associated with Hinduism, Indian Muslims, Christians, Sikhs - all practice it.

Intercaste marriage is extremely rare in India - similar to the rate of Interracial marriage in the US 50 yrs ago.

I don't think the comparison with East Asia is appropriate for a variety of reasons. Each East Asian country is way more homogeneous than India. Religion has never been an important part of East Asian culture - this has nothing to with communism in China. Countries like Taiwan, SK and Japan have significant irreligious population. Lastly one of the good things about maoism is that they got rid of several misogynist practices in China and championed women's rights.

So, in conclusion, to create a socio-economic order similar to EA in India, there has to be a brutal communist uprising (10 times more brutal than Maoist China) that wil force every Indian to marry outside their caste and even religion. Even then, there would be lots of other fault lines (like ethnolinguist identities) that might lead to Balkanization of India.

A more pragmatic thing is to ban medieval practices like untouchability (banned in 1950, but still happens a lot in some parts) and give proportional representation to all the castes in jobs and education (happens , but is riddled with corruption).",aishikpanja,t2_flqqli24u,1,0,reddit2

The reason why access money works in China but not other places is that China is centralized and fewer people have to be paid off. The counter balance to that is that these folks who take bribes are measured by their performance in order to move forward in their scope and power within the government. So if they take a bribe that ended up not being in the interests of the party they are quickly weeded out and often jailed. This causes a dynamic for them to take bribes but only in areas that can be perceived as benefitting the party and it‚Äôs socialist agenda and hence things move forward.

In India or US, they are decentralized so it‚Äôs much more people to bribe, and the officials have no counter balance so if these deals do not benefit the people or even at all deliver they continue to be in office and nothing changes.",ekw88,t2_aldhe,14,0,reddit2

Let's say you want to discover a new material, you'd need to measure it's electrical, magnetic properties, you might need to first look at the atomic structure, grain boundaries and design in situ experiments under a Microscope. And then optimise, theorise and figure out new ways of achieving more suitable properties by using more sophisticated synthesis methods..  Any big discovery has a barrage of failed experiments which provides the insights to make it successful. Money and support is key to sustain it, and having high tech equipments allow researcher to apply more potential solutions.
Now, a lab in USA which has a high resolution in situ TEM with direct detectors. Vs a lab in India which doesn't have access to or cannot afford the latest detector set up. The chances and opportunities to explore and stumble upon the next big thing is higher in the US lab. 

Take the example of sea farers of the past. Research is similar to searching for islands in the ocean.

The answer is that they DO. They are not working as much in Government jobs or Private registered corporation (though that is increasing). 

There is a massive service and manufacturing sector in India that are unreported due to the lack of registration and exemption of taxes. Women in India are not sitting at home idly watching TVs (well exept the rich ones). Many of them work in their own household businesses, agriculture and enabling their family. They also work in their own household caring for their own and relative's children, teahcing them when they are young, prepare food for their family.

Imagine how large the contribution of food & hospitality industry, child care & day care industry etc. contribute to a developed economy and all of them exist in a different form in India. People almost always eat at home, and there's almost no culture of sending children to daycare - partly due to culture and partly due to cost. Many women particpate in minimum wage job equivalent but they are unregulated and unreported. 

I would advise taking a trip to India for significant time (its vast and diverse, it is called a subcontinent) and explore if you don't believe me. Of course the economy & culture is very different than the Western world so it might seem weird to you. 

The important thing I wanted to point out overall that there is very little stopping a woman to achieve her dreams if she is so inclined in pursuing higher skilled research / jobs (yes exceptions do exist in remote areas but it is a massive country with massive population) - especially in 2023. This does not mean that there aren't people with outdated perceptions of how a woman should live but they are a minority.

Border settlement is insanely hard from Indian political dynamic but it is not impossible, it just needs a greater Political Capital Spend (by the leader, party in power and so on).

China has no other option. It can't force a short-timeframe/immediate Ratification (this very problem itself arose because of such a dynamic, i.e. British and then Independent India forcing an Illegal 1914 agreement onto China as being Ratified when it never was. Hence China can't do that to India anyway).

This is why in large parts PRC retreated back in 1962 at end of War because EVEN IF it had held the territories they still would not have gotten a Ratification since India would still have gone, ""We still claim it"". The end result being same, i.e. Disputed, Unresolved Border.

China wants Border resolution (their Land border track record is objective proof of it & offering India multiple status quo deals also adds to this). It has been frustrated by India despite it knowing why India is doing what it is doing (domestic politics).

But China has small operating room, it was begrudgingly fine till 2000s with long timeline for resolution (just like India, which wouldn't have minded it it was resolved 50-60-80 years from now). But post Pivot to Asia and all what happened in 2010s China's own internal timeline shifted, it had to do something because Not doing anything was a Net-Negative.

It is trying to budge India from that 50-60-80+ years internal timeline to shorter decades. That is all China can do.

jutei9f,t1_ju7aivq,2023-08-04 21:28:21,Economics,"Disagree on most fronts. Russia was a great power but that had more to do with its sheer size than its economic capabilities. Russia was the last holdout of serfdom in Europe by something like 100 years. And the serfs weren‚Äôt just a small % of the population but the overwhelming majority. They lacked true middle class and as a result of stagnant societal structure they lacked educational and economically far behind powers such as America, Britain, and Germany. They were heavily agrarian until the end of the first revolution at which point all parties that tried to fill the power vacuums stressed the importance of the industrialization. The communist speed ran industrialization hardcore and took them from a ‚Äúwet behind the ears‚Äù industrialized country pre WW1 to an industrial super power in the 50s-60s

US was agrarian but even by WW1 we were ahead of Britain and France in terms of raw output and we were not recovering from
The civil war which was over 50 years ago. We may not have gotten over the civil war socially/culturally but economically we hadn‚Äôt just recovered but expanded into a economic superpower. By WW2 we outproduced every single country involved in the conflict, and I believe outproduced all major powers combined. 

Even with all this strength in production the USSR became a threat in a matter of decades despite numerous bloody conflicts during that same
Period which is truly remarkable. Authoritarianism is great for single minded clear plans of trying to play catch up because the goals are easy to see ‚Äúcatch up to the world by copying their playbook‚Äù but it creates stagnation once you get to the top due to limited vision/voice from others.",Mando_Commando17,t2_a52dg2nq,2,0,reddit2

This isn‚Äôt new. Beef consumption bans have been in place in different parts of India for over 2000 years. And much more since the vegetarian influence of Jainism and Buddhism grew to influence Hinduism.

Even under certain Mughal rulers beef consumption was banned as to not stoke civil unrest amongst the majority hindu population by the Muslim rulers.

So it‚Äôs nothing new introduced recently.

It is a sacred animal. Some people will get upset if you mess with that.

Secularism in india is about pluralism. It does not mean anti-religion (like it does in the west). Mainly because there are so many religions in india and much of it is not organized or centralized religion so it is much more flexible in what is believed and accepted at any time in order to try to accommodate everyone. Hinduism for example is practiced very differently from family to family and community to community.

There are some Hindus that are fine eating beef also and have done so for centuries. Usually these people are from tribal areas whose leaders were fine with it.

Preferences and practices of what is acceptable differ from region to region, province to province and town to town in india. So it‚Äôs very tough to generalize anything about india.
