it's a little like student loan forgiveness as an issue. yeah, this is a problem, but it's hard not to be cynical when an issue that very disproportionately affects the upper middles is given such an outsized amount of attention, and even harder to trust that the pmc won't immediately turn around and attempt to widen the class divide further if they win these fights.

especially when there are only halfhearted attempts at returning solidarity by amplifying blue collar union efforts, and mutters about ""no ethical consumption"" from wfhers who have been living off amazon and doordash for 3 years. 

e: if white collars want it to be celebrated then they need to mend the yawning chasm they created imo. to generalize a bit, white collars have for a long time steadfastly refused to coalition build in order to gain an economic advantage. if they (we, but I'm leaving myself out of it) want the rest of the workforce to stand with them, they need to start standing with other workers *as workers* first. as it is, wfhers aren't upset because rto is bad *for workers*, but because it's bad *for them*.",Ok_Yogurtcloset8915,t2_nfs38rxi,18,0,reddit2

So of the job Boston can be done from home in Boston, it can be done from someone who lives in bum nowhere America-where cost of living maybe lower. 

I support people‚Äôs choices to WFH. But I won‚Äôt pretend to understand the long term impacts of it. 

I think the movement can be great for certain folks..but it has every potential to shoot itself in the foot too. Because automatically, people who take jobs that require their presence in the work place, will automatically become of more value. In addition not having to commute to work and work less overall, will lower personal costs to the employee-however that fact- it will be not lost on employers and wages will reflect that accordingly. If you value freedom, then fair enough-but your wages will only diminish. I can‚Äôt see it going any other way.

It will be a lot easier to replace someone who is an email and team meeting jockey, with someone who is cheaper or with advancing technology, than someone who has to physically be present to complete their job.

**Secondly**, the weighted voting rests on the assumption that 'racialized people' have more of a right to vote on any issue related to race - which, in the splinter bomb of  a society in which we live, is ***everything*** - than any white member. 

Being a certain race doesn't give your opinion more weight. Saying that it does is race essentialism, although I hear the kids are now calling it ""racism"", because it presumes that every race indelibly applies attributes and character traits to every person. 

Being white means something about your character (literally - see: whiteness). 

Being white means that your vote matters less.

**Third**, [**71 percent of Ontario is white**](https://worldpopulationreview.com/canadian-provinces/ontario-population). 

How in the sweet holy hell do they expect to get 50% non-white quorum? (Hint: they don't. This is just their rationalization for hate. Hate always has a rationalization.)

**Fourth**, they prevent people debating or objecting to this measure by censoring the words people have to explain what's happening. 

This is truly the point where they started acting more like fascists than unionists.

**Fifth**, this is not legal in Canada. You can contact the Human Rights Commission here: **info@ohrc.on.ca** to make sure they're aware of this explicit racism.

If they condone it, all the better. Normally accelerationism is guaranteed to hurt the poor before anyone else but in this case I'm all in favour of them outright agreeing to explicit racism.

Although I disagree with this fully, I can see how something like this could be voted in. Working in a union I have experienced how difficult 'democratic' decisions and representation can be. 

A group in the union I work for are trying to increase representation and diversity within our membership to make the Union ultimately represent our community (the people we are supposed to represent) but it's very hard to make it work due to issues with capacity and the people with the most power in the union pretending they don't hold that type of power. As a result you end up with people like me and others trying to get things done who ultimately don't have the time to really do this shit properly because we are volunteers.

Also **because most people score poorly on implicit association tests**, because a lot of white people will get anxious if they see a black man on a deserted street late at night, and because if you prime people with traditionally white versus traditionally black names they will answer questions differently in psychology experiments. **It is no shame to be racist as long as you admit that you are racist and you try your best to resist your racism. Everyone knows this.**
> 
> **Donald Sterling is racist. We know this because he made a racist comment in the privacy of his own home. As a result, he was fined $2.5 million**, banned for life from an industry he‚Äôs been in for thirty-five years, banned from ever going to basketball games, forced to sell his property against his will, **publicly condemned by everyone from the President of the United States on down**, denounced in every media outlet from the national news to the Podunk Herald-Tribune, **and got people all over the Internet gloating about how pleased they are that he will die soon.

Currently where I live gov spends 53% of all income in the country and spends it bad. We're indebted up to our ears. If you're middle class you can reach 60%+ effective taxes easily, especially if one of your main monthly costs is fuel (which is over 50% taxes)",Daktush,t2_d39js,0,0,reddit3

Yes. Though there's a layer of complication in that buses and trams are handled by local authorities. So income tax doesn't factor into it in this context.

There may be council tax implications but the example I'm most familiar with - Edinburgh - actually runs a profit making (pre-covid anyway) bus operation that's the best I've seen in all of Britain. So I don't expect that municipally run buses in Edinburgh's case impacts residents' council tax bills.

Compare to Glasgow where buses are more expensive, less frequent, proportionally cover less of the city. And privately run.

I've got two friends who have tried to unionize their workplaces, both ran into this wall immediately. There's this overwhelming ""don't rock the boat"" sentiment, almost no one seems to understand collective power. If they did, even a little bit, so many employers would be in an extremely precarious position, most wouldn't even be able to fire 3 or 4 people at once.  

Anyway the one guy is a truck driver and he actually succeeded, but then in their contract negotiations the company said ""we'll give a raise to anyone who leaves the union"" and they all immediately caved. They had the company by the balls, dead to rights, and just folded. You can't make this shit up.

It started to be this way in the 80s once MBAs took over but now post covid it has hit such a massive breaking point. It is honestly getting completely ridiculous especially with how specialized employees can be now.

 My favorite recent example in my life is I have an uncle that among other duties maintains some equipment for a medical company that is incredibly mission critical if it goes down they lose thousands of dollars per hour. It is so important that him and his coworker/friend that also does the job are not allowed to both take days off on the same day (sucked for them they liked to go fishing together). Right now both are in retirement age and his friend has gone to part time in preparation for retirement and my uncle is probably gonna retire soon. Here is the problem the company refuses to hire anyone for them to train to replace them so once they retire the company is going to lose thousands of dollars per hour because trying to replace them is going to take at least a year. It is a highly specialized job requiring years of experience/knowledge that they want to transfer to someone else but the company won't hire a replacement because it would cost more in the short term.

This is still the party line.

Those that believe that those still masking are just virtue signalling do so because they don't believe that others could still think that masks are¬†effective (since many people spent the last few years getting sick despite wearing¬†N95 masks), and¬†because¬†COVID is never going away so masking now is masking forever (so obviously crazy that they presume an ulterior motive for masking).

* The LinkedIn profile that linked the person to LM said they were an Engineer.

Can't say much more since the LinkedIn profile was deleted, but it's a bit odd.
* Supposedly the person has worked at LM in some capacity for 15 years (not sure what the source of that is). That's a long time to have a bullshit nepotism job at a publicly traded corporation and not a family business. with some googling you can find out who her LM employee father is, and it's not a super high level position. So this is not entirely believable.
* If you assume uninterrupted employment for 15 years straight out of college, that'd still give you a reasonable chance that this LM parent isn't even there anymore and is retired.
* After admitting they had a job ""procuring licenses"" or whatever, they said ""that's why they know so much about Creative Commons."" This is supposed to corroborate the story, but it's weak.

Nonetheless, there is a long tradition( going back to the ancients) of understanding the need for leisure and freedom from work( Aristotle even remarked on how if machines worked by themselves there would be no need for slaves, and that   leisure  was the the precondition for intellectual liberation and the pursuit of higher things.) Freedom from work is not freedom from execration but instead freedom  from the coercive  relation that one has to one's creative and productive efforts( *exploitation* in the Marxian jargon) 

   This freedom from exploitation was the precondition for a communist society. 

 This idea that people need to be have some incentive to produce things is likely true, nonetheless at an advanced stage of technical development the numbers of things produced vs the time and people it takes to produce them will drop.  When this stage is reached work will become an optional affair for those who have the desire to actualize some special talent or other, to develop their bodies with excises and physical augmentation, to learn new skills or engage in recreational affairs( spiritual sexual, etc.).  Many will choose to make no real contribution to social order, but they won't need to so it matter much,  A society at the level I envision will be able to abolish most forms of mental illness through biogenetic/chemical intervention, and so no need to worry about social maladjustment. 

 This whole process will be run be run through an advanced system  of  quantum computing that will regulate production and distribution down to the letter.

I realized that even though I was only working 1-2 hours a day instead of 8 and the projects were of my own choosing, I still had a lot of mental stress and anxiety about it. My value as a person and sense of self was still all wrapped up in my productive value. Was I a lazy loser or could I stay strong and disciplined.

My point is, for me work is not just about the type of work or the number of hours or the compensation (although those things obviously matter) but is really about a way of seeing myself. Even though my labor was not needed by anyone, there was still a boss inside me and that boss has expectations and judgments. For me, this is the heart of capitalism, that everything, everyone has a value that can be measured against everyone else and those values are determined by those in power, whether it is the cool kids in high school, your boss at McDonalds or the elected representative of the workers collective.

It is theorized that part of the reason for this is that capitalists want to keep us occupied so as to keep us out of leftist movement, and also because worker bees make good consoomers.

Rather than find new ways to keep people occupied so that they can earn their paycheck, it just makes sense that as people's jobs become obsolete they are then liberated from the act of working. Not every can or should be retooled into modern but productive positions. Automation means there are less necessary jobs. The peak of society is where everyone equipped to innovate and solve human problems does so, and everyone else spends their lives learning and otherwise finding ways to occupy themselves in a satisfying way. Freedom from the workplace does not mean total idleness, it means control over where, how much, and in what way people occupy themselves.

My dream would've been a world where people only worked for one or two days a week, or maybe a quarter of the years of their lifespan, for important civic duties, with the rest of the time devoted to idleness and projects they voluntarily find themselves drawn to. This would have necessarily meant a much smaller economy with a much smaller population where people consumed far less. It also meant an industrial standard of living could have been sustained for many centuries and humanity wouldn't go extinct from the various environmental catastrophes it's stacking up, which is becoming an increasingly remote possibility.

Think about it. The current state of our work fetishizing world is psychotically stupid and suicidal. There are more people alive right now than ever before in human history, and all of them are at a constant grind of nonstop ceaseless work. This includes the wealthy, who unlike the obsolete stereotype of idle shirkers, are usually constantly working at ways to expand and increase their fortune. We can say with absolute certainty that we are doing more work now than ever before. The problem is that the vast majority of this work is at best banal. Most of the time it is actively destructive.

 We inherited an incredible gift in the form of fossil energy that took millions of years to accumulate and we've frittered it away on incredibly stupid vanity projects that will not outlast us, at the cost of poisoning our atmosphere and driving most of the fauna and flora on the planet into irreversible extinction. It's fucking stupid as shit.

The irony is that because of all our idiotic work we're only driving ourselves ever deeper into ecological debt that will be impossible to pay back because we spent the fossil fuels needed to pay it off. There's actually important work we need to be doing, like planting trees or conserving the ever dwindling wild species that exist on our planet, that no one does and no one is interested in. That's because the payoff would only exist many generations into the future and outside a normal human lifespan. Much easier to just cut the nearest forest down and convert it into toothpicks and cardboard, because then you'll get an instant payout. And then you can look at your toothpick and cardboard empire and feel proud of all the ""work"" you did!

Work should be fulfilling. A lot of work under in modern times is inherently unfulfilling, most likely by design. There's a reason a lot of Communist propaganda focused on the nationalistic and communal reliance one has on farmers and laborers despite the economics of how they were managed: unfulfilling work leads to a reactionary response to the concept of work overall.

I think a lot of anti-work stuff is overcompensation for people not wanting to be wage slaves. Or it's from people who are so inherently privileged that they find fulfillment in personal/non-work labor and therefore see work as useless.

More than anything there needs to be a shift in focus towards the fulfillment inherent in contributing to society (virtues of selflessness and comradery in the real sense) that goes along with shit like control of ones' labor and social safety nets, otherwise people will just want not work so they can play with their Funko Pops or whatever the fuck /r/antiwork actually does with their time because that kind of hedonistic/selfish shit is the only way to achieve ""fulfillment"" in modern consumerist driven culture.",GOLIATHMATTHIAS,t2_bi5qf,11,0,reddit2

I think it stems from the hopelessness of work in this system. You're not valued, you're expendable. You're not a person, you're a number. Your inherent worth doesn't matter, only what you produce. You work like a slave and can often have little to show for it.

It's a brutally demoralizing prospect. I think abolish work whether it's warranted or not is so appealing. I also think it's why so many young people want to become viral or influencers. They aren't stupid. They know that they won't strain the standard their parents or grandparents had. They'll just be making someone else's dreams come true.

I personally subscribe to the work is holy notion. Meaningful, fulfilling, and useful work is a benefit to the individual and society.

In our kind of world, the workers will control their destiny and the fruits of their labor. We'll have a centrally planned system and workplace democracy. All work will be valued. A janitor will get the same respect as a surgeon.

All workers will benefit from strong unions and a strong safety net. The disabled and the retired will especially have a very strong safety net.

As an anti work leftie, this is one of the reasons I'm NOT a marxist. Because I know that marxism is no salvation to someone who is anti work, as Bob Black said, marxists believe in labor more fiercely than anyone else, because they believe so little in anything else. 

Here's the thing. I dont give AF about communism. It's another jobist ideology. 

The thing about a lot of ideologies people fail to understand is they're developed in specific contexts and hundreds of years later dont make sense. Conservatism is based on Lockean philosophy of the 1700s. Leftism is based on the Marxist philosophy of the 1800s. Modern liberalism and social democracy arose in the 20th century, and neoliberalism in the late 20th century.

Often, these ideologies develop in response to specific problems and crises. Enlightenment philosophy arose in response to the divine right of kings and pushed for what we consider the basis of modern democratic society. Marxist philosophy arose out of the tyrannies of modern capitalism and in the aftermath of the revolutionary fervor of France. Liberal philosophy and social democracy arose out of an attempt to achieve a third way within western societies that maintained capitalism but still took care of people. Neoliberalism was a bunch of rich people waiting for Keynesianism to show its flaws and served as a counter revolutionary ideology to shift the balance of power back to the right. But it made a lot of sense in the late 70s/early 80s.

Marx offered a lot of valid critiques of capitalism, many of which are still valid today. But, it was developed in a time in which capitalism was just emerging, meaning it dealt with the worst of it, and its answers to it involved destroying it and replacing it with another system, and communism made sense given the technological limitations of the time.

But, liberalism achieved gains in reforming capitalism in the 1930s and while they amounted to band aids, I'd argue that's more successful in its track record than socialism or communism. I dont believe workers owning the means of production means an ideal society. Heck, at this point its just another regressive jobist ideology.

The problems of today involve the working classes being hollowed out by technological changes disrupting their quality of life while leaving them without work. My entire life has been this never ending drudgery of creating jobs and creating work. And it's old. I dont want more jobs. I dont want more work, I dont want more drudgery. I want liberation from this ****ty system. I dont want some ""workers paradise"" like marxists want. I dont care about the labor theory of value. The way I see it, my ideal society is more jetsons or star trek. Everyone has a high living standard, people dont really have to work, or if they do, work hours are very small and limited. 

In an age where automation does a lot more, and we have potential solutions like basic income, I'd rather pursue that. Give everyone a basic income, let us work less. In another generation or two, maybe we can reach a state where we can get away from work entirely, but for now, let's focus on establishing the preliminary phases of doing so. 

The left needs a new, 21st century ethos, marxism is 19th century and comes off as horribly regressive at this point. It's a luddite philosophy as far as im concerned. 

If you're capitalist, i encourage you to read books like yang's the war on normal people, or the book utopia for realists. if you're more leftist, I'd recommend Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams.

That's a gross oversimplification. Have you read Lafargue?

> But it is not in their best interests to house and feed people who willingly choose not to contribute to society.

That's a classic slippery slope: you start with dividing people up into ""deserving"" and ""undeserving"" and end up with the bureaucratic nightmare that are the remnants of the welfare state in the West. I believe people deserve basic sustenance as a right, regardless of what they do or don't do. Also - see above - there are productive activities not recognised as work. Also, there is no way to verify whether a person ""contributes to society"" - it's too general of a category to have any operative meaning (does caring about your friends, hosting parties and chatting with people on the phone ""contribute to society""? I think it does).

At the same time, workers obviously shouldn‚Äôt be compelled by force to work (as was often the case in previous modes of production). I think the simplest solution is the following: guarantee basic needs, distribute other goods in exchange for non-circulating labour vouchers. I have strong reservations about labour vouchers too, however.

The main issue with what you‚Äôre presenting is the idea that workers receive the ‚Äúfull bounty of their labour‚Äù. This sounds far more like Proudhon‚Äôs ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù than Marxism. Socialism isn‚Äôt about the workers receiving fuller wages, it‚Äôs about the abolition of the wages system in general.

Moreover - as socialists, we absolutely should be interested in shortening the work day over time.

Apparently we'll laze around all day indulging an idle bourgeois-bohemian consumerist lifestyle, but everything will still magically get done somehow. 

The dumber anarkiddie types literally cannot see the contradiction between making work entirely ""voluntary"" and guaranteeing everyone's needs are met. Point it out to them and they'll throw a fit and call you a ""fascist"". The smarter ones will at least acknowledge the problem, and posit some kind of techno-futurist unicorn farts that will accomplish the outsourcing of the entire economy to robot-workers. Ironically this makes their politics indistinguishable from that of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos; if the true driver of the historical dialectic is technology and not class struggle, then why even bother to organize the workers? Why not just put your faith in Silicon Valley to create Fully Automated Luxury Communism?

I'll concede there could exist a technically communistic economy that's like Wall-E, where all provision of the most base human needs is automated by machines and the humans are all just catatonic dopamine addicts who need robot slaves to change their diapers. However this is such a repugnant, meaningless, and spiritually dead vision of human life that communists should vigorously oppose it anyway. The point of communism is to promote human flourishing as the inherently creative and mutually collaborative beings they are, to *unalienate* labor, not abolish labor.

People who have a problem with it, in my opinion, simply lack the imagination to visualise humans fulfilling a higher purpose when liberated from the most base forms of labour that are still a necessity today. I earnestly believe the vast majority of people would still take it upon themselves to learn, study, and create.

Obviously it's not something that's realistically possible today, nor will it be for the next several hundred years. It's a Star Trek sci-fi fantasy, but it's a worthwhile vision and a noble goal. Humanity can't tie itself to the factory and the fields forever.

Perhaps more importantly though, places like r/antiwork are excellent recruiting grounds to get people on board with materialist left wing politics.

The goal here is to make work more voluntary, while balancing incentives still needed to encourage people to do it.

In the long term we can talk about abolishing work more completely, but given we still need some people to do work, and some people still like work and wanna do it, I say we trend toward a society where people get to choose what they wanna do, and if they choose nothing, let them.

The fact no one's mentioned the idea of a Polytechnic to uplift people in alienating labour hasn't been mentioned til your comment. I never understand people who balk at the idea of a society of people who could do the work of engineers or scientists or technicians or anything from bottom to top because in their minds, way at the back in the dark, they secretly think the average person isn't anything worth fighting for, let alone worth uplifting. The proles can be happy turning spanners but don't get it into their head they can build a society where each member aspire to the fullness of his being. Of course the world needs janitors and ditch diggers etc but why is it so absurd to picture a janitor doing his cleaning on a Monday to it's completion and then working in a lab on Tuesday? This doesn't degrade the idea of work, it gives a man his most versatile expression of his being through variety of work.

i hate incentives under capitalism, but there are  or can be pro-social incentives.

also this: don't FORCE one person (or sub group, or type of person) to be the scapegoat.  if there is necessary but crappy work, make all engage with it in a communal fashion for a very limited time each week/month/whatever.

that episode where Gandhi's wife is complaining about having to clean the latrine (because it is ""beneath"" her)comes to mind, here.

yes, there are some jobs that can be considered chores, where only the very few would find fulfillment doing them.  the trick is not to place someone in that job permanently forevermore and then develop some kind of social stigma about it and them.

right now, our most essential but ""crappy"" work is what?  someone above said wiping the asses of alzheimer's patients.  yeah, but that isn't the only thing those people do.  and if they only had to do that kind of thing a few days a week, and some other type of more fulfilling work the rest of the time, it might be more bearable.  (how about the rest of the time working in a lab helping to find a cure for alzheimer's?).  and if they got paid well and/or their needs are well taken care of, then they would resent doing it less.  right now we make the most essential workers suffer more financially and through degrading them and denigrating them socially.  

we are all really limited in our thinking here because we haven't experienced anything except capitalist slavery and various steps of favortism within it for certain privileged people, under the guise that they are ""smarter"" or better, or doing something ""more important"". we need to not only remove our attitudes about various kinds of work (and who does them) but remove our preconceptions about how work is carried on in the day to day.",No-Literature-1251,t2_7ez14fcq,1,0,reddit2

I mean that's kind of the thing. I think most people of coherent and rational thought forsee the hypothetical post scarcity utopia as enabling humanity to devote it's attention towards higher forms of cultural, scientific and artistic achievements; not just to sit on its ass and get fat.

Work will always be there because I sincerely doubt anybody would be happy to just sit and watch TV their whole life. Just ask anyone who has been on unemployment benefits in a country with welfare generous enough to let you do that. It's great at first, but after the first couple months it's fucking boring.

In fact I'd go further than that, and suggest that the desire to do so at all is merely a condition of capitalist alienation and the influence of bourgeois propaganda. Your worldview is rooted in some highly protestant belief that without the purifying virtue of necessary work, mankind would fall to the sins of gluttony and sloth. But I'd argue that that's not the case, instead it is a reflection of the motivation system capitalism encourages, where your reward for being successful is earning the right to be lazy.

Organization can push for better labor conditions, I dont see a contradiction.

>Why not just put your faith in Silicon Valley to create Fully Automated Luxury Communism?

Because maybe things are a bit more complicated than who owns the means of production? Like, this is a really dishonest and hacky take. Clearly ownership is a problem. If a select few own everything and wont share, then clearly the gains of distribution wont go to the people. But if you guys had your way we'd likely end up with the USSR again where it takes 3 clerks to sell a piece of meat, or china where they turn infrastructure projects into ""jobs programs"" and encourage everyone to shovel rather than using modern technology.

The point is, given your dictatorial nature and your dedication to jobs as a way of life, you're just as, if not more than a threat than jeff bezos or elon musk at actually establishing a good future. The industrialists are greedy to the point of being evil, but your ideology is just as regressive. 

>I'll concede there could exist a technically communistic economy that's like Wall-E, where all provision of the most base human needs is automated by machines and the humans are all just catatonic dopamine addicts who need robot slaves to change their diapers. However this is such a repugnant, meaningless, and spiritually dead vision of human life that communists should vigorously oppose it anyway.

And likewise I oppose your desire to coerce people to work for all eternity even if we develop the technology to overcome these problems.

What a dumbass statement. Of course a social democrat will say such nonsense.

Silicon Valley will not create FALC precisely because it is not in their class interests, and the logic of captialism prevents such a possibility happening. How one uses technology is the crucial point, and who wield it is how class struggle drives history.

We've already been automating jobs. There are entire communities ruined by the shifts things like automation and outsourcing have caused in the past 40 years. It's only gonna accelerate in coming decades.

We literally spend so much time talking about endless ""job creation"", we live in a society where we literally struggle to employ people. And the jobs that exist are low wage service sector garbage no one really wants to do. The fact is, we dont NEED people working like we did in the past. 

Obviously we cant transition completely out of work overnight. Thats where YOUR fundamental misunderstanding is. Im not advocating no one ever work again starting tomorrow. Society would implode. But obviously trying to create the perfect job for everyone is bull**** too and we should recognize reality as it is, and give everyone a UBI now, while still offering incentives to work. Thats the transition phase. That's the grand compromise. And from there, we can simply adjust the levers of things over time depending on where things go and maybe one day we can do away with work altogether. But that day likely won't happen in our lifetimes.

>How do we keep a basic standard of living if people aren‚Äôt working? 

if no one works because you give people $13k a year, then you lower it until they DO work to the point society isnt under a threat of collapse. But I doubt most would stop working over $13k a year. 

>Under socialism you will work less, and even less as time goes on. if you aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs probably a terrible implementation. Cutting out capitalist inefficiency and reallocating labor is the first step to the future you desire.

yeah, except we dont see this, because most socialist regimes seem to be run by rigid authoritarian ideologues who believe work is integral to well being.

It also undermines the idea of food and shelter as a right rather than reward for one's work.

The much easier thing is to introduce policies that encourage people to rebuild their local communities devastated by capitalism, to establish unions, to choose their occupation and place of work as freely as possible, without the danger of losing basic economic security or being branded a parasite, and they will work, because (well, I'm a Marxist, what can I say) it is, in fact, a part of human nature. If some won't work, that's still a small price to pay for the freedom of the others.

Insofar as we consider things as ""work"" when they're productive from a broadly social perspective, writing very much fulfills the definition, even (and maybe especially) if the main purpose is to read your short story to your local community center or whatever and share it with your immediate neighbours. Unless you want to use the capitalists' understanding of productivity instead... Harvey has a very good critique of this idea, that we can basically leave the capitalist law of value intact and just change the structure of production so it's more egalitarian or state-controlled or whatever. This is not socialism. One of the main goals on any communist's agenda should be to allow people to rebuild the ties that bind together these organic, local communities - be it in the workplace, or at home, or in the neighbourhood.

The white-collar work culture in Japan/Korea/China most people refer to when they say this values perception of hard work over measurable productivity. 

You might finish all your work for the day in two hours but have to sit at your desk looking busy for another eight just to look hardworking to your bosses. Then you might typically spend another four hours after the workday officially ends going out binge-drinking with your boss and colleagues just to look like a team player. 

Finally you maybe go home and grab a couple hours of sleep, maybe you just crash out wherever you can and then you wake up bright and early the next day to do it all again.

It's why you'll see a ton of office workers totally passed out on the subway during morning rush hour in those countries who somehow manage to get up just in time to get off at their stop for work.

Assuming you mean laundronats for industries, that can be largely automated. It's just cheaper to use people. If you mean laundromats regular people use, those either wouldn't exist under socialism (washing machines for everyone ho) or be collevtively managed by the people who use them.

I don't think someone who criticises wage-slavery and feels deeply unhappy about it is a parasite, but I would believe they would become one if they leeched off their parents, their brothers, their friends and so on. Basically, as you said, they need to be criticized.

Right now, yes. As communists living under capitalism our goals should be to improve working conditions, rebuild unions, and help our local communities. But our messaging shouldn't be anti-work because A) it doesn't make sense until automation (which is basically science fiction) and B) as you stated a lot of people find their work fulfilling, even under capitalism.

On the point of unemployment being necessary to move into a ""better"" career, that's a thing in market economies not demand ones. People should absolutely be encouraged to learn new skills that make them more valuable, but even in a society where that's fully realized we will need to people to work dirty jobs and it shouldn't be seen as degrading or beneath a doctor to work in a factory.

I want people to have the freedom to choose what kind of work they'd like to do, but this whole thing will fall apart if everyone is making pottery and nobody cleans out the sewer, so there's obviously a balancing act there.

Edit: worth adding that the 8 hour day has as much to do with what Henry Ford figured out was the limit of what he could get out of his factory workers using the manufacturing methods of the day without losing more productivity than he'd get out of making them work longer as it does with the labor movement.

No offense but this **is** a historically amnesiac take. One major reason a lot of modern jobs are boring / mind-numbing is because of increasing specialization and division of labor. But you cannot have an advanced society without specialization and division of labor, as every serious socialist theory of alienation since the 19th century has recognized. 

A second reason is that a lot of socially necessary labor sucks because large and ineluctable portions of life suck. Wiping old people's asses sucks.

gx4yuvw,t1_gx4rgw6,2021-05-06 11:21:28,stupidpol,"> But our messaging shouldn't be anti-work because A) it doesn't make sense until automation (which is basically science fiction) and B) as you stated a lot of people find their work fulfilling, even under capitalism.

This is something I can completely get behind (although automation is obviously happening and will only accelerate, it's not like we're anywhere near automating away the majority of manual and factory jobs worldwide). Post-work should never mean anti-work. 

> On the point of unemployment being necessary to move into a ""better"" career, that's a thing in market economies not demand ones. People should absolutely be encouraged to learn new skills that make them more valuable, but even in a society where that's fully realized we will need to people to work dirty jobs and it shouldn't be seen as degrading or beneath a doctor to work in a factory.

I don't think that's the point I was trying to make (about the unemployment). Anyway, yeah, sure - that's why we need to organise society in such a way that the traditionally undesired jobs are rewarding enough to be actually attractive (be it through the organisation of the workplace or some external benefits). But again, under a hypothetical communist government, I don't think there should be any need to force anyone into any line of work. Even the worst of the traditionally ""dirty"" jobs, if paired with economic security and stability, benefits and social prestige, may and should be hugely appealing to a lot of people. (Although I also believe that from a technological point of view, most of these jobs will go away sooner or later. If they don't, it's down to capitalism and the fact that from the capital's point of view cutting down wages is always ultimately the most profitable thing to do, and that automating away all labour would cause the surplus value to more or less disappear.)

> I want people to have the freedom to choose what kind of work they'd like to do, but this whole thing will fall apart if everyone is making pottery and nobody cleans out the sewer, so there's obviously a balancing act there.

Well, yeah, sure - although, even assuming that cleaning out the sewers will always have to be performed by humans (which I don't think is the case), such ""dirty"" jobs could be made infinitely more palatable (even in the sense of being more hygienic or less physically straining) if it weren't for capitalism. 

I think the main (and perhaps only) point of disagreement between is that I think it's a fallacy (of the kind where we internalise as natural what is only historically determined) to think that the nature of the work itself, i.e. the things that have to be materially performed by humans in order for the society to work, will stay more or less the same under communism - and that the only thing we can do is make this natural burden somehow more equally distributed. (This, to me, betrays also a kind of technological determinism: where technology progresses and develops in essentially the same way under capitalism and socialism.) Post-work to me means exactly the renewed (because it's originally found in Marx) emphasis on how communism may change the nature of the work itself: not just through automation, but technical/logistical efficiency, democratic control over the workplace, and more equal access to the existing technologies.",TheDandyGiraffe,t2_14wtcj,2,0,reddit2

Some of my teachers were very good (usually ones who admittedly switched from public to private).  The best was this guy who had a perfect score on his SATs and was working as a nuclear scientist, but had an epiphany and decided he would rather teach students.  He's the singular reason I passed Physics (back when 4 years of Science were required).  Parents generally trusted teacher knowledge here, though skill varied.  I had some teachers who were like ""Ok, open to p.whatever and read and answer questions"" and that was literally it.  I had others like the Physics teacher I mentioned who were more engaged, hands on, etc.

For public school, when it comes to grades, it depends where you are.  I work in a school that is alright, I would say it's about average.  Most parents take teachers word for it when it comes to describing their child's progress.  Most of the things deal with is in terms of getting parent engagement with the student's progress.  The population is primarily black and brown students with some asians.  The main difference is administration is very supportive of teachers which I can't say is true for most schools.

At a more elite school, such as Stuyvesant, I hear that the parents are a lot more engaged and aggressive when it comes to student's grades.  So a student gets a 97...a parent will harass a teacher ""Why isn't it 100?""  That kind of thing.  That said, students produce work, high level and are at least prepared for class.

So? That just demonstrates how divorced from reality ""the Left"" is. Obama is right to say that slogans must accurately communicate political ideas in ways the masses can understand, instead of redefining colloquial terms (like ""work"") based on academic bullshit. He would know because he ran a wildly successful campaign for President, purely on the power of empty marketing. He may be wrong about capitalism, but he's objectively right about marketing.

The ""right wing"" is 100% correct to point out that people derive meaning from their work. It is an anthropological fact. They may be wrong about capitalism, feminism, trans people, etc etc but they are correct about this one thing.

Yes and this kind of advancement via that kind of mode of production was necessary, but, as every serious socialist theory of alienation since the 19th century has recognized, it isn't necessary *anymore*. 

Not sure why this logical fallacy of ""there's a reason why things are as they are, therefore they *should* continue to be as they are"" gets thrown around so much , especially on a Marxist sub.


>Wiping old people's asses sucks.

Knowing a lot of people doing just that - wiping old peoples asses really doesn't suck for a surprising amount of people. Especially care-workers usually do what they do, because they enjoy doing it. And when they don't, it's not because they have to wipe asses, but because they are alienated by being overworked, underpaid, under-appreciated and their facilities underfunded.

>cleaning up road kill or doing quality control on steel bearings would become a desirable task.

It doesn't have to be desirable though. Most people simply wouldn't give a fuck doing any of that sub 20h a week if it guaranteed them a decent life, something to get busy, some structure in their lifes and if they didn't have some Wannabe-F√ºhrer powertripping and breathing down their necks all day.

Without a working-class to buy commodities ie exchange their paid labor for goods there is no capitalism. So instead labor is redirected to work on something else.

The capitalism/socialism divide isnt the big differential factor any more. Both ideologies are authoritarian, both involve needing to get resources from other people, and both involve some level of authoritarian or bureaucracy. 

Or, to sum it up by bob black:

>Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx‚Äôs wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue I support the right to be lazy. Leftists favor full employment. Like the surrealists ‚Äî except that I‚Äôm not kidding ‚Äî I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I agitate for permanent revelry. But if all the ideologues (as they do) advocate work ‚Äî and not only because they plan to make other people do theirs ‚Äî they are strangely reluctant to say so. They will carry on endlessly about wages, hours, working conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They‚Äôll gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who offer to do our thinking for us rarely share their conclusions about work, for all its saliency in the lives of all of us. Among themselves they quibble over the details. Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don‚Äôt care which form bossing takes so long as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers have serious differences over how to divvy up the spoils of power. Just as clearly, none of them have any objection to power as such and all of them want to keep us working. 

----

>You and I have very different goals. I care about the liberation of the working class and creating a society that provides for all, free of exploitation.

i also believe in liberation and providing for all. 

I just dont believe socialism provides that. Heck, my ideology gets straight to the point. By giving people a UBI and healthcare, we give people both a safety net to provide for everyone, and TRUE liberation through the power to say no. Not just to any job but all jobs. Your ideology would still coerce people to work, you just think making things a little democratic on paper = freedom. Such a dated mindset.

>I also understand that it may not be pretty and will take time to achieve a society that we desire.

So do I. 

>And ultimately if an opportunity to better society comes along, I won‚Äôt refuse to participate because it doesn‚Äôt line up exactly with my off-brand utopian futurism.

but thats the thing, Im not sure your society would be better. On paper it should be, but as we know about previous...failed attempts, yeah no I'd rather NOT. The fact is I dont think we want the same society, and quite frankly I dont think many leftists really care about anti work at all. 

Or to quote bob black again:

>The ludic life is totally incompatible with existing reality. So much the worse for ‚Äúreality,‚Äù the gravity hole that sucks the vitality from the little in life that still distinguishes it from mere survival. Curiously ‚Äî or maybe not ‚Äî all the old ideologies are conservative because they believe in work. Some of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in work all the more fiercely because they believe in so little else. 

And that's exactly what im getting at, old ideology.

I dont always agree with black either. Dude's an anarchist who craps on futurists like me at times. But I'll at least agree with him ON WORK and on how many leftists arent inherently anti work. Which, in my eyes, makes you no better than the capitalists.",JonWood007,t2_5sg9b,2,0,reddit2

Sure a plow made farming easier, and water pipes make life intensely more convenient. But for all the good these inventions do they often have underlying consequences not seen until the future due to the large scale impact they have (increasing populations, lessening of value of needed materials which pushes for even greater production, etc.) 

Beyond that, the real point (I believe) is that, in the last hundred or so years, for every invention that greatly aided humanity in sustaining itself there were a thousand inventions that did nothing but provide the slightest of convenience or comfort to those who bought it. But because of the consumerist, technologically progressive culture we‚Äôve established in the last 75 or so years, everyone wants every new thing. Which led to the massive solid waste problem we now see today. 

Furthermore, and this is always a sticky subject for people, technology that allows more people to live for longer periods of time is not necessarily a good thing for the future of humanity.

They had fire places, often central to the living area and necessary for cooking but which also, as a by product of being fire, gave off light. Further, without light you can still see pretty well at night (try it sometime) and well not enough to read a book, you could still do things.  Further, people flocked to the cities - at least in England - due to enclosure, where they were kicked off the land by the Estates seeking to maximize wool production. With no where left to go, they turned to the cities to process the wool. This would later shift to cotton and other textile products. But this started before electric lights. In fact, industrialization started in the late 18th century - starting about 1760 as Enclosure started to hit critical mass. Electric light wasn't introduced till the 1880s, and wasn't even cheaply available till the 1920s. Centralized gaslight wasn't available till 1802 publicly, and then only as a display - it would take decades to rollout the infrastructure.

Typically, oil in a cup with a wick of some kind was the most common portable light source - and such oil could come from a number of sources. Fish oil, for example, was a common source. But plants could as well, such as castor or flax - flax was also used for making linen, so a byproduct of textile development would be oil for lamps. 

Another source for light other than candles that was super cheap and easy would be rush lights. Made from rushes soaked in animal fats - again, a by product of a necessary process (cooking). Once cooking meat was done, you'd place the rushes into the pan to soak up the fat. They would last for about 10 minutes, but a skilled housewife could make a bunch of them quickly.",,,3,0,reddit2

Like I mentioned, disparity in pay would handle this. Having your ""basic"" needs met in a non-monetary system might be fairly simple: take the average cost of housing, food, healthcare, and education and effectively gift everyone (via some kind of distributed currency system, think blockchain without all the ancap BS baked in) a UBI or something like it equalling the sum of those averages, maybe with some ratio modifier (like 0.8 or soemthing).

So if you *don't want to work at all*, fine. You can live in an apartment with three other people and eat corn on the cob with a mangy dog. But if you want to wipe people's assholes then you can afford the maintenance cost on a house on the hill with a pool and drive a Stalinmobile A-model.

In fact, I'd argue that if everyone's basic needs are met, people who wipe assholes are going to get paid what they deserve. Why? Because why would I wipe someone's asshole if I get a roof over my head and three square meals a day? You have to pay more for that! You can no longer rely on the unemployment pool and competition between destitute workers in order to artificially drive prices down. If a job is dull, boring, difficult, stressful, or disgusting...then it will require high wages to get anyone to even want to do it. This is what I mean when I say free association. Capitalism coerces people into these bad jobs by threatening them with unemployment. I propose we use more carrot than stick and the productive system can reorganize from there.

> give them something they want, like money... which is basically capitalism

Capitalism is not when you pay people to do things. Capitalism is when you merge private property (absentee ownership) with a market system, generally that uses prices as the sole productive signal. There are plenty of ways to organize production, including paying people for doing difficult/gross things, *without* absentee ownership or centrally-printed money that draws its value from military and financial conquest, and even without ""central planning."" If you're curious, here's a really interesting article on the matter: https://logicmag.io/commons/how-to-make-a-pencil/. It doesn't give a coherent replacement for all the mechanisms of production, but it does give an overview of how essentially markets/prices are a *protocol* and that procotol can be changed for the benefit of society as opposed to private owners.",orthecreedence,t2_46daw,12,0,reddit2

It's seen as the ""easy"" job to get into tech and to make six figures. Except it's not ""easy"" (granted you have a real UX job and you aren't just a glorified graphic designer) and you better have a brain that can handle 50 things at once. And you better have encyclopedic capabilities because you're considered the expert that knows exactly how a piece of software, an app, or a feature is supposed to work. And you need to actually think through how something should work and plan out every single bit of interaction that can possibly happen. I think too many idiots are in the field that only think at the surface-level, have zero multitasking abilities, and cannot seem to remember the thing they're working on.

UX bootcamps are scams, a lot of the newer UX master's degrees are scams (especially if it's 100% online), and I tell people to not go into the field unless you can get into a top master's program that has connections to large companies or you have managed to procure a *real* UX design/research internship the summer after your sophomore year.

I have interviewed people from UX bootcamps and I have never recommended a *single one of them* to go further in the interview. They can only think at a shallow and surface level and nothing they show me is impressive when compared to a person with a bachelor's who took UX classes in conjunction with another major or someone from a good grad school. And this checks out--you're not going to learn UX in 12 weeks.

The field is oversaturated and the market is filled with glorified graphic designer jobs. I am hoping layoffs will deter people from blowing thousands on useless bootcamps. However, UX tends to be safer from layoffs as long as you're not working on a useless product (or internal product--they'll outsource UX to India) solely because they're the ""encyclopedia"" for the products they're working on. Engineers and devs are seen as disposable at the levels where people are making layoff decisions because these people don't understand they are also encyclopedias for how the product is coded--they just see them as code monkeys that can be replaced with cheaper outsourced labor.",Inthralls,t2_i38zb8f1,46,0,reddit3

That said, your point about coders being the base of the pyramid is correct, and ""Learn to code"" could be seen from that perspective as being a means by which to reduce the power of the best coders and ensure that the programming masses stay at the bottom of the pyramid, and never get a chance to unionize.

edit: The software dev environment remains a land of extremes and seeming contradictions, though: the monetary cost of outsourcing is miniscule these days, meaning that no one at any level has a safety net, but conversely, one or two really decent guys can do the work of a hundred for the cost of ten.

Excellent articulation. This is *precisely* why I decided not to go into IT when recently investigating a career change. As I spoke to people and learned more about it and, frankly, simply did some critical thinking on it, it was extremely clear that there were a handful of people who were freakishly talented, obsessed with their work, benefited from nepotism, or who just literally, personally enjoy coding who were making all the money, and even then, not half as much as some fucking suit. I just don't give a shit enough to ever make it work.

What these sorts of discussions always miss however (not OP, just in general) is that like with the rush for everyone to go to law school prior to this in the 90s, it's all bullshit and there is no panacea to being lower class in the United States or elsewhere in other capitalist economies. Class mobility is a myth, first off, but a large part of the reason its a myth is because the division of 'middle class' labor from lower class labor has always been essential to the functioning of capitalism, a system that works tirelessly to group as many people as it can into lower and lower labor categories so they can exploit them harder and harder.

As many analysts have pointed out, the middle class furthermore doesn't really exist, but for capital, it is an important illusion to maintain, yet one it increasingly finds itself unable to.

In other words, the industry that will work for *you personally* is the industry you can survive in: the one that takes advantage of your talents, your tolerances, so on. The whole idea of an advanced modern society is that each person's abilities benefit the whole in the most efficient way we can achieve.

That so many people can't find a way in life isn't so much because they've made the wrong career choices. There are simply so few career choices left that result in a comfortable income and those choices are increasingly narrowing; one cannot force themselves into a mold they aren't suited for, not for long.

No. **That countless millions can never leverage their God-given talents to acquire even a meager living wage is a failure of the labor system itself.** Yet, Americans are strictly incapable of systemic thinking, and not one fucking person can deny it.

-its tough right now due to covid but try looking for intern/volunteer work in a field your interested in.

What that meant was that God had already decided, or knew, who was going to hell and who was not.  Nothing you could do, say, think, anything could change that.  If you were good all your life you could still go to hell. You just had to hope you were chosen. 

Woke Calvinism applies that to the favored or disfavored identity groups, for whom their prosperity is ""predetermined"" based on an intersection of sexuality, race, gender, religion etc.  According to Woke Calvinism, Straight White Man has been predetermined by fate, or God, or J.K. Rowling, to be powerful, rich, successful, and privileged and a Homosexual Black Female is predetermined by those same powers to be oppressed, a victim, downtrodden just solely based on those categories and without looking at the material conditions of either individual.

It depends on the position and years in the field.

If your aunt has an advanced bio degree she more than likely might also be in a position beyond just a standard water operator, since that just requires two short courses and a state exam to get started as a trainee for the most part.

It can also largely depend on the size of the water plant, as well as location. I'm at the level I'm at cause I'm still closer to the entry-level in terms of experience, and the plant I work at isn't exactly the largest.

We have to somehow get a political party going on a state to state basis with a platform explicitly pro-labor. Look at Florida, they voted for Trump and a $15 minimum wage. People know that there are clear solutions to their material conditions but have zero idea how to reconcile neither party explicitly supporting those solutions. This is because there simply is no viable organized political alternative being presented to them.

No debt, thankfully, but an all-consuning opiate habit - albeit a relatively ""high-functioning addict"" who can hold down jobs.  I have been a waiter at a restaurant with freakishly high/stable clientele, and I have averaged 50k-65k/year over the last 3 years (the average American household income is around 60k/yr).




A few years ago I looked pretty throughly into the sort of ""blue collemar unionized trades"", and not only are you going to spend 5 years as a $15/hr ""apprentice"", but the light at the end of this tunnel is a $50-$65k/year salary, plus (i would ballpark) about $10-15k/year in medical and retirement benefits.  This is nothing to sniff at.  It places you firmly in the middle class and provides more job security than most fields.




What I dont like is this sort of bipartisan jobs panacea that's been embraced by both the mainstream left and right that ""college isn't for most people; trades are a totally respectable and viable alternative thst provide tradeoffs in many ways favorable to a traditional 4 year bachelor‚Äôs degree"".  For *some* people in *some* places this is true; in others where unions have been hollowed out and the ""right to work"" people have enshrined job insecurity into law, you might want to seriously consider relocating before committing to something like this.




My general point here is, before you commit yourself to one of these apprenticeship programs, do a *deep dive* on your state's labor protections, union strength, licensing requirements, and projected job growth for the state you plan to do this in.  For instance, a plumber or electrician in Hawaii or the PNW or some parts of New England, is going to be *vastly* preferable in innumerable ways to being a tradesman in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, or much of the south, or even the Wisconsin/Michigan/Colorado ""flyover states"" that liberals generally consider less egregious in their union busting than the south.  The state to state variation in these laws in wide and not easily predictable.




I'm just saying if you're going to commit to this, do a *deep dive* first into the state and local conditions for your trade.  I was shocked at the amount of variation between states and cities with compensation/benefit packages vs cost of living, and the last thing you wanna do is wake up 4 years into a 5 year apprenticeship and realize the math doesn't make sense.  Im not some fucking labor organizer, but I am a guy who devoted untold hours to doing cost/benefit analysis for this type of career move where I live, and the way the math worked out I would have been taking a pay cut for marginally better retirement plans.  Not saying your situation is the same, but really look into it before committing nearly a decade of your life to reaching the median pay scale for some of these trades.",HunterButtersworth,t2_7fwcskrb,5,0,reddit4

Where I live (North Carolina) the different ""levels"" of licensure are restricted by the price of the job, but most electricians here who focus on residential work never even get their intermediate or unlimited licenses because the limited license covers you for most residential wiring jobs. My boss has been an electrician for 20 years and only has a limited license and we've wired some fairly large homes.

IIRC a lot of southern, midwestern, and interior west states have set ups that are similar to this where your apprenticeship is just 2 or 3 years of work experience, unlike northern and west coast states which tend to have extensive, curricular apprenticeships and require a lot more years of experience in order to obtain any kind of license.

**Their Comment**

ok well I am gay but I shouldn't have to say that as I thought I made a pretty articulate and relevant point that stands on its own legs without bringing that up. but I would like to actually know your true reason because you didn't address anything I said, other than offering ""look there's black people on this sub too"", and you also proved my point again by saying gay ""boi"".

you don't even see the insidious homophobic emasculation in your words, ultimately the underlying insinuation is that being gay is derogatory or literally just the most hilarious thing. Somehow seeing in the context of any otherwise seemingly welcoming and extremely intelligent and self aware stream of thought is more painful to me to the fact that I felt like now was the time to say something about it, sorry?

I'm not trying to make you feel guilty just trying to bring this shit to your attention bud.

**My Reply**

Strap on in and bear with me, this is a pretty long reply lol.

>ok well I am gay

I do not care. While I wouldn't use those words if I was speaking directly towards a gay person (with some exceptions), I was speaking in the context of this sub, which is very against Idpol (which often goes hand in hand with against PC).

>""look there's black people on this sub too""

No, I did not say that.

>gay ""boi"".

I don't know what you're trying to say by that. My usage of ""oi"" instead of ""oy"" is just for comedic, meme-like effect.

>you don't even see the insidious homophobic emasculation in your words, ultimately the underlying insinuation is that being gay is derogatory or literally just the most hilarious thing.

You're free to take what people say however you want, but ultimately I think you're being weak. There's nothing wrong with being a cock-gobbler, but in the case of the Media and Biden it's a conflict of interest - the media is supposed to hold politicians accountable, so they shouldn't be giving a good ol' gobbling to Joe's wrinkly cock. That's the true nature of what I said, not some inherent homophobic bullshit because at the end of the day, you shouldn't be ashamed of you're gay; gobble away on cocks, but if you're doing it for someone you're supposed to hold accountable, I will call you out on it. If it was Hillary instead of Biden, I would have said something like, ""the media is tongue-punching her twat n fart-box.""

>of thought is more painful to me to the fact that I felt like now was the time to say something about it, sorry?

Oh the humanity!

My gay friends have tried to argue that being dramatic isn't a characteristic that all gay people have, and while I know it's not necessarily true, I get a chuckle out of seeing it out in the wild like this.

>I'm not trying to make you feel guilty just trying to bring this shit to your attention bud.

Taking anything the American government and corporate media says regarding America's enemies at face value is highly inadvisable. Most people here, including those angry at ""muh tankies,"" already have a healthy skepticism of NYT, Bezos Post, CNN, etc.

If they lie about Bernie and shape coverage to support America's corporate power candidates, why wouldn't they do the same here? Plus, we already know they have a history of outlight lying to manufacture consent for wars: ""Iraq has weapons of mass destruction."" ""General Soleimani is a terrorist."" Etc.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Much of what the MSM says on Uighurs can be be debunked by *sources that are not exclusively Chinese.* 

That's not to say China is entirely beyond suspicion. We don't know everything there is to know about these places and it's hard to find good reporting.

Then from the late years of Qing all the way until the establishment of the PRC, both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union on-and-off stoked separatist movements in the region in order to try to take it for themselves.

In contrast, [China has brought Tibet out of poverty](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42372455/271837ash_tibetv4.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). 

And I don't have to ask Tibet how Chinese occupation of Tibet is going. Michael Parenti already did: http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html

>In old Tibet there were small numbers of farmers who subsisted as a kind of free peasantry, and perhaps an additional 10,000 people who composed the ‚Äúmiddle-class‚Äù families of merchants, shopkeepers, and small traders. Thousands of others were beggars. There also were slaves, usually domestic servants, who owned nothing. Their offspring were born into slavery. 15 The majority of the rural population were serfs. Treated little better than slaves, the serfs went without schooling or medical care, They were under a lifetime bond to work the lord's land--or the monastery‚Äôs land--without pay, to repair the lord's houses, transport his crops, and collect his firewood. They were also expected to provide carrying animals and transportation on demand.16 Their masters told them what crops to grow and what animals to raise. They could not get married without the consent of their lord or lama. And they might easily be separated from their families should their owners lease them out to work in a distant location.

>As in a free labor system and unlike slavery, the overlords had no responsibility for the serf‚Äôs maintenance and no direct interest in his or her survival as an expensive piece of property. The serfs had to support themselves. Yet as in a slave system, they were bound to their masters, guaranteeing a fixed and permanent workforce that could neither organize nor strike nor freely depart as might laborers in a market context. The overlords had the best of both worlds.

>Many ordinary Tibetans want the Dalai Lama back in their country, but it appears that relatively few want a return to the social order he represented. A 1999 story in the Washington Post notes that the Dalai Lama continues to be revered in Tibet, but

>. . . few Tibetans would welcome a return of the corrupt aristocratic clans that fled with him in 1959 and that comprise the bulk of his advisers. Many Tibetan farmers, for example, have no interest in surrendering the land they gained during China‚Äôs land reform to the clans. Tibet‚Äôs former slaves say they, too, don‚Äôt want their former masters to return to power. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already lived that life once before,‚Äù said Wangchuk, a 67-year-old former slave who was wearing his best clothes for his yearly pilgrimage to Shigatse, one of the holiest sites of Tibetan Buddhism. He said he worshipped the Dalai Lama, but added, ‚ÄúI may not be free under Chinese communism, but I am better off than when I was a slave.‚Äù

>Kim Lewis, who studied healing methods with a Buddhist monk in Berkeley, California, had occasion to talk at length with more than a dozen Tibetan women who lived in the monk‚Äôs building. When she asked how they felt about returning to their homeland, the sentiment was unanimously negative. At first, Lewis assumed that their reluctance had to do with the Chinese occupation, but they quickly informed her otherwise. They said they were extremely grateful ‚Äúnot to have to marry 4 or 5 men, be pregnant almost all the time,‚Äù or deal with sexually transmitted diseases contacted from a straying husband.

The Xinjiang conflict (Chinese: Êñ∞ÁñÜÂÜ≤Á™Å), also known as Uyghur‚ÄìChinese conflict, is a conflict in China's far-northwest autonomous region of Xinjiang centred on the Uyghurs, a Turkic minority ethnic group who make up the largest group in the region.Though the conflict is traced to 1931, factors such as the massive state-sponsored migration of Han Chinese from the 1950s to the 1970s, government policies promoting Chinese cultural unity and punishing certain expressions of Uyghur identity, and harsh responses to separatism have contributed to tension between Uyghurs, and state police and Han Chinese. This has taken the form of both frequent terrorist attacks and wider public unrest such as the Baren Township riot, 1997 √úr√ºmqi bus bombings, protests in Ghuljia, June 2009 Shaoguan Incident, the resulting July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, 2011 Hotan attack, April 2014 √úr√ºmqi attack, May 2014 √úr√ºmqi attack, 2014 Kunming attack and the 2015 Aksu colliery attack. Other Uyghur organisations such as the World Uyghur Congress denounce totalitarianism, religious intolerance, and terrorism as an instrument of policy.In recent years, government policy has been marked by mass surveillance and the incarceration without trial of over one million Uyghurs and other Muslim minority ethnic groups in ""re-education camps"". Numerous reports have stated that many of these minorities have been used in prison labour in a seeming return to the ""re-education through labour"" program, supposedly abolished in 2013.

g5nb5ga,t3_iujdin,2020-09-17 23:24:46,stupidpol,"Robert Putnam, who is probably one of the most respected American sociologists/data driven poli sci analysts in the world, did a massive study on the effects of diversity at the local level.  He started collecting data, i believe, in like the late 90s/early 00s, but sat on the study and didn't publish his findings for well over a decade, until he released it with little fanfare in like the mid-2010s.




He strenuously denied the delay was ideologically motivated but if you read the study its pretty crystal fucking clear why he waited to publish it.  It was a huge data set, urban, suburban, rural, from all over the US with some data from self-reporting and some from field observation.




What Putnam found was that on literally every metric, and by an overwhelming margin, the more diverse an area or neighborhood is, the lower the quality of life of the residents, and the more homogeneous the area, the higher quality of life.  People in diverse neighborhoods: tend to trust their neighbors less, are less likely to know or even talk to their neighbors, are less engaged politically, less likely to vote, dont organize community functions, like cleanups, block parties, etc., spend less time outside, spend more time watching TV, report lower life satisfaction, give less to charity, and on and on and on.




Diverse neighborhoods show all the characteristics of ""low-trust societies"", and the study didnt just look at black-white neighborhoods, they found the exact same effect for black-latino, black-Jewish, white-latino, etc. neighborhoods.




We constantly hear the ""diversity is our strength"" mantra, but if you look into the actual data from people whove studied this, you cannot rationally conclude that this is anything but a statement of faith.  There are a few workplace studies of ""diversity"" - defined by expertise, not in ethnic terms - that show a workplace that's ""diverse"" in this sense is good.  But when it comes to racial diversity in workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, or countries, there's just no data showing that diversity helps anything.  Those studies just haven't been done.  Very few academics have even attempted to show such an effect, and Putnam's study is one of the very, very few data points we have.  And I suspect the only reason Putnam's study didn't get the ""file drawer effect"" treatment is because he's so influential.",HunterButtersworth,t2_7fwcskrb,2,0,reddit2

This can't solely be placed on guilty white leftists though, a lot of people of color encourage (what is essentially) fetishization because they enjoy the double standard/privilege they can engage in in their rhetoric, instead of just demanding that race be fought and equality be established, they say that certain ""voices"" need to be elevated and ad hominem idealist ""standpoint theory"" etc. etc.

I used to support ideas like ""you can't be racist to white people"" because I thought that encouraging this double standard would reflect the ""reality of race in society"" and that it would de-center white people, but I have now come to realize that allowing toxicity like this, or even to minimize it, ALWAYS (in my experience) leads to something bad down the line, in fact it LEGITIMIZES racial divisions **(essentially fetishizing black people or other non-whites as the mecha-oppressed that cannot be expected to behave to the standards that a white person would be held to, blatantly racist against non-whites ironically enough but a lot of non-whites encourage this subtle fetishization because they want to get away with toxic behavior lol)** by encouraging the idea that there IS some fundamental separateness from whites and non-whites.

And people will justify this division by saying ""well white people are racialized as white (true) so they have the perspectives of a white person, they have internalized 'white racist culture' blah blah"", but the reason this cannot be accepted, is because it's the same thing as ""black culture"", to justify the inequality that black people face, conservatives have gone from the 'blatantly' racist position of black people being biologically inferior, to the more 'palatable' version of they just have a 'black enviorment' that causes them to be poor, criminals, etc.

While the intentions *and* the rhetoric of the latter position are definitely less dangerous than saying that black people are biologically sub-human savages that can never be saved, it is still regardless essetnailizing race, and in the final analysis as Adolph Reed has said, *they have the same function, to justify inequaliuty, the belief in a ""black culture"" as a cause for the woes of black workers has the exact same substance/effect (social or political) and that is to demonize black people and to justify the inequality they face.* Similarly, an idea of a ""white culture"" that causes whites to be chauvinist/racist in the EXACT SAME WAY essentializes race, the *substance* of an idea like this is in fact, that yes, race is real, it is legitimate, and any idea that treats race as a socially valuable category *will* only pursue the category of race essentialism that is a hindrance to solidarity.

The insidious nature of microaggression is if you do stand up to it, you will most likely be labeled, ""overreacting"", ""pulling the race card,"" or ""stop being so sensitive,"" etc. Because it did't hit the threshold of racism, people don't like to address these issues.

In other words, microagressions is more of a ""quality of living"" problem rather than the existential problem that is racism/institutional racism.

It can hurt your self esteem since people just assume you are a foreigner just by their looks. 



In my experience, microagression is more of a problem among non white people who are born and raised in US, not primarily for immigrants who come to US. (But it can be a problem to them too once they assimilate to their host culture) An Indian American has values more in common with other white people than an Indian who just immigrated from India. 

The problem is SJW's abusing these concepts in a typical evangelical way.",tritter211,t2_7p1dh,0,0,reddit2

Obviously anybody can bring any idea to the table regardless of race or gender or such. I don't think that the argument about diversity helping ""diversity of thought"" has much merit, though it does have some.

I do think diversity has merit though when it comes to minimizing discrimination. 

Sure, people can remain racist despite working with people of other races, or sexist despite working of people of another sex, but many people will instead learn to be respectful - at least publicly - when they actually have to deal with other people that they normally wouldn't deal with of their own free will.

Besides which, even if any given individual could bring any idea to the table, the truth is that there are going to always be statistical differences between the values or thoughts of people of varying groups. An Atheist and a Christian for example might be the same on paper in many ways (such as on their resume), but they will bring different perspectives to any work or situation - and this diversity of thought could potentially be beneficial. I feel the same is the case when it comes to race, sex, or other factors - though to varying degrees obviously. Of course this doesn't apply to individuals, but for a company hiring on a large scale it makes sense that they might feel safer hiring based on diversity alone rather than doing an intense psycho-evaluation of every single person they hire.

This does suck though for those who might not get a job due to not being ""diverse enough,"" and I admit diversity itself as an ideal does have drawbacks. I don't think that it is entirely without merit however, by any means.

The problem is that people pretty instinctively gravitate toward others like them. Even if there's only a slight preference, it leads to de facto segregation in aggregate. There are models which show that substantial housing segregation will emerge if the inhabitants of a particular area want, say, at least 5/10 of their closest neighbors to be of the same race. In terms of hiring, this leads to substantial biases in terms of the number of applicants from different races. Especially with minorities, people don't necessarily want to work at a company that is exactly proportionally representative of the demographics of the USA. If minorities want to work at a place where at least 3/10 co-workers are the same race, clustering will occur.

Not that firms aren't incredibly biased toward ivy grads or don't engage in nepotism--they do. But consider that Harvard is 15% black, which is slightly over-representative. That doesn't help the 99.99% of blacks who don't go to Harvard, but it lets Harvard trot out its diversity statistics and proclaim how woke they are, justifying their entire existence. This is a prime example of how idpol is a reactionary movement that works to maintain social inequality. Even though Harvard is a ridiculously exclusive institution that gives way disproportionate benefits to its students (increasing inequality), somehow this is okay as long as they have 15% blacks.

Go to any country in the world and if you're a foreigner or racial minority there you will probably hear ignorant things said. It's not necessarily an ""aggression"" or a slight. It could actually come from a clumsy attempt to include you or be nice. 

I'm not an American. When I go to America and people hear that I'm not from there, they say stupid things to me. It certainly is annoying, I'll give you that. But characterizing it as an ""aggression"" is not quite right. Sometimes it's a clumsy attempt to be friendly. Why on earth should I be upset, or take it as a slight, if people recognize me as foreign in a place where *I am* foreign? (By the way, Europeans also say stupid, stereotypical things to Americans when they encounter them in Europe).

The problem here is how a culture deals with difference and foreign-ness, things they're not used to. Americans are usually pretty friendly but they notoriously do not know much about the world outside America. So you get ignorant comments. But your experience as a foreigner will not necessarily be any better in Latin America,  or in East Asia or Africa or the Middle East. People will still react to you like a foreigner, and among those reactions will be fear, curiosity, stereotypical ideas, clumsy attempts to be friendly... Why take it as a slight or be offended by it? 

Your example of the Korean-American: Is that *an aggression* or is it just ignorance? Maybe the people who are asking that just want to know where he's from, or where his parents are from, as racial minorities. Why not just tell them? Why is it a big secret?

>Diversity is not only about bringing different perspectives to the table. Simply adding social diversity to a group makes people believe that differences of perspective might exist among them and that belief makes people change their behavior.

>Members of a homogeneous group rest somewhat assured that they will agree with one another; that they will understand one another's perspectives and beliefs; that they will be able to easily come to a consensus. But when members of a group notice that they are socially different from one another, they change their expectations. They anticipate differences of opinion and perspective. They assume they will need to work harder to come to a consensus. This logic helps to explain both the upside and the downside of social diversity: people work harder in diverse environments both cognitively and socially. They might not like it, but the hard work can lead to better outcomes.

g5m9hm6,t1_g5m6yu1,2020-09-17 19:02:07,stupidpol,"It certainly can lead to that, but I feel that it depends on implementation.

People seem to naturally, inherently, be discriminatory against those who are different from them. That's just a part of our natures, and I think it takes conscious effort and interaction to minimize the problem.

If diversity training or implementation leads to people ""othering"" over things they didn't previously care about, and that leads to more discrimination or social separation, then that's clearly a bad thing.

If diversity leads to more interaction between people who are different however in ways that they already perceived as differences, and this leads to people becoming more likely to associate with or sympathize with others who are different from them - then I think it has done its job.

Ultimately I view it as an issue of social harmony. Diversity measures lead to discrimination by how they are implemented, such as by choosing a minority candidate for a job or for certain media over an equally (or more) qualified non-minority candidate. This discrimination has to be balanced against the potential benefits of having a less biased populace as a whole though, and you can only reduce societal bias and discrimination properly through frequent exposure to those who are different from you.

If everybody just stays in their own little bubble, then they're never going to consider anyone outside of it. Yet many people will never actively try to ""step out"" of their bubble, and I think there is some merit in encouraging people to step out of their bubble regardless of whether or not they want to. This has to be done to the minimal extent however, as pushing people too far becomes counter-productive when diversity is seen by many people as a weapon rather than as a device for social harmony.

In short: diversity itself can be used as a tool that is beneficial to society, but that same tool can cause more harm than good if used incorrectly or without proper consideration. Many people call for diversity for the sake of diversity without considering the potential side effects, and simply cause more discrimination and anger as a result.",echonian,t2_8bf7y,2,0,reddit2

Wouldn't this also fit the definition of an ""implicit bias"" if you assume people have this bias in the first place? I don't have this particular bias about black Americans. But someone who takes this line in a training session would be assuming I do. 

On the other hand it's hard to ignore that rap and hip hop culture is real, has certain tenets and predispositions, influences people to behave a certain way, etc. Obviously that's not every person, but some people are that way.

And the tragic irony of that being the case is that it actually does make people think in more selfish and self enriching ways.

That is not original sin, that's socialization and we are all affected by it, irrelevant of your skin color, it's all about culture.

There is no preaching. No one is saying you are bad for having those bias, it's just a fact those bias exist and you should be conscious when they start affecting decisions. That's the point of ""implicit"" bias, they are not explicit, those are not conscious bias, thus becoming conscious of them help negate them.

It's a fact that putting a black sounding name on an application will severely negatively affect your chances.

Everyone do have implicit bias. Those biases can be for more than just black people, it can be for Asian, Latino, White, Men, Women, anything. Hell, if you associate black people with your friend you loved you still do have an implicit bias in their favor. Or it could be someone called Karen and you downgrade that Karen in your mind because you associate Karen with annoying women.

It's not about ""acknowledgement"", it is not about doing a petty dance admonishing yourself for your sins in public, it's about being conscious you have learned stereotypes that unconsciously affect what you think and to consciously put it aside it to be objective in your actions.

Right but I don't have that problem. I have more of a problem with the fact that the outcomes of hiring decisions are being monitored from the outside for whether or not they advance a given race's material interests. 

Because that implies that the result of a hiring situation is being seen in zero sum racial terms. I don't really see the point in that. 

Not that it matters, since I don't control hiring decisions where I work nor is the pool of candidates very diverse in the first place. The amount of bottle necking and self selection involved in producing qualified applicants in tech schools for my job far outweighs any implicit bias that might be expressed by an eager hiring manager at my workplace. 

I've seen for myself how black students select themselves away from either finishing their programs or from facing potential discrimination in hiring when they're done: they stick to their own and seek employment at black businesses in black regions wherever possible.

I can't tell them not to do that any more than I can tell them not to bring guns on to school property and get expelled, something that happened twice throughout my pipeline to employment. They're doing what they think is best for themselves at the moment. They are repeatedly warned not to break those rules in and around safety or harassment of staff on campus... They disregarded that advice and now there's two less qualified black applicants in the industry. 


>You can willfully choose to not judge black people with it and that's because you are conscious that the stereotype is bad and it shouldn't affect your judgement.

Insofar as the stereotype of a criminal rapper thug reflects on real qualities people have, it's pretty bad. Well, at least as far as maintaining insured employment is concerned. No one would care about that stereotype if those types of people didn't exist, or if their work was never impacted by it.

There's a whole bevy of criticisms of the IAT which show it's no better an indicator of bias than a questionaire.

Nothing in that says you have to admit to anything. It's literally just saying that when you are putting aside the candidature of someone, why is it you put it aside?

Yes, you have definitely been exposed to at least one stereotype in your life. Ever seen the meme about Karen? That's a stereotype. Ever heard Asian are good at math? That's another stereotype.

>Which sounds a lot like an unscientific idea that can only be posited and never directly tested. It's clearly a placeholder concept that is necessary for unifying some broader theory of society. 

No, it can be tested, it just doesn't predict behavior. There are clear association and effect from it. The amount of discrimination is much higher than what you would expect from the amount of explicitly racist people which mean there is a lot of people who are acting based on race without actual racist belief. There is also a general association between races and concept. What can't be measured reliably is how the biases actually affect people. We can also test it in children as young as 6 years old.

Sequential priming, response competition, EDA, EMG, fMRI, ERP and ITA are all tests to measure implicit bias.

>they stick to their own and seek employment at black businesses in black regions wherever possible.

That often has a lot to do with them facing discrimination elsewhere. You may look at it as self-selection when it is often the result of racism. Studies very much show that having a non-Christian sounding name put you at great disadvantage, even more so if it sound stereo-typically black. Chinese people opening Chinese restaurant or a Cleaner business has historically been a lot about them being discriminated elsewhere. They may very well self-segregate, but there is clear external pressure to push them to do so.

>Right but I don't have that problem. I have more of a problem with the fact that the outcomes of hiring decisions are being monitored from the outside for whether or not they advance a given race's material interests.

>Yes, you have definitely been exposed to at least one stereotype in your life. Ever seen the meme about Karen? That's a stereotype. Ever heard Asian are good at math? That's another stereotype. 

Right and I'll do you one better: everything about how you percieve the world is based in part on stereotype. Stereotyping, insofar as it refers to a real state of mind people exhibit, is fundamental to how we think. 

Ever notice how we call everything with leaves and wooden trunk a ""tree?"" Do you mean to tell me that every single one of those objects is actually the same thing? No two trees are alike. They never share the same number of leaves. When you look closer, their Leaves don't even perfectly resemble one another. They're all different down to the atom. 

And yet we deign to call them all by the same name and assume they're all going to fall off their branches at the same time every year. 

But we don't know that for sure, do we? Not until it actually happens, anyways. That's how you ""check"" or otherwise dispell the power of a stereotype. You realize it as a shortcut in thinking, and you work around it. 

Alternatively, if you never notice a pattern in your everyday life which you also feel the need to explain quickly to others, you don't adopt a stereotyped way of thinking about it. If you don't consume media from others which carries such shorthand references to things, you offset the adoption of a particular stereotype. 







> But in the US stereotypes against black people are spread absolutely everywhere and it is very unlikely that you wouldn't have been exposed to it at some point.

What is an example of a stereotype about black people that I wouldn't know is a stereotype? Or that is based entirely on a lie and no underlying pattern that promoted its use? 


>Frankly not sure what you were going for with that paragraph.

I just mean to say that I don't really consume any media about hip hop and rap culture, today. I consciously avoid pigeon holing people into those characterizations, and I'm way more likely to use some reference from my own life than one I've been given by that media. 





>No, it can be tested, it just doesn't predict behavior.

So, what's the point? That people have all sorts of latent, irrational, queer behaviors that undergird what we call consciousness? That underneath the facade of amicable personality we develop for the purposes of society, something alien and unknown is compelling us to act?

You can restate that observation a thousand ways without turning it into a game of secret racial domination by unconscious association. 





>Sequential priming, response competition, EDA, EMG, fMRI, ERP and ITA are all tests to measure implicit bias.

Ok, and if they don't predict racist behavior, why give them any authority in these sorts of discussions? 


>That often has a lot to do with them facing discrimination elsewhere. You may look at it as self-selection when it is often the result of racism. 

Yeah, no doubt they have faced racism elsewhere. What do I do about that, as a fellow student who is respecting their autonomy? Should I be trying to correct for that discrimination they faced elsewhere? Should I let them cheat off of my test answers to make sure they pass every class despite sleeping through most of them? 

Because they think it's more authentic to be aloof and snarky, to berate their well-behaved black classmates, instead of being studious and determined not to waste everyone else's time and money?

I'm a few years late to that party, I'm afraid. Someone failed them in the Alabama public school system and nothing I say as a white guy is going to make getting a regular job sound more appealing than football, guns and girls. 


Should I raise my hand and volunteer myself as the culprit for the racist slurs that get written on their sign-in papers every morning before class starts? Just so they can put a white face to the deed which was most likely perpetrated by their fellow black classmates in jest? 

I have my doubts that any of those corrective actions would be worthwhile for anyone. Best to skip it and not let it color your perception of an entire race. Most people in my class did so, even the most conservative rural Louisianan army meat heads, back from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, swaddled in every kind of reactionary American patriotism, knew all the tools to avoid unnecessary stereotyping. They learned it from being in the multiracial military. It's not hard. 




>Studies very much show that having a non-Christian sounding name put you at great disadvantage, even more so if it sound stereo-typically black.

Yep, definitely. And the reason those non christian-sounding names exist is because they were the last generation's conscious protest against white European civilization. They picked those names because they disliked hearing names which resembled their former Slave masters. 

What should I do with that piece of information? Besides giving someone with such a name an equal opportunity to work and earn a living? I can't make other people not want to go through the hassle of dealing with someone who may or may not resent and despise them because of their traditional naming conventions, among other grievances. 

I just don't have the time or power to change that recalcitrant person's mind. Supposing I could actually find anyone who doesn't hire based on black sounding names. I've never been in such a workplace myself. 


> They may very well self-segregate, but there is clear external pressure to push them to do so.

I agree. Now how do you break that cycle if they see it's actually working for them? How do you control for all of the factors necessary to incentivize them into being totally colorblind in future professional behavior, without coming off as condescending and superior? 

Best I can come up with is to be consciously colorblind and respectful in my personal dealings with them, to lead by example, and to give them an equal opportunity to work with me or for me when the chance arises. 



>Watching yourself for your implicit bias is not that, it's trying to be impartial and not advantage or disadvantage anyone. It's not a quota.

Right but in practice everything about avoiding so called quotas still amounts to enacting quotas. Somewhere, deep down in some sub routine, a miniature quota exists and factors into a greater decision. 


>The point is how they affect how you view black people that are not criminal rapper thug.

I understand. And understanding what a stereotype is allows me to do that. Not just with the idea of a black thug, but with everything else, too. Even with my ideas about what a good black person looks like. 



>But you clearly don't know what implicit bias mean if you mix it with innate bias. Implicit means it is unconscious and involuntary, it comes from your environment and is not actively espoused by you(technically it could be as a implicit and explicit bias can coincide). Innate means you are born with it.

Yeah I see that you've drawn that distinction. But if we're talking about something unconscious, or pre-conscious, is that not more innate than something you are supposedly free to think and decide about? 

Our unconscious is innate within us. Our biasing ""engine"" or ""routine"" is innate within us. The only thing that changes is what its currently focused on or subsumed within.  Supposing we could ever really tell for sure. 

I don't really trust any authoritative accounts of human unconscious or subconscious. I think we made a mistake in incorporating those types of freudian schemas into our models of psychology in the first place. I think they're distractions at best, and desperate rationalizations meant to complete a broader theory at worst.

Implicit bias is literally not about judging people, implicit bias is outside any conscious thought, it is the judgment society taught you and how it affect how you form your judgment, your subconscious guide the consciousness. Tests show that the brain can react and decide something before someone even know they made a choice. The consciousness will then interpret the decision of the subconscious after the act.

>wouldn‚Äôt me and the rest of the hundreds of millions of people who don‚Äôt judge black peoples by their clothes or the video games we play show that we are addressing lir unconscious biases without being scolded by busybody donothings like you?

Studies show people are quite biased in practice. https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html

This study basically show that despite it being illegal, 33% of people are discriminating based on a racial line. So either 33% of the country is explicitly racist consciously going against federal law, or there is much less explicit racism and a lot of people are affected by implicit biases, and this is not even touching how there is quite possibly going to be even more racism in the people who do give a callback so the percentage is certainly higher than 33%.

I also never said anything about scolding anyone. Saying to pay attention to you implicit bias to be fair is not scolding, it's a warning at worst, and generally just a good guideline.

You have a production line of strawmen.

How much your subconscious affect you in a decision is unknown and that's why you need to question your decision to see if it is a logical conscious decision and not a shortcut your subconscious pushed. You can't compare how we treat people with how we name things. That's kind of a non sequitur.

Complete non sequitur. The studies were done with equal resumes other than the name and those with a black sounding name received 33% less callback, more racism could probably still be found in interviewing but that is much harder to test.

I can't make other people not want to go through the hassle of dealing with someone who may or may not resent and despise them because of their traditional naming conventions, among other grievances. 

Never asked you anything more than giving them equal opportunity. Assuming they resent and despise you because of their name is racism. You are literally assuming they think some way because of their race.

>I agree. Now how do you break that cycle if they see it's actually working for them? How do you control for all of the factors necessary to incentivize them into being totally colorblind in future professional behavior, without coming off as condescending and superior? 

It is clearly not working for them. If they are at least 33% less likely to get hired they will obviously congregate toward black business since they were not accepted in non-black businesses. This doesn't mean it is actually benefiting them.

No... That does not follow logically. Saying to be careful how your subconscious affect you does not amount to enacting a quota. It is not about avoiding quota either, it is about being decent and understanding your subconscious affect your consciousness.

>I understand. And understanding what a stereotype is allows me to do that. Not just with the idea of a black thug, but with everything else, too. Even with my ideas about what a good black person looks like. 

The problem is that you are only looking at it from the point of view of your consciousness disregarding how it affect your subconsciousness. You can understand the stereotype is bad, but it still affect how your brain associate things.

This is not really about how you interact with black people in your day-to-day life, it's about how it affect your decisions. Frankly it's only managers, leaders, and other people in positions of responsibilities that need the memo, it is kind of irrelevant to people in general. This is also all coupled with other psychological factors like decision fatigue which make your subconscious more important in your decision making. When evaluating 10 candidates it should be fine, when evaluating 200 candidates the implicit bias will be stronger.

>Yeah I see that you've drawn that distinction. But if we're talking about something unconscious, or pre-conscious, is that not more innate than something you are supposedly free to think and decide about?

Ok, and I'm asking how you can ever hope to control something that is literally defined as ""sub"" conscious. We keep wrapping around this issue in particular because I can't comprehend how the content of my subconscious is anything more than simply whay you tell me it is, or what you want it to be such that I can undergo a performative process of overcoming it. 

As far as I can tell, I do a great job of not letting my ""sub"" conscious dictate my social behaviors in a way that unfairly disadvantages anyone. And I have always striven to do so, years before I ever heard of these terms.  



> How much your subconscious affect you in a decision is unknown and that's why you need to question your decision to see if it is a logical conscious decision and not a shortcut your subconscious pushed.

Right and I think this is a great summary of why this concept is a stumbling block for so many people. So we have decided to follow a schema where people have a sub conscious, or an unconscious, and a conscious. We don't know exactly how they relate in any predictable fashion. We don't know how to control them at all times. But we want to be able to. Or be seen as being able to. 

Why any of this really helps us, I don't know.

 

>That actually sound racist as fuck. Lot of them are immigrants and have nothing to do with American slavery and they didn't choose their name, their parents gave it to them and it's not just a ""fuck white slavers"" it's also to reconnect with their ancestors.

I didn't tell them to pick out names like that. And you'd have to be pretty ignorant not to be able to tell the difference between an Americanized ""African"" sounding name, and an authentic African name from a recent immigrant. You can look up the naming conventions and everything on Wikipedia, they're pretty noticeable and yes they would certainly be justified as a way of reconnecting to ones ancestry. 

But that also means not imitating the naming conventions of formerly slave-owning Europeans. This is also where you get the ""X"" in names like Malcom X or Ibrim X. Kendi. It's a conscious resistance to ""white"" society. 


>Complete non sequitur. The studies were done with equal resumes other than the name and those with a black sounding name received 33% less callback, more racism could probably still be found in interviewing but that is much harder to test.

>You say you are not prejudiced and yet those are some pretty heavy prejudices.

Nice, so could you explain why something that I observed as actually having happened in my own classroom setting is just a ""prejudice?"" 

Surely you don't think I was ""pre judging"" those gentlemen when I watched a series of causes, followed by their predictable effects, play out in front of me. 

Or when I listened to the things they actually professed to care about to one another. Or when I befriended the black classmates who were actually serious about their education, and who happened to be a bit older and more experienced and who also derided the bad behavior of their soon-to-be expelled black peers. 

Are you sure you're using the right word here? Because if that's the case ""prejudice"" sounds like it means something other than what the term suggests. 

It sounds almost like you don't believe certain groups of people are actually capable of lacking merit in whatever regard, and that all claims to the contrary are just projections of a fevered and ignorant mind. 



>Never mentioned a corrective action, just to be wary of how your subconscious color your decisions.

No, I don't think this is always the case. It could be, but I can't know unless I give someone the opportunity to show that. 

But I'm guessing that other people must be doing that, if the tests you highlighted earlier are true. They must find something distasteful about the names themselves. 



>It is clearly not working for them. If they are at least 33% less likely to get hired they will obviously congregate toward black business since they were not accepted in non-black businesses. This doesn't mean it is actually benefiting them.

It's not all places that are provided the opportunity to hire black people that are 33% less likely to do so. It's some certain industries in some states that appear to have that problem, if I remember the study correctly. 

But to the point about black businesses hiring black people, isn't that a benefit if all parties are getting most of what they wanted? Should those black businesses also be forced to seek out white applicants over black applicants in order to balance their employee representation? 

Or are they providing some sort of secondary service by making themselves into a sort of safe haven for the rejects of other avenues of employment? Would you feel confident in outlawing such workplaces in the hopes that it changes things for the better for everyone? 

I would be in favor of it. But I think you'll find that a lot of those black employers and employees wouldn't. They probably wouldn't trust it in practice. 



>No... That does not follow logically. Saying to be careful how your subconscious affect you does not amount to enacting a quota. It is not about avoiding quota either, it is about being decent and understanding your subconscious affect your consciousness.

If you refuse black people in an interview because you assume they all did those things, you are racist. Painting the whole for the action of some you saw is racism. I think you mentioning all those things was just completely irrelevant to what you were replying to and was a non sequitur. I'm talking about discrimination in interview based on as study and you come talk you saw black people do shit in class. How the hell is that relevant.

>It's not all places that are provided the opportunity to hire black people that are 33% less likely to do so. It's some certain industries in some states that appear to have that problem, if I remember the study correctly.

Everyone should just be impartial. But them hiring all black probably has a lot more to do with white not applying and them taking all the black people that couldn't find a job in non black businesses because of racism. That and geographic segregation. Businesses are filled with people that mostly lived in proximity and historically white people got the fuck out of areas with black people.

>Ok, great, I just don't think that's a very clear command to follow. And I think in practice it means we create a kind of quota, anyways. 

You haven't shown how that in anyway amount to a quota. A short explanation of how the subconscious affect us and how it relate to implicit bias would help make it more clear.

>Ok, so I ask again: is it possible to control your subconscious or unconscious in any meaningful way? And if so, why do we call them ""sub"" or ""un"" conscious? 

You can certainly influence it, studies do show that mentioning MLK before implicit bias test in regard to race reduce the implicit bias. But doing so would be tantamount to brainwashing. That's why my point is not to control your subconscious, it is to mitigate its influence by using your consciousness to verify no shortcut was taken in your decisions and that is absolutely possible. The naming of subconscious is possibly not the best, it generally denote all thinking that is done outside of the conscious thinking.

The best policy is generally to make things blind. Being conscious of how society affect you is certainly a good thing, it doesn't need to be perfect, just realizing it go a long way. Resting more between decisions is actually a good thing, not just for races. Even outside any specific bias.

>Never talked about any guilt. The goal is impartiality, not reverse partiality.

Right I just don't really see how that plays out any differently to how most people already run their workplaces. 


>That's a logical fallacy of the slippery slope. The acceptance of my minimalist and cheap suggestion would sabotage their expensive suggestion. Their solution already exist, is already bought, and is already spread.

Yeah, it would. And your solution isn't the one that I'm going to eventually get training on should any issues around race present themselves where I work. 

It's going to be what anyone ends up doing in practice of course, because the extreme scared straight solutions can't actually work. 




>You don't control your subconscious(technically you can influence it by opposite reinforcement, but that's just changing the bias), but you can very much do a double take on your decision to make sure they are truly impartial and neutral and were not influenced unbeknownst to you.

Yeah I guess that's what I already do. But this explanation seems to help you more than it does me. 



>Well, I was talking of a study, in that study the name were Jamal and Lakisha, nothing political. It would be pretty racist to assume they changed their name to Jamal or Lakisha because they are black and hate white people.

They would balk if you said they did it purely out of ""hate"" for white people. They'd also balk and dismiss your accusing them of being racist in adjusting their naming conventions. It's all for the greater good, you see. 

The fact that the names go from Christian inspired to Pan African diaspora in a single generation means that there's a resistance to being named like the dominant group in society would otherwise dictate. It's not about an overt hatred being expressed: it's just a passive form of resistance and separatism that I'm sure other people from prior generations must be picking up and responding to. 

I don't care what anyone's name is, personally. 


>If you refuse black people in an interview because you assume they all did those things, you are racist. Painting the whole for the action of some you saw is racism. 

But I said that everyone didn't do those things. I knew that at the time, I knew before and after. I'm just giving you an anecdote of what happens to black individuals further back in the pipeline to employment. There's all kinds of influences playing out in their lives which make them better or worse suited for completing a program. 

There's all sorts of opportunities to intervene and get them to correct their course and find gainful employment should they just forgo short term gratification. But those opportunities are forgone for a variety of reasons like I explained. 

This isn't about stereotyping people as being one way. It's about explaining that there's actually a lot of self inflicted problems that people suffer from and which they often have to learn from the hard way, on their own. One cannot always intervene as an individual witnessing a situation and alter it for the better. It wouldn't even be acceptable to do so in many cases. 



> I'm talking about discrimination in interview based on as study and you come talk you saw black people do shit in class. How the hell is that relevant.

It's relevant for the reasons mentioned above. I wasn't talking about your study, I was talking about why more qualified applicants for various jobs don't exist in the first place. Because they are self selecting themselves out of certain career tracks. For all sorts of reasons. Reasons that often are only tangentially related to their race as such, but which are often interpreted as being racially discriminatory. 


>You are remembering incorrectly, all industries are concerned.

Where does it say that in the study? 



>Everyone should just be impartial. But them hiring all black probably has a lot more to do with white not applying and them taking all the black people that couldn't find a job in non black businesses because of racism.

Ok, so should we compel people to be impartial, or just continue to expect it? We've been expecting it (and compelling it to some degree) for a few generations now. 


> That and geographic segregation. Businesses are filled with people that mostly lived in proximity and historically white people got the fuck out of areas with black people.

Ok, so what's preventing a promising graduate of some college or certificate program from moving into a new neighborhood and turning over a new leaf among a racial out group? Are there any Laws that prevent this from happening, logistically? 

Is it not just an engrained prejudice that makes people of all races self segregate into communities that share their overall cultural and political aims, anyways? Continuing to do so even when it becomes a derided practice? 

That's what seems to be happening, to me. 


>You haven't shown how that in anyway amount to a quota.

If you have two resumes of two perfectly-equally qualified applicants for a job in your hands. And the only difference is their race. And you know how many of whatever majority or minority race already working for you. How do you decide who to hire? 

One way or another you're forced to confront the prospect that you have been following a pattern of unconscious bias in hiring. And in order to correct that you'll be giving an extra, arbitrary weight to one of those applicants based on no fault or choice of their own. 

No matter what, you'll be defaulting to a kind of quota that you want to meet. To correct for something else. What else could you do? 






>The best policy is generally to make things blind. Being conscious of how society affect you is certainly a good thing, it doesn't need to be perfect, just realizing it go a long way. Resting more between decisions is actually a good thing, not just for races.

That is also brushing aside the Jim Crow law and civil rights movement. It is a political statement but that statement is by the parents, not the child, and now 60 years later it is kind of a moot point as it is more cultural than political.

Yeah, but how is that relevant to a study based on job application that is measuring racism based on callback? I'm not talking about global statistical outcome for quotas.

>Where does it say that in the study? 

Where it says there is no noticeable difference in different industries or whether they say they are equal opportunity employers.

>Ok, so what's preventing a promising graduate of some college or certificate program from moving into a new neighborhood and turning over a new leaf among a racial out group? Are there any Laws that prevent this from happening, logistically? 

Them being too poor to move to those neighborhoods? Historically there was very much laws preventing it. Even not racist white people were forced to move as the law would screw them over if they didn't move.

>Is it not just an engrained prejudice that makes people of all races self segregate into communities that share their overall cultural and political aims, anyways? Continuing to do so even when it becomes a derided practice? 

Now it is mostly poverty and inertia stopping it.

>If you have two resumes of two perfectly-equally qualified applicants for a job in your hands. And the only difference is their race. And you know how many of whatever majority or minority race already working for you. How do you decide who to hire? 

You call both of them back and give them an interview :')

Ideally you also do blind hiring so you don't know their name and cannot tell what their race is.

> I wish other people would, too. I just think I do most of this type of self checking already, though.

A lot of people lack introspection. If you don't then it doesn't concern you.

Goalpost moving is often done to avoid tough questions.  Since you dodged the question (as if that would make it all go away), here's your answer:

The National Organization for Women is the largest feminist group on planet earth. Full stop.  Nearly every feminist agenda from #METOO to keeping lifetime alimony has been funded and fought for by the NOW.  

Because of the absolute reach of NOW, the ""No True Scotsman"" argument doesn't apply here. 

NOW has openly and proudly fought against the [recognition of parental alienation syndrome](https://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/the-national-organization-of-women-vs-parental-alienation-the-strange-parallel).  This is something that no only hurts the other parent, but also devastating consequences for the children.   And before the chumps try the next tactic of attacking the source, here it is [in their own fucking words](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/0dab915e/files/uploaded/California-NOW-Family-Court-Report-2002-2.pdf).

Fighting against one parent to alienate (and subsequently harm) the children from the other parent should be a titanium pillar of parental equality. Same with equality measures such as default 50/50 parenting.  [NOW is against that, too](http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2006/0802sacks.html). The red herring is that ""Well some men are baaaaad and should have custody.""  

Sure.  Some women are too.  But even if we stick to men, the courts take these factors into account.   If there is an anomaly, this is addressed. Default shared parenting simply means that the default position is for the child to have equal access to both parents.  

Who spent millions to fight this by influencing judges and politicians to fight or delay shared parenting initiaves (and is still doing so today)?

 Same organization.  

Next direct question to you.  If feminism was about equality, why would this group fight measures for equality? And why don't the feminist icons, supporters, and stalwarts denounce such efforts?  Hell,  even to look askance at the NOW would be a marked improvement for these feminists.  But not even that.  Either tacit approval or complicit silence.",NohoTwoPointOh,t2_2b1m4j1i,4,0,reddit4

I would say that it's because there isn't an equality issue there (maybe other than social stigmas, but thay often goes against both genders)

The problem isn't equal outcome, its equal opportunity. Everyone understands that a gender may naturally lean towards a certain job for whatever reason.. but in the instances of board rooms, it's fairly gender neutral in terms of the people who want to apply.

But I do agree in breaking down gender stereotypical norms. And everyone should be able to apply for whatever job they want without fear of gender being an obstacle

I mean, think of this. All jobs used to be men's jobs right.

Child support **ISN'T** fair.. because the majority of people paying Child support are men. And, in many cases these men are forced to pay child support without having any legal right to spend time with the child / children they are paying for.

If a man can not pay child support he's called a dead beat and thrown in jail.  
If  a woman can not pay child support she is told she's the true victim here and given support.

Also the system is 100% broken when it will force a boy who was raped by a woman pedophile and went on to have the baby to pay back dated child support as soon as he turns 18.

Let that sink in for a second.. a boy whom was below the age of consent is raped by a woman and instead of getting justice for what happened he is told that the woman is the true victim and he needs to pay child support for a child he was too young to consent to having.

And yet you seem to think that Child support is 'Fair'

The reason it exists is because women stay home with children often for many years and have no credit or income when their husbands leave them. In those cases, the higher earning spouse has to support the low earning one until things change. 

Note that the word ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù is deliberately used here, it would be applicable in situations where the man had a tremendous amount of money and the woman had nothing. 

Alimony has largely disappeared now. Interestingly, it would be applicable if my husband and I divorced as I stayed home with our three kids for like 8 years, as a result I earn 1/3 of his income. But we would never ever get divorced ever.",GiantDairy,t2_55tt0m07,1,0,reddit4

Once the projects wrapped up and we were delegated to work on other stuff, naturally we weren't talking as much. 

Months later I get a disturbing email from an internal investigations group that I was reported for code of conduct violations. I go into the meeting with them completely baffled what it could have been. They tell me who reported and why and drill me as if I'm a monster. After which I sent 55 pages of texts showing how consensual it was. 

Fast-forward to the follow up meeting, I'm completely exonerated once they saw how consensual it really was, and told me she was mad that we weren't talking as much and felt used. 

I was also advised to not do anything that'd appear retaliatory, meaning, I had to keep having ONE ON ONE weekly syncs with this person who tried really hard to get me fired. How fucking uncomfortable. 

A month later she quit. Good riddance!

I'm one of the few lucky ones where an honest investigations group did the right thing, but it could have easily gone the other way. Ever since then I stay clear of any conversation that could remotely be considered flirtatious, look at the floor if standing in an elevator alone with a woman, do my best to stay in my lane and minimize interactions with women, and pretend to be an inferior species just to get a paycheck.

After a few days of training her, she began to attempt small talk and i went along with it moderately.

After her training ended, she started to have attitudes with the rest of the kitchen staff, and i found out from someone there that she complained about me to the head chef that i was being ""creepy and too touchy"" with her.

This has nothing to do with women as a whole. You will perhaps meet guys like this as well. Or maybe not. Thankfully, people like this are generally rare (whether male or female).

I would not leap to broad generalizations based on this one single example. But in the future, maybe be more cautious about immediately developing a close friendship with a work colleague before you know more about their personality and character. And if someone is trying to borrow money after you barely know them, that's usually a big red flag. Even if you didn't meet the person at work.

Basically, just learn to vet people better. This really doesn't seem like a women vs. men issue to me.

I was convinced she lied to me about being 28, she said I was mistaken, so I asked her age a few more time to see if she would slip up & she did, I think she told so many people so many lies, she didn't know what was real and what wasn't..

oh I agree nepotism is a problem, that is a pretty common thing enjoyed by both parties having their children and relatives given big jobs across seas, not uncommon. Does not really affect me or the country. However what does, and people like you never seem to mention is when Kushner can not pass security checks and gets nepotism 20 times that level, and billions from the Saudis, or Ivana and her Chinese millions and copyrights.  Not even remotely close on the same level of harmful nepotism. Thats cool and all you are not American and still giving your opinion, but what is a bigger deal, someone unqualified getting a job that has no affect on your country, OR multiple children getting top clearance jobs that have serious implications on your country and those some half wit shit stain kids cashing out with hundreds of millions of your countries money? answer this please?



> the idea that some random woman can show up with very vague claims

That was a character testimony, for a lifetime position job. She put her life  on the line to do that. She was not random, they went to school together.

The thing you are missing is Kavanagh did the same thing, but even worse.

>I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded. There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. 

I want you to read very carefully for a minute. If you think the administration is not aware of what this teacher is doing you are dead wrong. By allowing it to happen for as long as the teacher has been doing that class, the school is willfully indifferent. That is implicit support and why willfull indifference is a thing under Title IX.

You say you aren't worried about retaliation but here is the deal. There are many ways a school can fuck with you. The teacher has the backing of the administration if she is getting away with this. Be very careful. When it comes to Title IX issues (which this is) it is like dealing with HR at a company. **Rule of acquisition number 48: The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife.** I have personally been down this road and see some similar mistakes being made here.. This is a topic of study for this professor. If you think that a short email and a quick talk will fix her thinking this way about men you are wrong. She will just do it to another person the next semester at best.

If you are in the USA and *actually* want to do something the *worst* thing to do is tell the administration. It is a conflict of interest for the school to find it discriminates against men. They don't do it. Have you ever read a news story showing a school investigated a professor and found they discriminate against men?

If in the USA you can file federally through OCR for free. I can point you to the website for filing and Title IX legal manual for reference if you choose to. Violation of Title IX is a federal issue. Let the OCR's lawyers represent you rather than hoping the school does the right thing. OCR has binding resolutions that force the school to do substantially more. Once you file, your protection against retaliation goes way up. From what I have read the general idea is that the burden of proof is shifted to the school to show an adverse action was *not* retaliation, rather than you needing to prove it was.

If I was about to, or wanted to file federally the last thing I would do is tip the entire case into their lap by dumping evidence to higher ups hoping the people who support this teacher will suddenly do the right thing. Establishing patterns of discrimination via OCR is useful for people who come after you. Also, more cases like this going to OCR helps set the tone and inform OCR this is a real issue across the country that we care about. OCR looks for case patterns. If we don't file, we arent changing the narrative. Hit me up if you want me to point you in OCR's direction.

What you should have done, instead, is bring up certain example, state how and why they were inappropriate or made you upset.

There's nothing wrong with women being engineers and I think you would be hard pressed to find a man that feels they shouldn't be.

There is something wrong with unqualified women being shoehorned into engineering positions due to gender politics.

 I don't care if she said men are pigs and idiots, that doesn't give you, me, or anyone else the right to *lie* about what happened.

Not only do I not see you citing any source on your claim that she ""made gender a issue"", I don't rightly give a shit. It couldn't be less relevant what she did.

What's your point? It *was* a terrible movie, regardless of the gender issue. It doesn't matter what the actors did or didn't say about it, it changed nothing. The movie was bad.

She made the construction of this bridge a gender issue? When? I've seen this claim made twice now, without a single source to back it up. 

Secondly, even if your claim is 100% true, some other person being sexist does not entitle you to attack someone based on their gender. Not in this sub. Not anywhere with people that can rub two brain cells together. 

The phrase ""Don't stoop to their level"" comes to mind. Start acting like an adult. Just because someone feminist may or may not have said something you find sexist, doesn't mean you get to be sexist in return. You can take that attitude and go find a different sub.

Drafted first overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Daigle failed to live up to the high expectations, achieving a career-high of only 51 points in three separate National Hockey League (NHL) regular seasons. Daigle is widely regarded today as one of the all-time greatest draft busts in NHL history.

If there are any women you work with that appear a bit neutral or are willing to have a good work relationship with you, bring the subject up with them. Pick and choose your times, of course. Hold your frame, just state that you think it's good workplace policy not to date someone you work with or someone in the same workplace as you. Because: you want to put your career first, because dating could cause animosity in a workplace where patient's health should be the main focus, etc. Eventually some of them will start to accept your viewpoint even if they don't personally agree with you. And their changed opinions will start to radiate out into the wider workplace. It may take months or years, but stand your ground and they will eventually accept that you have a right to your opinion.

EDIT: another option would be, if your hospital or workplace has a newspaper or newsletter, write an op-ed about dating in the workplace. State why you think dating someone from the workplace is a bad idea (or at least why you think it's a bad idea for you personally and your career), and invite people to offer a response. Make it a human resources issue about workplaces generally, rather than an issue about just one person. Get it out there, get people talking about it. If people are ""angry"" because they don't like your opinion, make them justify their ""anger"" with reasons.

'Good morning, x.

I hope to be able to speak to you later about a series of incidents involving myself and a coworker. 

The incidents have encroached upon sexual harassment and have resulted in retaliation towards myself from individuals not involved, possibly due to slander. The resulting hostile working environment has heavily weighed on my mental and emotional health, and the severity of the retaliations have only increased in recent days, affecting my ability to provide care and focus on my tasks. 

The seriousness of the incidents, the possible consequences to myself and my career, and the environment in which I now find myself have lead me to schedule a consultation with a lawyer specialising in these cases and to speak about the meeting I am requesting. 

I hope you can empathise with my distress and take steps to assess the situation to figure out what has been said and to whom, and that you won't take this lightly due to the genders.

hyyad2e,t1_hywx6et,2022-03-01 19:50:04,MensRights,"Is it legal to record people without their consent? I did it once as a child and was punished for it and told that it was illegal and could land someone in jail (I was just a child and those idiots overeacted, I had no ill intentions, I just had this little tape recorder and I was recording all kinds of things for fun, like a normal fucking kid does and they lost their shit thinking I was trying to cause trouble, it's fucked up how they deny children their innocence and project all kinds of shit on them, like flipping their shit because a 9 years old girl is having fun playing with her tape recorder or falsely accusing a 5 years old boy of being a sexual predator because he was playing house or doctor when a 5 years doesn't even know what sex is, but it won't stop these crazy folks, especially the radical Left Feminazis, from projecting sexual shit on innocent 5 years old boys and falsely accuse them of being sexual predators or Brock-Turners-in-Training). If it's illegal to record or film people without their consent and he does he, he could go to jail for it.

Someone once said: ""So, if someone recorded you without your consent, it is considered a gross infringement on your privacy, and you can initiate a lawsuit against them. If you win the suit, expect to receive a handsome amount in damages.""

Also even if you can record someone, according to law advice lawyers, you still have to prove in court that the voice on the tape actually belongs to the person you are claiming and not someone impersonating them, show that the recording device you used was capable of making an accurate recording, prove that the recording is a true and accurate representation of the conversation (this is usually an issue when the recording cuts in and out because of, for example, wind blowing through the microphone, which could cause the conversation to lose much of its context), and verify that the recording has not been tampered or altered in any way. 

So you see, recording a cracy married chick who is sexually harassing you is not as simple and easy as some people think it is. He should ask the authorities what is legal and illegal and what measures he can take to legally prove that he's being harassed. The last thing he wants is to go to jail, a lot of men experience prison rape in jail.",312Michelle,t2_2fcotuis,0,0,reddit4

You're likely to get zerged by downvoters just as my remark is above. While I agree with everything you said, that wasn't exactly the concept behind my post.

I was speaking about the fact that feminists decry men who express any sort of preference for any type of woman, and they are attempting to indoctrinate their less radical sisters to that ideology. 

Admittedly, it's an attractive ideology for the lazy, selfish, and entitled women out there. 

Western women already have ALL the cards and all the choices when it comes to child bearing and raising and indeed, whether or not a child is even born. The only choice men have is whether or not to have sex. 

The choices I was talking about though have to do with just not playing the game. Simply avoid women who express current day feminist ideas. Ask them flat-out what they think about things if you need to. 

These feminists do not want men to be entitled to choose a woman that they want to be with because it makes life more difficult for them and it takes power from them. Your power is your ability to choose.

Feminists don't want you to have the choice because it means that when they decide it's time to get a sperm donor and 18 year mealticket, they want to be able to choose from the entirety of the male pool, not just those cucks and stooges that are desperate enough to sleep with them.

Do not be a desperate stooge. Choose women who agree with you, they are out there, I promise you they are!

So, that's is what I meant by having choices.

Replace feminists with other people, and you've got it right. 

As for the definition of good, it is a largely subjective thing. People aren't taught anymore how to recognize what they want and expect in a relationship, so when the inevitable breakup happens, they just blame the other person and refuse to learn and grow. 

I've accepted that I'm likely going to be single the rest of my life simply because I find myself in an environment where my definition of 'good' simply does not exist in the form of a single woman. Doesn't mean I won't discount the possibility that I'm wrong, just that I've recognized that the traits I'm interested in typically result in a woman marrying young, and staying married.

I don't know how to be encouraging to you in a way that won't sound either patronizing or as if I'm talking past your concerns, so bear with me with what I'm about to say:

You have to put yourself out there and be in a positive and receptive mental state. 

Physical appearance is only reasonably important to women when they are young and even then, a rock star personality can convince them where a Bradd Pitt appearance may not exist. 

I do know that looking back over my life, my best times with women were when I was in the best mental state - when I was happy, outwardly projecting ""good vibes"" (for lack of a better term). I also know that I didn't always project the most positive energy, and it was during those times that I found it hardest to find a date/hookup. 

When I was splashing around confience and positivity, getting laid was like taking candy from grandma.

That is DEFINITELY a thing that you have to ""fake it, til you make it"". 

By that I mean that even if you are not feeling particularly confident or even super positive, you gotta fake it, even if you feel super awkward in doing that. The reason is that you consciously telling yourself to be positive literally changes your brain chemistry (little by little) and makes it easier for you to project that the next time, and it goes on and on like that until you just do it more or less automatically. Fake it til you make it.

Maybe I'm getting caught up in semantics, but I believe that emotional availability isn't what you should try to exhibit, but rather emotional maturity. I wouldn't even try to limit interactions with women with those terms either, as you come off as two-faced if you act differently with men vs women. I've always treated people the same regardless of gender, I've just found that my tendency to be a serious, factual person scares off a lot of people. 

I've always been different from the general population, even growing up. I'm not interesting in lying to myself about how I function, so it's only natural to accept that the odds of finding somebody that accepts me for who I am, reinforces my strengths and helps cover my weaknesses are simply lower than most.

If you have to change yourself in order to suit others just to get a date, those others are not worth your time or energy‚Ä¶ and a massive amount of energy is expended in order to try to fit in. 

I know several people on the spectrum who have not only managed to get dates without having to turn themselves inside out, they even married and had families. Some of those people (myself included) ended up marrying someone else in the spectrum. Some of those people found loving, caring individuals who understood their differences. Some of those people did learn different coping mechanisms so that they did eventually fit into their relationships more easily. 

Whether you‚Äôre neurotypical or diverse, a long term relationship will involve change, it will involve compromise. However you need to find someone willing to accept you for you first, when you‚Äôre actively in a relationship and find that certain behaviour you do annoy your partner, you‚Äôre more likely to actively want to work on changing that behaviour yourself. Many on the spectrum don‚Äôt necessarily notice or realise when their behaviour causes issues. That‚Äôs why communication is important. If your partner of however many years tells you that you leaving the toilet seat up pisses them off, then you need to listen. However, by the same token, if you tell them that their behaviour in leaving their dirty dishes on the table really aggravates you, then they should show you the same respect in working on changing what they‚Äôre doing also.

A post about racism in which I said the following:

>Well nearly 1/4 of homeless people are mentally ill. And the rest  probably end up there after a few years on the streets. They probably  end up seething with hatred and resentment. Racism and sexism are easy  tools to use to lash out against ""normal"" members of society. They are  low cost/high impact. Had you told him to fuck off I'm sure he would  have had some choice words for you too. But they wouldn't have had the  same bite as calling someone a ni\*\*er or a cunt. 

I edited out the n-word, because everyone knows racism is exponential. By six uses you are basically Hitler at the Olympics. I can't find the other three instances the bot spoke about. So I have no context. But it is not a normal word in my vocabulary. I also have a 12 year old account and me loves me some controversial topics. Religion, sex/gender, race, and politics.

3) If they refuse to leave, remind them that they are trespassing on private property and that you will call the cops if they don't leave.

Actually a club not wanting its reputation to be potentially tarnished by the probably trial by media the incident would generate sounds entriely accurate.

And yet he's updated things as they've progressed and mentioned calling on powerful prestigious members of the club to aid him, working through indirect channels as well. The response will most likely be very forthcoming under those circumstances.

Any emergency, which may or may not include a crime in progress, such as trespassing, especially after being asked to leave the property, can necessitate a call to 911.

Source: http://www.911.gov/whencall.html

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress

>Important: If you‚Äôre not sure whether the situation is a true emergency, officials recommend calling 911 and letting the call-taker determine whether you need emergency help.

I live in a major US city, and have called 311 to report a break-in from the night before, not even an emergency, and they instructed me to call 911.

Unless you can provide a better source for your claim that 911 is only for **life-threatening** emergencies, you are completely wrong and such information could lead to someone not seeking proper help in the future, for their sakes you should probably correct your statement.

The fire department came rushing out and saw that it was a Mexican family burning the trash.  They didn't even bother talking to the Mexican family, they came over and called my friend a racist bastard.  I'm assuming they would have ticketed them if they'd been middle class whites, but I don't know for sure.

Second, the man would have to prove that he was harmed.  He didn't lose his job, his wife didn't leave him.  Third, the girls would raise a litany of conditional privileges.  Each of them would claim they were protecting the other, that it was in the interest of the public to know about this pervert, and so on.  The biggest obstacle is that if the girls did not assert any factual basis for their conclusion that the man is a pervert, then it is a statement of opinion, and while courts are not required to throw those out, they do because they would be required to ask a jury if the man was a pervert.

Can you support this with any sources? Where does it say that those are the crimes they are talking about?

It is extremely clear what they mean

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:A fire, A crime, especially if in progress, A car crash, especially if someone is injured, A medical emergency, such as someone who is unconscious, gasping for air or not breathing, experiencing an allergic reaction, having chest pain, having uncontrollable bleeding, or any other symptoms that require immediate medical attention

The website didn't take the time to explain the difference between crimes in progress for which you should call 911 and crimes for which you should call the local number. Could you provide a source for this distinction? I've always been instructed to call 911 by a local precinct when it has to do with a previous crime or one in progress, no matter how minor, which is anecdotal so it doesn't count as a source really, just my own experience, but the website I provided seems to support that.

Do you have a source for your claims, because all you are doing is restating your original claim, and backing it up by saying you were a first responder at a pool and therefore are authoritative on what necessitates a call to police (but you still don't have a source, photo of your training manual on concerning what to call 911 for maybe?), which isn't a source, I'm not going to just take your word on it, because I was a 911 responder for 20 years (I wasn't but I hope you get my point, without a source, everyone is full of shit on the internet). According to you, trespassing by females is not something that requires a 911 call. Do you think the 911 call the girls made was acceptable? Do you think in this situation the police should not be involved at all?

>Some boy in an adult's body who's intimidated by girls sunbathing where they aren't supposed to isn't an emergency. As a general rule of thumb, if it's fitting to go tattle on the girls to their parents then it's not appropriate to call 911 to report something.

Why does the fact that he is a man and they are women matter? Furthermore implying that he is an intimidated man-boy is really just attempting to shame him for doing his duties as a caretaker. Neither of these things are relevant to the discussion.

The **government website specifically on the topic of which occasions necessitate 911 calls** I provided is very clear that a crime in progress constitutes an emergency for which you should call 911.

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress...

Now this last bit was a little rude

>If you are that much of a bitch, keep the local police department's number in your phone or call the operater at 0 and ask to be redirected. But don't trust me, I was just a certified first responder for 4 years at a swimming pool and taught how to deal with crime (call police directly) versus medical emergencies (call 911)

Oh, you worked at a pool, so you still have no source for your claim.

Anyways what is a bitch? Please tell me. Is it a person who won't ""man up"" and solve his own crimes? A boy in an adult's body who calls the police to solve his crime-related problems? Ironically, that's exactly what the girls in this case did, a man told them they were trespassing and told them to leave, and they called the cops. Was their well-being in immediate danger because he is a man and they are women? You seem to be implying that him being male means that he has no reason to call the police if females are committing crimes.

**TLDR** I provided a pretty clear source, all you did was say I cherrypicked it and said you were a pool first responder for 4 years and are therefore qualified to counter that very clear wording on the website. **http://www.911.gov/whencall.html**

Please provide a source for your claim that **crimes in progress such as the one witnessed by the OP do not necessitate 911 calls and do not constitute emergencies, only ""real"" emergencies like the ones you listed do.**

Furthermore, I'm being reasonable and not advocating calling 911 at every opportunity, that's an obvious straw man of the argument I am presenting, verbal warnings and explanations can go a long way to remedy these situations, but when that doesn't work, what is the recourse you suggest someone like the OP take?",,,3,0,reddit2

I'm in NY though, and had a similar he said/she said situation where I was accused of harassing a tenant when trying to get in to fix a leaking toilet (I could hear it running from the hall, and I paid the water bill).  NY is a single party state, so I didn't have to tell them I was recording since it was a conversation I was involved with.

She calls the cops after letting me in.  I see car in driveway and go out, they're already talking.  One of the cops walks up to me and starts lecturing me about harassing a tenant.  I let him go for a minute or two and then say calmly:  ""you've only heard her side of the story, would you like to hear mine before coming to a conclusion?  Or better yet, would you like to just listen to what actually happened?""

I played the recording for him and you wouldn't believe the level of satisfaction I got from watching them rip her apart for lying to the police.  I smiled at her from over the the cop's shoulder.

The bolded part.

If they had asked for ID, seen that according to his ID he lived there, and then chosen not to detain him, that would be a reasonable course of action.  OP *did* say that they confiscated his wallet, so we know he had his wallet on him.  Presumably it had ID in it.  They had talked to each group of people individually before conferring and locking him up.  There was certainly time to ask for ID proving the guy lived there.

If a female burglar breaks into my house, and cuts herself on the glass of a broken window, then calls 911 to charge me with assault when I catch her... shouldn't the cops ask me for my ID to when I say I live here, and the person is a burglar?

Further, they did not arrest the women for trespassing, or even ask the OP if he wanted them arrested for trespassing, when it's his job to enforce the no-trespassing rule.

Let me put it another way.

If, in a 2-party dispute, the cops detained the person other than the one that called all the time, then ""of course"" they detained him because the girls called first.

Since they don't, there are other factors involved in that decision.

verb (used with object)

1. to seize (a person) by legal authority or warrant; take into custody: The police arrested the burglar.

2. to catch and hold; attract and fix; engage: The loud noise arrested our attention.

3. to check the course of; stop; slow down: to arrest progress.

noun

5. the taking of a person into legal custody, as by officers of the law.

8. Machinery. any device for stopping machinery; stop.

-----

[arrest](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrest)

""to cause to stop,"" also ""to detain legally,"" late 14c., from Old French arester ""to stay, stop"" (Modern French arr√™ter), from Vulgar Latin *arrestare (source of Italian arrestare, Spanish and Portuguese arrestar), from Latin ad- ""to"" (see ad-) + restare ""to stop, remain behind, stay back"" (see rest (n.2)). Figurative sense of ""to catch and hold"" (the attention, etc.) is from 1814.

-----

DerpaNerb's use of the word was appropriate, and your ""correction"" is out of place.

The arbitrary distinction between ""arrest"" and ""detain"" came into being well after the constitution and the bill of rights were codified.  This distinction came into effect as a way to arbitrarily grant the police more power.

If you use the meaning of the word ""arrest"" that was in use at the time that the constitution and bill of rights were ratified, then the original poster (OP) was *indeed* ""arrested"" without a warrant or probable cause.  As such, his rights were violated.

If the owner or owner's agent (manager, security guard, whatever) asks you to leave and you refuse, then you are trespassing. I'm not sure how the signs would play into this since you can't prove they saw them, but by OP telling they are on private property yet refusing to leave they are trespassing. I'm more concerned with the false report. Again, in my state:  

It is unlawful for a person to knowingly make to a law enforcement agency of either this state or a political subdivision of this state a false, fraudulent or unfounded report or statement or to knowingly misrepresent a fact for the purpose of interfering with the orderly operation of a law enforcement agency or misleading a peace officer. Violation of this section is a class 1 misdemeanor (up to 90 days).  

They knew they were there illegally. They knew the 'creeper' was telling they were there illegally. They could have apologized and been on their way. But no, they decided it would be a hoot to try and fuck up some random guys life just because they could.  

The cops confirmed that he belonged there and that they did not. Instead of telling them they can file (false) charges against OP they should have gone full ""Scared Straight"" on them. At the very least these FEMALE cops who probably know what true victims look like, should scolded and scared the shit out of these little entitled fucks for crying wolf.

Rape, sexual assault, threats of same, which the girls also cried, are definitely greater in magnitude than trespassing so yes, they should investigate that claim first, if there must be a choice between the two.

However, when the cops separate the two sides, it's to get their stories separately.  The OP said that's what they were doing.  That's a part of their job.

However, when you can verify a part of that story with a 15 second check, that too is a part of the job.  Then she'd know he was telling the truth about living there, which means his story has more evidence than that of the girls.

> This means detaining the alleged harasser.

Telling him ""don't leave, stay over there away from the girls, we're watching you"" style detaining?  That's debatable, but I'm not going to make an issue of it.  However if they should have detained him that way, then they should have detained the girls the same way.

Until they have probable cause of, or witness threatening or violent behavior, cuffs or back of the car are inappropriate.

And the law actually does not, on its face, require warrants for seizures nor probable cause.  It simply says you are protected from ""unreasonable"" seizures.  Which is why the law has created the distinctions between a terry stop, a detention, and an arrest and given specific protections to each.  You only need probable cause to effectuate an arrest.  The second sentence only says that a warrant wont issue without probable cause.  It never says when you need a warrant.  A perfectly good interpretation of the 4th amendment would be that warrants can be issued but are never needed and that searches and seizures are limited by an arbitrary reasonableness standard.  We have decided to give the citizens more protection by requiring a warrant where there has not been an exception to the warrant requirement when effectuating an arrest or doing a search.

A terry stop is a type of seizure.  A legal detention is a type of seizure.  An arrest is a type of seizure.  To effectuate a terry stop, you only need to have reason to believe a crime may be afoot.  A detention can be used where further investigation needs to be conducted and is to be limited to what is needed to do that investigation and to protect the officer.  An arrest is where the detention has become more than a minor inconvenience.  The division between these three things is not always easy to make but this sounded like a detention to me.

It says right there that no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, and that they shall name the person or things to be siezed.

If you can sieze a person without a warrant, then why, praytell, is there cause for such a warrant?

And seizing a man without probable cause that he's done something wrong *is* unreasonable.

The natural course of government is to extend itself by bites and nibbles.  The government says ""this is right and propper"", and over time, it convinces people that ""well if the government says it is so, it must be so"".

I have to disagree here with that being even remotely ""good"".  If warrants are never needed, then it'd be pretty idiotic to include any requirements on getting them, now wouldn't it?  The section passage is there for a reason.  If the passage is there for a reason, it affects the rest of that ammendment.

The fact that there are requirements on warrants for searches and seizures, in a passage devoted to protecting the people against searches and siezures, means that they *are* necessary.

That there is nothing specifically allowing for searches and siezures without warrants, then, means that warrants are required for *all* searches and siezures.

One cannot make this claim without further analysis. She provides a *potential* explanation, not a fact which is already verified. Equally likely is the explanation that men take bigger risks, ignoring the degree at which a role must be a ""perfect fit"" before applying. This differs from vetting, as vetting implies no foresight was done before applying (more shotgun approach than sniper approach).

The analysis also stops prematurely. Why do women vet more? Is it luxury? Is it a better strategy? Does the vetting of roles play into satisfaction later down the line? If women are so good at vetting jobs, why do they still earn less on the adjusted wage gap (what do they gain from the vetting, or is this only young women, were adjusted wage gap is even smaller)?  How do women vet roles?

Yet according to the other report, women are 18% more likely to be hired for **senior roles** despite applying to fewer. Not to mention it's just another typical attempt to blame men even though women are actually benefiting from this

And if you want more idea of the worthlessness of it, look at this section:

>In other words, LinkedIn‚Äôs research shows that women on average apply for fewer positions, and in particular for less senior positions. So it may be that women are just applying for positions that are safer bets for them which leads to higher success rates per application.

As for personal opinion: things are currently happening in the labor force and company cultures which are severely detrimental to men, and result in women being picked excessively. The obvious one is gender quota. Less obvious is the desired set of skills which has changed over the last few generations: we've become increasingly noisier, more white collar and more ""design by committee"" than before.

But literally since the creation of this account, you have used it *exclusively* to post about situations that vilify men. Literally almost every single one of your posts and comments are about how men are sexist or arguing against the idea that men aren't sexist.


To me, or anyone else for that matter, it's clear that this account was not made with the idea of equally representing both sex's. In fact, I would go as far as to guess that your username is a nod to the notion that it's obvious that more men are sexist or bad in some way than not.


If we were in front of an omnipotent being and rendered incapable of lieing, I would bet my soul that deep inside you, you absolutely believe that men as a whole are inferior to women. You will never admit that you think most men are shit out loud, you'll vehemently deny it in fact.. Your crusade against sexism would have a lot less wind in their sails being so blatantly sexist yourself.. But from the limited bits I've read from you, it's almost undeniable. 


Just the way you talk, I can't literally feel the disdain *radiating* off of your singularly sided words. **MEN ARE NOT BETTER THAN WOMEN** . I bet when you read that line (that absolutely true line) you get a feeling like, ""Damn right"", and as should you. Conversely I can't imagine that **WOMAN ARE NOT BETTER THAN MEN** , an equally correct statement, gives you the same feeling. 


Look, I'll never agree with any ist or ism, for or from either side. You're allowed to have your biased (right or wrong) but it's important that you're able to recognize that no one sex, race or anything is better or worse than the other on the whole. There are just as many fucking deplorable, disgusting women in this world as there are men. There are also just as many good on both sides. 


When you start believing that one group of people are inherently worse than another (be it sex, race, orientation, anything), *that* is when you've begun to cross the threshold of becoming what you claim to be arguing against.

Remember recognition is not done on a per employer basis but on a per site basis, so if you can get 50% of the staff on a single site to join up, the union can force recognition on that site.

That aside, even an unrecognised union can represent you in grievance (or disciplinary for that matter) so you can raise an equality grievance with full representation whether your employer likes it or not.

Not exactly a nuanced position. 

While I agree that feminists are often not comfortable with male behavior, this goes beyond that. Often there are masculine comfort zones and feminine comfort zones and the two are not always compatible. Sometimes the right solution is to find a compromise depending on the environment, something rather neutral. 

While radical feminists often want to feminize everyone's behavior, there are also people who want to masculinize everything as well. I am suspect of anyone who thinks that people should conform to one end or another, which is frankly what it sounds like your mother advocates. ",vaughg,t2_6fn30,7,0,reddit4

Counter-point. What your mother is describing is that men, and male behavior, has the privilege of being ""normal"". Yes, men act a certain way, but is that the only way people should act towards one and other? If you want to change the models of behavior or challenge them, they have the advantage simply by virtue of the fact that they're 'normal' and whatever you're suggesting isn't. 

Here's an analogy via race - I'm white, and whiteness has the privilege of being 'normal'. I'll never be called an ""American of European decent"", whereas others are labeled ""Asian American"", ""African American"", and so on. 

You mother speaks of women wanting power. I agree, they do. They want the power to create their own models of behavior and not have the model that's ""normal for men"" imposed upon them.

What we are seeing today, I believe, is a sharp line of demarcation between Equity Feminism, those who believe in equality and Gender Feminism, those that believe that women should dominate via unequal power, representation and unequal laws.

This does, however, attack radical feminism to a reasonably thorough extent, where the difference between mainstream and radical feminism tends to be that radical demands far stricter guidelines be followed when men interact with women socially or physically.
This isn't a game where two teams battle to see who wins, to see who will come through with the best platform and take control of gender issues.

For example, at a recent meeting; a team of us put ideas forward to the boss. One of my ideas was rejected as ridiculous, as was the idea of a female team member. 

Only difference was, she went away afterwards and blamed her 'sexist patriarchal boss' for not respecting her brilliant idea; I just got on with it. These victimists will often misinterpret normal workplace interaction i.e. the boss rejecting your idea, as sexism; when it's really something as benign as your boss having 40 years of experience and they know the idea isn't feasible.

However, where the feminists have a point is when it comes to *how* it's done--I don't think sex-based jokes are good for anyone. It just encourages gender roles. And phrasing depends. ""You sure you can handle that?"" is an innocuous question, even if it is implying they don't think you can do something alone. ""Why don't you leave that for the men to handle, sweetheart"" is not--it's implying that they don't think you can do something because you're a woman. The same applies to teasing. Sometimes, though not nearly as often as is claimed of course, it *is* specifically disrespectful when aimed at a woman. Just like how men often face gender-based discrimination when it comes to childcare, which is very unfair.

There's also a difference between equal teasing, and the sexual note that is often added in for women.

First off, you are right.  Part of the problem is that those particular women you describe are selfish and want special treatment, like you said.  But here is another problem I often see: many men don't treat other men very well.  They allow themselves to get caught up in the ""man up and don't be such a pussy"" gender expectations.  They *enforce* those expectations on each other over and over and over.  I have seen so much male on male verbal and physical abuse in the name of brotherhood, and sometimes I think it can be very damaging.  

You say that feminists looking for equal treatment don't have thick enough skins to handle what the men dish out.  But I say that *nobody* should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

I really don't see how sex based jokes do this.  You can make jokes about people either fitting into or not fitting into gender roles.  My friends and I sometimes play up being masculine jock roles as a joke, and sometimes play up the clueless nerd roles.  Neither of these activities influences our behaviour towards either extreme.  

> ""Why don't you leave that for the men to handle, sweetheart"" is not--it's implying that they don't think you can do something because you're a woman. 

Yes, it is.  But we don't need to prevent people from saying this.  If a woman replies to the above comment with another aggressively joking comment, like ""Actually, I better do it because knowing you guys you will probably get bored and wander off halfway through"" or something to that effect will do much more for gender equality and the woman being accepted than complaining about sexism ever will.

>There's also a difference between equal teasing, and the sexual note that is often added in for women.   Men don't treat each other as sex objects in typical relations, so when that component is added in for how they treat women, then the women do have a basis to complain about inequal treatment.

Yes, there are going to be some differences in behaviour because of sexual attraction, and that is to a certain extent unavoidable.  Straight men do often joke about being gay (not in a derogatory way), so I don't really see why any sexual comments should be off limits.  I also don't see that it makes that much of a difference what the subject of the teasing is.  

I think what is really going on when women complain about sexual teasing is the idea that women need to be protected from male sexuality is being expressed.  Men are more attracted to physical appearance, and may find you attractive even if you don't want to be in a relationship with them.  Deal with it.

I didn't say that women get better treatment,  I said that they get special treatment.  Personally, I highly value the ability to say what I want without worrying about other's feelings, and I value the truthfulness that I expect from other guys.  I also value the fact that my male friends will call me out if I am being dumb, or whining. 

Yes, sometimes men are jerks. But I prefer to have conflicts out in the open rather than behind others backs.  And yes, men should moderate their aggression, if someone is really in a bad way you should let up or give them good advice and help.  But the standard 'guy' way of treating people is not bad, and I prefer it to pussyfooting around others feelings.

>But I say that nobody should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

What you are offended by often has more to do with your own insecurities than what is actually said or the intent behind what is said.  I think that there is really no reason to get offended by what people say about you in many cases.  If you are comfortable with yourself things shouldn't bother you.  We as a society should be encouraging people to be comfortable with themselves instead of trying to control what everyone says.

>This is a problem with our entire society, I think. Men and women alike should stop buying into traditional gender roles and pushing them on themselves and each other.

I don't think it necessarily is.  I don't mind a certain amount of verbal aggressiveness among my friends, and I think many men feel the same way.  If it is true that most men feel this way, the attitude that men shouldn't say the things they say is anti-male.

> First off, you are right. Part of the problem is that those particular women you describe are selfish and want special treatment, like you said. But here is another problem I often see: many men don't treat other men very well. They allow themselves to get caught up in the ""man up and don't be such a pussy"" gender expectations. They enforce those expectations on each other over and over and over. I have seen so much male on male verbal and physical abuse in the name of brotherhood, and sometimes I think it can be very damaging. 

**So, to summarize**: 

...You're suggesting that we strip men of the masculine behaviour that makes them men, and to 'improve' them so that women get treated nicer? 

Gee, that sounds realistic.

> You say that feminists looking for equal treatment don't have thick enough skins to handle what the men dish out. But I say that nobody should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

Your entitled views are *exactly* the kind that OP's mother is voicing against. 

Since you're not in a role where you have to face hard, exacting situations and tough people on a daily basis, it's easy to form the impression that no one ""should"" or ""should not"" be expected to have thick skin, but sometimes it's necessary for what a person has to do in life. Especially for the kind of stuff that men, who traditionally are the ones who handle rougher lines of work, have to face. 

Salespeople, politicians, policemen, etc -- you think they can do their jobs if they were all soft and expecting other people to be nice to them? If you want to join a certain sort of league, you toughen up to make yourself an equal and competent member of said league, especially if you want to do your job right and be treated as as equal. 

Your gender *does not* hand you a right to be treated as an equal; it is your competency, and your abilities, that do. And you are especially not, and will never be, an 'equal' so long as you expect others to give you special treatment in handling a job, just because you're a woman, and especially when others doing said job aren't give any special treatment as well. 

> This is a problem with our entire society, I think. Men and women alike should stop buying into traditional gender roles and pushing them on themselves and each other.

Stop buying into traditional gender roles? How silly. The only reason why society works is because each gender has something to contribute towards society -- and feminists have been instrumental in trying to destroy this relationship since they first got vocal enough to do so -- which is why our society is messed up as it now is. 

Not buying into gender roles will *not* remedy issues of equality; it'll only make the situation worse. Men will always be men and women will always be women. ",rabaraba,t2_64ixo,0,0,reddit4

I do take the point others have made that the jobs in which one is likely to get actually *killed* are male-dominated.

With that out of the way, my point was that the scenario described in the topic is the very definition of equality, no-one is being treated differently because of their gender. It happens to be in this case, what we would traditionally label as a 'masculine' environment, but there seems to be no implication that anyone is forced in to behaving in a particular way. The problem that exists with some parts of 'feminist' ideology, is that it would disregard how people felt about being in that environment, and focus on the idea that it happens to be 'masculine', meaning somehow wrong or discriminatory. And to extend that further, the same parts of 'feminist' ideology seem to think it's ok to tell men and women that they are wrong to behave in a certain way. The simple distinction I guess that I always draw from this is that (broadly) everyone should behave the way they choose to behave (within the law), but the moment they tell someone else that they shouldn't behave in the way they choose to behave, there is a problem, and when it is done on a basis of ill thought out generalisations to a group of people, it's even worse. You seem to be questioning the right of a group of people to behave in the way they choose, because it happens to be labelled as 'male behaviour'.

Maybe it's just a cultural thing though, because as a European, I can't seem to relate at all to this view that is often put forward about how men and women behave towards each other, and rarely see in day to day life the sort of imposition that may be far more common in America (only perhaps in Politics does it seem to ring true at all).

Susan Brownmiller was a major influence in feminism.  Her ideas are still very much alive.  But I have yet to see any feminist link me to any conclusive evidence that rape is exclusively about control and power, and never about sex.  This is a major component of the ideology that rape is a gendered crime men commit against women.

However, in the [2010 NISVS](http://www.delicious.com/redirect?url=http%3A//www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), which feminists cite to show women are raped vastly more often than men, you can see that this only appears to be the case because they were not allowed to count women forcing men to penetrate them as ""rape.""

I have two problems with that.  First, ""feminist"" is an ideological label one chooses for oneself.  You choose to self-identify as a feminist, you are choosing to align yourself with a sexist, biased movement, and there is evidence to support that.

Just like it's unprofessional for a woman to use her sexuality to exploit coworkers or her boss in the workplace. To complain about any restrictions of your sexual expression is ridiculous. You are not entitled to treat every woman you find attractive like a sex object. Stop contributing to the stereotype that men are raging hornballs who just can't control themselves.

And the same goes for women. They don't get to get away with sexual harassment either. And it certainly happens, and is often treated less seriously because of the assumption that all men must like it. There are plenty of men here who have complained about it. Women are just as attracted to physical appearance as men are. We're just socially encouraged to be more meek about it, or pretend that we're not, which is why it's more rare from women, but certainly far from unheard of.

if you're male. Hence, my remark that men are privileged because they are the 'normal'. If you're male, or, if you're a straight male, or, if you're a straight, christian, white male, you don't have to change a single thing about your behavior or world view. The world was literally made for you, your only concern is how marketable your job-skill set is. Every other person has more to deal with and has to accommodate their idea of 'normal' to match up to white, male, heterosexual, christian views. 

""that the scenario described in the topic is the very definition of equality"" not physically forced, no. But if she wanted to paint the room pink, or watch Oprah (I know, these are throwaway cliches, but you get my point), she would be harassed for it. Indeed, the way she describes it, everybody gets harassed, and she's just resigned herself to it. I'm male (and white) and when other men harass me whenever I act ""non-male"" I *don't* resign myself to it, I tell them to fuck off and give them a lecture on the social construction of gender identities. 

"" parts of 'feminist' ideology seem to think it's ok to tell men and women that they are wrong to behave in a certain way."" - Aren't you doing the exact same thing when a gay man or a woman decides to act in ""non-normal"" ways? If not you, doesn't society at large? If you think not, I challenge you to dress like a woman for a day. One whole day. And go out in public. Subject yourself to that and see if it broadens your perspective at all. 

""The simple distinction I guess that I always draw from this is that (broadly) everyone should behave the way they choose to behave (within the law), but the moment they tell someone else that they shouldn't behave in the way they choose to behave, there is a problem, and when it is done on a basis of ill thought out generalisations to a group of people, it's even worse."" This is exactly what everyone who is not a white, male, heterosexual has to deal with everyday. Again, go out and act blatantly gay in public for a full day, or, if you can pull it off, dress like a woman. Also, I hasten to point out, isn't this exactly what you're doing with the labels you're putting on feminism? What books on feminism have you read? Seriously, read them.

More specifically, [a central tenet of feminism is that women, as a class, are disadvantaged relative to men, as a class](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/r5zjr/why_are_there_so_many_attacks_on_feminism_in/c43cmaw).  In most of the world this is clearly true, however in certain places and in certain situations it's clearly not always the case.  An example of this would be [men receiving harsher sentences than women for the same crimes](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/sentencing.pdf).  On its face, this would be an obvious way that men, as a class, are disadvantaged relative to women, as a class.  Despite this, many feminists will tell you that this isn't male-disadvantage...it's just ""benevolent misogyny"" (I can provide examples if you like), or some other justification which looks to re-frame male-disadvantage as female-disadvantage.  Denying reality to protect your ideology indicates belief in that ideology is not grounded in fact, but faith.

I have always been puzzled by exactly what people mean when they say ""rape is about power and not about sex.""  

How does its being about power exclude it from being about sex?

I can even see arguments where the fact that it is about sex actually implies that it is about power.  For example, a rapist might deliberately target attractive young women because they wield so much sexual power in society and by attacking them the rapist feels more powerful as a result.

Perhaps the point people are trying to make is that a typical rapist is not motivated by a lack of sexual satisfaction in their life as much as they are by a lack of power in their life.

I am not sure what practical application that observation has, though, if true.  So what?

I'll attempt to answer your questions clearly:

> Why are my views entitled? I am trying to help. I very consciously base my Men's Rights stance on the views and complaints of my male friends and family members who have been affected by gender bias in a very, very real way. 

And you may be genuinely trying to help, which I do not dispute, but if you re-read what you had wrote, this was how you came off: ""Here's how we solve the equality problem -- fix men, get them not to be so manly with each other, they don't need to be tougher; and why is everyone so big on gender differences?"" 

Quick problems in your argument:

- Men and women are physiologically and psychologically different. Gender roles exist for this very reason. 
- For example, going by the most traditional of roles -- men as protectors -- they can only do this if they're more used to sustaining 'abuse' (I hate that word, for the record, because it's over-used and applied to almost anything), whether physical or verbal, and have been roughened up enough to prepare better for their protecting roles. Women aren't necessarily the protectors -- therefore it's silly for them to argue about the way men treat each other, *because women will never share the same worldview that men share with and between other men* on account of the two main differences I've stated above. 

> Should I stop referring to myself as a feminist? Is that the problem? A label? I am an extremely active advocate for both Men's and Women's rights. But every time I tell somebody on this forum that I am a woman and a feminist, somebody always jumps down my throat, moreso than in any other sub. This happens even when I am expressing a view that is extremely contrary to the ""feminist"" views that many people in r/mensrights oppose. 

Yes, your self-identification may be a problem. Obviously, feminists are not regarded happily within men's rights circles, because they are everything that the men's rights circle is against. A rough analogy: It's about the same as being a dog and jumping into a group of cats and preaching to them that you're supporting cat's rights. No matter how true or strong your support for them is, you're still a dog, and the cats are therefore still bound to eye you with wariness.

> The strange thing is, absolutely none of my friends in real life ever react this way when we discuss such things, even the one's who are deeply entrenched in men's rights issues. So what's the deal?

Why must you pose such an obvious question? 

The lack of anonymity in real life prevents honesty such as that which you see online. 

And arguments in real life erode the social grease that keeps you all together -- thus, most people would rather sustain the discomfort of temporary disagreement, than to argue heavily and face the risk of permanent and *identifiable* mutual resentment for one another. 

> It's very difficult to be an ally sometimes when it feels like ""my kind"" is not welcome. 

Your kind is welcome. Do not mistake this. 

> The other reply to my post told me that it was arrogant for a woman to try to help fix things. 

Because that's what women like to do. They like to fix things, and suggest improvements, because they think that their way is the 'right' way to do things, when often, it isn't, and what's worse is that they're completely oblivious to the many fundamental aspects that are necessary to consider when doing suggestions. Especially when it comes to things like gender roles. Most women assume that their understanding of gender roles is better than men -- which is flawed in itself, because you should never approach a contentious issue with the idea that you understand it, and that only you have the ultimate say on how it should be treated... which is how feminists typically approach gender issues. 

> Why do so many guys here react this way? Honest question. 

I've answered this above.

> And how can I avoid this in the future? 

1. **Do not assert that men's behaviour are to be fixed or changed.** You too would be offended if I said that women are fundamentally flawed for being catty, manipulative creatures who oftentimes backstab each other -- which is true, as much as men abusing each other is -- but I do not suggest that women should be fixed for it, do I? 

2. **Do not suggest that gender roles are unimportant.** Understand that gender roles are there for a reason. Gender roles provide consistency and stability to society. Gender roles give identity to growing children, and to families and parents. Gender roles give status to people, both men and women, and are a necessary aspect of our human social hierarchy. Deconstructing gender roles, or asserting that less heed should be paid to it, destroys all this. And I don't mean to offend you, but I'll be honest: Ignoring the importance of gender roles only shows how ignorant and myopic you are. 

> No, this isn't about improving men. This is about men allowing other men to be themselves, whatever that may be, even if it means being less masculine. It's about not having such specific expectations that we would punish each other for falling out of line. It's about human kindness and mutual respect regardless of gender. Perhaps you see that as an unrealistic goal, but I will continue to fight for it.

The above was not how you asserted it. If a man is less masculine, it is fine. There are all degrees of soft men out there, and it is not an issue. What is an issue is when a man professes to be feminine or takes up a more-feminine-than-masculine aspect despite being a man; *that* is societally and biologically wrong, and that is why they are being punished for it. Women do that stuff all the time as well -- they just do it differently. You've seen women punish other women, in full view of the public, for being 'sluts', haven't you? It's the equivalent chastising treatment among women for their kind stepping out of the line and assuming a 'predatory' sexual behaviour typically associated with men; and there is no kindness or respect to these women's behaviour, is there? It's just how the world works. 

Now, your trans friends may disagree, but ask these questions to yourself: even if they don't identify themselves as being of any gender, are they still not leaning towards dressing as being of one particular gender? There is no neuter gender to speak of, so are they not at least sexually attracted towards a person bearing one or the other gender roles? 

Now, considering all that, *are they not still buying into a gender role, despite crying out loud against the fundamental importance of gender roles*?

I could equally say that it's equality in a (stereotypically) female environment, where female behavioural norms apply, if the women treated both men and women the same way.

I think it's a mistake to try and equate gender in this scenario with religion, and especially with sexuality... the former I concede may be again because of cultural differences (though I do live in a very catholic country, I have never been discriminated against because of my atheism), but the latter, where those who consider themselves gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender or any other variation, are a small minority of the population, and it has always been the case. The split between men and women is always, give or take a percentage point, pretty much even, so where arguing that cultural norms cause difficulties for those who make up around 3% of the population (at an estimate), arguing that for 50% of the population takes a much larger stretch.

I would also argue that being the target of banter, whether or not actions fit the cultural norm, isn't discriminatory at all. As I read it (and i'm making as many assumptions as you here), if she did those things, she would be targeted with banter, but she would also if she didn't, and whether or not she did those things wouldn't effect how she would behave otherwise in that environment either.


I'll state very clearly that I know i've got a very different perspective on life to many, but having grown up with an ignorant bigot of a father, I learnt very quickly from him how not to behave. I don't judge people based on their gender, sexuality, or anything else, though I do admit to also having a pretty sharp sense of humour about mocking these stereotypes, and am pretty intolerant of the intolerant (if you'll pardon how hypocritical that is). My point wasn't supposed to be that feminism alone does this, it's that feminism can be as bad as anything else in society, and can be as narrow minded and bigoted as any other group based on gender, age, culture, religion, taste in ice-cream or any other catergory you could think of. That's why I don't like the language of 'priviledge' and 'victim' because the truth is that almost everyone in society is treated crappily by other groups in society.

In reply to your next point, I would argue that men are the subject of as many prejudices as women, as far as cultural expectations of behaviour go. You even mention this yourself, when you talk about people harassing you for 'non-male' behaviour, so i'm a little confused by the response you are making. As I said earlier, the reason I talk about the problem with some parts of feminist ideology, is because i'm intolerent of intolerence, and not a fan of hypocracy in general. I would go in to more details, but I've got to rush off soon, but I do want to make it clear that i'm not criticising all feminism, but only parts of it.

Have you ever done any actual comp-sci classes? Like, say, programming? Where we do arcane computer-science wizardry like algorithm optimizations, graphic rendering, etc (and I'm simplifying this because I'm assuming that you don't know what these are)? Now *those* are true tests of logic and critical thinking and problem-solving. Philosophy, on the other hand, is pretentious logic-wanking, and useless circular thinking at best.

I don't believe that men need to be fixed or that they are ""fundamentally flawed"".  I will choose my words more carefully in the future so as not to misrepresent my actual feelings on this matter.

>Do not suggest that gender roles are unimportant.

Okay.  I won't.  I would appreciate your input on something though.  How do I reconcile the assertion that we should not be blurring the gender role lines at all when considering the following examples from my real life:

* My brother in law is a ""house husband"".  He has been happily unemployed for a decade now and takes care of their child and house while my sister works.  This is contrary to current gender roles and blurs the line.

* My best friend is on the road to becoming a male nurse.  He is facing a lot of unfair discrimination along the way because he is a man and society expects nurses to be women.

* Two of my male friends are rape victims.  Neither of them were taken seriously when they came forward because getting raped ""isn't something that happens to men"" according to current gender expectations.  They face harsh ridicule and shame for this.

* My cousin lost the custody battle over his son, even though he was far better equipped financially and mentally to care for the child.  It was clear to him, and our family, that this happened because of current expectations/assumptions relating to mothers being the nurturers and therefore better suited to care for a child.

* My next-door neighbour committed suicide because he had ""failed as a father and a man"".  The burden of expectation weighed so heavily on him that when he couldn't live up to it, he gave up.

I have heard these men directly and repeatedly say that current expectations result in them feeling ostracized and discriminated against.  This breaks my heart, especially since I know they are just a small sample of the many men who go through these same problems.

Maybe you are right.  Maybe it's ""myopic"" of me to allow those close to me to inform my opinions about very broad issues.  But can you suggest how I might reconcile their Men's Rights point of view with the Men's Rights point of view that current gender roles should not be tampered with or changed?  I am not meaning to challenge you here.  I am honestly struggling with this. 

And sorry if all that was TMI about my personal stuff.  I just thought that if you understood better where I was coming from, you might be able to give useful advice on the matter, given your stance.

I agree with you that sometimes evolutionary psychology is used to explain differences which have not been demonstrated to exist.   I think what ends up happening is that since it is not politically correct to do research into gender differences, because gender differences are hard to prove, and because people often cry ""socialization"" people turn to evolutionary psychology to attempt to give reasons why we would expect gender differences to exist.  

What people are often doing when the use evolutionary psychology is making an argument something like this

-we know we evolved

-given this assumption about the state during the time in which we were evolving, this is the role of both sexes

-the sexes would have adapted to this role

-therefore we would expect to see difference X which would help this gender fulfil their role. 

Since we then have a reason to expect gender difference X we can attribute the existence of gender difference X to biology if it exists, and we can also put the onus to a certain extent on others to show that gender difference X does not exist.  

This type of argument can be flawed, but it is in principal correct. Of course, the assumptions about roles in the past can be challenged, and gender differences can be shown not to exist.  

Evolutionary psychology is far superior to what appears to be the alternative, attributing any sex differences to socialization.  We have reason to expect sex differences in behaviour, and their are many phenomena that are not easily explained by attributing sex differences in behaviour to socialization.  It may be that often evolutionary psychology is used incorrectly, but it is fundamentally much more sound than alternative.",themountaingoat,t2_6dtja,0,0,reddit4

Here is a quick one that outlines the methods that feminism has been using to cover up the truth about domestic abuse, this has been going on since the 1970s and is probably largest reason that men's, fathers and abuse victims rights are mobilised against feminism as the ""violence against women"" fraud has been used to create fear and mistrust, discriminate in victims services and slant areas of the legal system against men and fathers. Its also feminism's cash cow.

If you want to work for a logistics company in a logistics capacity, you'll probably need a supply-chain degree.

> Some believe it is a mistake to fetishize job preparation and the ‚Äúrigor‚Äù of fields like accounting and finance.

really my only reply to that is ""wut"".  that's like saying that scientists shouldn't study science.  i don't disagree that an average ""business"" degree can be quite meaningless but studying any discipline that involves technical knowledge and professional licensing (such as accounting or engineering) is much more valuable than general higher education.

Thinking can be important, but some thinking is arguably more useful or practical than others.  Thinking, for instance, that all men are created equal is more useful than thinking about whether or not there may be some abstract ideal of any given thing of which the things we see and deal with are merely pale copies.  Fiction and art have other uses, such as entertainment, education, and showing us other perspectives.  The ""diversity courses"" at my college claimed in the course listings to show other perspectives, but they didn't-- they dictated them.  I found the parts about the experiences of Asian Americans (I took an Asian studies course) were interesting, the parts about how we need to be ""sensitive"" to the ""special needs"" of people of different cultures but at the same time treat them like everybody else, less so.

As far as social sciences influencing public policy goes; there is a limit to how data can actually be applied that is lost in translation from study to law. A study that finds men rape more often than women on a national level cannot be applied to the nation. The samples are different. You'd go from men to nations and the translation just isn't there. The same can be said for many studies done on events or subgroups. They can't be generalized outwards without at least seeing if the data can be applied.

We are not measuring food by the quantity of labour or skill required to obtain it, not by raw amounts obviously.

>And no science works backwards. 

Yes, it often does.  Very often scientists assume something and then look at what would need to be true for that to be the case.  Look at the history of special relativity.  Many people assumed that there was an either, and formed elaborate hypotheses to explain what would need to be true for the ether to exist given experimental data.  Einstein did the other thing, he assumed some broad principal and then explored the consequences of it, in some cases before those consequences were even tested.  Science works both ways. 

One of the main features of science is falsifiability.  Evolutionary psychology is the same as evolution in that it is somewhat hard to think of something that would falsify it because it is almost a logical necessity.  In some sense evolution and the paradigm of evolutionary psychology don't are just necessary logical truths.  However, individual uses of evolutionary psychology can be disproved, and they are scientific.
>First you have to prove women are more manipulative. Then you have to prove it's biologically based and not due to cultural interference. Then you have to prove it happened in history.

Why the assumption of cultural interference be the default?  We have a reason to expect biological differences in behaviour.  Because of this differences in behaviour should be assumed to be biological be default, or at least should be an equivalent hypothesis to social conditioning.


>It's the exact same stuff people used to try to prove that white people were more evolved, and that black people were just meant to be slaves.

Yes. Most feminist advocacy papers rely on the following flawed methodology.

1) They do not ask women about their own violence. 

2) They survey non-representative populations such as women in a battered women's shelter.

3) They do not include men.

4) They expect men to either label being abused/raped as a crime or as abuse/rape. Due to men's socialization, men resist anything that makes them sound like a victim. Asking for specific _acts_ is the only way to capture the abuse victimization of men.

5) When they do include men and do ask for specific acts, they do not consistently use male interviewers for male interviewees. Men are less likely to disclose abuse to a female interviewer.

6) They do not _ever_ mention the studies that indicate most intimate partner and sexual abuse is massively under disclosed by men. For example one study found that men with verified case histories of child sexual abuse disclosed that abuse on a neutral survey instrument at _one fourth the rate of women._ 

7) They often omit the vagina as a instrument of rape in their studies on sexual violence, creating vastly lopsided rates of rape. (You can do exactly the same thing in reverse by deciding that a man penetrating a woman is not rape, but a woman enveloping a man is.)

Ironically despite these limitations general population surveys are getting closer and closer to parity. Rates of men being victimized already exceed in some places women's victimization within the last 12 months. I think a properly designed survey instrument would probably find out that significantly more men are raped and abused in a year then women.

c43rmlc,t1_c43rdmd,2012-03-22 16:33:24,MensRights,">Why the assumption of cultural interference be the default?

Because culture impacts everything from food and appetites to what we find sexually attractive. Because culture has constantly changed its assertions about behaviour. Like with women's sexuality--culture has varyingly said it is nonexistant, weaker than men's, and stronger than men's. Or girls liking pink--pink used to be a masculine color for boys. Or women being more nurturing for nursing--nursing used to be a strictly male profession, just like a lot of ""traditionally"" female careers. People used to think women had no need to be literate, but now science is showing that women's brains are better suited for language-based work than men's are (which of course doesn't mean men are bad at it, just like women aren't bad at math or science just because male brains might be better suited for it). Whether we say we're attracted to thin women or fat ones is far more culturally taught than biologically. So if you assert something is biologically based, you first have to prove it's an actual biological fact, not a culturally taught one.

Basically, you have to prove your assertion is true, before you bother trying to theorize as to why it would happen. Otherwise you end up with the same conclusions that any mythology has--you're just making up excuses for false beliefs.

Hell, I'll admit one of my own faults. I believed for most of my life that glass was a liquid, just a slow-moving one. My mother told me so. My school told me so. I *learned* it, it was a fact. And the proof was obvious--look at old windows, and how they ripple and are thicker at the bottom. Because the glass is slowly melting. 

Glass is a liquid. It melts. That's a fact. And yet I was able to stand there and look at Ancient Egyptian glass bottles, without ever wondering ""Hmm, why aren't they a puddle of glass??"". Because my brain just *knew* that glass was a liquid, and didn't bother to think about contrary evidence. (Because obviously, glass is **not** actually a liquid, it was never a fact, my brain was just taught that it was and accepted it.)  That's how strong confirmation bias is.

Let me get this straight.  We have extremely strong reasons to believe that the sexes should have gender differences in behaviour that are due to biology.  However we should assume that all gender differences are not due to biology because some factors can be influenced by culture.  There are also the cases of people who were raised a different gender than they were born which highly suggest a high degree of biological determination of gender.

>People used to think women had no need to be literate, but now science is showing that women's brains are better suited for language-based work than men's are (which of course doesn't mean men are bad at it, just like women aren't bad at math or science just because male brains might be better suited for it). 

No-one is arguing that not being taught reading or being taught reading is not social.

>Whether we say we're attracted to thin women or fat ones is far more culturally taught than biologically. 

Citation?  Yes, what is seen as ideal in paintings ect varies with culture, but sexual tastes are not always in line with the cultural ideal's of beauty.  For example men find women most are attractive at a weight much greater than the typical supermodel weight.

I agree with you that confirmation bias is an important thing, but it works both ways.   It is an article of faith among many people that all differences between the sexes are due to conditioning, and there is no reason to admit this.  Accusing others of confirmation bias however does nothing to solve anything.  What you need to do is to critique their reasoning.  For example, if you disagree that women are more manipulative do a study on it.  If you agree that women are more manipulative but think it is due to conditioning, then attack assumptions about the state of nature, or do studies that attempt to show it being due to conditioning.  

>If you think that women being more manipulative is an obvious fact, you still need to prove that it is. Because you could just be ignoring all the evidence against that, from confirmation bias.

Likewise if you think otherwise.  What the obvious facts are is not established here.  However, there is much more reason to believe that sex differences are due to biology than there is to believe in the social conditioning hypothesis.",themountaingoat,t2_6dtja,1,0,reddit4

We do not have extremely strong reasons. Some things have some reasons. But we do not have very much sexual dimorphism in our species, so ""extremely strong"" is an incredible overstatement. Most sex differences that do exist can be easily explained by how hormones affect our bodies and brains, with no psychology necessary. They are sometimes just side effects of the way other things that are necessary and selected for in our biology works. Like men being more likely to be colour-blind; it's not because women needed to be able to see berry colours because they were gatherers (which is the kind of argument evopsych would make), it's just because it's a defect that happens to be carried on the sex chromosomes.

>However we should assume that all gender differences are not due to biology because some factors can be influenced by culture. There are also the cases of people who were raised a different gender than they were born which highly suggest a high degree of biological determination of gender.

There are some differences. But the transgender issue has a lot more to do with the internal map of your body than with any behaviours. There are tomboy MtF transwomen as well as femme transwomen, and so on.

You are joking right?  Men and women have large physical differences so we should expect equivalently strong behavioural differences.

You really don't understand how evolution works.  Evolution is what determines what hormones exist in our bodies and what they do.  Hormones are one of the mechanism's of evolution, they are not separate at all.

I am not refering to transgender people, I am referring to cases like [this](http://www.singlesexschools.org/reimer.html)

And I could say that the cultural conditioning hypothesis is bunk because they don't prove that differences don't exist first.  You don't need to have an absolutely certain empirical evidence in order to try to look at what might cause that effect.  In fact, some physicists explore the implications of things that we have no direct evidence for, for example magnetic monopoles.  In fact, evolutionary theory is so obviously true the fact that sex differences are highly suggested by evolutionary theory is strong evidence for them on it's own.

>Maybe some imaginary version of evo psych might be better, but what exists now is, by and large, utter bollocks.

Did you actually follow the thread? 

Apparently the military can do anything but make women a soldier.  I'm saying this to flush out the crypto-chivalrous sentiments that women can't be soldiers. Even if they 'can't' be soldiers, they can still bear the physical risks of being one via a registry. Remember, a woman only would die if a man does. (And you're saying one is more horrendous then the other. Isn't that hateful?)

But since you seem to need a recap.

The standing point is this: democracy is undermined when you have a majority of the electorate who can vote for wars that they are exempted from fighting in. That creates a moral hazard in which the costs of choosing warfare are not born by those choosing it.

How would you resolve it? Particularly in the face of all the crypto-chivalrists who are hiding their 'I don't like seeing women in body bags, dead men are just fine' sentiments behind 'women can't be soldiers herp derp.'",typhonblue,t2_6e7t3,1,0,reddit4

You obviously don't know much about sexual dimorphism. We differ a little more than some species, but are almost nothing compared to species even like gorillas or orangutans, much less anglerfish or birds or the male cichlids that are 60 times the size of the females.

>You really don't understand how evolution works. Evolution is what determines what hormones exist in our bodies and what they do. Hormones are one of the mechanism's of evolution, they are not separate at all.

Sigh. My point with that is that the hormones evolved for other reasons and then as a side effect cause certain behaviours, rather than the behaviours evolving as the main reason. Just like how domesticating foxes causes their coat colours to change and their tails to curl like how many dogs do.

>And I could say that the cultural conditioning hypothesis is bunk because they don't prove that differences don't exist first.

There are some cases where you would be correct. But they often do. ""Women evolved to have sex with one high-status male while men evolved to sleep around."" Biology directly contradicts that, with the physiology of the penis. As well as plenty of historical and cultural accounts that also contradict it.

>In fact, evolutionary theory is so obviously true the fact that sex differences are highly suggested by evolutionary theory is strong evidence for them on it's own.

But that doesn't mean you get to just make them up! ""Women are more manipulative than men"" needs to be proven to exist at all, before you start trying to prove why it exists.

Nice unproven assertion.  Very convincing.  Given enough time the brain should be able to change how it responds to certain chemicals even if initially a chemical has a side effect.

>Biology directly contradicts that, with the physiology of the penis. 

Can you explain what you mean?

Again, examples?


>But that doesn't mean you get to just make them up! ""Women are more manipulative than men"" needs to be proven to exist at all, before you start trying to prove why it exists.

Scientists predict empirical phenomena from theories all the time.  This case is another example of that.  We predict from a well established theory because it is difficult to empirically test sex differences.

>Because we're talking in generals. I'll sit and tear apart individual examples as much as you want. But you also have to show any evidence of it being true, too. You've shown none. Just because you think something should exist doesn't mean it does. 

You haven't done a very good job tearing apart the manipulative example.  In the case of the manipulative example the evidence of it being true is evolution.  You have no evidence to suggest otherwise.


>You also are conveniently ignoring my colour blindness example of why you need evidence before you make an assertion.

I don't really get what you mean with that example.  Sure, one thing was not explained by evolutionary psychology, that is hardly reason to think that nothing is.  And that example gives no reasons to prefer social conditioning as a reason compared to evolution.  Yes, if you can demonstrate that something is due to chromosomal abnormalities then that supersedes other evidence.

I ended up getting arrested within a few months and sid a little time in a central Florida jail. A girl had a seizure one night, and fell onto concrete from an 8 foot bunk. For hours they refused to open the door and come get her for medical attention.  When they finally did, she never came back. She wasn't in the infirmary, she was just gone. Another girl gave birth in the pod, once again because no one would open the doors and help. Jails in Florida are awful. Most of the inmates don't have the means, or even anyone who cares about them, so they know they can get away with it. When someone fr otl m a wealthy, caring family is in the pod, they are always treated differently once their family becomes a thorn in the jails side by calling and fighting for their family member to be treated like a human being. 

One girl had been raped repeatedly at a local prison, by guards. She got pregnant, but hid the fact because she knew she could be badly hurt or outright killed if they knew. She got out and had twin girls. She tried to go against the system, but her house kept getting raided, she had to start sneaking out of the neighborhood hood just to catch a ride to work, because if she just left she would be pulled over and often searched. Out of nowhere her license became suspended, she didn't know why when I knew her, but she got pulled over and thrown in jail. 3 times in five years of basically anything means your a ""habitual offender"" and as such can be charged with a felony.  When she got out of prison years before, she had trouble getting her life together, and if you miss an insurance payment in Florida your license ends up revoked and it used to be 250 these first reinstatement, 500 the second, and 750 the third. In those times, she had been pulled over withour a license the DAY her suspension became active. So she started being careful.

 She was doing very well for awhile. Until she requested paternity tests against those prison guards so she could begin getting justice.  She was so afraid. She knew they were going to send her to that prison. Even if she survived, she was silenced. She regretted ever trying together those rapists removed from a place where they raped inmates freely. She just wanted to go home. Her story seemed like too much to me at the time, but she had documentation. ""Lehal papers"" were allowed, and she had slid in some of her papers regarding the whole affair into large packets shipped in my her mother. Unless a guard went through and actually read all the papers, they wouldn't have known they were there.  She cried every night. She was afraid and missed her daughters, she was afraid for them as well, because now the potential fathers knew of their existence. She left for court one day and never came back. I don't know what happened to her. :(
 

A pseudo uncle I had growing up died in jail. They said he fell. When his family got the body his neck was broken and he had LOTS of other injuries, even broken bones, with signs of healing. The didn't have the money, or the means to go up against the system, and no lawyer would touch them as soon as they told them their story.  

In Florida there is a common saying ""Come for vacation, leave on probation, come back on a violation.""  Some of the things I've personally witnessed law enforcement do, even in my own neighborhood, was making me lose faith in humanity. I felt hopeless, like everyone else on that pit of despair that central Florida has become.  I left. Moved away.

Florida's open records laws regarding arrests are some of the most open in the country. That's why there are so many ""Florida Man"" stories.  Crazy arrests happen elsewhere, but with how the reports are written, and how freely available thay are as soon as they're put in the system... it's just funny how, when they arrest someone, the details of that arrest are made public, where anyone can read every detail of someone's worst day, but every time an inmate dies and it actually reaches the media, the records kept on what happened and how often these things happen are all the sudden ""confidential.""

There is *so* much wrong here on so many levels.

1) Not every prisoner is someone who has had a victim.  So from the outset you are building a position based on a false pretense.

2) For people who did victimize someone, the lengths that the other person was victimized has high variance.  Someone who maybe vandalized something is not the same as someone who got arrested for fighting, and that in turn is different from murder.

3) ""What about the victim"" does not actually work in practice.  The very idea of justice only can ever work in ""eye for an eye"" context.  There have been a myriad of studies of this done on relatives of murder victims that show that the death penalty does not actually help with the grieving a loss process.  Your reasoning is innately broken here.

4) Not every prisoner is guilty.  Our ability to determine guilt is always going to be flawed to some capacity.  Your position would make innocent people fare far worse than they already do for improper imprisonment.

5) ""Make it a living hell so they never want to go back"" is, in fact, something we learned doesn't work.  That's why we have made changes that prohibit things like chain gangs.

6) Without a proper rehab program to get people in prison proper life training, skills, and ability to function in society, all you get is a bunch of people who live a harsh life in prison, and that's all they know.  Inducing heavy trauma on people already broken *does not* make people suddenly be functional in society.  This would just increase repeat offenders rather than actually keep crime down.

7)  The war on drugs was built entirely on this stupid premise.  That is a giant disaster that failed on every conceivable level, cost people their lives, helped nobody, cost incalculable amounts of money, and we are *still* reeling from it, and attitudes *just like yours* keep perpetuating it.

Please learn to actually think about the consequences of your opinions instead of just going with what feels good, because shit like this is why we'll never have proper prison reform to help people.  Also maybe learning a thing or two about facts would help you.",Rob__T,t2_bdudg,9,0,reddit1

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/06/26/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent/

Was a big push of Hillary Clinton during her candidacy. The platform website isn't there anymore, but there are articles.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/27/opinions/hillary-clinton-women-and-mass-incarceration-crisis/index.html

The article makes many excuses for women comitting crime. No empathy for men with identical backgrounds. Studies show the majority of men convicted of raping women were raped by women as boys. If this is justice, (which I'm not sure it is) why should men not also get a pass for adverse childhoods?

Things are headed this way in Australia with the same narrative. All women criminals have reasons. Men are just naturally criminals. Women don't deserve to be punished like men. I suspect in Australia laws will pass within the decade like they were in the UK.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/17/a-mass-imprisonment-crisis-why-more-women-are-doing-time

Now they are saying we shouldn't even put women on trial for selling drugs in the UK.  Not people based on a certain scenario, women.
