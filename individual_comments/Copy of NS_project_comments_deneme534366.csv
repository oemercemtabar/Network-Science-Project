> Second, **this study cannot account for causal relationships between gratitude reception, satisfaction with
care, and physical health.** While other studies have
examined the temporal precedence between trait gratitude and psychology well-being (e.g. Wood, Maltby,
Gillett, Linley, & Joseph, 2008) as well as subjective wellbeing and health (Feist, Bodner, Jacobs, Miles, & Tan,
1995), we based our hypotheses on theory and empirical evidence suggesting the current directional model
within the context of nursing.

The reason seems to be because the only thing they actually did was send out surveys. I'm not too familiar with psych jargon, but it looks like they consider how individual participants results vary over the time of the survey, but it's hard for me to point what actually speaks to that.

They also describe how more in depth their survey *could* be, which would give better results (and they didn't do this, because of the risk ""participant fatigue"", especially since the surveys were administered over 3 months).

So other obvious questions: When a nurse writes in they they were thanked during a shift, what does that mean to individuals? Does the genuine nature of the thanks matter? Often when I ""thank"" service-people, it feels forced on my behalf and unnatural. I think people are smart enough to pick on the difference between ""yeah thanks"" being said in a situation where it is mandated or expected vs a genuine ""thank you!"" from someone who really feels like you excelled or went beyond for.

For example, is it fair that someone from a wealthy family has more opportunities than someone from a poor family? Your instinct is probably to say ""no that isn't fair"". But equally, if someone has worked hard to provide for their family and give their children as much opporuntiy as possible, is it fair to take that away because someone elses family didn't or couldn't?  


Basically, it's way more nuanced than it seems to make things as fair as possible because everyone will have a different idea of what is fair and how to make it more fair.

h8z36fz,t1_h8xw6dv,2021-08-15 00:27:46,science,"Yeah, I'm a little confused about people's responses here. Everyone is absolutely correct that a statement like this, delivered randomly and robotically, would be off-putting. However, do people not chat with their coworkers? Do people not have the ability to casually interact with each other in a natural manner? 

I'm a woman working in tech, and in my experience this post is absolutely correct. I know I can trust and respect a dude when they make a joke that indicates they are feminist, or make a comment that implies gender equality is important to them, or that toxic masculinity is funny to them.  

One example was a guy who made a joke about an old creepy guy who used to work there who made gross comments to young women (the joke was derogatory towards the creepy guy, not minimizing his behavior.) I immediately felt more comfortable with him. Later on I had an issue with a different guy saying to me ""hopefully you will get naked"" at an upcoming company retreat that involved a beach, totally unprompted, I had just asked if he planned on going. He was on the same team as the guy who ""revealed"" himself to be an ally, so I asked the ally guy to have a talk with harassment guy. He did, and I never had a single issue with harassment guy again, even though we worked together for years after that. Didn't involve HR or anything. Male allies are useful.

Edit: Definitely don't force this in to conversations if it doesn't feel natural. But if you're a dude and you notice someone being sexist in a meeting, maybe make a comment about it later, ask a female coworker something like ""was that weird/creepy/inappropriate or is it just me?"" If a woman reveals to you that someone has been condescending or creepy to them, lend an ear, make yourself known as someone who gets it, or at the least, is willing to listen.",aalitheaa,t2_jw3ya,10,0,reddit4

Say you want to watch a baseball game but a fence is in your way (let's ignore the whole ticket/admission aspect, we're just focusing on how to watch the game by solving the fence problem). **Equality** would be handing everyone the same size step stool. However, not everyone is the same height. While the given step stool may be enough for some, it might only be just enough for others, and in the worst case not enough at all.

Now, using the metaphor to compare to any slice of inequality in the world (such as employment opportunities), there is of course always going to be some level of disparity in opportunities, ones that are completely fair and valid. There are, however, certain inequalities that arise systemically which is what the height gap in this Fence Metaphor represents.

So, if we're looking to address the baked-in inequalities (the height differences)...well turns out we need to give everyone different sized step stools. This is equity and the part that looks like wanting special treatment or to be ""treated uniquely."" If you're looking purely at the tool/accommodation being requested, yes, different treatment is being requested. However, that's only looking one layer deep at the problem; the real problem being solved is how to get everyone able to watch the game. 

The Equality that is desired is equal viewing height. To counteract existing inequalities (height difference), a ""counter-inequality"" in the size of the step stool is necessary to create that equal outcome. Equity.",EffortlessFury,t2_64d9n,-1,0,reddit4

When I met this girl, she was talking about feminism with a random group of people (it was a MUN conference, so that was pretty common). I agreed with some things and disagreed with some, but made sure to listen to all of her arguments and didn't try to argue that they were wrong nor that she was wrong. If my female friends' feminism hadn't been able to change my mind, then of course I wouldn't be able to change hers. 

When the group eventually dissipated and we ended up alone, I told her I thought that maybe I was somewhat sexist because I didn't agree with most of the mainstream ideas of feminism.

However, she told me that I was acting the way she imagined a man should act. Listening to what she had to say, arguing respectfully and simply treating her as an equal. That day I noticed how simple gender equality (and all equality, honestly) really is, and completely changed my concept of what being ""inclusive"" meant. 

You don't need to read a shitton of books, nor attend protests, nor share feminist content in social media if you don't want to. All you need to do is to be a decent human being. Respect everyone's dignity and accept them for what they are.

This may be uncomfortable for some people to hear or understand but wherever there is a winner there has to be a loser. You or I or whoever have nice things because other people somewhere don't.  


And by that I don't mean that someone *needs* to be exploited for my gain (though that is often the case somewhere along the line) and it doesn't mean they are necessarily unhappy either, but more that wherever there is a luxury or a limited resource, relative economic strength is what separates the haves from the have nots in most cases.   


This is true for material possessions like your car, the latest smart phone, designer clothes, or even things less tangible like education and social technology, or even something as simple as having more family time.

That's not to say that I think people should suffer due to poverty, sexism, racism but returning to my original point, if you disconnect something like familial wealth/advancement from a child, then while it may give a more equal footing for each child in general who gets to say that it is or when it is fair?

h8yw4iv,t1_h8yq9ux,2021-08-14 23:28:04,science,"The reason why saying ""I don't see XYZ"" is bad is because it ignores the existing and past issues that effect people.

Let's like the Blizzard lawsuit for example. 

One of the big reasons why the Blizzard situation came about was due to gender disparities and a sexist work culture that was further perpetuated by all male leadership. Literal cube crawls where male Co workers would go cubicle to cubicle harassing female employees. As well as denying female employees from raises or promotions based on gender. 

If post lawsuit the new administration came in and fired all the bad actors that previously worked there but did nothing else to improve the company culture other than stating that hiring will now be ""genderless"" that would be an example of ignoring previous and present issues, ie. ""I don't see gender"". 

Men are still far more likely to look for employment at gaming companies like Blizzard, and the gender disparity was one of the root problems. Even if they removed the names from resumes during the hiring process this problem would persist. 

However, if Blizzard made an effort to recruit more women and create a more balanced workforce, that would go a long way to mend company culture. There are plenty of women who have similar qualifications as men, and they will certainly do better than their drunk male co-workers. (Men at Blizzard have a history of showing up to work drunk, probably explains all their new games.)

They could also hire women into positions of power due to their history of not promoting women based on gender, as well as appoint HR that will actually take complaints seriously. 

Basically, there are many situations in life where you have to take people's inherit traits into account. Simply saying ""I don't see XYZ"" doesn't fix the problem, it pretends the problem no longer exists.

However, most people who say ""I don't see XYZ"" are genuinely trying. They may be perpetuating an issue, but they're making an effort to prevent further harm. They're just going about it the wrong way.",ZestycloseFruit9315,t2_dlcwuuf4,11,0,reddit4

h8z4zm3,t1_h8yqcua,2021-08-15 00:43:13,science,"The best simple analogy for equity/equality I've heard is this:

A city government wants to encourage people to be healthier and clean up the environment, so they ban cars from the city streets, but provide every citizen with a bicycle to encourage exercise and reduce pollution.

In an ""equal"" city, they will take the average height and build of every citizen and build the perfectly average bike. Everyone gets that bike. For people who are close to average and able-bodies, they get a bike they can ride. For people who are shorter or taller than average, they can make simple modifications to ride their bike, but for a lot of people, that bike just doesn't help them. The person with an amputated leg can't use a standard bike, for example, and children get an adult's bike that doesn't fit them. And for others, there is a bigger burden to using the bike. Maybe they never learned and they need to spend the time and effort to learn how to ride. Or maybe they have a back problem and they can't bike for very long, or doing so causes them pain. This is an ""equal solution"" to the problem. The same amount of time and energy and money was spent on each person. The average person says ""this is fair"", but most people are unhappy.

Equity would be this: Each person gets a bike they can ride safely and happily and exceptions are made for those who cannot ride a bike. This means the children get a child-size bike, the person with a bad back might get a recumbent bike or an exception to drive a car or a free bus pass, the city holds free bike-riding classes for those who don't know how to ride, etc. The average person goes ""wait, this isn't fair, I just got a normal bike, why does the amputee get a special bike? Why is the city spending more money on other people and not me?"", but the majority of people get a solution that works for them.

The sticking point is that it's very true that governments just don't have the time and resources to make every situation perfectly equitable for every single person, which is an easy argument for people to use to say equity is impossible and we shouldn't try.

The main issue I see is that it doesn’t seem to tackle the root causes of these “height” gaps and assumes that these groups can’t “grow”. Simply providing a higher starting point is never gonna solve the root issues like lack of educational funding, prison-industrial complexes, societal perceptions, and on and on and instead pushes the burden of higher barriers on groups that are currently succeeding (which is also composed of many minority groups). 

This line of thinking also tends to push overly empathetic approaches to a competitive endeavor (career progression) instead of fundamental changes at the social, political, and educational level.  We can recognize the danger of advantaging certain underrepresented groups extremely well in some areas of society like athletics. It wouldn’t make sense for Asian or Hispanic men to have an easier draft into the NBA or NFL simply because of their lack of representation. And yet we push policies of race or gender based admissions to school or work all the time with no thought of the social consequence of these policies. 

Lowering the bar for disadvantaged groups naturally leads to resentment, particularly within those from “taller” groups yet horribly impoverished backgrounds.

We sorta do this at my job. Our stepstools for reaching high places are 'way too big' for the taller guys and they only need to stand on the first or second step.

""*Actually* have something to fear,"" is an interesting qualifier, in that it means you are actually referring to a level of statistical risk, not a level of emotional fear - after all, a person can be legitimately terrified of something that poses no *actual* threat to them, right?

So really, what your first sentence is saying, is that if you are accused of sexual assault/harassment, it's about 49x more likely that the accusation is legit, than that it's fabricated (using the 2% false acc rate from something you linked somewhere else).

However, in making the logical jump from there to your third sentence, you equate the *emotion* of fear with the *statistical state* of ""actually having something to fear"".

Point is at least some men saying, ""I won't work with women because they could say I was inappropriate,"" are afraid because our culture/media/whatever blows the odds of being falsely accused of being inappropriate entirely out of proportion, not because they are *actually* at risk of being accused.

The change you saw was not ""getting a seal of approval"", I mean, yes, it was, but what was unspoken was the threat of violence.

Women understand this *very* well. In fact, anecdotally I think they perceive it far more then men. 

If I piss off a guy, I might end up in a fight that I might win or lose. If a woman pisses off the wrong man, she might end up in an unwinable fight, or worse.

Of course this isn't a communication style that works with everyone. Generally people who have loud friends and family understand the rules.

What you did is actually what feminists want. Most of the negative stuff in the media is an extreme focus on angry and misinformed Twitter users, and not on the actual academic or sociological thought behind the movement. 

For example, I hear people saying thing like ""Feminists want to force women to work instead of being stay at home moms"" a lot in my circles, as they are largely conservative and religious. But that is not true, and it is why I out myself as one in those situations. The actual position is that a woman should be able to choose for herself what she wants to do with herself. If that is being a stay at home mom in a suburb with a working husband, then she should be free to make that choice. If it is to be a single, childless manager at a mechanics shop, she should also have that choice.

Going on a case by case basis is much different than claiming that lack of equal representation is evidence of systemic issues. Again, look at data from Nordic countries. They always score the highest on opportunity equality (or whatever its called) for both sexes, but have some clearly defined sectors preferred by either men or women.

h91273d,t1_h904894,2021-08-15 13:36:10,science,"I suppose my point is that those features, while observable, are perhaps being overemphasized as being more important than they really are.

You can categorize human beings according to hundreds of features. Eye color, favorite sports team, hairiness, propensity to like Brussel sprouts.

The present question is how important certain categories are.

I suppose when it comes to an occupation like engineer, people perhaps really shouldn't care that much about skin tone or what makes the person horny.

But who knows. The counter argument of the religious left-leaning team suggests that there might be a problem if the team of engineers who are designing your railway aren't equal proportions black/white/asian and ""likes vagina"" / ""likes penis"" / ""likes both"" according to the precise proportion found in the general population.

So there is a hint of absurdity in wondering - between the meetings about physics, and building materials, and contracts and such - about which genitalia that your team of mathematically proficient analysts prefer to put in their mouths, if any. And that we are urged to do such an accounting as a moral imperative. Not that it's too absurd but that it just might be a little absurd. That perhaps we should just focus on the business of making sure the buildings don't collapse.

Sure, there could be discrimination lingering based on those silly features that mean relatively little. But, this can be addressed by that same common sense imperative. That we simply focus on the business of making sure the buildings don't collapse.

However in 2021 this sentiment might get you exiled as heretic. Hence the current prevalence of clueless and frightened managers foreswearing their allegiance the proper God by saying, out of nowhere, relevant to nothing ""Golly it sure is GREAT to see so many EMPOWERED FEMALE engineers around here!"" to the surprise cringe of all engineers in the room, male and female, who are simply there for the business of making sure the building's don't collapse.

Yes, you can observe that your coworker has boobs, and is Hispanic. But this typically doesn't matter all that much in the professional sense. UNLESS there is some war in which we must make sure that the boobiness of the employees are equal to the boobiness of the general population. (And so on and so forth). In case the manager happens to secretly be against boobiness.

Obviously you shouldn't be hiring unqualified people. But most positions will have multiple qualified individuals as options to hire.

Have you ever seen a product that passed through a company all the way to being released and somehow no one noticed the really glaring problem with it?  Having everyone in the company be the same racially, sexuality-wise, gender-wise, etc, with “the best” skill set, means you get products like that, because they all saw it the same way.  When you have a diverse group, even if it’s at a slight disadvantage in skill set (which isn’t even always a thing, but we’re talking as if for whatever reason only cishet white men were the best skill set wise), you don’t run into nearly as many problems where the finished product just completely misses the mark entirely.  


For a quick example, it’s really obvious that facebook doesn’t have any blind developers because they force pushed out a feature to groups awhile back where it reformatted posts automatically into being “question” posts.  And for whatever reason, the question posts just completely broke with every screen reader I heard about.  So for awhile, anyone blind on facebook just couldn’t really exist in groups because these posts just didn’t work at all, and they were being made without people setting their post to be a question post, and they didn’t even have good logic as to what posts became a “question”.  Sometimes posts without a single ? were still made question posts for some reason even.  If their dev team or testers had blind workers, or even just, people who tested with screen readers, they would have absolutely never pushed that update because it completely just, broke everything.  As it stands now, the question posts still break with screen readers, they just have made it possible to turn off the automatic question posts.",TGotAReddit,t2_10goi9wo,3,0,reddit4

>For instance, one study analyzed 31 separate two-part conversations, 10 of which were between two men, 10 of which were between two women, and 11 of which were between a man and a woman.  The researchers identified seven interruptions overall in the two same-sex groups combined; in themale-female groups, however, the researchers found 48 total interruptions—and 46 of them were instigated by the man.

I made the miniscule effort to actually click on the link and read the study. It says that interruptions happened in 3 of the 20 same-sex segments, and 2 out of the 7 interruptions were done by women, but in 10 of the 11 mixed-sex segments somebody was interrupted, and as the quote states, 46 out of those 48 interruptions were done by men. Let's do the maths

* 55 interruptions
* 46 done by men targeted at women
* 5 done by men targeted at men
* 2 done by women targeted at women
* 2 done by women targeted at men

And you say women are the problem? That's ... almost cute.

In this study, women treated men and women the same, while men, for some reason I cannot *fully* fathom, decided to interrupt women about 9 times as much as they interrupted men; or rather almost all of them did it, while only one or two interrupted another man. And going from the content of the conversations they clearly did understand the flow of the conversation and its turn-taking behaviour; it just was that they were unhappy with where it was going, so they interrupted.

And as the other person wrote, there's copious research on how women are treated if they object to these interruptions.",hanikamiya,t2_jzdih,1,0,reddit4

Yeah, that's absolutely a bad hiring pratice. No one needs a hard-working genius, who can't accept authorities or their team members. No one needs a very capable and sociable person, who sits around all day. A good manager would always hire someone who is mediocre in all of those aspects over someone who only excels in specific situations. In fact, many people who climbed very high up a company ladder have massive problems when trying to find another job, because they are absolutely overqualified, simply bc it's much harder to integrate these people, without them getting frustrated. Even if they are really good, sociable and work a lot.

My uncle owns a hospital and while they have a very diverse group of doctors, it's extremely hard to even find male nurses and the ones who get hired have very big problems, integrating themselves in a group, only consisting of women and usually end up quitting within the same year. My gpa is a engineering professor with like 60%-70% women in his classes, with very similar grades as the men. We had 10% tops in physics, a couple of years ago who were all extremely capable. I don't think a single woman failed the first semester, while 40% of men did. You have to take these things into account, in the hiring process.

Because we don't need them if there are general programs available, which I'm sure there are given the side-step with that response.

The general programs are our programs, by and large. The goals of those tend to be more individualistic in nature than the ones you're taking issue with. The group-specific programs are meant to address wider and well documented trends (through individual advancement) as they relate to hiring and advancing historically marginalized groups. It contains a wider goal. We (white men) don't have a history of being ignored for any and all programs, promotions, raises, etc. due to our race or gender because we've *always* been the default in the US, hence the extremely minor correction like development programs specific to historically marginalized groups. We have exactly zero need for a program that's specific to us for that reason. Ideally, all groups will get to this point eventually.

Focusing solely on your specific job ignores the very real reasons why programs like that exist in the first place even if you're a ""minority"" in the small context of the job you currently work. 

I understand the gut reaction of thinking this is somehow an affront to us because of race, but if you dive into the history of prejudice and problematic thinking that has made the response of programs like those largely helpful it's hard to take issue with. It's also basically impossible to come off as anything more than a entitled and ignorant by demanding we be allowed into them.

On the other hand, these studies seem to only be counting when an individual comes forward to the *police* and makes a false statement. This feels quite disingenuous when you are also trying to point out how few sexual assaults get reported to the police. If you want to count that statistic, you also need to account for how many false rumors get spread about sexual assaults having occurred, how many false accusations are only ever reported to college administrations and handled internally under Title IX, and how many false accusations are made exclusively to internal corporate HR departments. Those are rarely ever investigated thoroughly, and they are the things that lead to job loss, academic expulsion, and becoming a social pariah. Their chances of happening have absolutely no bearing on whether or not the allegation was ever reported to the police.

Things like women going out for drinks without you and forming connections to get job promotions whilst you're the outsider would surely be wronging you and you wouldn't even be aware of it happening.

Academia is the place in our society **most** on-board with equity programs and all that they entail, by a large margin.  In fact, they lead the charge in many ways.  Except they've charged so far they now are continuing to promote groups who are marginalized in society more broadly despite the fact that the majority in the population at large is now a vanishing minority within this institution.

Surely, if equity and diversity is always desirable, then having members of people who are even in the majority of the broader population is still desirable, and the elimination of bias against them is only evident when they representation is proportional to their percentage make-up of the population.

Nothing I've just laid out here is an anecdote.  It is an analysis of the theory and practice of equity and the logic that fits based on the current population dynamics of my institution.  If a group is underrepresented within an institution compared to the greater population, then that institution is marginalizing them, and equity should focus on ensuring they cease to be marginalized, not furthering that marginalization.

fiupp6k,t3_f9tm7r,2020-02-26 19:39:02,science,"This is all fixed by approval or ranked-choice voting.

**How?**

* Well, the very first thing it does is allow people to make both a sincere vote AND a strategic vote.
* Once people start putting their sincere vote on the ballot, center candidates start becoming viable.
* Center candidates start running
* Now, instead of having a false dichotomy between the two biggest sides, we can actually debate in the middle.
* Center candidates start winning.
* ROI for buying-out the two parties diminishes as the number of centrist candidates running increases.

**Why isn't this happening now?**

Because first-past-the-post voting FORCES strategic voting. Since there's no way to express multiple preferences, voters MUST NOT vote for their personally most preferred candidate because it splits the vote.

If you really want to fix the world, push for raked choice or approval voting.

**What's wrong with one person one vote?**

Well, even in ranked-choice voting, it's still one person one vote.  It's just that your vote automatically moves to your second choice when your first choice is eliminated.

In approval voting, it's not as clear how it's fair, but let me highlight that voting for more than one person doesn't increase your voting power.  In fact, if you vote for everyone on your ballot, you are effectively voting for nobody (write-ins notwithstanding).",otac0n,t2_3p22y,0,0,reddit1

In particular, we focus here on oil and gas companies, who contributed more than $84 million to candidates running for the US Congress in 2018 ([9](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/18/1922175117#ref-9)). 

The source for this is Open Secrets. When that site looks at donations by a company to a candidate, it includes the donations of individuals employed by that company. For example, if a Wal-Mart employee donates to Bernie Sanders, OpenSecrets lists the donation as coming from Wal-Mart. 

The quote above is extremely misleading. The only donations to candidates in that 84 million are the donations made by the employees of those companies from their own personal bank accounts.

In each category of harassment, respondents reported personal and career consequences”

Male photographers being the primary perpetrators paints a different picture than “sleezy millionaire hires models to attend his penthouse party and proceeds to harass them”

khtrbnw,t3_196isak,2024-01-14 15:49:00,science,"Modeling is a dream occupation for many young women, but for those who make modeling a career, finding work can be a traumatic, sexualized nightmare, a Rutgers University-New Brunswick study finds.  
To land a modeling job – the first photo shoot, the next gig – models must constantly network, an essential element of entrepreneurial labor. These informal dinners, clubbing events, and private home get-togethers, activities that Rutgers public policy professor and study author Jocelyn Elise Crowley calls “the party life,” are often opportunities for sexual harassment.  
“When they are not officially ‘on the clock,’ models must actively pursue connections that can potentially lead to solid, steady work and often times, this involves socializing, or what I have termed here engaging in the party life,” wrote Crowley, whose study is published in the journal Women's Studies International Forum. “Pressure to engage in the party life is both internally driven from the models themselves and externally driven by the surrounding business players,” clients, art directors, and photographers who are many times men.

The rest, primarily take pictures of naked women and when they're not doing that, they're busy trying to get women to submit to naked photoshoots. It's basically why they chose this profession. 
And they've told me that many times, they can get the model to sleep with them afterwards. 

A friend of mine, a woman, got her first marriage ultimately brought  to an end by a photographer. She was young when she married this older dude, she was 22, he was 30, and after about a year of marriage he started getting emotionally abusive, basically making her feel insecure about her body and undesirable. She wanted to get him to like her again, so she hired a photographer to take boudoir shots of her. He got her to open up about the reasons, seduced her and sex with him kinda happened, as she explained. I'm not 100% sure she was completely onboard as much she was going with it because the situation was dizzying.

khvtvi7,t1_khutoxs,2024-01-14 23:02:37,science,"In my experience it’s also largely about how people think about credibility of threat (which is somewhat related). People seem to understand sexual harassment through the lens of whether they think they seem like a credible threat for sexual assault. Gay men don’t see themselves as credible threats against women in part because they likely have no malicious intent, no sexual desire, and assume others to understand and trust that and overlook how more “minor” boundary crossings are still actually just sexual harassment. What makes something sexual harassment doesn’t hinge on whether the person doing it gets sexual pleasure from what they’re doing, but that is a common often subconscious assumption people make. 

But I think the “threat” assessment is also important because it explains something many ignore. You are totally correct that women will sexually harass gay men, but tbh I don’t think it’s much less common against straight men when women feel that they are in a “safe” position to make such a move. There is often no pushback socially for women who sexually harass men, regardless of orientation. Anyone who works in a bar or other space where there are lots of drunk, primarily straight women can attest to how aggressive women can be about unwanted sexual touch and other forms of sexual harassment. Women broadly don’t see themselves as threats to men, especially on a physical level. Generally the logic stops there and the idea that treating someone in a demeaning way or violating their boundaries never occurs to them. It’s also tied up in the myth that “men always want it.” I especially deplore this in the cases I’ve seen of women harassing and assaulting asexual men, as they simply are not believed and there is a culture of acceptance around “corrective r*pe,” the idea that someone can forcefully show them they aren’t ace (which also applies to this attitude about other queer identities). It’s frankly gross how accepted (by both women and men) sexual harassment of men is, and I think that this stems from the presumption that women can’t be threats to them. It fundamentally misunderstands why sexual harassment and assault are bad - the boundary/consent violation. 

I don’t attempt to whitewash the shittiness of these actions by describing my understanding of what the people who do them are thinking, nor do I think gay men and straight women only do it for these reasons and not other more openly malicious ones (power over someone). I just want to describe my understanding of this dynamic having seen this behavior play out in many situations and seen the absolute shock of especially straight women when they are called out for sexual harassment, as if they think it doesn’t “count” when they do it. It’s certainly a problem that needs addressing and holding people to account for, regardless of if their intent is outright malicious. Actions and impacts matter more than intent, but intent can sometimes help us know the best way to approach confrontation and changing behavior.",sarahelizam,t2_kyov0,57,0,reddit2

khuufgj,t1_khunzmc,2024-01-14 19:38:09,science,"Obviously there are different things occuring, though I would say the legal system isn't always the best area to go seeking definitions; it's often very behind the times or reactive to society, as opposed to forward looking in some of the language used. It can be very open to a ""well no one says a dog can't play basketball"" type interpretation, even the more specific you get with rules. 

But regardless, when we talk about Rape, there's lots of different kinds. It's an umbrella category. Generally all of it being centered around the concept of consent. We say children can't consent and pedophilia can fall under statutory rape. Animals can't consent so bestiality is a form of rape. If someone gets so drunk they pass out and can't stop someone from performing sexual acts on them, that's a form of rape. 

At the end of the day though, if you think that someone pulling a gun on you and saying ""suck my cock"" and you comply out of fear of death, and you make the argument ""well that's not rape, that's a coerced sexual act"" I have to ask the question; why are you highlighting this difference? What purpose does it serve?

And when you bring up the legal system, and point to crimes that have different sentencing; it makes it sound like you think someone physically pinning someone down to force sex upon them is so different from someone wielding a weapon and threatening to use it to make someone commit sexual acts under duress are so different that one deserves less punishment than the other.

So if that's the argument you're trying to make, fine, I think I'll go on the record and disagree personally.

Co-authored by an MIT economist, the study finds that, per capita, immigrants are about 80 percent more likely to found a firm, compared to U.S.-born citizens. Those firms also have about 1 percent more employees than those founded by U.S. natives, on average.

“Immigrants, relative to natives and relative to their share of the population, found more firms of every size,” says Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-author of a published paper detailing the study’s results.

Taking firm creation into account, the results indicate that immigration to the U.S. is associated with a net gain in job availability, contrary to the common perception that immigrants fill jobs that U.S.-born workers would otherwise have.

“The findings suggest that immigrants act more as ‘job creators’ than ‘job takers’ and that non-U.S. born founders play outsized roles in U.S. high-growth entrepreneurship,” the authors write in the paper.

You want a business? Just do it. While many native US citizens see all the work required to start a business as just something outside the realm of possibility and not something worth the time & effort or only for the rich.

Many immigrants come to the US specifically to make more money to support not just themselves, but their families back home. They very quickly realize that you can’t make ends meet and send money home without starting up a business (since they may have a harder time finding good paying jobs like Americans), so they do it without regard for some of the technical details, they sort of “fake it til they make it”. Starting a business for immigrants is probably compensating for Americans having all the better-paying job.

Just getting to the US via a Green card lottery can be a big investment for some foreign families, so there’s very much an expectation that people coming out here are going to have something show for it and there be some sort of return on that investment.",,,1,0,reddit3

I have known 100's of immigrants from all over the world, both legal and illegal, and by and large they were some of the most solid and upright people I've ever met. Good people who are good for our country. I am proud to have known and worked with the vast majority of them and would be thrilled if they would like to stay and raise their families here. The U.S. needs them so much more than most people here realize or would ever admit. 

I have worked hard manual labor most of my life, which is where I have met many of these great people. I can attest that most citizens of the U.S. not only don't want to, but could not do these jobs. I worked at a place that paid very good money for the time and we would try to hire often. But, the hours and work load were just overwhelming for most people. Once, in 1998, I watched 10 of 15 new hires quit the first day. Some didn't even come out to the yard, just went back to their cars and drove off. Others snuck away at break time and lunch time.

I imagine this range wasn't chosen for no reason, particularly regarding the fact that it was during the largest recession in almost a century. Natural born citizens were busy picking up the pieces of their finances at that time too.

There is also the fact that we'd need more than a percentage of each group starting businesses. A group of immigrants is going to be more likely to have had plans but not acted on them whereas natural born citizens are likely to have had plans and already acted on them for the most part.

The best stat I could think of to look at would instead be how many employees does each group have on average. That would take into account past foundings and also account for the extremely small businesses with minimal value to the economy as a whole.

They should then also split it up into the financial status of the immigrants based on arriving within a year (i.e. did they arrive and suddenly get a million dollars from their family overseas?).

1) Immigrants legal or not, do not move to another country to be able to suck on the government's teats. We move because we want a better shot at life, *and* - and this is an important and- we have the drive, courage, and wherewithal to do it. For the most part, you are talking about resourceful people who are not afraid of taking risks. I was never illegal, so I can't speak from experience; but remember that informal businesses are businesses nonetheless.

2) Profoundly disagree. It does not take ""great means,"" especially not if you're talking about money. What it takes is great courage to jump into an unknown situation, and great ability to learn, adapt, and grow. The US immigration system is exceedingly complicated, but it can be understood and followed by motivated people. In terms of money, it takes surprisingly little since one way to do it is to start with legal, sponsored employment. It is easier and safer to hire a good immigration lawyer to help with the process, but it is not strictly necessary. And there are levels. You can pay a lawyers through the whole process, which will cost many thousands of dollars; or you can hire an hour or two here or there for legal advice when you're in doubt, which will cost a few hundred dollars. Consider that people with great means often times don't have the motivation to go anywhere- life's already great where they are!

3) There is no direct path between a student visa and permanent residency or citizenship. Anybody coming here on a student visa hoping to become a legal immigrant needs to have a better plan. Something needs to happen before the person finishes school and they are required to leave the country. I am not saying it's impossible, but it's a seriously difficult step, and an unnecessary one. Somehow while pursuing a degree the person needs to find a job willing to sponsor them, or get married. Also, many countries and private entities, and the schools themselves, offer scholarships to promising students. Don't assume that a foreign student in a US university has a wealthy family paying their way abroad. Most don't. The reason you see some students actually becoming citizens, usually through work, is that they are talented people. Talented enough to get accepted, talented enough to get a scholarship (or several), talented enough that a US company would be willing to go through the costly process of sponsoring them. But this is not a path open to most people.

More than 200K people will die waiting in this legal immigration queue before they get their permanent residency, including myself.

>2) It takes relatively great means to migrate to a whole different country legally. So presumably they already are in a privileged position (with of course some exceptions)

This is a huge factor. I have a colleague that is Cambodian. Family originally immigrated during the genocide. They have been helping more family members migrate over the last 40 years. The main financial requirement for legal immigration  is that you have to prove that the family member will be supported by the sponsor (this could be specific to the visa type they are using). So that requires a big income base to even consider starting the process. 

Why this matters is that there is a big survivorship bias that is baked into the statistics. If it takes big money to help a family member immigrate then rich families will have more people in the US. The poor immigrant will have fewer family members come with them. That results in more immigrants with wealth driving the statistics for this study.

I don't have an issue with this policy approach. Most western nations require something similar, and it is far better the  the unofficial US policy of accepting anyone that claims asylum at the southern border and then allowing them into the country to access financial support. That group never leaves if their asylum case is not supported, they just melt into the background of society.",Trest43wert,t2_gbjlq3hh,1,0,reddit3

The goal of the charity was to help its target demographic integrate into U.S. society. Hedren invited her personal manicurist to teach a group of 20 Vietnamese women the craft of doing nails.[2][3][4] The training required for nail salon work is short and inexpensive, the work itself does not require high English proficiency, and the work hours tend to be flexible enough to allow immigrant mothers to attend to family obligations.

**Update**: Because people don't Google and don't know enough about their own country:

1. 2.8 million visas are issued each year. This includes students and other visas. Work permits are usually more than 140k each year. Student worker visas are 300k+. Such a large number compared to #2 below.
2. vs 10-12k refugees and asylum seekers that US takes in.

Poorly thought out on your end. No immigrant can enter US without a visa. Those visas are usually issued by employers and they are closed work permits. Which also means two things:

1. You get a job to be here.
2. You can't start a company of your own when you are on visa (restrictions for visa holders).

Immigrants start their companies after receiving green cards or after becoming a citizen. The third route it can happen is if an immigrant comes as a company owner(but the research doesn't seem to be speaking about that).",,,-4,0,reddit3

Higher education was always a massive boon for the US because of this. Not only do the schools train the best and brightest, they attract the best and brightest from around the world.

It’s not terrible for someone who’s working a full-time job in the US, but a lot of immigrants are applying from outside the US. 

It definitely takes a lot of money to go to a good school in the US (which is where most international students want to go), and there are  no/few grants that are available for them. I went to a public school slightly out of the top 50 in the US, and my tuition was over $25k per semester.

If a company sponsors you for a work visa, you have even more time to get married (if you want it of course). The only difficult path is actually getting sponsored for an immigrant visa/green card by a company.

A lot of American culture is centered around individuality and being a ""self starter"" when in all actuality, those that have a support system and others willing to help them are the ones that are in a better position to succeed. 

This is why you see a lot of Latin American families, as an example, be able to afford houses and cars because everyone is willing to pitch in with the expectation and promise that when we've helped you, you will help the next person and next wave of immigrants succeed like you did.

America is preoccupied with doing everything as an individual, but it's just the lie that is propagated to keep people poor at this point. Almost all successful people had some kind of help and luck to get to that successful place.  This isn't to downplay the hard work that has to go into the equation, but even as you mentioned, your mother had people willing to help send her to a place of opportunity that she might not have been able to afford herself and on her own.

I say all of this just to point out a lot of people in America are selfish and have been made to believe that once they are successful, there is no need to help those that come after.

Each country has a limit of visas every year, but the country I applied through never hit that quota, so getting a visa was almost guaranteed, otherwise it's a lottery.

But instead of fixing the problems with the whole H1B system, they do finger pointing and strawmen arguments.

As for green cards, giving H1B a green card will be better for the job market as they are no longer wage slaves. Shifting a H1B to green card won't make a job dissappear, but keeping someone on H1B for decades is definitely giving the employer undue power over the employee",,,16,0,reddit3

They didn't gain the resources to immigrate by being poor in their country or unmotivated. 

Then again, I've worked with some firms that got ahead by hiring via H-1B visa abuse and paying them pennies so maybe that's what you mean when you say they're not wealthy. But they're definitely educated.",Econolife_350,t2_5l662pl1,5,0,reddit3

i7y6gxm,t1_i7xdora,2022-05-09 18:14:15,science,"I can only go by my own experience, and maybe a few cases I know from friends. My own experience is that the way to deal with the imperfect grasp of language and culture is to ask questions. I may be very lucky that I ended up in a part of the US where I always felt very welcome, and I've been helped a lot by a lot of good people.

Again in my experience, the way to deal with subtle prejudice is to try to understand it and engage the person in conversation. Often times prejudice comes from ignorance and from never having had the opportunity to meaningfully engage with some minority. So when I detect that I try to make friends, tell stories, ask questions about their lives in the hopes that they will ask me questions as well. I've made a lot of friends this way, and I like to think that I've helped a little the general issue with prejudice.

To your actual question, though, I think that creating one's own business is a transition. It allows for a means to supporting one's self and family while learning the ropes. I know people who own restaurants and other types of services, like computer repair; because they can start by catering to the same ethnic group. I like the fact that I can go to a store and find products from the old country; in the mean time the owner of that store can deal with me in terms that she is used to. In the mean time she learns how to navigate American culture and society. By the time the next generation is ready to take over the family business, they are well acculturated and it's just another restaurant or whatever, with all sorts of customers and no longer necessarily catering to the ethnic group. By then they are just Americans :)",,,3,0,reddit3

It takes money to start even a small company, so if you are flat broke, you can't really start much.

In fact, I'd be curious if you just look at wealth and ignore immigration status entirely, if the numbers still don't look pretty much the same. The US has a VERY large disproportion between our rich and poor.

Wealthy immigrant can start a business about as well as a wealthy native-born, whereas a poor immigrant would struggle as much (if not more) than an equally poor native-born.

Obviously this is anecdote so take it with salt but I’ve noticed that a lot of people in America (and probably other countries idk) tend to believe and see themselves, no matter the evidence, as completely disconnected from others, as an island. I think in many cases collectivism/family and loved ones focus can sort of put on blinders to peoples own choices and possibilities, but American-style individualism seems completely detached from reality and fosters this contradictory belief that people have to make as much money as possible to support their kids and help them  in the future, but that everyone rich and successful they see is all “self-made” and they didn’t owe anyone anything. Again just my conjecture but I think it fosters this ideal among middle-income worker-class people that they should be able to jump into life at 18 or earlier, and that assistance (the receiving or giving of) is shameful and hurts someone in the future. idk this is a rent but the mention of generational wealth just sorta got my mind going about how so many people seem to be like purposefully blind to how much it can effect your life, and how much other people can effect your life. what is that saying? “No man is an island”?

The US economy has “grown” significantly over the last 60 years and yet wages have stagnated against inflation and wealth has continued to be consolidated toward the upper classes of society. There’s mountains of data showing how much wealth and income inequality have grown in the US over that time period.

There is no coherent argument that an hourly/salary worker is “benefitting” from increased immigration in remotely the same way that business owners/shareholders do; the exact opposite is true as we’ve seen with Covid. Smaller labor markets are better for working people as it gives them more power and leverage; the opposite benefits businesses.

Any working person who wants to see their wages increase and their power in the labor market remain strong should oppose the dilution of the labor market; more employees at their disposal only benefits businesses who can use that competition to drive down wages.

As I said to the previous poster, the maxim of “more money is being spent, so everyone benefits” is an outright lie; the only people who benefit from increased spending are those who profit from increased spending. Hourly/salary workers do not see any increases in income from growth in profits, only business owners/shareholders. If that were the case, we’d have seen working-class people’s pay skyrocketing alongside the boom in corporate profits over the decades but they haven’t.

Based on? Which groups of immigrants? Are you aware of the requirements of immigrating to the US?

A quick google search said that the average immigrant comes with around 50k is savings, which is 10k above what the average US citizens has in savings. But that was really just to get a quick look into that claim.

Is it? I think there’s arguments to be made for both styles of culture. On the one hand, if you have strong family ties and a sense of duty to your parents/tradition or whatever, you have a good safety net and people looking after you. You also have a large amount of expectations that may or may not be within your, or your country’s best interest.
It’s easy to imagine a scenario where whatever the family business happens to be is no longer viable, but because of the weight of cultural expectation, a kid feels pressured to go into that line of work anyway, despite there being no real future there.
Someone from a more individualistic culture would feel more free to pursue something that was more financially lucrative or personally fulfilling.

In employment based category there is an annual cap on number of green card available by country of birth (not the passport one holds).

So you have a huge numbers of applicants trying to squeeze through a funnel of H (within 85K overall limit or so per year - most filled by Indians) and L (not constrained by a cap) employment visa - and then only 7K or so can get green card per year. My numbers might be off by a bit - but you get the picture.  


It creates an ever increasing backlog (70-100+ yrs) for a very large number of Indian immigrants coming through work visa route. Not surprisingly next impacted are Chinese (7-10 yrs).

Basically the law says 7% of total green cards can be awarded to immigrants from 1 country. When reading it, it seems fair, but in reality, it predominantly targets immigrants from India. Since India has a comparatively large workforce and hence large work visa immigration, they have a relatively high green card application, so their 7% cap gets filled quite easily, and the excess visas pplicants are moved for next year green card applications. But here's the catch, other countries that have relatively low immigration populations, whose 7% cap is not filled, those visas are discarded, and hence go to waste. So now, you have about 200,000 green card visas being wasted/discarded every year, while the 100s of thousands of imigrants from India are stuck in the backlog, and in infine loop of visa renewal benefitting immigration attorneys (who actively lobby against removing the country cap).",brocode103,t2_hidmt,3,0,reddit3

It absolutely cannot flood it’s own local talent pools, job markets, resources, etc. with foreign workers with no regard for its own citizens. If everyone in the world who is qualified to immigrate, and simply can with automatic green card, it would be disastrous for its citizens — naturalized or US-born.

Yes, there are paths that do not require company sponsorship. By that logic, you can add the US to that list too! https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate.html

Maybe I misinterpreted your message, but ""treating h1b as an immigrant visa with automatic green card"" seemed to imply ""we should grant green cards automatically for temporary employment-based visas""...""like every other country"", since H1B is designed for foreign workers. I was namely wondering which countries support this employment visa -> automatic citizenship, and clearly the US (and almost every country) has many non-employment-based immigration paths. 

Or did you mean ""the US should allow foreign workers to immigrate with automatic green cards without company sponsorships with full work authorization""? 

> Why have dual intent when the second intent of immigration is denied for 40 years?

Just because it is the case for one country's petitioning workers, does not mean it is the case for every other country's petitions as well. I know many Canadian-born people that have successfully obtained green card via TN -> H1B -> GC, or H1B -> GC, within 2 years total time. That dual-intent works, and Canada has the third highest number of petitions, according to my previous link (althought its H1B applications, I cannot find one for Green Card specifically, but perhaps we can assume the proportions are relatively similar). 

> If we agree that we want the quota to remain my question is why not extend to h1B and just ask these poor souls to work in their home country

I don't want the quota to remain, and I don't disagree the H1B system is broken. I would be open to better solutions. I understand why it may be there in the first place, but I would love a better alternative.

There is ample evidence in psychology suggesting that, in fact, people are bad at that. Especially on something as low-stakes as a poll.

This situation is not analogous.

Again, this is a giant reach and there's no amount of finagling that will change that.

Night people generally do worse on almost every metric from health, mental performance, wealth, etc. 

I think when they do studies of indigenous people, that the difference in time they go to sleep is usually half an hour or so. 

Then you have studies of people when they go camping and avoid artificial lights, and then those night people start going to sleep much earlier. 

So while genetically there are evening people, the difference is likely to be small and doesn't explain people who go to sleep really late. 

So many night people are just day people, but doing almost everything to mess up their circadian rhythm, through artificial light exposure, etc. 

You can take night people and force them to go to sleep earlier and then their mental and physical performance in tests improves. 

&#x200B;
>Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by actigraphy and circadian phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no adverse effect on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical ‘suboptimal’ morning hours.

Nice spot. I don't think I have any specific studies on that. Also I think in general it's going to be hard to tease it out.

When you look at just correlational studies then you'll have all sorts of cofounders. So people who are morning people are linked to psychological factors like constraint. So those people with more constraint are going to exercise more and have better sleep habits which then results in them being morning people. So then it's not going to be easy to tell if they are healthier due to being a morning person or exercise, health/sleep habits etc.

>Constraint was associated with Morningness and earlier circadian phase

https://www.psypost.org/2023/08/new-study-sheds-light-on-the-connection-between-sleeping-patterns-and-wages-168300


>Participants reporting a “definite evening” chronotype were 54% (95% CI, 49% to 59%) more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle than participants reporting a “definite morning” chronotype. A total of 1925 diabetes cases were documented over 469 120 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the “definite morning” chronotype, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes was 1.21 (CI, 1.09 to 1.35) for the “intermediate” chronotype and 1.72 (CI, 1.50 to 1.98) for the “definite evening” chronotype after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, shift work, and family history of diabetes.

In the end I don't really stress much about the details.

Even more genes than that are post-translationally modified by ribosomes according to circadian (ie light/dark) timing. The way that genes express themselves in response to light and darkness is not a coincidence, but adaptive to dirurnal living and nighttime sleeping. 

People can make themselves “night owls” by avoiding seeing the sunrise, constantly exposing themselves to dim (compared to outdoors) artificial lighting that doesn’t vary between night and day, and scheduling their days in a way that causes them to stay up late. However, before artificial lighting was invented, night owls were extremely uncommon (as was sleeping under 7 hours per night).

Now, companies are unable to replace employees that quit or move on. You could say “Well then companies need to pay more” except even that isn’t working.

The problem isn’t NEW people going on unemployment, it’s those that have already been on unemployment NOT wanting to get back into the workforce.

h5d10kd,t3_ol0tb9,2021-07-16 04:37:17,science,"First off, any studies on unemployment or anything about that should be taken with a grain of salt for the simple reason that unemployment is not what most people think it is. Unemployment rate only factors in people that are still in the labor force, if you have not looked for a job actively in the past six months you are no longer a part of the labor force. That is a legal definition, that does not mean that those people don’t want jobs or that they aren’t looking for work really, it’s just a stupid measurement because they assume that these people won’t get jobs. The more likely answer though is that a lot of those people just don’t wanna work for the abysmally low wages they get offered. 

Secondly, based on what the highlights of the study are, unemployment benefits are only beneficial to unemployed people, and no one else, because it effectively reduces the available labor supply by raising the opportunity cost for taking a crappy job. In other words, why work for minimum-wage when you can get paid minimum-wage and do nothing? Of course, this only works if you’ve accrued unemployment benefits, you don’t just automatically get them. It is easier to get a crappy job when unemployment exists is the conclusion of the study. The real takeaway of the study though should be that we need more better jobs. It’s pretty clear that society is messed up when it’s literally looking like it’s better for people to get paid not to work then it is for them to just find a job that’s reasonably paying.",Giraff3,t2_8tljz,1,0,reddit2

That's not true, it was 5.4% **on an annualized basis**, meaning the inflation amount is extrapolated over an entire year. 5.4% year over year is high; the Fed targets for 2%, but it's also not catastrophic, especially since the causes are transient accompany expansion.

ECON 101; inflation always comes with expansion. GDP rose 6.4% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, which is massive for the US. Prior to 2020 anything over 5% was something you only saw in developing nations like China and India.

Where inflation really hurts is when you get stagflation from a supply shock, where inflation accompanies a recession. The Carter malaise is the best example, and was triggered by the oil embargo. Inflation hit 13% in 1980 and GDP fell. Which is why I have to laugh at anyone under 50 bitching about inflation being at 2-3% every year.

 Increased wages are not wholly consumed by inflation. I can see why you might logically come to that conclusion, but many economists beleive that while increased wages may have a moderate effect on inflation, the overall result is increased buying power.

But the number of available jobs didn’t change.  

Highlights
•
In March-July 2020, US unemployment benefits were raised by $600 a week.

•
Each 10% increase in benefits caused a 3.6% decline in job applications.

** So the number of ppl applying for jobs reduced. I would imagine you would need to look at the type of job. Lots of white collar jobs were able to WFH, Blue collar there was no work so why apply or post jobs, and retail was running on reduced crews if anything. Jobs like retail etc who operate closer to min wage it would be a wash to work or stay on benefits. 

•
However, the increase in benefits did not decrease job vacancy creation.

** in a normal time I would expect the opposite, increases benefits causing ppl to look for better jobs and less willing to grab any job.  Causing job vacancy to increase, but again by this point the pandemic was in full swing and those who could work, worked. Those who worked in service or close to min wage the jobs were not there and so were on benefits
. 
•
Jobs were scarce at the time, with 26% fewer vacancies than in January-February 2020.

•
High benefits reduced competition for jobs, which was likely welfare-improving.

** I guess here what they are trying to say is that because of the increase in benefits  less ppl were looking for jobs and therefore it was a more employee market forcing companies possibly to pay more to get ppl to fill positions. 

But there is a lot of problems with this analysis. For example this was not a “free market” time. Specific jobs were unavailable,  again a majority of those would have been close to the min wage, some job posting may have been holdovers from before the pandemic and just not removed. Positions possibly placed on hold.

In some cases jobs went vacant due to covid and weren't being re-hired, so the unemployment benefits aren't affecting the employment rate with jobs in that situation.

1. Ceasing an unemployment claim does not mean that the claimant is now employed.
2. Most states removed certain qualifiers or enforcement present in their unemployment system during Covid. Because of this a decrease in claims had to be expected from the get go even with no corresponding increase in the employment rate.

And we seem to be seeing that hit especially hard in the housing, energy, food, and medical areas.  We had been told the CPI increase would be around 0.5%, in June it hit 0.9% with energy seeing a 24.5% increase. And CPI up 5.4% since june of last year. 

And the trends seem to point towards a continued increase. The last time we saw an increase like this was July of 2008. Right before the economy crashed.

We all know right after that what occured. We actually saw the CPI go negative, but for good reason. Millions of middle class families lost everything and took nearly a decade for those who did recover only to find themselves in that same spot today on that ledge.

The bailouts only should have gone towards those directly impacted by covid restrictions. And PPP loans should have went directly to the worker, with the company having to pay back those loans at another date when they could afford it. 

They didnt, instead people enriched themselves and cut wages. Federally backed mortgages should have simply been extended and a pause put on payments until the economy saw a recovery. 

Instead the feds printed money like never before, and cut interests rates to the point that everyone is rich today if they are willing to take on overwhelming crippling debt tomorrow.  The only people any of this has truly benefitted are those of us in the upper income brackets, and the extremely poor. Everyone else is going to have to pay the bill with what little they have left.

For states like Michigan I think a different conclusion can be made which is ""Businesses did not lay off more workers when the unemployment insurance tax was capped"". 
Michigan lockdowns significantly decreased in June but no one returned to work. Places like McDonald's are still offering sign on bonuses and they are still raising their wages to attract more workers. Most restaurants are still closing at 10 because they can't support late night shifts. The problem is even if people are making a couple of dollars less on unemployment, they aren't going to return to work when that will result in having to pay childcare and gas. I think there are alot of factors that would effect workers willingness to work then just looking at if unemployment is offered or not.

If the hearing determines the employee did not qualify for unemployment (as per the laws of your state) the employee would then have to repay any benefits they might have received. If they don't repay, then the state can garnish future wages and tax returns.

That’s because wages are abysmally low along with many people not being able to have their kids in daycare due to the cost or availability. 

Why would someone spend 40-50 hours a week working for poverty wages just so they can turn around and give the majority of their extra income to pay for someone to watch their kids? 

Would you take a 20% cut in your pay if it meant you got an extra 40 hours a week to spend with your kids (or just use for yourself?). Any semi-intelligent person would make that trade in a heartbeat (given that they can afford the bare essentials)

Here you get pretty much 2/3 of your previous net salary plus insurance etc for a year, two if you're above 50.

If you need support after that you get a flat base support of something like 450 per month and your rent & insurance gets covered up to a certain point.

“My employer has remained open because it is essential. I’m not sick, nor is anyone in my household sick. I do not have children or care for someone who cannot care for themselves. However, I’m afraid of getting coronavirus from customers coming to the store, so I quit and filed for unemployment. Can I obtain benefits under the CARES Act?

No.”

Not sure how much clearer it can get than that. The rest of the quote explains that that isn’t qualifying and that you’d have to have specific health concerns.

h5fda8o,t1_h5f21q5,2021-07-16 18:27:02,science,"First, anecdotal evidence is relevant because we're people that speak from the experience of our lives. In my case, I have one friend that runs a small business in need of labor (and definitely representative of that job sector, locally at least), and paying/offering good wages. I have another friend with the exact job skills needed by the first, that is instead actively choosing to coast on UB as long as he can. In this case, these friends of mine are also friends, and friend B would not work for friend A (tried it in the past, but put too much strain on the friendship).

People use anecdotes to provide a relatable example for what they believe to be true. Its not scientifically statistical data, but its also not irrelevant.

Second, my issue with the overall topic is that its phrased ""UB did not reduce the employment rate"" which may be true, but its meant to *imply* ""UB did not affect the employment rate"" which is almost certainly not true.

I dont have a problem with the UB having kept so many people from struggling during the pandemic. I have good friends that survived and even thrived because of this (anecdote). My problem is simply the apparent intent of the title to mislead by sticking to a narrow interpretation of the facts, which will imply a different meaning in many people's minds.

It can be ok that people needed the UB to get through the pandemic. It can also be ok to acknowledge that people are making employment decisions based on the availability of the enhanced UB. Those statements are not mutually exclusive.

Unlike other employees who serviced the vehicles, we weren't classified as essential workers. After a few weeks of the business being closed (which only happened because the Attorney General received information the employees were not sent home as ordered in March), a young sales manager devised a system where our entire department could work from home, which we did. After two months, the owners insisted they wanted everyone to work in their building -- even though profits had increased! Several of us stood our ground, though, and said we were more than happy to work from home but would not return to the building (the law supported us). Owners were stubborn and didn't budge.

Now if you were unlucky to get fired from a job without covid being the issue, then the unemployment was a lot more strict, requiring you to actually jump through hoops, and play by the rules. The employer you were separated with had to give any yea or nay if it was covid related separation.

Like the place I was working, a dude had previously been hurt. When the furloughs started the employer gave everyone the covid yea, but stressed that you HAD to say it was covid related work furlough.

h5cfozo,t1_h5ccz8o,2021-07-16 01:19:43,science,"Most (all?) states allow you to quit your job and collect unemployment. This is because unemployment is paid out for involuntary loss of a job, whatever the cause. If your employer tells you now you're a night shift employee, the law sees this as functionally equivalent to getting fired from your day shift job and offered a night shift position, in that case saying I quit is actually just declining a different job after being fired, so you do qualify for unemployment. This happens in a lot of cases, if you are assigned a more dangerous task, if you have an hour or pay cut, or anything else that results in different responsibilities. These can typically be rebuffed by the employer by offering the old position back. There are other ones too where it might apply, like your spouse moving for a new job so you have to quit, or you having a child so you have to quit. They are not caused by your employer, but they are at least viewed as involuntary and make you eligible for unemployment.

So for anti-vax people, yea, if your job already requires that you get vaccinated (likes hospital), they can require it, and I'd you decline you get fired and can't get fired because that was already a job requirement when you were hired, but if they add it on later, that's involuntary and yea, you should be able to collect.

I will say, most big employers gain more than $15/hr in profits per employee for unskilled labor.

We'd call this a market failure because it causes an increasing disparity in wealth between the poorest and the richest. Historically, large wealth disparities have not been good.

Furthermore, it is also possible that small minimum wage increases could lead to increased employment in low-wage labor markets.

Maybe min wage could help drive the cost up across the board. Ultimately the customer has to pay more for the wages to go up.

This is exactly what happened during previous democrat administrations and those business only came back under the Trump administration when corporate tax and tariffs incentivized them to do so.  So again fewer jobs and lower wages at all levels.  Also increased prices.  Inflation is the only other solution to increased productions costs.  But you are suggesting that minimum wages are increased to match inflation creating vicious cycle of ever increasing costs.  How would you suggest dealing with these issues you are going to create under this plan?

I agree that society sort of depends on a large base of poor workers to sustain the powerful on top, but they genuinely dont benefit by those who dont work, produce, and pay taxes. They have to find less effective ways to profit off of those people - prison and military service to name a few, and these are convoluted and less efficient than just working, paying taxes, and spending income.

But yeah, they also likely dont want a bunch of CEOs, either. But i have no problem with blue collar/manufacturing jobs. Done reasonably well they are something to be proud of and should take a person through life into a comfortable retirement. 

Ultimately the problem here is that parents who cant work, or cant work as effectively/consistently, are potentially *taking*, not *producing*, and a relatively small investment would see them now able to produce, pay taxes, spend income, and more effectively raise more Americans who will do the same.

h5ds7xo,t1_h5chzj0,2021-07-16 10:40:06,science,"That depends entirely on the numbers you use actually.

Also, this is kind of an analogy. You (the burger flipper) represent the working age population for whom a minimum wage increase would be relevant (people making $50/hr aren't really going to be affected by an increase to $15/hr). The burger represents all the products of their labors. The number of burgers you can buy represents inflation.

Also also, businesses cannot just increase the price to perfectly offset the cost. They have to take into account the drop in demand that will come with price increases,  and thus price increases will never or almost never increase linearly with wage increases. For actual evidence of this, look at countries with higher minimum wages, like Denmark, where a burger flipper makes $22/hr as standard, and the burgers they make only cost about 27 cents more.

h5em153,t1_h5e2uq2,2021-07-16 15:15:07,science,"i understand what youre saying. but there is a thing that i dont think you see:
there is not a single person on unemployment that is getting rich or even putting money away. literally everything your state pumps into unemployment goes straight back into the economy by getting spent on food, absolute basic necessities and rent. often that isnt even enough. if you raise the minimum wage to something people can pay for themselves youll lower the unemployment rate to a number where your thoughtprocess might makes sense. 
the problem is that minimal wage currently isnt enough to pay for survival. not just in the us. unemployment SHOULD be a last resort, just enough to get by and not more attractive than having something to work. seeing that even boosted due to covid is barely enough but STILL better than a minimal wage job should clear the picture.
and please dont think every recipient of social support of any kind is sitting at home doing absolutely nothing 24/7.
just because one isnt trying their best to burn their physical and mental health down as quickly as possible and brags about how hard they work, doesnt make them lazy.

and of course i am being emotional. you try and not get emotional while having to explain the same thing over and over to the same kind of person… and basically always getting the same answer back: who will pay for it? me? no thanks! its my taxes and i want them to go directly into bullets, rockets, fighterjets, warships and predatordrones! making skeletons out of middle eastern children is rad!",PrvtPirate,t2_p7qok,0,0,reddit2

Yo, they specifically replied to you and told you explicitly that they were not talking about marital status.

And in your reply you said:
>The individual they responded to said single parent, so unless the child is their own parent then it’s a single parent household. “Single parent” doesn’t mean there weren’t two people part of the conception, it means the parents are divorced, separated, or were never married.

>So again, that’s not how it works.

No one was claiming anything about the number of people who conceived, nor was anyone talking about marriage, seperation, or divorce. 

FlappyCatt said, ""$15 is enough for one person to live on.""
The next person said, ""Unless you've got medical issues, or are a single parent.""

dvyfqz3,t3_85kgt6,2018-03-19 19:36:09,science,"Won't this study have an inherent confirmation bias?  In general, people who are self employed will, by definition, have sought out and succeeded in becoming self employed.  This means they desired the self directed work from the start.  The expectation is that they will then be happier doing the work they sought out.

Conversely, many of those working for an employer will not have a choice.  There are many reasons they could be in that situation, below are a few off the top of my head:

they cannot afford the instability of being self employed (family/support situations)

They do no have a marketable concept/idea

they do not have the funds to start a business.

Many of these people may be happier self employed and desire to be self employed but not have the opportunity.  OF COURSE they will be unhappy doing something they don't want to do.  As an anecdotal example, I know specific people at my job who have no desire to have influence outside of their position and would be absolutely unhappy being self employed.  They are happy to be told what to do and to do it.  I'm pretty much the opposite but I'm unwilling to take on the financial risk of starting my own business.",puterTDI,t2_4agki,5,0,reddit4

People who are self employed of course only bill for the hours they work (at least, they should).  Most jobs though have down time where the work is very relaxed or even non-existent.  Whereas if you're self employed and billing people for your work hours, you can't get paid for the time when you're just browsing reddit or youtube.

Because, if you’re not an instant success it’s really hard coming up... It takes 5 years on average to start building profit let alone gaining actual capitol than can be invested or counted as net worth. Therefore you may be happier doing what you love WHILE you do it, but when you’re finished at the end of the day and have to come home to a lesser quality of life, higher bills, less money to spend on hobbies and leisure and eating out, then that itself can make you unhappy. Even more so if you are not a success or only break even.... not every or even a majority of self employed people “make it”... 

So the stable and safe choice is obviously to be traditionally employed... we all know starting a business is a HUGE risk for the self sacrifices alone, that is all a part of being an adult and personally I find it odd that a study had to be done to tell us something that we all know on some basic level: funny how that works ",LOG1_DBM-,t2_givl3hx,1,0,reddit4

The rush you get when discovering a good design or fix is more rewarding when it's a collaboration. I'm so grateful to coworkers who have taught me new or better methods or tools, and I've honestly enjoyed sharing tricks and tribal knowledge with others. That kind of camaraderie is wonderful.

As to the downside: the energy drain of dealing with people who have obstructed and criticized for so long that they no longer recognize when they're doing it - not just good people on a bad day, but the total shits who've morphed into turf-protecting barnacles on the company - is a profound cost in energy and time. I believe many managers fail to appreciate the high cost of such dead weight - it's like injecting even your good employees with downers.

1. You have a reason to care about your work and projects again.

In my old job: it didn’t matter much if I did good work or a mediocre one. No one really cared. If I did very good, my superior got the credits. I didn’t get a bonus or raise or anything.

Now: if I work more, I’ll earn more money, if I work less I earn less. It’s in direct relation to my effort.

2. Diversity improves my skills.

Old job: mostly the same client(s). Always the same kind of tasks, always the same software.

Now: sooo much variation in projects, tasks and software. I also meet much more people as before. That’s a) very nice, and b) builds automatically a solid network.

3. My time my structure.

Old job: gotta be there at 9. Can’t leave earlier than 6ish.

Now: I can structure my days as I prefer. Not always, but often enough. I don’t have to go shopping when everyone else does. I can go to the museum or gym etc. when most people can’t. Since I’m a rather quiet (introvert-ish) person, I love that!

I was at my last company for 4.5 years, and was the only one with a full knowledge of one of the vendor systems our team was told was important. So naturally I figured that with consistently getting good performance reviews there was plenty of job security. 

Nope, my boss’s boss decided he didn’t think the system was important anymore (our clients disagree, and some have told me how awful it is to work with the company in regards to it now), and I was one of the two highest paid people on the team, so when his boss told him he had to trim down his group, guess who had to go.

It's hard finding someone who understands my work. 

I cant vent to many people, I'm not some high flying CEO, this is a small business. Also, you get asked to do favours all the time - discounts for work, rather than people wanting to give you work (maybe 10% of the time it's a positive work experience).

I will occasionally do weed to sleep or relax, MDMA to reset myself every few months, hardly touch coke... all because i was doing everything almost everyday and still working as per usual.

dvyx2r4,t3_85kgt6,2018-03-20 00:22:01,science,"Worked both self employed and as an employee. I think it depends on the person really. I did not like being self employed, mostly due to the job security part. I am not an outgoing and social type of person, so for me, getting a contract was not something I wanted to do. Having to do that regularly was not something I was looking forward to. There are is also a lot of exploitation going around in the gig economy, where these large corporations are looking for contractors only so they can get around providing benefits and other legal issues they would need to face as employees. If you are a contractor, you need to get your own insurance through the exchange, and that's usually much more expensive than employer health insurance. Then there's the lack of a 401k, so you don't end up getting a matching contribution from your employer. You need to calculate all of this into your contract fees.

I can definitely see it being rewarding, but only if you have the skills required. I feel very few do want to deal with the overhead of being not only a skilled software engineer/plumber/electrician/etc, but also a manager (of yourself), potentially an accountant, among other roles. Like others have mentioned, for this study to really be indicative, it would need to have looked at people who tried both and sided with one or the other. I'm not sure if they did, since its behind a pay wall, but based on other studies I've seen, a small percentage of people who try self-employment end up giving it up, and these people may not be well represented in this study.",RigelOrionBeta,t2_lbqo2,1,0,reddit4

A: have a nest egg, mine was in the form of a freelance job I could do after hours which gave me the financial security to leave full time work and know I didn't need another job for 3 months (worst case scenario).
Leads to B: learn how to scale, I've had months go by with only a few paid gigs, but because my rent isn't crazy and my tastes aren't expensive I can slow my spending. Then when I've been doing well I can treat myself to a something or a flight somewhere. I can turn a 1 week trip into a 2 week trip because my boss is me. Know that you can survive on the minimum and you'll value the good times even more when they role around.
C: Sell yourself but don't be arrogant. You're getting paid more to come in and do a job right. Do it half arsed and your client will notice and not have you back again. Do it to the best of your ability (and be confident in those abilities) and you'll get more work through word of mouth.
D: If you're going to work from home have a routine, fit your hours into a part of the day.
E: Don't stop improving your craft and learning new skills. You want to represent the cutting edge, not the unambitious fall-back or the adult child who thinks the rules don't apply to them.
F: Diversify, make sure you don't become dependent on one client. I've seen this screw freelancers and small businesses alike. Have some direction or you risk stagnation.
G: Go on holiday, travel, take advantage of your freedom. If you're doing all the stuff above there will be work for you when you return!",pacey-j,t2_wx28b,1,0,reddit4

1. I am not happier compared too when I used to be working for other company because the responsibilities that I carry are way bigger rather than ones I had on the company I worked for. Planing your time is not actually easier by any means. I can still get my summer vacation, but the work load that comes to me before going and after I get back from holidays is the one that should have been made in that holiday time, thus making me now enjoy my holiday at all.
2. More engaged at work, this one I have to agree with because the only way for me to keep myself self employed is if I keep myself engaged at work.
3. Earning is a factor aswell. I now earn twice as I used to, so that one counts.

Anyway I would describe also some downsides of being self employed
Not working on a team is boring the most of the times. Since I am self employed, I cant afford to rent an office so naturally my sleeping room is my office aswell.

dvzf3xr,t1_dvyc5af,2018-03-20 07:12:54,science,"There are different reasons that motivate someone to be self employed, and I personally do not find there to be a correlation between being willing to work long hours and being self employed. There is probably a correlation between occupation choices and willingness to work longer though.

I'm self employed because my mental health only lasts a few weeks in a full time employment environment. I work maybe about three hours per weekday on average (not at all some days, maybe up to six hours other days) and it pays my bills with a bit on the side to have fun. I don't work in the occupation that I love the most but rather the one that pays the most for the least amount of time spent at it. I do it to maximize the amount of time I have to do non productive things (things that aren't financially productive but maybe productive in other ways). And I'm very happy with the arrangement. It's like being semi-retired and I'm still in my 40s. I'm not rich, but I have everything I really need.

The other implied misconception is that self employed is somehow synonymous with entrepreneur. That is certainly *not* the case for me. I have had plenty of opportunities in my career to be an entrepreneur, and there is enough demand for my chosen occupation that incorporating and hiring people would certainly be successful if I were motivated to manage other people, but I am absolutely not interested in that. I like things simple and manageable, and I am strongly risk averse. I'm just lucky that my job is surprisingly stable all things considered so it is a very low risk self employment situation. I think there are lots of self employed professionals like that. They have a marketable skill and a few good clients and the ability to gain new ones in a pinch, and they're not looking for anything more than that.",domesticatedprimate,t2_7dqvk,1,0,reddit4

It’s lonely on top. People think it’s so easy to be on top when it’s actually far more stressful for the wrong kind of person. ",Supes_man,t2_x4485,1,0,reddit4

Employment is lonely to me. I am surrounded by people who I have no choice but to interact with (outside of finding a different job, of course). My coworkers are nice people, but we are ""work friends."" In other words, we aren't really friends - we don't hang out, we don't have common interests, etc.. Sure we talk at work and whatnot, but at the end of the day, they are just people caught up in a similar situation to myself. It's almost like we are friends out of necessity. 

Now, it might be wishful thinking, but I feel like if I were to be self-employed, then I could manage my time well enough that I could surround myself with the company of people that I choose. ",WillCode4Cats,t2_i62z9,23,0,reddit4

I've never worked at a normal job my whole life since my family have always been entrepreneurs, I think my parents worked a total combined of two years in their life before they started to pursue their own businesses. For me one of the biggest thing about doing your own thing is the flexibility it gives you. You can push yourself to work extra hard if you want, or if you want to take it easy, you can.


There's just so much flexibility. I started to really get into skiing a few years ago. If there's a huge storm that hits the mountain with lots of snow, I can literally just up and go for a few days, whenever I want. My other friends who are really into snowsports can only go on the weekend, or they have to request getting time off, it won't fly if you ask for time the day before you actually want it. If I want to take a two week vacation across the globe, I can. If I wanted to take a two month vacation and still work while traveling, I can make it still work. If I'm feeling lazy and I want to start work at 4pm instead of 9am, I can.

My parents are very strong on self employed.  I see a minefield full of hire, fire, and cycles of flush--dump when cheaper people come.

I feel unless the company is remarkable it's not worth it.  Furthermore, it's always always good to have a part time on your own.  If I shut down my little gig I can't invest--but if it's weekend money which pays my rent then I can continue.

I'm coming up with a business plan as we speak! Might be a year or two down the road, but it is gonna happen!

Tons of affordable marketing ideas that agencies around town (including the one I work at) are not taking advantage of. Big data, at least for what I am using it for, is cheap. More targeted advertisements to a targeted market = better conversions. Long gone are the days of just sending out mailers and waiting for the phone to ring!",Misprints,t2_137lxd,3,0,reddit4
dvyw8f1,t1_dvyqwv6,2018-03-20 00:07:45,science,"I say ""in the hole"" loosely. It's not necessarily cost of the agency but how much money I am putting aside.

It's going to be about $10K first year between mortgage/student loans/ misc. expenses.

It's going to be another $5K initially to get access to a aggregate. A cluster allows me to get instant access to insurance carriers I would not otherwise have access too.

It's also going to be AT LEAST $500/mo ($6K per year) for rent. Not ready for a mortgage yet. Probably closer to $750 per month at the location I want. Going to be doing most of my business via docusign, texting, FB messaging/Facetime, e-mail, telephone etc. Don't need anything fancy from the get go. Thing is, in order to get access to insurance carriers I HAVE to have an office or else even with access to an aggregate they won't let you do business!

Phone (VOIP) and internet, $100 per month, $1200 per year.

Software (quoting software, management software alone is ~$250, website domain registration and hosting, MS office, docusign, etc.) so I'm guessing at least $300 per month for that, or $3600 per year.

Also another $100-150/mo for E&O insurance.

I'll have to buy a laptop and other office supplies, I can probably get a lot of that stuff off of Amazon/eBay and Craigslist or going out of business sales or FB buy/sell/trades. Another $1,000

I'm also going to use another $5,000 for marketing.

I have the whole business plan expenses at home... just started working on it Friday. But the first year is going to be at least $10K to cover my personal expenses for the year and another $15-20K for the business side of things.

Of course that's not including the money I draw out of my other business to supplement my insurance agency business. I am also very blessed to have a girlfriend to understand and help me out with both side businesses to relieve some of the financial burden of the personal expenses.",Misprints,t2_137lxd,1,0,reddit4

It's a fallback if you need to go find a job working for someone and with it being a year off, it's too close to not finish. You should however be starting your business (depending on the trade) in the meantime.

My situation is a bit unique also, I've been in video production for over nine years and just didn't go out on my own. I kept lining my employers pockets. I was profitable immediately when I opened up; I had connections. Truth be told it was an easy path for me and I'm grateful for that every single day.

In my case, running the company felt like a 24/7 thing. There was always something that needed my attention, and weekends were spent catching up on the backlog of work that had piled up.  

And with 30-50 people in the payroll, the burden felt more like I was working for everyone. I felt the pressure to keep the company going and be prepared for a downturn in sales.  70-80 hours were the norm and occasionally I did sleep at the office. 

That's why when I got my weekends back, I felt free.  Going home when it's still light out was amazingly uplifting.  I hit the gym, got fit, and started dating.  It was great!

It also helped to end up working for a very well-funded company with an immense operating budget. So my worries lifted almost immediately.

In many industries if you want to set up on your own you're going to need trucks, machinery, plant, tools, equipment, employees, etc. 

That can be a significant capital outlay, and if the whole thing goes tits-up there's a good possibility you'll lose the lot.  Once you're invested to that extent simply 'walking away' isn't really an option. Doubly so if you've taken on employees who are now reliant on business remaining viable in order to put food on their familes table.

Many people are naturally risk averse and would much rather someone else take those risks so they can just sell them their time as an employee (for often a tiny percentage of the overall profit).

So long as they understand that's the trade-off they're making all is well.

Typically an account (in Florida) is $85/mo for every week service (usually 1 scheduled week off for Christmas/New Year’s, and then if it falls on a major holiday like Thanksgiving or 4^th of July), some big pools are gonna be like $100, then he also does $45 for 2x a month for people that don’t/can’t shell out more.   
  
Expenses (chemicals, replacement of pools/brushes/nets, etc.) come out to $15K-$20K per year.  
  
He doesn’t have any workers nor does repairs (anymore), cause then he could make bank.  
  
____  
A lot of unnecessary info:  
    
I grew up in Honolulu, and my Cub Scout leader invited the group over for Super Bowl (like 2002 or something). Now, being Hawai`i, it’s expensive (my uncle just got  “cheap” 2bd townhouse, built in the 80’s, non renovated, in a decent area, for $555K), so his home probably was $3M+. He had a huge, nice pool, and had a living room projector that came out of the wall and a projected probably the first HD image I ever saw. Turned out he ran a pool company that was residential and commercial, and had a handful of workers and did repairs.  
  
My dad’s side of the family (some cousins too) moved to Hawai`i like 40 years ago and his dad and uncle started selling Kirby vacuums (insane beasts that can cost >$1000, search your local Craigslist), owner by Warren Buffet. Both ran their division and were more than well off doing it (won all the the dozen or so awards possible for sale number, as it’s Hawaii where people have money). By well off, I mean they also own properties and my uncle once ordered a $5K wood+marble bed frame from Italy and gifted it to my parents because it couldn’t fit in his home, he has another company now, and he also does something with bringing entertainers to perform large venue gigs, like singers, comics, and even Mike Tyson; he also plays the stock market, and has like >100 shares in Apple. Both got all upper level Mercedes. My dad and his parents lived in the Marco Polo, you may have seen the news article about it catching on fire a few months back, decently expensive, a basic unit was like $500K like 10 years ago.    
  
But, even though they earned enough to never have to worry about money, they still didn’t earn as much as my scout leader.   
  
Also, as Chris Pratt and a John Bishop will tell you, [it’s not easy getting good workers to do door-to-door sales](https://youtu.be/S7zk-u31oKE).  
  
But yeah, my dad switch to pools. Then, his cousin (who did real estate) switch to pools, his two good friends from high school (one worked with him Kirby and the other worked for AAA and still does part time cause he likes helping people) switched, and his other old friend who moved to California also switched (managed restaurants and opened a surfboard shop).  
  
So yeah, needless to say it’s a very cushy gig.   
  
Only real downsides are acquiring accounts (people starting off usually buy them from a retiring pool man, usually 8mo-1yr’s worth of payment per account, so it’s pricy; my dad befriended a pool builder/renovator, and also gets referrals from some consumer pool supply stores, so he has no issues with that), the other is the billing and getting people to pay (95% of everyone pays, 4% fall back a few months, so it’s only a handful of accounts that he has to dump overtime). Just being physically able is another thing, it’s nowhere as hard as roofing, but you are in the sun most of the day. Oh, and my dad recently hurt his back/ribs riding ATV’s, so he had to work through that.",homeboi808,t2_7mcc7,4,0,reddit4

I replied to someone else with a backstory, but my Cub Scout leader owned a residential+commercial pool maintance company, so he let my dad tag along with him to learn the ropes (mainly the equipment end of things; knowing how much chlorine, acid, etc. is easy stuff; as well as some tips, like squirting watered down liquid dish soap acts like olive oil and vinegar, making all surface dirt move towards the edge, for easy cleaning).",homeboi808,t2_7mcc7,1,0,reddit4

But I eventually want to specialize in the preferred personal lines market, IE, insureds with good credit scores and clean claims history. 

My other target market will be small to medium business owners. A lot of these $1MM revenue businesses easily have $10K insurance premiums but are most likely going to a generalist. What if there was an agent that above all else focused on 50 or so businesses with premiums of $10K-100K? These 50 businesses are the types of people that would have my personal cell phone number and would be the core of my book of business.

I also own (mycounty)Quotes.com which will be a simple questionnaire on what type of insurance you are looking for, and the best way to communicate with you (phone, email, text, FB messenger, Skype/FB messenger video) and time. I think if you put the ball in the prospects court, they are more likely to give their info. It will also be advertised locally obviously in (mycounty) and target the aforementioned preferred personal lines/small and medium businesses.

Welders and other trades are also harder to hire because less high school grads are going into trades schools and going to college because they were told that's the only way to succeed nowadays.

There are Pros and Cons, but mostly Pros.

For one, it can feel better to clients, because they can't question if you're ""really working"" for those hours, or whatever other stupid things they may come up with for billing.  Also it means they know exactly what it will cost up-front -- and either agree to it [in writing] or you get to have your arguments and/or decide to not work with them *before* you start doing work on the project.

The only real downside is that if you have an obnoxious client that keeps asking for things under the original contract.  For that it's good to have some kind of ""initial money gets X; if you want more, you need to pay more.""  Concrete goalposts that can't be moved on you.",zebediah49,t2_bxx3a,28,0,reddit4

But as another person said before - unskilled trade jobs like this tend to attract a lot of riff raff. I've interviewed guys who were clearly stoned, can't spell their own name properly on their resume (a clear sign they lack attention to detail) and blokes with AVO's on them etc. I employed one guy who I sacked on the first day because he turned up smelling of beer and was still drunk from the night before. 

I get plenty of clean cut applicants too but they're seeing the pay and benefits and don't consider the type of work they're getting into and more often than not, it turns out they don't like the job. For the inexperienced I offer a 3 month trial at $20 p/hr where they ride with me instead of getting the car so I can teach them. If they learn quick and want to stick around I'll boost their pay and give them the car and assign them their own work orders. Unfortunately none of those people have stuck around long enough for the car. 

I had one promising young fella who didn't have his own transport but was licensed. So I let him use the car to get to and from work etc.  He looked like he was going to work out and then all of a sudden after about 2 months he handed the car keys back and said he'd gotten offered a factory job from a mate paying $16 an hour.

I'm going to cheat and group them so I can get my strobes and light stands in 1.   :)  Also, I don't know if you're a fellow pro or a budding portrait photog.  So I'll answer in the middle but please ask about anything you don't understand if I've over shot.

1. 3 studio strobes - I like the Profoto D1 Air.  They're not fancy but they work EVERY time.  That's important when working with clients who value their time in the thousands per hour.   And the Air radio trigger allows me to dial in the light from the trigger but I'm usually close enough to just do it manually on the light.  I use one for my main, one for my fill, and 1 for my backdrop.

2. Backdrop stands with 5' thunder grey seamless paper.  I like seamless because it's totally smooth.  And I like grey because almost everyone looks good on it.  I can push it near black or lighten it depending on how much I light it.

3. 5 in 1 reflector disc on a stand.  It's good to bounce light where I need it or even block the sun coming through an ill positioned window.

4. Light meter.  I rarely use it to actually meter the light.  But when I hold it near a client's face, fire my strobes, and walk over to my lights and pretend to adjust something, they know they've hired a professional.  I'm not kidding.

5. My sense of humor.  I can make the most awful person look amazing after talking with them for 3 minutes which I start doing the second they walk through the door.  If my subject feels great they'll look great.  I'm exude a ton of confidence and, like above, the person relaxes because they know they are in good hands.

Edit: Crap!  I forgot something so now I really have to cheat and do 6.  Sigh.  :)  6. Brolly boxes.  I also use soft boxes but the majority of my work is mobile and quick setup is important.  Brolly boxes go up in like 45 seconds.  And a little light spill is usually OK for most of my work. ",fTwoEight,t2_he1l6,1,0,reddit4

We spend billions and billions of dollars trying to abate the current problems using only the demand side of the equation. What would happen if we applied the same amount of effort and money facing this economic problem using the supply side of the formula.

There have been fewer if any studies or programs to consider increasing the supply of doctors, and nurses and other than efforts with AI I fail to see how we are progressing towards efficiency in the healthcare supply side of the equation , focusing rather on patients and their needs , rather than the societally economic need to create more scientists of the body.",guerochuleta,t2_di3ff,1,0,reddit2

For example, while I'm off the suboxone now, I still am a patient because the doctor there said something about how many adults with adhd or depression and so on self medicate. So he gave me a little questionnaire after that meeting and then said I have adhd and before I could finish asking how to go about starting a new doctor for that purpose with my history he said he had sent the prescription for adderall in. I was told about 20% of the others are in a similar situation. There's the very rare few on benzos and suboxone too from what some have shared.

Point being, they it plays a part in the addiction issues anyway and some places will link it and cover various medications and whatever if they can prescribe and it's still covered.

Hopefully that will help bring the stigma down to almost zero. 

Personality disorders(such as Borderline Personality Disorder) use to be thought to be just that, your personality. As we've done more research we've begun to show the many flaws of this theory.

I had one doctor explain to me that it is ridiculous the abuse of ADHD medication right now and he said (at least in his area/state or whatever) that the level of ADHD medication abuse was currently worse then opioids and drugs like Xanax etc. He said that is why so many doctors shut it down if you try to mention a concern of having ADHD etc, especially if you are already older and never had any prior diagnosis of ADHD from childhood, etc. If you have any medical records from within the years to request and take with you, that at least can show a lot of doctors that you are serious and with a serious diagnosis and that you have a track record of constantly checking in with the doctor and not constantly having your doses boosted, etc. But if you’ve never been diagnosed and you’re an adult then hopefully you have a PCP doctor that you’ve been with for a while and have established a relationship who will at least be willing listen to you and recommend you to a Psychiatrist for further evaluation. It’s weird, because according to doctors and reports and claims, so many people have or believe they have ADHD and thus the increase of the use and abuse of these medications, but then lot of reports and such claim that the ADHD symptoms that so many claim today are a side effect of technology and the internet and something always grabbing our attention and being able to bounce around so much that those of us that grew up with the internet etc almost had it “trained” into us to not be able to pay attention etc. Who knows.

Often, these mandated prices are so low that they are a net loss for the doctors' office (after paying nurses, secretaries, office rent, etc).

Medicaid is entirely voluntary, so if the rates are a net loss, many doctors' offices simply refuse to participate in the program. 

As a side note, this is also why many reasonable people are hesitant about single-payer. The US government already has a track record of simply refusing to pay market rates - as proven by the fact that doctors often simply refuse to do the work for that rate.

f2ld00f,t1_f2kcm4q,2019-10-05 16:43:51,science,"There are a few reasons people are opposed to things like Medicare for all:

-Any increase in the social safety net shifts power away from employers to employees, which means employers either have to treat their employees like people or else pay them more, and the latter costs customers money. 

-There is a belief among many that the government can’t do anything right, that it is slow, inefficient, and full of people who are greedy, lazy, incompetent, and who can’t be easily fired (and not just in congress!) and one with this belief would further believe that anything the private sector can do, the public sector shouldn’t. 

-The government providing services costs money, and while it generally only does so for things that either the private sector can’t or won’t do (e.g., military, servicing the poor, etc.), people are rightly wary of where their tax dollars go. There is a logical fallacy that people seem to look at a potential tax increase without looking at what is saved by not spending on private insurance (with further complications like employers subsidizing health insurance so that employees are oblivious to the true costs, although it isn’t clear that employers would provide other compensation if they were no longer subsidizing private insurance)

-There is a pervasive belief that the world unfolds according to God’s plan, that successful people are good, smart, and hard working, while the poor are dumb, bad, or lazy, and that both groups are deserving of their lot in life. Any evidence to the contrary is dismissed as god working in mysterious ways. Because of this, redistributive policies are seen as an immoral theft from the good to benefit the undeserving.


So to these people, Medicare for all is robbing deserving to help the undeserving, increasing taxes and the size of an incompetent government, giving people the lazy more freedom to leach off the work of other, increasing prices, and who knows what else. 

These are not terribly good arguments, and there are not only direct counter arguments but also convincing arguments that even if all of these things were true, this (and other social programs, even expensive ones) are still worthwhile not just for the people they help, not just for society at large, but even for the people at the top who pay more and don’t get a direct benefit.

An example  is water. If you have anything for living expenses related  to  housing, you pay for everyone near you having 
clean and safe municipal water. And even if you have well water someone had to pay some cost to have the well dug and maintained.

Clean air isn't free either. No one tells you that you have to pay for it, but everyone understands the costs. Here's an example, if you live next to a steel mill your house and lungs will most definitely suffer. So if your poor and live next to a dirty plant and can't afford to move then you can't  afford clean air. And if you say 'Tell the government' they know. Most larger steel mills have an onsite EPA and OSHA office that is staffed and used regularly.

f2oairj,t1_f2npx1a,2019-10-06 01:27:11,science,"Funny you should ask.

Here is what happened (while the figures I'm using may not be exact, the concept is):

With the Medicaid Expansion under Obamacare, the income level needed to apply for Medicaid was raised from 100% poverty level to 133%. Thus, if you made over the 133% poverty level, you were eligible for Obamacare subsidies, meaning that some or all of your insurance would be paid by the Federal government. The higher your income, the fewer subsidies you would receive and the more of your insurance bill you would pay yourself.

Well, Republican-controlled states were allowed to refuse the Medicaid Expansion by the Republican-controlled Supreme Court for purely political reasons, not the financial reasons claimed by Republican Governors because the Medicaid Expansion had the Federal government paying 100% of the extra costs for the first couple years then 90% after that and the only thing the states had to do was spend a little bit more money in administrative costs.

So the poverty level for Medicaid remained at 100% in those states.

However, the Republican-controlled Congress never went back to fix Obamacare levels, which means that Obamacare subsidies still only kick in for those above the 133% poverty level.

This means if your income puts you anywhere from 101-132% of the poverty level, you get ZERO help with insurance. You make too much money for Medicaid and not enough for Obamacare subsidies.

All because of Republican evil.",evilkumquat,t2_27ywmr2,1,0,reddit2

The wait times aren’t bad at all in psych when you are paying as much as I do. The doctor and her team that I go to bend over backwards for me, but I do pay for that. I have noticed in an increase in psychiatrists that specialize in adult adhd and it’s gotta be a sweet gig.

I think people are just afraid of it getting worse so they're reluctant to embrace a wholly different system. There is so much propaganda about how if it's government-related it will necessarily mean longer, waits, more red tape, uncaring bureaucrats, etc, but those impressions are reinforced by movie stereotypes and politicians who use that for their own purposes. Sure, it happens, but it's not like capitalistic companies all put much into customer service. (Many do, but you can't count on that.) But with catastrophic medical bills being the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy, I can't imagine there aren't millions of families out there wishing for a better, simpler, fairer system. The whole idea of insurance was supposed to be that we share risks so reduce the costs to everyone. The more people in the pool, the better it works. One bureaucracy and billing department instead of dozens or hundreds of different ones means one set of rules. And there would definitely be a need for ombudsmen and people in the system dedicated to improvement and increased efficiency. Insurance companies squeeze out every last dollar so their CEOS can take home tens of millions of dollars. That money is being taken from Average Joe and Judy. I'd rather see Joe and Judy get the benefits of increased efficiency, not execs who get their ""efficiency"" by denying claims and using a business model that makes it so difficult to dispute claims that most people give up or don't even realize they've been screwed.",thisisjaytee3,t2_gl6uf,2,0,reddit2

Sure single payer is ""free"" but you pay for it in income tax withholdings and your employer matches the same amount.  I believe it is somewhere between 10-12% on both ends in Canada.

Liberals and conservatives have a number of root values on each side of a spectrum that account for their feelings on most issues, and I’m elucidating one of those values: personal responsibility versus fairness. 

In this debate, liberals are fighting for fairness when they want to expand Medicare to all (or whatever they call the expansion of health benefits). No matter how you slice it, though, this expansion WILL cost taxpayers more money, which is where conservatives’ instinct towards personal responsibility kicks in. They think that people aren’t taking enough personal responsibility in providing themselves with healthcare. 

I understand there are lots of data on either side of the argument and efficiencies in the healthcare system that could lower costs for all, and I understand that not everyone starts with equal opportunity to access healthcare which is why the system exists in the first place...all I’m trying to explain is that that is the moral root of conservatives’ argument.

Conservatives DO NOT REJECT medicaid.  Again, it's a spectrum.  Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, which is why they are skeptical when expansions of medicaid are put on the table.  No one wants to go back to living in caves, that's just a stupid comment frankly.  It's an argument of how much we should expand medicaid.  I bet liberals would be much more careful with their calls for medicaid expansion if they were the ones who had to pay for it, but instead they just say to tax the rich, absolving them of any dog in the pony (not all of the time, but that's the narrative among current candidates).

Your comment is the problem with US politics today.  Neither side is stupid, it's just a matter of values.  Conservatives value fairness less than do liberals, which is why they don't automatically jump to the side of taxing the rich to pay for an expansion of medicaid.

1. Those ridiculous prices you keep talking about? Those are inflated by WAY too much, it's almost criminal. Bulk billing would ensure that the prices of medical things are kept reasonable.

2. What about the big procedures? Those would be covered under health insurance. Just because bulk billing exists, doesn't mean it can cover everything. But small things, like visits to the GP? That would be covered under bulk billing?

3. What even is bulk billing? It's essentially an additional tax, just a few dollars, that splits the medical bill for common things, e.g. a GP visit, between the entire country. Which, essentially makes it free for those without insurance. If you do have insurance, you still need to present it and they can cover the things they cover. But it has major benefits for those without insurance.

4. Who even has bulk billing? You would be surprised how many countries have it. Finland and Australia are just two of many.

Those are just the main points, any more questions, I probably won't be able to answer because I'm not an expert.

Examples of frequently employed roadblocks are:

Last minute changes to voting areas

Voter eligibility purges

Not enough voting booths resulting in extremely long lines

Straight up closing or moving voting areas out of low income neighborhoods requiring sometimes significant travel time to reach the nearest booth

I think the other big impact was that ACA stopped them from using many of the signals that they had been using to assign risk and price policies and forced pricing to just depend on age and zip or something. That might have triggered some people who were getting lower than average rates to come up and higher than average to come down.

There was also, independent of the ACA, a long term trend of health care costs rising at like 10-15% y/y ...

(I.e. if you were given an aspirin, make sure it made it to your bill, but also make sure it was recorded so that they didn't double deliver etc)

I don't know what was driving the rising costs to the hospital most. I do know, around the same time, there were tons of stories in the local press about the costs of malpractice insurance for doctors. Apparently the price of a policy for an OB was around $140k/year. If the doc is paying $700/day for the insurance just to be able to work, you can bet they're charging enough to make it worth it.",cballowe,t2_87ah,2,0,reddit2

Only Bernie Sanders has repeatedly insisted on a government monopoly to care. Warren has not committed to any specific policy proposal, Harris has embraced everything at various times and walked it back. Buttigieg, Biden, and others have proposed a public option. A public option is essentially establishes a baseline insurance plan, something private insurance needs to beat either with services not covered or a better network of healthcare providers. They have sometimes termed this “Medicare for all who want it”, or “improving the ACA” or whatever. 

ACA was supposed to include this public option, but it was removed because Joe Lieberman threw a one man filibuster to block it. The consequence is there isn’t a not-for-profit, public insurance plan available to all to establish any kind of anchor relative to what the more higher end, premium plans should charge. This public plan would also draw the sickest people, who need the most care, leaving private plans with fewer expenses. Private insurance does not want chronically sick people. They are expenses. But the public option was removed and instead anyone who makes more than poverty level is tossed into this marketplace.

It is expected by many that many Doctors will not take patients using the public option plan, as they do now with Medicaid, because the compensation prices are well below private insurance. If they competed with private insurance for paying providers, the program would be far more expensive and (rightly) criticized as a waste of tax dollars.

You immediately doubted my actual paper that had actual data of merely comparing reimbursement rates

Furthermore, even if you read your article it says some stand to lose up to 40% by some estimates. It also says the physician who estimated 16% said it would have disastrous results and ""I have no time for all the politicians who use the health care system as a crash-test dummy for their election goals,”. Maybe you didn't actually read it, but even that generous estimate would have catastrophic results

So yeah, at the bare minimum, using a bunch of assumptions I doubt come true, the minimum they lose is 16% which will result in many going out of business. You're also not considering many physicians, even that work in hospitals, are private contractors and not employees of the hospital. Surgeons, anesthesia, er, radiology, cardiology, gi, and their nurses etc. Are usually private contractors which your article does not mention, but my paper does when it talks about actual reimbursement

f30qw9e,t1_f2zpe8h,2019-10-08 18:47:14,science,"Your original paper (the CBO study sourced by the article) said that some procedures are about 150-300% higher than Medicare, particularly brain/abdominal MRIs, knee arthroscopy, and radiation therapy. The same paper said that some services, including the usual pedestrian patient visit, are roughly the same. It also said that the prices of service varies due to factors such as industry consolidation.  
&nbsp;  
Many of these rates that are picked are set by hospitals, not private practice, and I do know that hospitals charge private insurance a hell of a lot more than they do Medicare.  For example, the ER can't turn anyone way, regardless of ability to pay. This means a lot of money spent on people who won't be able to pay it back, which means lost money, the hospital surcharging the private insurance industry to recoup losses and the patient possibly filing for medical bankruptcy. Everybody loses. Under M4A, these people who are skipping the bill are reimbursed by Medicare, and they may not have such a severe emergency if found and treated earlier. These losses are no longer driving up the prices the hospitals charge to everybody else (e.g. private insurers.)   
&nbsp;  
Fiscally, insurance is a concept where a monopoly is beneficial. The point of insurance is to spread risk around a large pool of people. The people in the pool are, essentially, the product. The rates for each individual are less for each healthy member of the pool contributing payments but not making claims for service. This is why there's so many concerns about ""death spirals"" surrounding the mandate of ACA; an insurance pool dominated by people who need expensive care will have skyrocketing costs.  
&nbsp;  
We are basically left with two choices to solve our current dilemma of hospitals treating people who can't afford to pay: let ERs deny service and people die from preventable illness due to lack of money, or extending coverage to everyone. Most polling shows much larger support for the latter. If we're going to extend coverage to everyone, the most efficient insurance pool *is everyone*. Most of the population is healthy and not drawing a lot from the insurance pool. Most people are contributors. Having multiple pools just leads down a road for healthy people to make exclusive pools for themselves, as we saw before ACA, and having multiple pools regulated to not exclude anyone just causes outrage over increased costs, as we saw with the market after ACA.    
&nbsp;    
The most effective solution is to simply end the market. Health insurance is not a concept that is compatible with free market ideology, because free markets only get in the way when something is mandatory like healthcare. Property insurance remains competitive because there's an alternative to being insured. You could just risk your house burning down and save money on payments. Car insurance is often mandatory with driving, but you can opt not to drive. There really isn't any good structure for allowing anyone to opt out of health insurance. If you have a body and are alive, you need coverage, because anyone of any means can get cancer and society is unwilling to let people die for lack of funds.",FullMotionVideo,t2_rtsc4,1,0,reddit2
f30swzx,t1_f30qw9e,2019-10-08 19:09:01,science,"Ok your completely wrong with how it works

> Many of these rates that are picked are set by hospitals, not private practice, and I do know that hospitals charge private insurance a hell of a lot more than they do Medicare.

This is not true at all. The way it works is a physician sets certain codes that they bill for, either procedures or diagnosis and then send it to the insurance company who pays a certain rate. Medicare is the same way. The hospital can charge whatever it wants but what it receives it what the insurance or Medicare pays for that code which changes over time but is pretty set

You're completely incorrect on this likely because you've never been involved in hospital billing

In regards to ER, you are referring to EMTALA. If the person does not have insurance and does not pay this comes out of charity care which basically means is tax deductible. They do not make money on these though and make the money back through people paying with insurance and tax write-offs. 

If you have insurance you essentially are already subsidizing medical care for people who don't pay or people who have Medicare and Medicaid

Insurance is not a method that is better as a monopoly. No business is better as a monopoly. It is the insurance companies job to appropriately rate risk. The better job they do of this, the more accurately they can book people for services and have enough money to pay people out. If they do this incorrectly either they charge people too much and people go elsewhere or they run out of money and go bankrupt. If it is government run, there is no incentive to reach this balance. That is why the amount needed always goes up and Medicare expenditures will continue to rise. There is also no competition to go to so if people start paying more, there is no alternative. It's hidden through taxes though, so what really winds up happening is there programs start going bankrupt and middle and lower class taxes are raised. See Portugual, Sweden, pretty much any country will always say ""NHS or Medicare or whatever is underfunded""

You are grossly mistaken in thinking that a monopoly of a business helps anyone but those in the monopoly. In this case, it helps the people who run Medicare

What you're describing with EMTALA is not insurance, it's charity. It's also a very small portion of actual expenditures. Which is fine but there are alternatives to this that don't involve creating a mandatory monopoly of the insurance system


So, for people without any income, we could create a service like Medicare that aids people. We could call it Medicaid

Ending the market is the dumbest solution possible unless you want to exponentially increase the cost of healthcare

Also, I like how you've just given up arguing that Medicare reimburses the same because you realize you're way off. It actually does reimburse 40-60% less depending on the state. Medicare for all would lead to less Heath care for all and more expensive at the same time

It's definitely dangerous that you don't even understand how the current system works but you know how it should be fixed so you go to ""www.imright.com"" to look for things that already reaffirm what you wanted affirmed when you don't really understand the way it works and it's problems.

Abstract

The pursuit of passion in one’s work is touted in contemporary discourse. Although passion may indeed be beneficial in many ways, we suggest that the modern cultural emphasis may also serve to facilitate the legitimization of unfair and demeaning management practices—a phenomenon we term the legitimization of passion exploitation. Across 7 studies and a meta-analysis, we show that people do in fact deem poor worker treatment (e.g., asking employees to do demeaning tasks that are irrelevant to their job description, asking employees to work extra hours without pay) as more legitimate when workers are presumed to be “passionate” about their work. Of importance, we demonstrate 2 mediating mechanisms by which this process of legitimization occurs: (a) assumptions that passionate workers would have volunteered for this work if given the chance (Studies 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8), and (b) beliefs that, for passionate workers, work itself is its own reward (Studies 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8). We also find support for the reverse direction of the legitimization process, in which people attribute passion to an exploited (vs. nonexploited) worker (Study 7). Finally, and consistent with the notion that this process is connected to justice motives, a test of moderated mediation shows this is most pronounced for participants high in belief in a just world (Study 8). Taken together, these studies suggest that although passion may seem like a positive attribute to assume in others, it can also license poor and exploitative worker treatment.",mvea,t2_6hji,30,0,reddit3

enhw5cx,t1_enh4mv8,2019-05-14 18:19:46,science,"It's very true in the PhD system, unfortunately. But that is also somewhat biased; to go after a PhD in anything and dedicate 5+ years of your life to a small set of questions, you have to have some passion for that. 

In this case, the devil is in the details. When compared to their peers, individuals who are exploited can be seen as more enthusiastic, passionate, or ""go-getters"". Speaking as someone near the end of this path, I feel like I've found just how rampant this sort of scenario is in the PhD field, both from internal and external sources. Personally, while I have an excellent advisor, I feel that my own studies have been exploited and it just seems like this is something that is very easy to do in academia. It has left me unmotivated to the point where I can't see myself taking another job in the field, despite the interest.

I guess I just want to take the moment to highlight a notion: It is a true privilege to be able to go after a graduate degree, and to additionally have people pay you to explore your ideas; but this can come at a high cost for the student. Whether you are in a grad school program or know someone who is, it is important to keep in mind that this is a population that is at risk for a lot of abuse / exploitation; they need protection and support! 


If anyone wants to talk about it more, I am happy to, although I may be somewhat slow in getting back to you at the moment. But for those interested in the mental health crisis that is affecting grad students, here is a good article that sums up a lot of it: [The Emotional Toll of Graduate School](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/) In particular, the passage 

>Even for students who are lucky enough to produce results, frustratingly, individual professors have their own standards for what constitutes “enough research” to graduate. Is it four first-author research articles? What about one review paper and a few conference presentations? The answers you hear will vary widely, and ultimately, a student’s supervising professor usually has sole power in determining when a student graduates. At best, this creates a confusing system where students perform substantially different amounts of work for the same degree. At worst, it fosters a perverse power dynamic where students feel powerless to speak out against professors who create toxic working conditions, even resulting in cases of sexual exploitation.

is something particularly relevant that I talk about with others. In my case, the student before me had 1 paper in the process of being published, got their PhD, and is currently revising a 2nd related to the work. The impact factors were average (I only say this since 1 Nature paper could have the work of 2-3 other papers, etc). I am at 5 papers / reviews, and require a 6th to graduate. The current grad school system needs substantial overhaul, and, to get back to your point, it seems like those who become competent in that high stress environment and who are lucky enough to generate interesting results can easily get shouldered with more, as that feeds the grant cycle system.

For other articles as well, people can google something like ""Nature grad school""; they frequently have articles which discuss the issues that are affecting grad students.",I_just_made,t2_iy73q,178,0,reddit3

engxko7,t1_engev55,2019-05-14 14:08:57,science,"Some people are perfectly content being in the same career for life. Back in the 90s I worked at a large company that does credit checks, guess one of the 3 names. Anyhow I was running a small support desk and hired a guy named Don. I was a young buck and he was 10 years my senior but he was a good guy and did excellent work. 

Fast forward to 2014, and I've been to 70 countries by now, lived in 4 different ones, and run a global sales division for a major IT firm. There is a sales opportunity at this company I haven't stepped foot inside since around 1996. I'm pretty excited just to walk back into a place that in reality helped form the career I have and set my base so I could launch.

I'm walking to the CIOs office on the IT floor and look at that, it's Don sitting in a cube. I backtrack as soon as I see the name and say ""Don?? Wow dude! It's been awhile."" Don was doing the exact same job I hired him to do in 1994. Twenty years of sitting in a cubicle making Windows accounts and managing emails and backups. Hey, whatever. He's a worker bee. Not everyone can be the queen bee and many have no desire to do so.

I've had a salary since I was 22 so hourly isn't a thing I understand much and now that I'm in my 40s I'm out of touch completely. However, working my ass off has paid large dividends and at that company I would come in at 3am when no else wanted to and do software loads and updates so the business could hum by 8am. I was the guy the CIO at the time called to fix his email, his PC, pick out his son's laptop, and the guy the director counted on to run this 25 person org as a 22 year old.

Now I'm semi-retired and fart around on some conference calls. I'm not done yet. There is hunger there still even though I could sit on my ass and Reddit all day every day or go fishing. Nope. I have a really good opportunity coming up that I think I'll take to run a global business channel, the hunger never stops. It's why Warren Buffet is still doing his thing. My good friend owns a restaurant, the guy was CEO of two major companies, and he still can't sit down and rest. 

You either have this or you don't and I can't explain it. People who give the most ARE promoted because they're the hungry ones who fight to get it and it's not even always about being on top. I don't want to be on top, but I absolutely want to create something huge, own something great, and build a stellar business. 

It's not even about the money and people might be surprised by that but the money is a trailer. If you do everything you need to do to make the business the best business it can be the money will absolutely follow.",xynix_ie,t2_8m8rm,44,0,reddit3

several years ago I worked at a place that forced employees to do extra hard work as a condition for continued employment, because they were ""downsizing""  The losers didn't offer any kind of severance deal.  I signed up to do technical support. I ended up doing customer service, billing, sales, and technical support, just to keep my job!   I fooled myself into thinking they would pull themselves out of the rut they were in.  I thought I could somehow switch into another IT dept within the company.

Looking back, I regret working there!  Some of the work was actually demeaning.  I accepted the job because I was sick of unemployment and the company seemed solvent at that time, on an upward spiral.  Long story short: the CEO left a year after me.

To be fair, this and associated abuse/exploitation can and does vary greatly. 

My graduate program is mostly filled with grouchy older guys who are willing to work for and towards given goals, but wont take abuse from anyone. which being said for us I think the median Masters student age is around 32-35 and phd candidates are 40 somethings... most are old army guys too who are out to get the doctorates for purely career needs related things and not necessarily willing, nor able to deal with nonsense of any sort. Hell, this bit may also tie in to where the money for said education comes from and how desperate a program is to keep certain populations in the system.(Gibill funds and all)

And ironically, I'm pretty sure I a have been experiencing the target end of that assumption for the last few years at my job.

And the reasons I put up with it include good pay, high job security, and even better prospects in the event the company grows as fast as it seems likely to. I like my job but I'm not passionate about it (although sometimes for certain elements, sure).  


And yet people still mention my long hours as if they are personal choice. They are not per se; only my tolerance of them is, for the time being. If I had a normal amount of work assigned, I would work normal hours. But because I have so much assigned, and so much of it is stuff that a) only I in the company can do currently, and b) stuff that is on a short deadline, it's not practical to neglect it.

It’s cool that you know who you are and actually live it. I have that hunger as well, but it just happens to be in areas that have nothing to do with business or making money, at least not directly 🤣. So for me, and Don I assume, working extra hours and seeking promotions isn’t profitable (in a quality of life sense) and actually hinders me in my passions. It’s hard for me to explain to people that I’ve got a good job already, I’m paid well enough for my lifestyle, and have no financial worries, so I just don’t desire a bigger work load at all. I’m responsibly funding my personal passions and while I’m at work, I do my job well. Ahh perfect, that’s the end of that transaction for me. But don’t you want to grow?! Go to more meetings?! Have more responsibility?! No because I’m excited about a personal project or pursuit I have going on at home! I want to hang with my wife and dogs! Ahhh perfect.

You articulated something that many people don’t understand, because it is counterintuitive unless someone explicitly teaches you the concept. It’s a wisdom that allows you to appreciate Don even though he doesn’t seem as successful in the conventional sense. You said it’s not about the money, money is a trailer. Yes! You pursued a path that was true to you and you did it with passion and self honesty! That in itself is the goal, don’t you think? Material rewards did follow, but those were just secondary. Your path just happened to be materially profitable in this time and place, but that’s only a cherry on top because your joy comes from how you are living. And Don is doing the same thing but in his way! Our culture desires those secondary trappings and make them the goal, which makes people miserable.

There's a vast spectrum of people in between and beyond these two types who have varying levels of motivation and passion about their work. Everyone has different goals and a different work ethic, and all of that is beside the point.

The underlying issue here is compensation, not ambition. Self-improvement, career advancement, or even just enjoying what you do are actually pretty decent compensation (at least in my view).

At the moment I'm working extra hours because I indeed don't want to get fired, but I'm also doing it to make sure I get the experience I need to qualify for my visa (this right here is a whole new world of being taken advantage of) or I would leave at the end of my shift.

After multiple warnings and one being put on probation they both got fed up and quit leaving me alone in a terrible situation so I'm looking for a new job too. 

All I've noticed is that it makes the management more likely to dump work on you, it doesn't actually help you get ahead at work you'll just be labelled as the guy who works really hard but will never get promoted. I've had other jobs where I did stay to make sure things got done properly and I was definitely compensated/rewarded for it but that is rare.

I've been told that I'm good at my job - though, I would think otherwise - and am completely content with staying in this position for X amount of years or until I get the boot.

The environment I'm in makes it tough to make it balanced because most of my other colleagues love to work 10+ hour days and weekends while I would much rather clock out at 5 oclock.

I can work really long hours but they're not bad hours. Just last week I flew to Vegas which I'm not a fan of because I don't gamble and don't go to strip clubs but I had an interview with a couple VPs for this possible job I might take.

I fly first class as the upgrade was almost nothing compared to the ticket price. Get on the plane from this paradise I live in, sit down, and get a Chardonnay. The guy sitting next to me in 2C and I chatted for awhile and I watched a movie and read some. Land in Atlanta to connect, meander to the gate while stopping off to get a meal at TGI Fs. Board the next plane and spend 4 or so hours in first class sipping wine and watching movies and reading. Landed in Vegas and got an uber, checked into the hotel and met a few old friends downstairs at the Venetian. We drank until god knows how long, probably midnight. I'm old now, 2am doesn't work for me haha. Wake up and go meet these guys I'm talking to for this job, and then I go back to my hotel room at 5 and lay in bed and read and watch movies. I wasn't up for a night of partying or whatever. It was a nice couple days. 

This is my life now. I did all the work to get here and now what I do is hop on a plane and take people to dinner and then sit in my hotel room and read books. It's a great life and people pay me assloads of money to do this. It took work to get here though, a lot of work, and a marriage burned. The ex couldn't handle my travel, my wife now met me when I did and it's just fine.

Of course there is pressure building the business and managing people, conference calls, firing people sucks, hiring people isn't all that fun to me because I don't trust people inherently, but it works usually. My pain points at this point because I spent 25 years building my personal brand have allowed me to live on the ocean and have toys I can play with like an airplane, boat, buncha cars, blah blah. However that isn't a definition of me. It's more a result of being bored that I bought an airplane and got a license to fly it.

I much prefer to stay home and hang out with my wife and kids BUT that constant hunger compels me to go out into the field and work, to put ""time in."" I don't have a running tally of financial metrics as if I do this work those things happen anyway. My end result now is a product of working my ass off for 10 years and then coasting on knowledge and efficiency while gaining small bits of knowledge constantly and monetizing that knowledge. I can close a $4,000,000 deal by answering a single question and then calling a person who can handle the logistics, a person I've known for 20 years that can accelerate the delivery. That's the networking side of the house. Knowing how to answer, and who to call.

I'm a travelling salesman. I can make $400k a year by flying around in first class and taking people to dinner and to many people all my travel sounds brutal. However I'm in Paris having a lunch at a small cafe and people watching while sipping Pernod. It's not a bad life.

That's what people don't get. I learned it very early on when I was 18 and working at a small computer shop in say 1992 maybe 1993, and some guy paid us $40 to install a memory card (SIMM) into his computer. It took me less than a minute. He was paying me for my knowledge and not for the physical effort of installing more memory into his computer. This whole concept of ""I don't want to work in an office"" has always baffled me. I don't work in an office, I work at a cafe in Buenos Aires until a meeting time slot hits, or a bar in Rome.

I could have stayed at that place like Don stayed at his company and done that my entire life but .. big but, that spark was lit. I knew at that point that if I continue doing this type of activity that people will constantly pay me for my knowledge. That is why I get payed. 

As I tell my son who is about to graduate and go to college, ""If you put the time in now, the payment will come."" And I've prefaced this by saying that money isn't always the reward. Sometimes it's just the satisfaction of knowing, as a teacher for instance, that you sent a kid off to college. Financials don't define a person, the acts they do with the short life they have certainly does. For me now it's charity events and I suppose I'll start working again, 6 months out isn't working for me anymore.

By the way, my son's aunt is an amazing artist who has bounced all over the world just making art and now owns a small gallery in Australia. It's her thing and she's excellent at it. Is she making good money? Who cares..",xynix_ie,t2_8m8rm,3,0,reddit3

This culture of looking at people that are happy and yet don't have X or Y as a job is a problem in this country. What if a person is a manager at McDonalds?

enlmtoc,t1_enifw6c,2019-05-15 11:35:00,science,"Currently a postdoc, and still feeling like cheap labor. I had not wanted to do a postdoc originally, but it’s difficult to get a job interview in industry without it on your resume due to the abundance of postdoc applications. 

There’s several things I hadn’t expected which I’ll note because they add to the discouragement. 

1. I still feel trapped. Grad school is usually 5-6 years of being “stuck” in a lab with few [good] options to leave or transfer. In my field, it usually takes a few years to get out a paper, and a postdoc position held less than three years is generally dismissed on a resume. So I feel it would be a waste of my time if I left my current position. Thus, stuck again. 

2. Future career options are confusing from a career trajectory perspective. I’m doing a postdoc similar to what I did for grad school. I’ve learned so much more even in the first year so no complaints there. But looking at “next steps”, I would likely be doing something much different in nature. So, am I really getting trained for a career in science or am I just cheap labor? 

3. Attitudes towards postdocs. Despite my own feelings of needing to stay a few years, many postdocs at my center use it as a temporary stepping stone and start the applications for “real jobs” nearly immediately leading to high turnover. I’m not at an academic institution so (a) I’m essentially a contractor and don’t get any benefits i.e. health insurance, retirement, maternity leave and (b) there are no grad students or technicians so I’m back to being the lowest rung on the ladder. Anyhow, we are viewed as disposable and easily replaceable. I worked super hard to specialize in a field but there’s little credit given to postdocs relative to how hard they work (until you land that full time position). Most postdocs are in their 30s and it’s discouraging to be viewed as “not having a real job yet”.",MiddleFroggy,t2_uc20d07,1,0,reddit3

eo30lpi,t1_eniwqwn,2019-05-19 02:27:09,science,"Hello, sorry for the late response!

So, I can give a few tips that I give to new students, but a lot really depends on the program, etc...

1. You are doing exactly what you need to be; research the professors, find out what they are doing. Does it interest you? Do you think you could learn skills that would help you advance your career in the way you want? If you can, sit down, chat with them! It doesn't have to be anything serious; short talks about what they are doing, where they think the research is going, if they had a spot open and you were taken in, what types of projects exist, etc.

2. If your program has you do rotations before joining a lab, try to find labs with very different atmospheres. One of the best things I did, though not on purpose, was to try out a very small lab where it was literally just me and the PI, as well as a larger one with a few postdocs and students. What I found was that I did much better in the larger lab, as I had more opportunity to get hands-on training from the post docs, as well as daily conversations about science.

3. As others mentioned, talk to the students if you get the chance! You always have to put their critiques and comments into perspective though. But one of the senior students when I joined talked with me a lot, we had similar interests, and he told me that the lab he was in would be an excellent fit. I tried a rotation through there, and from that point on knew that was the lab I should be a part of. I had also crossed out a few labs by talking to others, there experiences, etc.
Along these lines, you should pay close attention to these professors and the kinds of questions they ask in seminars. Are the respectful? Do they ask engaging questions that show interest? Or can they be arrogant / a haughty? How they handle themselves in seminars is them at their best!

4. If things don't seem to be going well, try to find help. Go to a mentor, or the grad student manager, but get help before things get worse.

Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to know before you are in the thick of it. Find friends to talk to, and if possible, find a few friends outside of the lab you can chat with as well; ones that have nothing to do with the university / science. As much as I have felt I have harped on this in recent posts, ensure you watch your mental health as well. Watch for signs, sometimes they start showing themselves before you even realize it. It always seems negative to say this, but it is one of the most important things a grad student can do. For instance, I thought everything was great; 3rd year in, my mentality was ""I constantly heard of people hating this, but I'm enjoying it! Things aren't too stressful... etc etc."" Meanwhile, I had gradually started coming in later, started shying away from a lot of outside social engagements. In year 5, I had been dealt a ""blow"" when I got my first author publication and thought I was on my way to closing up and getting done (our requirements according to the department are 1 primary/ 1 co-author), only to find out that they wanted more. They rules had changed during my time, and they decided to include me in it. From that point, those feelings I had been repressing came to the forefront and I realized just how deep I had been for so long, without even knowing. I lost most of my interest in my work, I stopped putting a lot of effort into my presentations, I started coming in even later. Unfortunately, that was only the start, as I began to have conversations about where to go after; low pay in academia postdocs, yet that is where everyone wants me to go... With little to no support in terms of advising in transitioning to industry.


So, I am sorry for sounding grim and foreboding, but I say all of that because I think that mentally / physically, I could be in a much better state if I had paid attention earlier and sought help.


You'll be fine, take it all one day at a time; study hard, treat your classes and your research like a job. Choose your friend circles carefully, and try to surround yourself with people who you can learn from and who are professional. I have a colleague who didn't do this, and grad school seems to be a continuation of undergrad life for them; that's fine if you like that lifestyle, but it shows in the quality of their work. They haven't taken it seriously, they haven't master the material, and it has led to very limited opportunities for them. Nice individual, but that is something to learn from them.


Anyways, I hope that helps. If you ever need someone to talk to, or want to mull over an idea, feel free to send a PM! You should look forward to it; overall, I learned so much about myself during my PhD, through both the good and the bad. It'll change the way you think, but you'll gain a lot of confidence and the ability to tackle large problems on your own. That is invaluable!",I_just_made,t2_iy73q,1,0,reddit3

Wow, you hit the nail on the head when it comes to what I'm dealing with at the moment. The committee keeps pushing me towards academia; but I developed a skillset that is in high demand, both inside/outside of science. The difference is that academia postdocs get crazy hours, massive stress, low pay, poor protections.... Compared with decent pay, maybe not as bad of hours... I don't know how people can go through 5-6 years of this, then look at the Postdoc system and feel that it is the next best step / moving forward. It's terrible, the postdoc system seems extremely exploitative, and as much as I enjoy running ideas down, I can't sell my soul and sanity to a broken system like that.

hjc99dy,t3_qmnder,2021-11-04 22:11:24,science,"Obesity absolutely is preventable and curable. And worth preventing and curing.

But there are a few big challenges that make it really hard for a lot of people to do it on their own, unless a significant change occurs in their day to day life.

The first problem is that in a 21st century western society it is incredibly easy to get fat and stay fat, particularly if you're lower middle class. Lack of free time, road or rail transport, office jobs, cheap, readily available junk food, screen based entertainment and a drinking culture all contribute in a way that is incredibly hard for an average person to dodge. Simply put, we've built a society where the easiest ways of travelling, the standard 9-5 jobs, the easiest meals to buy and the most common forms of leisure activity are all really bad for us. You need either more money and time, a healthier career, or above average willpower and self discipline to avoid those traps.

The second problem is that being fat is now so common that it gets normalised in families. Obese parents are way more likely to have obese kids, because your food and activity options almost always become your kids options. And if you grow up fat it is so hard to change habits you learn as a kid.

It strikes me that if governments pumped as much money and effort into fighting obesity as they have to suppressing covid, the long term public health benefits and lives saved would be equally dramatic. 
And really there is a moral imperative. If a teenager is already morbidly obese, in practical terms they have a chronic, treatable, terminal illness that will hugely limit their quality of life and almost certainly make them die decades earlier than they should. That should absolutely be a public health priority.",juddshanks,t2_kght1,1021,0,reddit4

I'd personally prefer a mentality of ""hey maybe lets stop bullying people"" and then from there move on to ""lets help people be healthy"".  It's way easier to help someone live a healthier life when they arent on guard from constantly being judged by everyone around them. 

if the goal is to help people be healthy, I feel like it'd be more productive to make the process of being active and healthier more fun, approachable, and desirable for the people trying it rather than trying to shame people into changing their life. sometimes that's not gonna end up with that person losing weight. that's okay. it is okay for obese people to exist.",spejoku,t2_9d22h,305,0,reddit4

Definitely can't do that with food for obvious reasons. Yea this one's tricky",Fivethenoname,t2_375olnds,167,0,reddit4
hjczbg6,t3_qmnder,2021-11-05 01:18:11,science,"I’ve encountered morbidly obese patients who say they never “feel full” or “sated” - for whatever reason, whether it be mental issues as a result of trauma or whatever. There are studies that posit that obesity, especially morbid, or extreme obesity have not only psychological components, but ties to the immune system in the gut. As the patients’ weight increases, so does inflammation, which can directly contribute to further weight gain.
Societal obesity can be addressed by decreasing (or eliminating) poverty so that all people can have nutritious food. However, there is marketing everywhere for unhealthy food, and corporations will do anything possible to keep you purchasing their unhealthy products, including adding ingredients that almost seem addictive!

I’m pretty heavy myself, but I also grew up in poverty with habits that developed into my adulthood, I also take medication that increased my gain, and my depression/anxiety makes it difficult to lose weight well at all.

If you see obese people who dont look after themself your moral will drop and some will express that by bullying.

Not talking about people with conditions or people whos not at their fault to be how they are. Most obese people inherit that or have medical conditions. Thats another thing.

Yes, CICO is well established but the matter at hand is how to facilitate people actually adopting long-term, health promoting diets. Behavior change is the crux of the issue.

There's also increasing evidence that food environments, appetite signaling and satiety signaling are *huge* components in obesity risk. Telling people, for whom it is literally harder to stick to an appropriate caloric intake for reasons outside of their control, to just eat less is not helpful, as is further evidenced by the current obesity epidemic.

We've largely stopped telling impoverished populations to just ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"", I don't know why we still stick to that kind of rhetoric when it comes to those with obesity.",keenbean2021,t2_a3xt8ieu,104,0,reddit4

The reason obesity is more rare in asia is diet. In the west, you walk into a supermarket and the easiest meal you find is microwave ready cheese and meat lasagna, in asia you walk into any convenience store and you can find a pre made lunch of rice, a boiled egg and a chicken breast (not fried)

Also, fish is a lot more popular, which provides similar nutritious value to other meats while being healthier. They also don't eat something different every day. They will have something like rice and vegetables most days and go on with their day.
In the west, you need to watch out for what you eat in order to avoid weigh gain, the path of least resistance will not be healthy. In the east, the path of least resistance is rice and some vegetables, so you don't have to actually think about what you eat in order to not gain weight.

I am a dock worker and often my obese coworkers slack at their work and I have to pick up the work for them which makes me angry at them. They constantly complain about their weight but make no effort to change it as they slurp down Dr.Peppers.
I try my best to be sympathetic. 
But sometimes these ideas “let’s just stop hating/ bullying people” are more complicated than people think through.
These hateful thoughts and actions are not through. In contrast they are spontaneous and unexplainable and to recognize them you have to be really introspective which is harder than you think. 
You can also see why some people might be logically annoyed by an obese person.
If they act lazy at work and you have to work harder to compensate I’m sure you would be annoyed as well. 
I am not saying that we should not condemn bullies rather I think to get to the root of this phenomenon we need to also understand that the bully has less control of their thoughts than you would think.

hjepx17,t1_hjeca7h,2021-11-05 12:48:15,science,"Oh wow, your wife and daughter found a way to defy the laws of conservation of energy?  
  
I promise you, your wife eats fewer calories than she burns, your daughter eats more. You can calculate their metabolism nicely within about ~200 calories a day, just online with a total daily energy expenditure calculator. Your wife might feel like she eats a lot, but she eats smaller portions or less frequently than she thinks. And your daughter might eat healthy food, but just more often or bigger portions than she needs.  
  
Exercise is also much less of a factor in your weight than people think. An hour of jogging barely even burns the calories of one full size candy bar, for example. So if you work out, and think ""wow, that workout really got me hungry!"" and then eat a meal, you probably put back all the calories you just burned and then some. It's really not intuitive.  
  
Either way, weight is not magic. Even people with metabolic disorders only need around 300 calories less or more a day than someone else their height, weight and activity levels.  
  
Calorie restriction works. It really does. Calories in < calories out and you WILL lose weight. It's just hard to get it right. It's hard to count every single calorie. It feels unfair when even a tablespoon of oil you use for cooking is almost 100 calories, or 1/15 of your total daily calorie allowance.",WeReAllMadHereAlice,t2_15l93i,3,0,reddit4

Nope. It requires complete denial of of the founding of American liberty and capitalism.

One of the core principle of American culture is liberty, especially negative liberty: that people are free to do what they want without barriers or constraint. And one of such constraint is government intervention. It is why America is a ""united states"", that it is formed into a coalition and disfavors a strong central government.

But to implement a nation wide policy, such as deciding that all states must follow a guideline of fast food content to avoid obesity, will inevitably strengthen the federal government's power. Then the possibility of the US becoming a totalitarian country which the federal government dwarfs state government increases, closer to that of China.

If you leave only the state government to decide, some state will relax the rules, so as to attract US fast food corporation to establish there to produce fast food in order to bring taxes to the government. The fast food will then export cross stateline and made other states' citizens obese.

There is also no such thing as ""gaining more weight than you should from what you eat"" I'm not going to throw the typical ""calories in calories out"" statement, but each person uses a certain amount of calories a day, that means that their body only requires this amount and if you consume extra it will turn to fat.

This left the lay world, which is essentially ignorant of even the basics of genetics (trust me I taught intro to undergrads, smart kids, for the past 5 years and many had no idea what was going on) to ascribe some people's weight issues to personal choices, which makes sense at a glance.

What?! Let's remember that obesity is higher in lower education and income groups.

First, people need education on how to exercise and eat healthy. There are tons of people who literally don't know how to do these things.

Then there's structural issues like food deserts and unsafe neighborhoods. Sure, ""just go for a walk everyday"" is great advice to get people moving, but not everyone lives in an area where it is safe to do so. And loads of people live in areas with no access to fresh produce or other healthy foods.

And none of this even touches the mental health component. Most Americans, especially the working class, do not have access to good mental health services. If someone is self medicating with food, taking away that outlet can cause mental health problems to worsen and people will either fall off the wagon or turn to other unhealthy coping mechanisms, like drugs and alcohol.

What this person is saying is that clinicians need to consider these other factors when treating obesity. Programs targeting obesity need to educate and provide means to change to the people who need them. I have worked in many clinics, and I have never seen a doc refer someone to counseling when they are having trouble losing weight.

hjdy4ba,t1_hjdqlyo,2021-11-05 06:53:10,science,"Ding, Ding, Ding!  Obesity is VERY often exacerbated and sustained by anxiety.  Often anxiety triggered by a lifetime of bullying and judgement by those around the obese person.  It often starts as a child when hounded and hyper-monitored by its skinny parents and caregivers like its an alien zoo creature.  To be fair, those thin parents truly can't figure out why their chubby kid is big and their skinny kids are thin when all are eating the same foods. (Usually ~ages 2-4). Next step (~ages 5-11):  Siblings of said chubby kid learn from the adults to judge, comment on, and 'other-ize' their sibling while also self-segregating from the larger kid.  Being left out of the 'reindeer games' begins a cycle of lesser activity, embarrassment, and hiding from others to prevent more of the same.  Isolation becomes the safe zone where people can't see you and gather amunition to further tease and judge you.  Isolation tends to involve more sedentary ways of passing one's time.  Thus begins the usually life-long habit of inactivity, self-soothing by comfort foods, and anxiety of going out for activity.  Everything becomes a who's judging me here or there event.  It's emotionally easier to stay in and away.  Oddly enough these folks are often very happy-go-lucky at work when life is busy, purposed, and focused.  But once the time clock is punched, it's an anxiety driven bee-line to the safety, comfort, and anonymity of home.  Inactivity awaits and the pounds pile on.

There’s a range of rates of cellular metabolism yes, but it’s closer to 10% variance than 50%+ some diet guru like to claim. A lot of the actual change comes from changes in body composition: fat cells are less active than muscle cells, and muscle atrophy is common during weight loss unless you work at maintaining strength, and that skews basal metabolism more than the “metabolism” that tends to be pointed at. It’s why olympic athletes can eat enough for several normal adults: they have a lot of expensive muscle to keep fueled.

What does happen is that the body changes the hunger/satiation signaling pathways so that they’ll encourage you to eat in a way that will cause you to get back to slightly above your previous weight.

PCOS makes it more difficult for the body to use the hormone insulin, which normally helps convert sugars and starches from foods into energy. This condition -- called insulin resistance -- can cause insulin and sugar -- glucose -- to build up in the bloodstream.

High insulin levels increase the production of male hormones called androgens. High androgen levels lead to symptoms such as body hair growth, acne, irregular periods -- and weight gain. Because the weight gain is triggered by male hormones, it is typically in the abdomen. That is where men tend to carry weight. So, instead of having a pear shape, women with PCOS have more of an apple shape.

Secondly, the biggest cause for obesity is overating. You can't get fat if you don't eat more than your body needs.

But at the end of the day, easily available high density foods and overeating are the cause.


Obesity rates began to climb at the same rate that sugar consumption began to climb. The sugar industry has spend billions trying to convince people that saturated fats are the problem, instead of sugar, and they have succeeded. Luckily people are starting to see the lies and changing their dietary habits.


Saying that genetics and/or epigenetics are the main cause of obesity is antiscience and dangerous. Yes, genetics may make it easier for some people to become overweight than for other people. But that doesn't mean that genetics are making them fat.


Obesity is a real problem which could very easily be preventable if governments started listening to contemporary science and stopped giving the fast food industry so much power.


But hey, I guess it's easier for governments and people alike to blame genetics, instead of acknowledging that under current guidelines, pizza with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce, counts as a vegetable in the US.",RealAstroTimeYT,t2_9cu7xwnm,2,0,reddit4

The strained tomato sauce that I used to buy (and can't find anymore, possibly due to the Xinjiang thing) was also processed. Processed doesn't mean bad, or unhealthy, it just means it isn't raw, and some company did something to it, before selling it to you. Cans of beans, frozen vegetables, both are processed and sugar quantity dependent, pretty healthy, and can help make you feel full.

But none of those 3 aforementioned products (rice, pasta, potatoes) will make you feel full or satiated for any significant length of time. You may feel full after 20-30min, and not be hungry again even after an hour, but not much longer than that, you will start to feel hungry again. That is because these are high calorie foods, that have high glycemic indices, and when that index drops again, which will happen not long after eating, you start to feel hungry again.

Obviously, that isn't necessarily how they would always be eaten. If you throw in a high fiber low glycemic food like green vegetables, things work out better. But it's when you start getting into those fresh vegetables that prices start to go up, and I'm not even talking about organic.

I'm also talking from experience, even though it is anecdotal. For the last, a little over 2 years, I've had ~$65-$75CAD/month for groceries, that's about $52-$60USD/m to spend on food. It isn't easy to buy sufficient food of the right variety, quality, and quantity.",adaminc,t2_1z28h,-1,0,reddit4

hjf91et,t1_hjf3t1c,2021-11-05 15:07:55,science,"All of the things you mention affect obesity, but do not demonstrate free will. It's still done by a biological organ that functions in an environment.  Binge eating is not the best example to pull out to demonstrate free will. It's defined as a sense of loss of control over eating.

Survival of the fittest (coined by Spencer, not Darwin), actually favors obesigenic traits. Humans evolved in an environment with limited food and the threat of starvation. So characteristics like gorging, hyper-responsiveness to high calorie and palatable foods, storing fat easily, resistance to burning fat (thermogenesis), etc. would be selected for because the prevented our ancestors from starving. Extreme examples of this are the Pima Indians who survived in a desert with sparse food for generations and then all became obese and diabetic when they started eating out of supermarkets. The obesity trends follow the over-abundance of foods engineered to be highly palatable, cheap, and highly processed. With the genetic predispositions of people who survived countless generations under conditions of food scarcity, only an environmental change (food type, availability, and other cultural factors) could have produced the rapid and recent increase in obesity, and morbid obesity as you point out. 

There are mechanisms in the body and brain that regulate all of this and our very ability to choose what, when , and how much we eat are based on systems that are biologically integrated in our anatomy and physiology. 

A moralistic model, based on 100% free will lack explanatory power and more importantly has failed to produce positive results. If blaming people (including people blaming themselves) worked, obesity would not exist. Dieters tend to have enormous amounts of self-blame when they fail or regain the wait. It doesn't make sense to think that everyone kept their act together for the first 250,000 years and then suddenly let it all go in the last 50 years. A combination of biological, evolutionary, and environmental influences provides the most coherent explanation so far. The same has already been proven with addiction models: the biopsychosocial model (multicausality) is the most useful. Moralistic blame models (people are just selfish, lazy, weak) are circular explanations that neither helped us understand it or discover more effective treatments.",Papancasudani,t2_4fh90xgw,2,0,reddit4

How our bodies store fat and processes sugars is relevant to how easily put on fat and get rid of it. Over time that’s very relevant to obesity. But moreover those biochemical messages (insulin, ghrelin, leptin, cortisol, adrenaline) tie directly or indirectly into the brain systems that guide decision making (hypothalamus, limbic system, reward system, prefrontal cortex). Our sense of choice and agency relies on prefrontal systems that can be overridden by other areas.

Working 90 or more hours a week was associated with changes in depression symptom scores three times larger than the change in depression symptoms among those working 40 to 45 hours a week.

What’s more, a higher percentage of those who worked a large number of hours had scores high enough to qualify for a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression -- serious enough to warrant treatment – compared with those working fewer hours.

The research team, based at the University of Michigan, used advanced statistical methods to emulate a randomized clinical trial, accounting for many other factors in the doctors’ personal and professional lives.

They found a “dose response” effect between hours worked and depression symptoms, with an average symptom increase of 1.8 points on a standard scale for those working 40 to 45 hours, ranging up to 5.2 points for those working more than 90 hours. They conclude that, among all the stressors affecting physicians, working a large number of hours is a major contributor to depression.

it2qqfc,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 14:46:36,science,"I genuinely don't know how people work the mythical 90 hour week. In my peak stress busy periods I've worked from 6am in the morning till past midnight but with breaks thrown in to eat, shower, commute. Those are impossible to avoid really, particularly the commuting bit. So maximum 16 hours of that day spent actually working, but usually around 12 to 14. That was all week. I'd then work over the weekend but not as many hours. Even on absolute maximum 16 hours per day during the week for the entire week, which never actually happened, then say max 16 hours total over the weekend, that is 96 hours working week.

And I can confidently say I never hit that number.

And during those periods I worked in an investment bank, harder than anyone else around me and harder than anyone I have come across before or since.

It was insane and I could physically not pull it off for more than a week or two at a time.

If you can't see the difference in that, then your methodology is junk.

it2tplv,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 15:06:17,science,"I'm willing to bet that the causality is that:

People are desperate, which causes them to both NEED to work 90+ hours, and to be depressed.  That is the work hours are the MEASURE not the cause of the underlying cause of depression.  

Note I say that the desperation causes the long work hours, but hat desperation does not need to be strictly financial.  One could imagine any of the following as forms of desperation that might lead to both long hours and also depression:

* A youth is desperate to demonstrate his productivity in a family business.  His father is also his boss, and his land-lord, and his home is also their place of business, and thus he never has ""time off"" as such.  He is desperate to prove himself and also to have the slightest sense of autonomy.  The closest he gets to privacy is the bathroom.  

* A soldier is stationed on the front lines where his unit has been dug in for months with little movement and constant low-intensity fighting.  In theory his unit has 30 men and one officer, but at any given moment the number of effectives is closer to 15.  As a result there are no days off and everybody is pulling double-shifts to maintain watch and protect their mates.  He is desperate to not be the next one to eat a bullet, and must be constantly on watch every minute of the day.  

* A female lawyer in Japan, is trying to prove herself in a male-dominated society and a male dominated field.  All the lawyers in her firm are desperately competing to make partner, but she must work harder just to stand still in the rankings of the young up and coming lawyers.  As a well educated professional, she is unlikely to starve even if fired tomorrow, but she is desperate for *social and professional* recognition; that's why she works 90+ hours.

More scenarios could be constructed, but I think you get the point.  90+ hours a week is not something that almost anybody CHOOSES to do if they feel that they have any kind of reasonable alternative.  I argue that it therefore is a reliable marker for people who do not feel that they have such alternatives, and that it is really the lack of alternatives that drives depression... not the work hours themselves.  Astronauts on the space station routinely work 90+ hours, but they are doing what they love, their time on the space station will end in very short order, and have they have aggressively competed for the opportunity to be there.  Their 90+hour work week is a result not of desperation and a lack of options, but rather is a result of them intensively exercising their options.  All the difference in the world.",Lucretius,t2_4341,2,0,reddit1

it33nre,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 16:11:00,science,"60hrs is normal. Common. 40hrs isn’t enough time to get things done to meet the demands of society. 90 is double time and then some. That ain’t right. I don’t mind 60hr weeks, it’s needed to keep up with consumer demands. That’s the only thing people don’t realize often is that production of consumer goods is directly related to employee hours. Healthcare is another ball game because we die without it. But for me to keep up with the 3M gauze pad or syringe packaging and related means at least 60hrs a week to meet their 90hr a week demand. Same with food packaging. Doctors have it worse because of legal obligation, but manufacturing is a similar Boat. The more people, the more hours needed. 

40hrs isn’t enough time. 90 is far too much. 60 is just right to keep shelves stocked in Walmart and hospitals. That’s fully staffed with extras on hand on my end.

it36n7s,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 16:30:07,science,"I once had 7 jobs when I was in my early twenties. I was a recovering addict who had quite the hole to dig out of. I worked with one company full time and then 3 more that were per diem through that job. Then I had two personal pay clients that were scheduled weekly plus an at home side hustle. Luckily I was able to sleep about 4 hours at the one job. The human body can adapt quite amazingly to situations you’re in. I slept twice a day, 3-4 hours each, so about 6-8 hours like normal people. I never had a day off. So if I had to guess, out of a 24 hour day, I was working or driving to work 20 out of 24 hours a day. So like actual working time about 100 hours a week. It was absolutely not sustainable, I had never been more depressed, more manic, more lonely or more broke in my life. It was so difficult. Most people can’t imagine working 50 hours a week, let alone 100. But it just became normal. Then I had the breakdown, broke my back, met my husband and now live - not like that. Now I just work 60 hours and commute 7/week. It feels like an huge upgrade.

it37sfd,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 16:37:29,science,"Dropping my response to another commenter in the main thread. I regularly do this for extended periods, with 1 day off/week, though those sometimes gets skipped. Prior to a couple years ago, I had one day off every two weeks, though sometimes those would also be skipped.

I've done two and a half months with no days off in the past. My typical days now are 12 to 14 hours, but heavier days are 16 to 18, somewhat regularly. As of a couple years ago the heavier days were more the norm, but things have been tweaked for the better more recently.

I am generally able to take breaks for bodily functions and meals, but often times I'm eating/on the toilet while working through emails or responding to work messages and such. It is very easy to commingle work and break times if one is not vigilant in the setting time aside to step away from work.

The article is certainly accurate, this amount of overwork leads to deep crashes when projects or cycles are finally ended. What it doesn't mention is the tendency toward weight gain, I tend to put on 50 to 75 lb over the course of a cycle. If I'm lucky, I'll lose the majority of it during our seasonal off time, before getting into another cycle.

The flip side of this job is that sometimes a cycle will only be seven or nine months out of a year, so the work is very intense, but then I have a quarter or so off. On the other hand, sometimes cycles conjoin and I might work for 20 or 24 months pretty much straight through.

My days off tend to be spent asleep. What I consider my ""real life"" pretty much goes on pause while I am engaged in my ""work life"". There is little to no time for months on end for hobbies, or visiting friends, even if I'm in the same state temporarily that they are, or family interactions and obligations.

This kind of workload becomes a lifestyle rather than an occupation. It is not a healthy one and has many drawbacks. In my case, the reason I do my work is because I think the sacrifice is worth it, and I've had the opportunity to help shape, in some fashion, the future of many states and of the country as a whole.

But I realized after working through the entirety of the pandemic, that I was having increasing difficulty when the bill came due for putting my ""real life"" on pause for most of a year or sometimes a couple of years. It impacted my ability to handle my non-work-related obligations, which deteriorated even further when the rest of the world was in lockdown, as the isolation's effect was magnified.

Many, perhaps most, people in my line of work or similar industries rely heavily on prescription or illicit drugs to regulate their sleep schedules and energize themselves to handle this kind of workload. There's a lot of nicotine and alcohol addiction, to go along with stimulants and depressants of other types.

I'm a bit of an exception in that regard, since I rarely engage in recreational drug use and don't smoke or really drink. But my other coping mechanisms are no more healthy, including the aforementioned weight gain from poor diet, binge eating in short periods to prioritize work, and an inconsistent sleep schedule, all of which mess with my hormones.

That's why I've made it to priority to attempt to address work-life balance and suggest other folks do the same in whatever capacity suits them. Making sure to take off my days off as they are earned, rather than the sacrificing them for project needs, using vacation time to attend important personal and family events, even at the expense of project needs, etc.",Iron_Baron,t2_tg55r,1,0,reddit1

I had a job that i loved and with nice coworkers and it made the 40hours bearable. It was more fun and easier than some 20-25 hours jobs i hated and was hard physically. 

Especially if you have health problems, either physically or mentally it can make all the difference between making life easier or worsen/create mental illnesses or making you suicidal.

IME, theres a point during every production where it gets hectic and everyones working through the day off. Sundays are paid double, but it still means more hours and ultimately two weeks of work without pause. 

That's a week of at least 84 hours. Since I'm part of the crew needed on set, I have to stick around to wrap up or prepare for the next day, so I expect to put in overtime on top of the 12hrs.

This particular production has had certain scheduling issues that have me entering way before the general crew call but STILL leaving at wrap, instead of the end of my 'shift', which would fall around halfway through filming. 

Earlier this year, during another project, stress and dehydration made me faint in the hotel I was housed in during filming, miles from home. I hit my head and got a two hairline fractures behind my right ear, which I was also deaf out of for two months after the fall.

I got to the warehouse at midnight, separated my load into orders by store, then loaded the truck. This usually took 2-3 hours. I’d be at my first stop my 3:30-4am.

On my days off (wed and sun) id spend probably 5-6 hours going from store to store putting out back stock and straightening shelves.

I can honestly say that was the worst 6 months of my life. What finally broke me was my wife coming home after work at 7pm and I had been asleep maybe an hour.

it377ry,t1_it2qqfc,2022-10-20 16:33:47,science,"Depends on your industry. I regularly do this for extended periods, with 1 day off/week, though those sometimes gets skipped. Prior to a couple years ago, I had one day off every two weeks, though sometimes those would also be skipped.

I've done two and a half months with no days off in the past. My typical days now are 12 to 14 hours, but heavier days are 16 to 18, somewhat regularly. As of a couple years ago the heavier days were more the norm, but things have been tweaked for the better more recently.

I am generally able to take breaks for bodily functions and meals as you mentioned, but often times I'm eating/on the toilet while working through emails or responding to work messages and such. It is very easy to commingle work and break times if one is not vigilant in the setting time aside to step away from work.

The article is certainly accurate, this amount of overwork leads to deep crashes when projects or cycles are finally ended. What it doesn't mention is the tendency toward weight gain, I tend to put on 50 to 75 lb over the course of a cycle. If I'm lucky, I'll lose the majority of it during our seasonal off time, before getting into another cycle.

The flip side of this job is that sometimes a cycle will only be seven or nine months out of a year, so the work is very intense, but then I have a quarter or so off. On the other hand, sometimes cycles conjoin and I might work for 20 or 24 months pretty much straight through.

My days off tend to be spent asleep. What I consider my ""real life"" pretty much goes on pause while I am engaged in my ""work life"". There is little to no time for months on end for hobbies, or visiting friends, even if I'm in the same state temporarily that they are, or family interactions and obligations.

This kind of workload becomes a lifestyle rather than an occupation. It is not a healthy one and has many drawbacks. In my case, the reason I do my work is because I think the sacrifice is worth it, and I've had the opportunity to help shape, in some fashion, the future of many states and of the country as a whole.

But I realized after working through the entirety of the pandemic, that I was having increasing difficulty when the bill came due for putting my ""real life"" on pause for most of a year or sometimes a couple of years. It impacted my ability to handle my non-work-related obligations, which deteriorated even further when the rest of the world was in lockdown, as the isolation's effect was magnified.

Many, perhaps most, people in my line of work or similar industries rely heavily on prescription or illicit drugs to regulate their sleep schedules and energize themselves to handle this kind of workload. There's a lot of nicotine and alcohol addiction, to go along with stimulants and depressants of other types.

I'm a bit of an exception in that regard, since I rarely engage in recreational drug use and don't smoke or really drink, But my other coping mechanisms are no more healthy, including the aforementioned weight gain from poor diet, binge eating in short periods to prioritize work, and an inconsistent sleep schedule, all of which mess with my hormones.

That's why I've made it to priority to attempt to address work-life balance and suggest other folks do the same in whatever capacity suits them. Making sure to take off my days off as they are earned, rather than the sacrificing them for project needs, using vacation time to attend important personal and family events, even at the expense of project needs, etc.",Iron_Baron,t2_tg55r,5,0,reddit1

it3eb86,t1_it2d5tr,2022-10-20 17:19:02,science,"Also many prospective med students don't do the math on the actual cost of school and loans. 

It's one thing if your family is rich and you aren't going in debt to go to med school. But for everyone else, let's use our hospital's associated university as an example. 

-$30k per semester = $240k in tuition alone

-Unless you are attending locally and can live at your parent's house, you're also having to take loans to pay for housing, food, transportation, clothes, and any other cost of living. So add another $50k+. 

-This $300k in total loans is accruing interest at 6 to 7 percent at a minimum. You don't make much more money than the US average household income as a resident or fellow, so you have anywhere from 5 to 9 more years (this would be 4 years of residency plus 1 to 5 years of fellowship depending on specialty with surgery being on the longest end of that) where you're not really able to make sizeable loan payments and that $300k continues to grow at 6 to 7 percent interest 

-By the time you're done with all this and making a real doctor salary, you're probably between $350-400k in debt

-That doctor pay of say $250-350k a year starting out is going to be cut nearly in half by federal and state taxes. Then, you have to pay another couple tens of thousands a year to cover malpractice insurance. So that $300k is now more like $130k in take home pay after accounting for all this. And you're staring down the barrel of $2k-4k monthly loan payments unless you want to be in debt forever.

Much like how some people live paycheck to paycheck no matter how much they earn, going to a 32 hour work week won't suddenly give you a ton of free time if you're already working 40 hours a week. You'll just waste the additional 8 hours you get if you don't change habits.

Speaking from experience, and to repeat similar comments every time this is mentioned: this is not the way.  4 10-hour days means you can get nothing non-work related accomplished and have virtually no free time during your working days.  You end up spending that extra day off catching up on all the things you could have done throughout the week if you weren't working those extra 2 hours.  All of your doctor appointments, trips to the bank, home maintenance, vehicle maintenance, and all other incidental tasks get pushed to that extra day, and if you miss them one week there is nothing you can do but wait for your chance to come around again 7 days later.  Your weekends still go by in a flash and you're left with even more dread starting Sunday afternoon as you anticipate the coming 4 day slog.

4 8-hour days needs to be the standard.  You can work 7-330 and still have enough time left in the day to take care of other personal tasks so you can actually take those three days at the end to unwind and decompress.",Fantastic_Engine_623,t2_q1r4yn4o,3,0,reddit1

Although the one about seven days in a week is kind of broken, because it depends on what your job considers a work week.

one is the age of statement of “it’s takes 10,000 hours to master a skill” it takes a long time, and a lot of hours to become a good doctor, and if I’m ganna spend 3 years at 80 hours or 6 years at 40 hours a week, I know what I’d choose, and 3 years is already a short rotation, surgical ones can be 5 years already

Second, who is ganna cover me? There are barely enough physicians as it is, and the hospital doesn’t shut down, someone’s always got to be here

Three, handoff is the most critical time for complications, im there for the full day, and I hand off to one person for nights, who then hands my patients back in the morning

One of the surgery programs I know added a whole new hospital (hundreds of patients) that residents had to cover without adding more residents to their program. 

This can be because the hospital is too cheap to hire extra attendings which cost more than residents, a culture of disregard for residents, just too damn disorganized to figure it out or how to make changes due to the bureaucracy, inability for the program director to obtain more residents, or a culture of disregard for high level of care for patients although community programs are more likely to have attendings on staff on call than academic ones.

My residency and fellowship programs were among the most call heavy ones in my specialty and even then, we tried to have as many shift changes as possible.

To add for those unaware, 

First the culture of how most residents and fellows deal with when it comes this means the higher ups expect their residents to go through the same stuff they did. It’s a pretty awful cycle as not only are the residents expected to do their rounds, be on call and such, they also do additional work outside as well for additional qualifications (especially for research.) it’s shocking how I see some of the residents I work with end up completely exhausted. 

It’s also that hospitals are just happy to keep everything understaffed. Not enough doctors, not enough Nurses etc. the entire healthcare system in the US is based on “how little can we pay to get the most out of it” so you get basically situations where not only that residents get other doctors on their case for not pulling crazy hours but that they can’t comfortably do so without risking harming patients. 

It’s wild. It was really bad during COVID cause people where flung head first into things, it hasn’t really gotten better. And it’s ignoring the normal compensation residents get. The university hospital I worked for in my undergrad (I’m a BME for direct surgical devices and guide manufacturing so I get to work with the surgeons one on one really often) had residents make $50k/year.

Only time they took a break got that down to about 80 hours a week was doing world Cup cricket.  You're not wrong to call it slavery, but that's reality of capitalism and wealth inequality.  Between working in the Army and then doing hours like that in kitchens I went from homelessness and poverty, and now I have a university degree, a college degree, played university rugby and football, own my own restaurant, and am mortgage free living in a beautiful suburban upper middle class neighborhood.  That's why I'm hesitant to completely condemn that sort of lifestyle 20 25 years ago.  Because working that hard for that many hours got me real estate and an education.

More to the point though yes increasing wages increases costs for business owners and to a certain extent will increase prices. It however isn't the majority of operating costs for most businesses. Lets say 30% of your expenses are labor, not an uncommon goal for restaurants. If you have to increase wages from $15-$18 for example, a fairly large pay bump, you have increased your labor costs by 20%, but have only increased overall costs by 6%. If you passed all of those costs along to the customer a $10 meal is now $10.6.

That vastly oversimplifies things but the point is more that increasing wages does not cause the 50-100% increase in costs that you are describing.

Currently, the resrictions are:

* An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
* A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
* A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 4 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
* No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
* One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
* In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

So right now medical residents can work up to a 30 hour shift, average 80 hours per week, only have 10 hours off between shifts and only 1 day off per week. 

You're telling me that you don't think dropping from 80 hours a week and at least one 30 hour straight shift per week, down to 3 on 3 off 12 (probably 14 hour shifts to allow for a two hour changeover each shift), would be less fatiguing?",,,1,0,reddit1

>Small businesses fluctuate so much in revenue and sometimes don’t have that ability.

Yes, I am very well aware. Having standards for wages and working hours applied to large corporations doesn't mean that every small business has to figure out how to pay exorbitant annual salaries to employees who only work during the summer. You're complaining about how rules that need to apply to massive international companies - which, if applied properly, would improve competition between large and small companies - would somehow drive every mom and pop out of business, despite me repeatedly reminding you that rules can be applied however we like and the same rules should not apply to a local sweater shop as they apply to Wal Mart.

Whereas the past several months, my workplace has taken to overloading the queues and reducing staff to perform back-office work to where the things I would normally supposed to complete every week are being completed once every two to three weeks at best, in favor of moving people tasked to inbound phone calls, which in and of themselves *never* stop, and they even opt to pull people onto them every day for periods where they're getting tons of calls outside their apparent expectations. As someone who is reserved for back-office work regardless of phone volumes, which is such a rare position to begin with (think 2 people in over 80 or so in my branch), I find myself far more stressed and prone to wanting to just desteam by browsing a couple Reddit posts on my phone reach hour than I ever did when I was allotted enough resources and backup to just feel like I'd finished my work properly and in a timely manner.

dzap3qf,t3_8ks174,2018-05-20 19:45:27,science,"A little anecdote. 

I work in a medical staffing office for a maximum security prison. Roughly a year ago we switched to a fully digital charting system. 98% of work in the prison now goes through a computer.

Now for those of you who have never worked in a prison let me tell you that it is like working retail but the ""irate customers"" come back every day, several times a day and are likely to throw their shit at you when you don't bend over backwards for them (or they'll throw it at you when someone else didn't and that person isn't there right now) . It is not a pleasant place to work.

Now our internet was always limited. No sports, no social media and obviously no porn. As soon as the training was done for the new digital system they blocked everyone from the internet. Everything that isn't a state website is blocked. And I don't mean ANY state website; I mean our state in particular. As my job has quite a bit of downtime I've checked. No federal, no local municipalities, just state.

Morale has tanked, sick days have gone up (thus involuntary overtime which further hurts morale). I was fine for about 6 months but nearly had a full emotional breakdown because I was going through a rough spot and had nothing to distract myself from my own thoughts. We can't bring in music, magazines or books and I work in a windowless office, often by myself. ",Ionic_Pancakes,t2_zwm5p,2,0,reddit2

Or he could prevent it from going down. If he had to “keep himself busy” people could die. 

This is similarly true, to a lesser extent, for plenty of jobs. Sales associates, executive assistants, receptionists, security guards - just to name a few.

If you only have short, unpredictable 3-5 minute bursts, you can't really do professional development during that time.

It's better to just browse news or read a short story on a tales subreddit, something I can drop in an instant when I'm needed again.

I didn't see the thread you're referencing, but it's actually a pretty big debate in some professional circles, whether you should be paid for that sort of development work or not. If you're salaried, obviously that's part of your salary negotiation, so there's no need to accommodate it. But for workers paid hourly, if you're doing a task required for work(for example, many jobs require that you obtain a certain amount of professional development ""credits"", or where I work librarians are required to read multiple titles on their own time and then report on them at monthly meetings), shouldn't you be compensated?

Let's be clear: this wasn't quickly discovered.

The pitch was: 8 hours for work, 8 hours for yourself, 8 hours for sleep.

Of course, the basic safety regulations that stopped easily preventable serious injuries from occuring *also* had to be fought and literally bled for.

And sometimes you're under underload, then you get a phone call and suddenly there's a lot of work to do.

There are few occupation, where you are constantly under the ""perfect"" load. Now employers could in essence send people home, when there's nothing to do and call them in for more time, when there's a bunch of stuff to do, but then you could never have regulated schedule for your personal life as an employee. And if you tied the pay to the actual time worked, you wouldn't have a reliable salary. So boredom is the price workers and employers pay to have reasonable schedules.

If you are at your job but you have to wait, for what ever reason, be it another person to complete their task, be it a process to finish, you ARE working.

When the nacho fries came in they asked me to switch to a new position, a fryer/prep person. Before whoever needed something fried did it themselves or asked someone, like a cashier, to do it if they weren't busy. The job started out easy enough, but then they thought ""he does this so fast he's doing dishes in between. Things are always getting caught up when he's on shift. He must need more work!"" so it became my job to constantly make sure everyone was caught up on their fries, rather than being told as they were getting half way or less. It then became my job to give them more of ***whatever*** they were low on. It became my job to sweep the food line even though the ones dropping food used to clean up after themselves. It became my job to restock the stuff like plates, bags, cups, etc. that used to be cashiers' job. It even became my job to work the food line whenever someone left for a break. 

   What grinds my gears about it though isn't the work. It's the attitude. They still act like I have nothing to do. Many of them have gotten into this habit of saying ""since you have nothing else to do"" before they ask me for a favor and they'll say things like ""how does it feel to have the easiest job"" or ""you must enjoy having the easiest job.""

Work can differ everyday depending on the workload, time of the year and needs of your customers, shareholders, employees. To say you want to correlate your compensation to X amount of task each day is stupid. Would you get less money if there are less tasks to do? No, people need consistent income. Then you get caught up in defining tasks and the value for each task. What if a new tasks comes in and it's not defined. Would you just not do it as it is not correlated with money?

dzav164,t1_dzary5n,2018-05-20 21:32:32,science,"Your #1 option is the combination of meditation, routine exercise, and a solid diet. 

I sat here and tried to think of how to convey the significance of the improvement those 3 can make, in order for it to sound worth the investment. I've been meditating regularly since I started my career, but it was originally a lackadaisical habit without any understanding. I've since put some time into reading guides, and all I can really say to sum it up is *wow*. 

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/8ja02l/it_has_been_claimed_that_meditation_and_ancient/dz35mbr/) comment thread I explain a little bit more about my experience with that. In the past I'd tried nootropics of various types, as well as 'just grit and bear it' style will-power. Both of those burn you out pretty quickly, which isn't acceptable if you're really looking to reach the limits of what you're capable of on a daily basis. 

The long-term impact of meditation, for me at least, has been a serious shift in how my motivation functions. Historically my motivation would have been something like 'I will do this work, because X is the result of that effort, and I value X more than leisure time.' At the heart of that evaluation is the idea that the act of doing the work is unpleasant. At some point without my realizing it, I began to value focus in and of itself. The subject of that focus wasn't important, because the focus itself became fundamentally rewarding. If you read my linked post you'll see what I mean by rewarding, physically and emotionally, on a level that I worry no description really conveys.

Diet and exercise are important as well, but only in order to support your biology. As long as you're getting your nutrition, sleep and your blood moving daily then that's as far as it needs to be taken. Without those boxes checked though, you can start to lose sight of happiness and wellbeing entirely.",bewalsh,t2_3jl0e,1,0,reddit2

I process compliance for customer's CPAP usage and obtain authorization for the patient's continued usage for 3 months to 12 months. My expected rate of touching accounts is 40/day, and my daily wage is $96, so each time I touch an account is worth (at least) $2.40. The authorizations I obtain probably net the company, on average, $60-$100 per month the patient actually get supplies.



If they switched to task based hours and paids me $3 an authorization (which would be a raise for me because I exceed production minimums) I would be more motivated to get an authorization than now, when as long as I touch 40 accounts a day there's no benefit to getting more for the company.


Seems like they'd just be paying me more for getting slightly more work done, right? However, if the patient doesn't have an authorization for their equipment while they rent it, we do not pick the machine up but we cannot bill for that time span (3 months) not retroactively get an authorization. So the company loses money because orders aren't processed quickly enough.

And your example only works if the company has no interest of bettering the work/expense ratio. Maybe they're paying way too much? The employee could be getting the work done in 15 hours per week. Then it only seems fair that the company should pay less or add tasks for the employee to do.

Effective Tax Rate is a shaky proxy for aggressive tax planning, and underemployment doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not investing in people.

For example, let’s take Real Estate Investment as an industry.  That industry has a lot of tax breaks specifically for them that are well-established, and I think it would be disingenuous to call basic industry-standard tax breaks “aggressive tax planning”.  I have no idea what the barriers to entry are for being hired by a real estate investment firm, but I’d assume it’s something on the higher side.  That industry may have trouble getting people to work for them because it’s hard to meet the minimum requirements, not because they’re treating their workers poorly.

On the flip side, retailers doesn’t have as many industry loopholes, and may have fewer hiring shortages because the barriers to entry are low.

Not at all. For one, there's no meaningful distinction between taxes on individuals and taxes on corporations. A tax on corporations is a tax on shareholders, and when those shareholders actually realize the profits as personal income via dividends or capital gains, they get taxed again. The combined tax rate from corporate income taxes and personal taxes on dividends and capital gains is higher than the rates that almost anyone pays on wages: (1 - 0.21) * (1 - 23.8) = 0.60, so the total tax rate is about 40%, just shy of the top marginal federal tax on wages of 37% + 3.8% Medicare = 40.8%.

That aside, the naive intuition that labor income should be taxed at a lower rate than investment income gets it completely backwards: There's a fairly strong consensus among economists who study tax theory that investment income should be taxed at a lower rate, or not at all. The reasoning behind this is a bit complicated, but there's a good introduction to thinking about the issue [here](https://www.thebigquestions.com/2010/09/14/getting-it-right/). 

The corporate income tax is especially bad due to the fact that it discourages investment in the country levying the tax. If a corporation is otherwise indifferent between investing in the US and China, taxes are going to be the tiebreaker. Yes, obviously there are some investments where China is the obvious choice and others where the US is the obvious choice, but there are also some in the middle that can be influenced by taxes, and the bigger the difference in tax rates, the more it affects investment decisions.",SerialStateLineXer,t2_gnwo83gf,2,0,reddit3

Firstly, they’re explaining how net tax value impacts a company’s effective tax rate. 

ie; limiting/eliminating tax liability. 

Second, tax avoidance =/= tax evasion. You use the terms interchangeably. The former’s legal, the latter’s illegal. 

> Fifty-five of the nation’s largest corporations paid no federal income tax on more than $40 billion in profits last year, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank.
In fact, they received a combined federal rebate of more than $3 billion, **for an effective tax rate of about negative 9 percent**.

> “Their total corporate tax breaks for 2020, including $8.5 billion in tax avoidance and $3.5 billion in rebates, comes to $12 billion,” according to the study’s authors, Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff.

> The findings also underscore the favorable tax environment for big businesses in the wake of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. 


> Twenty-six corporations have paid no federal income taxes since 2017, according to the report, including such household names as Nike, FedEx and Dish Network. Combined, the 26 companies have booked more than $77 billion in profits since 2018, while receiving nearly $5 billion in rebates, **for an effective three-year tax rate of negative 6 percent**.

… 

> “By all appearances, the companies described in this report appear to be using entirely legal means to reduce their tax bills,” Gardner, the study’s lead author, said via email. But that doesn’t mean the companies are “blameless,” he added. “Many of the tax provisions these companies are using exist because they themselves have lobbied heavily for their creation.”


> Those provisions include tax breaks for stock options given to chief executives as part of their pay packages, credits for research and experimentation, and write-offs for renewable energy and capital investments. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s dramatic cut to the corporate income tax rate, **from 35 to 21 percent**, also plays a role in the limited tax liabilities facing many major corporations.

A corporation is a group of people working to survive. Shareholders accrue money in order to survive.

It is taxed AGAIN as it is passed to the shareholders as dividends... So there are two different opportunities to tax it.  If you add them together, how does it compare to individual tax rates?  

The argument that corporations don't need profits to survive is interesting.  Profits are used for future investments, and some companies definitely need to invest to survive, but survival is undeniably metaphorical here.  It's more interesting to me to talk about the people who need the dividends from the corporation to survive, and those dividends are taxed, and come out of the corporation's profits, which are taxed.  Ergo, taxing the corporation's profits is double taxation on money people need to survive.  Taxing money people need to survive is moral if it is an equittable and fair burden. 

Corporate money eventually flows into the hands of actual people, and I think the outcome is moral if taxation is equittable at that point.  I'm not yet seeing the logic in focusing on the taxes on corporation's profits as a moral issue.

Other, more sensible companies have two or more promotion tracks.

Billionaires and billion dollar companies have literally offices full of people whose sole job it is to scour tax codes, identify exemptions and deductions, and determine whether or not these exemptions and deductions apply.

You would think ""how do they not lose money on this?""

Because the amounts being worked with here are *huge*. The effective tax rate for many corporate entities can be cut in half or more if they squeeze every deduction, exemption, and write-off they can.

And thats how tax law works, too. When the rates go down, they eliminate deductions so the companies end up paying roughly the same. When the rates go back up, new deductions are put into place so the companies end up paying roughly the same. The people who get shafted by this are the middle class and those below the poverty line. Sure the *amount* of taxes paid by the middle class only accounts for a few percentage points of total tax collecte by the government, but the per-capita rate of tax collected from middle class citizens can be double or triple or worse some years than the tax collected from corporate entities.",Taolan13,t2_j487g,27,0,reddit3

h6lrsdt,t3_orrnev,2021-07-26 16:49:13,science,"So, essentially an office manager here and I’m probably going against the grain. 

Myself and my team leads cannot possibly identify every way, task, or question that arises. We need our fellow team mates, who do most of the “real” work, to help us find better ways to do the job, deficiencies in the training, datasets that are unusual, etc. these situations happen dozens of times per week and cannot possibly be addressed by more meetings. 

In an open floor plan folks roll over and ask their coworker a question, that helps transfer knowledge. It the boss/trainer hears and sees a deficiency in the training material. It also allows these things to rise up more effectively. 

I have worked on a good team where every member contributed ideas, not just hours, and it was the fastest developing team I have ever seen (an outside agency said it was similar to Google/Apple, fwtw).  Now, I have employees with two years of experience and I cannot yet trust them with advanced tasks, because their needs are not communicated. 

When we put folks in cubicles they, and their ideas, stay in the cubicles. And even good digital methods (chat, forums, etc) pale in comparison. 

But maybe I’m different too. I’m buying my folks Samsung G8s, razor keyboards, razor mice, etc so they can have the best (trying a 55” oled too). I don’t get upset over YouTube being up, nor music or headphones. I don’t mind “sports” conversations provided it isn’t excessive. 

To me an open floor plan is also open discussion and ideas. It is not perfect, but as a whole the team functions better then a bunch of cubicles. Although open has a limit, 4-6 seats full open, these divided by a short (4’) barrier, and only a handful of these between 8’ walls.

On more stressful days we support each other and help where we can. When intense focus was required, you could just book a small meeting room for a few hours and no one would bother you. 

I guess this has to be adopted by everyone at the company, not just front line workers. I've sat at ear shot to the CEO and multiple other executives.

One sales team executive actually brought a coat rack from home where he'd hang suits to change into for important client meetings.

For example, an open workspace facilitates communication, but it doesn't _cause_ people to suddenly feel comfortable communicating with one another. The Expert in Earshot pattern works when the people with information feel open to share that information with others. What creates that openness remains largely mysterious.

Open workspaces similarly exacerbate bad relationships at the office. I don't think they _create_ them. As many have reported here, an open workspace makes it harder to sweep a low-trust environment under the carpet. That can be a good thing if it pushes change and a terrible thing if it doesn't. Sadly, it mostly doesn't.

As usual, the tendency of those in authority to preserve the systems that helped them gain that authority likely lies near the center of the problem, and issues like the one in this study might mostly be symptoms.

I've actually been involved in reconfiguring offices into a new spaces so I've seen the entire process play out a few different times and it's nothing like the claims people make it out to be.

>all you need to know is the boss will always have a desk at the end of a row... as isolated as possible, if not their own office room.

At one company we debated putting managers into cubicles with their employees.  It was actually HR that brought up the concern that managers often had to have 'private' conversations about sensitive topics with their employees that drove us to put in offices that they either occupied full time or part time when they had to discuss these matters with their staff.  In addition, at one company it was the managers that took phone calls the vast majority of the time and having them out in the cubicle space yapping away all day would be distracting. That was it.  There was no conspiracy involved.

>""open office"" is just code for... saving money on cubicles/office spaces for workers.

This is equally ridiculous.  For one thing, these reconfigurations were almost always prompted by some lectures about all the 'collaboration benefits' of the open office plan these executives saw at various 'business leadership' conferences.  They actually spent money to implement this stuff thinking there would be a return on their investment.  It wasn't like the existing furniture was dated or they needed to make more space, they just thought it was a really good idea.

In addition to all of these, I was also a proponent of open offices that I myself would work in because on the surface it actually sounds like a great idea.  After implementing this kind of office space, the whole place felt brighter and more refreshed with window views from every corner.  Prior to that, there was squabbling over 'seniority' every time a window cubicle opened up.  It wasn't until after that I along with many others realized the drawbacks listed in this study.  It wasn't some nefarious attempt to screw everyone for a penny, it was simply a misguided idea that ended up backfiring.  That happens all the time.",iushciuweiush,t2_o6z81,1,0,reddit1

I recall once asking about modifications to a section of cubicles because people wanted half-height walls (so you could see at least one window) and they came back saying that it was basically $800 per cubicle to modify them—there’s no savings in changing what’s already there.

Architecture and architects are generally ignorant of the psychology of the spaces they create; this is just one of them. Another great example is the ""tiny / van house"" phenomenon, which of course looks great on instagram when lived in by models but is phychologically damaging to its inhabitants. This is because, in a tiny / van house, in order to do anything (say, cooking) one must move like 6 pieces of adjustable furniture to clear up space for the desired activity. As a result, even the smallest chore becomes psychologically daunting because doing anything now comprises ten steps just to begin the activity.

There are endless factors that go into why an open office can be stressful for someone and I doubt it's just because it's an open space. 

Perhaps it's the reservation system specifically making it harder to find a spot that is yours? 

Perhaps people once had an individual space but now everything is public and they can't add their own spice of personality anymore.

Maybe someone is working in a place where they hate their co-workers so seeing them all is stressful.

Maybe it's a space that was designed for cubicles but the plan switched and now it's forcing the space to be something that it isn't designed for.

I work in an open space office which is also a co-working space. My boss doesn't have a private office, she is out here with us. I'm typing to you from a large sofa and a mini desk that I dragged over sitting next to two of my favorite people. When I need privacy I can either book myself a private room or I can use one of the small nooks in the staircase or I can go to the quiet room. It's all about what your office does to accommodate you.

 Having worked in cubicles I could see how my introverted nature may find it attractive but when you have the open environment and the right people in a navigable space it's way way way way better than a boring cubicle isolated from society with 0 options of choosing where you want to work. But like I said, if the space isn't designed for that then it's gonna feel like finding a place to sit during middle school lunch which is simply undesirable.",,,1,0,reddit1

If hell exists, that's the sound that's going to be played on an endless loop for me.  At our office, people played nonstop, from the time people began to arrive until the office closed in the evening. It never stopped. That sound will drill a hole between your productivity and sanity. It will haunt your dreams.  
Our desks were set up in a big L-shape, with the boss’s desk at the top of the L, of course at the farthest point away from the ping-pong table. My desk was at the end of the bottom L, at the closest spot to the ping-pong table. At that proximity, noise-canceling headphones are useless against the pernicious sound of ping-pong ball striking paddle.

I complained about the sound and suggested the ping-pong table be moved to the other side of the building where no one sat where no one would be bothered with the incessant sounds. The boss told I was overreacting and the sound wasn't that bad.

I spent the next 2-3 months nudging the ping-pong table each day when I got to the office, and little by little I moved the table farther from me and closer and closer to the boss's desk without anyone noticing. I made it about 3/4 of the way over to him before he declared that the ping-pong table was too loud and distracting and needed to be moved to the other side of the building where I'd suggested it be moved months before.",Garrettcz,t2_8rsec,92,0,reddit1

HR won't let them give you anything more than the maximum 5-7% raise, often force through the 3% COL unless you are promoted a grade. Those grade promotions are both a combination of merit but also have a hard cap related to the length of time of your most recent grade promotion. 

Here's my career path as an example: 
Hired in at an Engineer II. Three years in, promoted to Engineer III. now leading projects and taking a leadership role in the dept. My next two years, my projects were $260K above margin, and $760K above margin. (IE under budget by that amount so extra money for the company.) Got the 5% each year for that. 
Asked about Engineer IV, gotta be at my current grade for 3 more years. (that's an extra 7.5 - 10% pay bump.) But was told if I move to Engineering Manager if I found an opening. After being jerked around on that for almost a year, I left to another company, started at Engineer IV and since I didn't go through a promotion with that company, was an Engineer V within 9 months. Now I'm at the top of the pay grade so bonuses are nicer, but yearly pay bumps are capped at 3%. 

HR and HR policies are why people are job hopping. Once you are on board you are seen as replaceable, and yet they are willing to pay out the nose for your replacement. They view the more ridged the compensation structure the better as some sort of lawsuit risk mitigation tactic. From what I understand in the 70s-80s you could show up, show your worth/value at these larger firms and expect some sort of compensation adjustment. Now a days even if you ask for a raise most companies won't even consider it out of the annual compensation adjustment date, and at most you are getting 2% over COL.",EngineerDave,t2_7asov,44,0,reddit1

Of course, I'm an old bastard, but I suspect things as I describe are still happening.

I recall our human resources folks having documented standards for how many square feet of office space each pay grade should be allotted, as well as what titles and grades were to have private offices, who got window offices, who got dedicated parking spaces, and such.

That sends a message in my view.

Looking back it's hard for me to grasp just how that could be justified financially.  I believe it part of some twisted idea about retention, but any decent manager knows that high turnover among those folks who actually do the work to keep the place running day to day is far more detrimental than swapping out many upper managers.",oldbastardbob,t2_14vjx5,2,0,reddit1

It was terrible, I'm not actually aware of a single employee that liked the ""flex work"". We all complained, and HR refused to budge. I mean, maybe people complained to fit in and they actually liked it? idk  

They said there were enough ""work stations"", any flat surface that had power counted. There were a true limited number of desks (had monitors/keyboards/mouse). 

I was half tempted to submit an OSHA complaint because working on the small laptop, hunched over could not be a good work posture.

I played in the dirt as a daily activity. I grew up in Appalachia, so The Woods was the default. If you ever saw the post of the imprint of a kid's hand on a petri dish, and the stuff that grows from it, that's me head to toe.

The times I got sick as a kid, I was almost never given medication. Fever reducers were it. Our medicine cabinet had 1 lonely bottle of Tylenol and some band-aids/gauze, etc. My body fought off everything on its own.

I was fed a strong diet of the staples (meat/pasta/veg) and no cookies, candy, cakes, or whatever else like that was ever in the house. It was 100% real food, every time.

&nbsp;

I fully attribute it to the three things above. One of my friends gets sick every single time someone walks by him it seems, and I think he and many others I know get it often because they had/have 5,000 things in their medicine cabinet, and the second anything happens, they get loaded up with the contents.

To this day, the only thing that could be considered junk food is a bag of Cheez-Its that is about 8 months old. My medicine cabinet has Caladryl, Tylenol, and band-aids.

h540mgq,t3_ojfdae,2021-07-14 02:37:04,science," The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element, tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons, which gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.

Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a second.

Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.

Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.

Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.",Thewhiteguyyouhate,t2_584ne26d,25,0,reddit2

h54bwni,t3_ojfdae,2021-07-14 04:30:43,science,"Happened to me at my old job. I had a performance review with my manager and HR at the same time (thinking back that was a conflict of interest). I knew from the way I was being treated there I would never get a raise so I never bothered to ask for one. The manager said to me during the review that my performance needed work because I wasn't staying back after my shift and there was an incident where a customer wanted to order something but there were no staff members to serve them. 

The reason why I stopped staying back after my shift was because the person who was meant to takeover after my shift ended would clock in and deliberately avoid the cafe area for half an hour or sometimes more forcing me to pick up the slack. I would constantly have to chase up management to get those minutes paid so in the end I stopped staying back. 

What annoyed me during the review was that my manager emphasized the fact that I would be getting paid for those minutes when the whole reason I stopped staying back was because I wasn't (unless I chased them up about it).

The second factor suggested by literature on bullshit concerns the communi- cation behavior of high-status individuals in organizations. Since leaders are likely to be the most important and influential bullshitters in organizations (McCarthy et al., 2020, Spicer, 2017),

third factor, concerning bullshit language. This factor reflects how bullshit transpires in the workplace. As noted earlier, bullshit involves communicative acts that have no regard for the truth, and that are typically made with the bullshitter’s agenda in mind (Spicer, 2013).


The results confirmed the three distinct factors of the OBPS. The first factor, named ‘regard for truth’, includes all items that relate to the use of evidence- based decision-making supported by the incorporation of data sources. The second factor, named ‘the boss’, includes all items that pertain to an evaluation of the actions of one’s superior. The third factor, named ‘bullshit language’ includes items that relate to typical characteristics of the language of bullshit communications, namely excessive use of acronyms and jargon (McCarthy et al., 2020).",anddowe,t2_149lt7,120,0,reddit2

h51iaze,t1_h51e5h2,2021-07-13 14:44:17,science,"Did you know, as a human, you have no actual direct access to reality? You percieve whatsever is in your mind, which is a result of the inputs from your senses, that are subsequently processed before you're aware of it. so the only thing anyone can observe, are actually perceptions and not truely reality itself.

While this might sound as a ""technically correct"" argument, for me it actually had profound insight in how I treat peoples view; namely as (for them) the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I might disagree, (like i do with you now), but i'm conviced the other person is speaking the(ir) truth, which is indistinguishable (for them)  from ""objective reality"" (cause we can't actually see such thing).

Because no human has access, or a clear view, of ""objective reality"", the percieved reality becomes the gold-standard or ""most objective reality"" a person can deal in. So  when we're dealing with people, the percieved reality substitutes the presumed ""objective reality"" we use to describe the world.

The annoying thing is that most of the time that he's wrong, it has no repercussions because of various reasons.

Had the auditor even followed up on just a few of the processes, he'd find quite a few majors.

Another is about grammar or wording/terms on things he thinks is ""unknown"" to the public and is industry specific (e.g. he thinks that most people don't know what willcall is, and while it may be true, I actually know what it is but he just assumes I don't because I've never worked in the industry before).

h51wkfv,t1_h51qcik,2021-07-13 16:30:14,science,">Ok now explain or rebut how in a constructed reality science is the best tool for deriving objective reality.

good point. I think it is fair to say that the whole scientific method is constructed solely to solve exactly this problem. Let's use Neil deGrasses definition as given in cosmos (from [here](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1334957-to-make-this-journey-we-ll-need-imagination-but-imagination-alone)):""Test ideas by experiment and observation. Build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail, follow the evidence where ever it leads and question everything.”

\>Does science not create something more objective than the subjective perception of the researcher?

Yes! through several means. First the subjectivities of the researcher are tested, basically asking the universe if you're idea is correct, allowing you to find the subjectivities that came from your head and not from reality. Also questioning everything is a great way for a singular researcher to distinguish internal subjectivities from external objectivities; don't believe yourself and investigate even what you hold for true.

But there's more. Since we (likely) share some objective reality with other humans, the things that everybody can observe are either caused by the underlying reality, OR are caused by some internal mechanism that would be the same for all reserachers. This thus gives us another way to distinguish objective from subjective reality; if everybody sees it like that, it's probably real.

\>How could the researcher know objective truth from their own subjective perspective?I'd say it doesn't really matter philosofically. If we see science as a way to understand the world around us in order to manipulate it more effectivly, and we can use it to make a good descriptive model that alligns with our observations, then we're done. we substitute investigating ""objective reality"" by investigating ""that what happends consistently"" and we can make an effective science based on our observations, without the need for an clear view of an ""objective reality"".

Less philosophical, the "" if everybody sees it like that, it's probably real. "" still applies though.

\>I accept what your saying about the constructed nature of reality but surely scientific knowledge is somehow distinct and better?We try. We try to make observations about the world that would also be made in the same way by other researchers if they looked at it using the same method, which we thus explain in (usually unfortunately to little) detail.

If you try real hard and look at things in different ways, you can do better than mindless observing and presuming you're observing reality. And then if other people, preferably totally different (so subjectivies don't align) independently agree, you have a good indication that the thing you're looking at did not originate from the subjective brain, but from the input that brain got.

There is very little science that is wholly empirical, which is why peer-review is key to academic work.  Think about something like a group of doctors trying to decide the best treatment for a particular kind of cancer -- the empirical facts are things like rates of cure, rates of side effects, types of side effects, rates and extent of improvement in particular bodily functions, cost, availability of drugs or medical equipment and training to use them correctly, etc.  All of those facts are empirical, but none of them alone tells us what is the best treatment -- is a 5% increase in life expectancy worth a 20% chance of immediate death?

The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

....maybe. I tend to think so too, I especially think our methods are very effective at finding a descriptions of reality that allign with a lot of observations. But on the other hand, we have literal 0 opportunity to check that against any external observation. Maybe there's a 4th dimension of space , but we can't see in because there's little happening that our biological system needs to know about, so we never evolved 4d space perception/travel. Maybe we make a machine someday, who knows. We've discovered insane things about the universe before; like that light is massless, yet effected by gravity, or that fundamental particles behave differently wether or not you're looking. Or that the passage of time depends on your speed (making that, according to the photons, they travelfrom the sun to earth in 0 seconds).

For me the main consequence of the fact ""that objective reality is fundamentally unknowable"" is that everyones view on reality is just an opinion, but it should be treated as the reality, because, for them it is the reality, because there's no such thing as ""objective reality"".

They're not insofar as they're practitioners of professions. While doctors and engineers are often *also* scientists, or may approach the practice of their profession scientifically, they're not scientists *sensu stricto*. Science is not practice, and doesn't answer normative questions, which only arise in practice.

>I suppose you could argue that if you define science as only the most ""pure"" and unapplied research.

It fundamentally comes down to the question above, rather than the question of application of research. Take a very applied piece of research - deciding on what explosive is to be used for a missile warhead. Scientific research does not decide what's ""best"" in this case, because that's not a scientific question but a political one  - again, political in the widest possible sense, which is to say determined by competing interests and intended outcomes. Once the ""best"" has been decided on, science can determine which explosive is the closest match to that.

Or, to take another example, science can determine that the climate *is* changing, and determine *why* it's changing, and can be applied to determine *how* to avoid or mitigate that change - but it cannot be used to decide *whether* to do so.

To put it more broadly, science cannot of itself provide *intended* outcomes. That is a matter for human desires and, once more than one person is involved, politics.

> I know a lot of engineers and doctors who will take issue with the idea that they are politicians.

All humans are politicians. We all know that we need to balance various interests, win support, overcome opposition, etc, which is the art of politics:
>Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.

It is always amusing to watch said colleagues start doing the same things that they once complained about management doing, complaining all the while about things that ground-level staff are doing, that they themselves once did. I am friends with one colleague that is a relief supervisor and I rib him about how he switches mentality back and forth depending on what role he is in that month. He goes from complaining about management shenanigans when he's one of us to complaining about staff shenanigans when he's one of them.

One of our district managers is a bit of a rogue; he has the audacity to believe that if you try to keep your staff happy as much as you can, they will work more efficiently and deliver better results. He will do things that go against company policy if he feels it will better his staff, which costs more money for the company and yet he meets his KPIs month after month, quarter after quarter unlike the other districts. This, naturally, upsets the executive management team.

dlpu3xr,t3_6u2lr3,2017-08-16 19:34:48,science,"I feel like part of the problem is employers fail to realize the correlation between treating employees well, and employee satisfaction. When employees are satisfied they work harder and give more to the company willingly. 

Edit: Quick note to add. I'm talking about employers who follow the mentality that ""the beatings will continue until employee morale improves"", or my favorite, ""if you don't like it, get an education and leave."" There's more to life than money. If you demand 40+ hours a week and refuse to post the schedule more than 24 hours in advanced, don't be surprised if your employees don't care about the company or your product. 

If you treat your employees as replaceable cogs, eventually they'll wear down and need replaced. A company is like a machine. If you don't take time and resources for preventative maintenance eventually it will break down. Things like scheduling and benefits help. There's also a fine line between being overly strict and overly lenient. ",BAC_Sun,t2_e0xmo,502,0,reddit1

I commute 2 hours each way to NYC since the jobs and pay on the island are practically all unstable $10/hour or less jobs. So many people here, if they are not doing that long commute are working 2-3 jobs just to pay the (mostly illegal) rent setups.  We have a major heroin problem out here because people are looking for an escape.  Coffee is sold the most at Long Island 7-11s, people here are generally tired, manic and depressed while living in denial about ""How Great NY is""  My job in the city is thankfully allowing my wife and I to buy a home on the island (as the rent setups and cost make owning a home interestingly be more stable).  My wife is still working two jobs, both don't let her know her schedule until two days before the next work week starts, so good luck ever scheduling anything with family or vacationing.  Jobs that have no set schedule, force weekend work and pay <$15/hour are a bane on the fabric of the workforce.  I am so grateful for no longer having those kind of jobs and despite the long commute, able to have some stability that I'll soon be able to pass to my wife; maybe even have it where she can ditch both jobs and build her hobbies.  The same hope is not there for many here, many with college degrees that were forced to get into debt for.  Hopefully the mass exodus of 35 and younger out of NY/NYC will wake up the government in this state about the stress working/loving here is.

Or are we talking ""I can't get my child to the pediatrician for his allergy shots because I will lose my job"" stress?

Both are unquestionably stressful. Both are bigger problems for those who are working than those who are unemployed. And neither is insurmountable, with the right type of social assistance or legislation. 

But without a better understanding of what kinds of stress are causing the most problems, it's hard to triage. 

The study looks at biomarkers and physiological and emotional indications of stress. Important, no doubt. But if you want to solve social problems, we need more information about the social context of the issues at hand.

Before even thinking about new work I wanted to take a month off, to unwind a little and try to get back some form of WILL to work. I paid off two months of bills in advance (using nearly all my money) and did nothing but smoke weed and play games, music and with my dogs every day all day. I thought going in that in a months time I would be going insane with boredom and dying to find a job. 

Nope. Two months passed and I still didn't want to work. Still felt that humans aren't meant for it. It was basically like Office Space. I was so happy and relaxed. Another month passed and my gf had to start paying more than her share for groceries and bills, and the guilt of that is the only thing that pushed me to start putting out resumes. Yes I'm working now, but I've also started pushing my music (I record people) a lot harder because I've realized that the only way you'll ever be happy is to spend every day doing something you like. If it takes years and years to get to that point, it's still worth it. No matter how enslaved you are to the consumerism circle, it's still your life, your only life. ",,,1,0,reddit1

The thing is, when you are on government allowance such as the pension it's a constant stream of income. You know exactly how much money you are going to make and can easily budget around it. 

When you are working a low paying casual job it can be a total nightmare to budget properly. One week you can be scoring a load of shifts getting 42+ hours per week plus overtime and feeling rich and the next week you may only get a single 4 hour shift and wonder how you are going to pay the bills and feed yourself. 

Sure you can save money when the work hours are up, but when you are getting one 4 hour shift per week for several weeks it really eats into your savings.

dlq4ryo,t1_dlpu3xr,2017-08-16 22:42:43,science,"This is true. But I have a story for this:  
  
The company I work for has an awesome CEO. He's super friendly with everyone and most of the employees here are veterans who've been here for quite some time. That being said, there are one or two individuals who, as sad as it sounds, don't deserve to have this job. We work in a very chill environment. It's not busy. It's quiet, in an air conditioned nice office with no restrictions to sites you can visit. But some of these individuals are ungrateful of that. They complain left and right about this person and that person, ""So and so is taking another vacation? They just took one like months ago. What the hell?!"" There is one person in particular who can't even do her job right. I'm talking about her being super rude to customers and making mistakes all the time. But she still has her job. And she has this cushion schedule where she works 6 hours a day and gets paid full salary while the rest of us work 8 hours. Not to mention, her hours are 9:30am to 4:30pm. She starts at 9:30am!!!! But god forbid if someone is late and she finds out about it, she'll go around like a little child gossiping and complaining about how ""so and so was late this morning. Let me see them go find another job where the employer would let them be late this many times."" She's often late, and will wait for the CEO to leave so she can leave early too. And she tells us she's going to do this as if we're going to cover for her, which majority of us do only because we've complained about her before and nothing has been done about it. So I get that having a lax CEO is nice, but there are some employees who treat the job they have very poorly even though the employer treats them more than fairly. ",,,16,0,reddit1

I never confronted anyone but through conversation I would hear remarks about not liking someone's advancement or making sure everyone else had it as hard as they did.

I've managed to take some huge jumps in salary by learning new technical skills and advancing. It wasn't easy on my part but each time there was also a distinct individual that was instrumental.

Interesting point - I don't know how to articulate it scientifically but I wonder if it's because cortisol (stress hormone) sort of reduces the effect of depression because you're so focused on doing the next thing you have to get done. When you're unemployed, you're less stressed but more depressed because you have lower hormones ""driving"" you to get shit done.

Another related thing I read that was opposite of what I expected: people in senior management / high-responsibility roles have far lower cortisol levels than entry level employees. The explanation was that even though a senior mgmt role has more demands, you also have more power and more control.

I don't disagree with the article itself, because I can't speak to British unemployment programs in 2009-2010. I'm not even disagreeing with you, because you may very well live somewhere where the unemployed make the same money as the minimum-wage employed.

But unemployment in my state doesn't even close to pay the entirety of even low-income rent and basic utilities, especially if you weren't making much to begin with. If you got unemployment from a minimum wage job, you'd be getting considerably less than minimum wage in unemployment benefits, at least in the states (because at least in my state, unemployment is only a certain percentage of what you made before). If you had a higher-paying job, you could conceivably live comfortably on unemployment if you moved into lower-income housing and/or had a good savings buffer. 

Dad was unemployed for close to a year when he got carpal tunnel and had to abandon his career. Only reason we weren't homeless was because my godparents took us in and let us stay there for a year and a half. We couldn't afford housing. The second my dad got a minimum-wage temp job, his entire outlook changed. Working *sucks*, but in my experience unemployment sucks so much more. I only tell you this because I hear these rage-bait horror stories about people living on unemployment for long periods of time and abusing welfare programs because people who have never been unemployed think the unemployed get the same wages as the employed. I genuinely have no idea how anyone could even manage that, because dad and I accessed every single service available to us while he was unemployed and we still didn't make enough in welfare (unemployment, food stamps, etc.) to cover rent, bills, and food. And that's even in Oregon, a state with probably more generous benefits than more conservative states.

Edited to add: there is an income bracket where getting a wage increase will actually make you worse off, because it will make you unable to qualify for food stamps/medicare/welfare. I think this is called the welfare ceiling or something similar. But as far as I know, most unemployed people are in a more precarious position than minimum-wage-employed people, and that applies to wage increases of the employed rather than unemployed vs employed.

True desperate poverty to the point of potential starving is different than mere unemployment. It may be less mentally taxing to have nothing and struggle for food than it is to have something and fear to lose it, but I'd have to see a much more granular study to know when the tradeoff flips the other way because it has to start going there when the fear shifts from not being able to find food to ""I might die soon"".

dlq821u,t1_dlq1lt6,2017-08-16 23:49:14,science,"In the U.K., Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), which is our unemployment benefit, has stringent conditions attached whereby claimants are never made to feel like it's ""a pay[cheque] you know is gonna keep coming.""

It requires the claimant to complete a diary of their attempts to find work. Actions are allocated points and a specific number must be reached each week (e.g. Sending a CV is 1 point and attending an interview is 5 points).

Every fortnight the claimant must attend an interview at the local jobcentre and the advisor must be satisfied that you have provided evidence to show you have met the target. This is now largely done online through the government portal, which allows the advisor to check that you have logged on regularly, completed job searches with it, made applications and then uploaded proof of correspondence.

If the advisor is not satisfied, the payment will be sanctioned entirely. In fact, payments can be sanctioned just because you were late to the appointment. A popular film was made last year which exposed how draconian the rules are: [I, Daniel Blake](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt5168192/)

And if you are unable to find work after a few months, you may be required to work unpaid in a position they allocate you - usually a supermarket stacking shelves. Otherwise you will be sent on a course of some kind, from recruitment training to manual handling. At the very least, and for all claimants regardless of whether you are given one of these placements, you will be required to attend a detailed, invasive interview at the jobcentre where you must compile a folder of all actions taken to find work over the last few months, including copies of your CV, which they may compel you to review. 

And all this for £57 or £73 per week, for those under and over 25, respectively.

Note that rent is also paid, but separately as housing benefit, which is issued by the local council and not the jobcentre. It is basically guaranteed provided you continue to provide proof of your rent payments by post. However payments will cease if the jobcentre discharges you completely, for example because you find employment or they are unable to contact you for a month or so.",TheLaw90210,t2_mxmgw,20,0,reddit1

So it'll be a year of some discomfort now, and an extra year of some discomfort after I graduate.  I'll take that over major, suicidal-level discomfort now, followed by one less year of discomfort later.

The thing is, I can't do this.  It's way too taxing on my mental health.  I don't want to pull out more loans, but before I decided to quit by the end of September, my depression/suicidal thoughts were bad enough that a psychologist would have wanted me in an institution.  (I know because I've been and I know now what to and not to disclose to those people).

I haven't stopped looking for a better job though.  And things are looking up, I just met with a lead engineer at an engineering firm and he wants to take me in as a CAD tech until I graduate.

I'm also looking at dog walking, and doing the Audio/Video for events (I have 5 years experience doing that).  Based on what the A/V staffing company told me, I should be able to pull in $600 per month after taxes on that.  Dog walking should be another $300.  That puts me at $900 per month, requiring only an extra $400 on loans per month.  $400×7months is $2,800.  And I haven't even researched tutoring yet, but every friend I've tutored has told me that I explain math/science better than any other teacher or tutor.

So realisticly, I should be able to keep it under $6,000 extra loans.  Which would add 6-7 months to my time spent paying off the loans.  Not great, but better than being miserable. ",Dave273,t2_8jiaj,1,0,reddit1

The scheduling is the other half.  The one thing I regularly do in life that I enjoy is going to parks with my dog.
As of right now, the schedule prevents me from going out with friends before or after work (all shifts are mid-day).  But within a month or two, the change in day length as winter approaches will mean I won't have sunlight after work to take my dog to the park.  Once that happens, I'm out.  That is the point where the mental and emotional taxation of this job will be too much.

If you're mocking me, trying to say retail isn't that bad, that's relative.  Some people love working nights and some love working in call centers.  Most of us don't though.

I was getting paid the same or less than most receptionists/front desk workers that I know (or know of). Which sucked due to having to file insurance claims, take specialized measurements, repair glasses, assist customers, etc. ON TOP OF helping with the basic office work that front desk did. Insurance in particular is such a bitch, and it took months of training to deal with properly (front desk did some insurance but we were responsible for far more of it). To be fair, where I worked the pay was also below industry standard, but it was pretty demoralizing to realize that I was getting very stressed at my job when I could have just been flipping burgers for the same pay. I’m assuming that accounts for the high turnover even from better-paying places though, it’s a lot of stress and skill for pay that doesn’t match what you put in.

An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied, “only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”

The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”

The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”

To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”

“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.

The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”

“Millions – then what?”

The American said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”",d0nu7,t2_5gjz7,49,0,reddit1

Edit to add with the insurance system here, we have things like being required to get insurance permission to see a specialist and that can be months of back and forth between insurance company, us, and our general practitioner to justify a specialist. They do crazy stuff like that with approving meds, too. My partner has high blood pressure. The doctor tried a bunch of different meds, but my partner's body only showed real response to one of them - and it's not one that's got a generic available. The insurance required them to try and document three other drugs for a month each before they'd approve the only med that works, so they knowingly required a patient to have ineffective treatment and a high blood pressure for months before agreeing to cover the only thing the doctor said worked. Now that it's ""covered"", it's ""only"" $270 for a 3 month supply. And every time our insurance changes - usually because of a job change, once because the job changed insurance providers, we have to go through the back and forth with the insurance company again.

I remember working for $8.00/hr and less. I didn't smoke, drank somewhat (college), and didn't have a car (used my road bike for transportation). I got by but it was still barely. If I smoked or had kids, I don't know what I would've done. I could get assistance (had food stamps once), but you're not supposed to just stay on that. 

Everything comes down to our life choices. College or no college? smoke/drugs/etc or not? With kids, you also add in the ""unexpected"" costs (like ER visits). Either way, you're still barely floating and you're just one accident away from debt (car breaks, ER, etc). 

Even if you made $15/hr min wage, these problems wouldn't go away. Sure, you'd have a little more money, but it's not really enough to just do whatever you want (travel, etc). Also, you're still only an accident or two away from debt. 

I try to not be cynical about it all, but I feel like we're all just screwed to Corporate America. People like to shit on Millenials for no allegiance/etc, but there's a reason for it. Companies will lay you off w/no disregard, so you can't worry about hurting their feelings. Also, pensions don't exist anymore, so there's no reason to stay.

I saw a few other places that were in that range but by the time I could get their it was already scooped up. Only reason I got the place I have is because they had all the applicants come to an open house. If they were showing it by appointment it would have been gone an hour after posting.


My last place was $1500 on Cap Hill, right next to the park, WITH A PARKING SPACE!!!! Hated to give it up but tolls were to much. Anyway, the only reason I got that was because a friend of mine was in the building and keeping an eye out for me so I was able to apply for it before it went on the market.

My bills like rent, food, etc. were about the same as what I was taking home. I worked a full-time job AND a part time job, lived in the cheapest place I could find, bought my groceries at walmart to save money, kept my heat and lights turned off unless ABSOLUTELY necessary, and never went out. Ever. 

My schedule was too erratic to reliably get a better second job, and I couldn't risk losing my main full-time job because despite the pay, I had benefits. I could barely afford to eat, but my medical and dental were paid.

Malaga is about 500k population. There are 34 bigger cities in the US and the price of rent changes a lot between them as well as does salary or pay, and usually cost of living goes hand in hand with wages.  
  
It is crazy how much the prices differ though. I bought a house (~200m2, 4 bedrooms and a study) last year for about $215k USD in my area, built in 2000. The same house in California is about $800k. Then again my area is lower wage compared to many other states.

I wasn't even thinking about moving when my office mate bought a house in the fall of 2009. She kept telling me about it and I thought ""I could maybe do that"" even though our circumstances were very different. She was able to do many improvements herself (and also had family money).

I investigated a little further and I closed in January 2010. I figured prices were only going to go up and there were still many houses to choose from because of the market collapse. I got lucky and found a flip that had been for sale too long. Everything else in my price range needed too much work. 

So maybe just keep an eye for what's out there and any programs you might qualify for. It might be easier than you think. First time home buyer's rebate was also available so I was able to upgrade a few more things after I moved in. 

There no shame in a mobile home, either. I liked that better than having a roommate or an apartment. I'd do it again if I needed to downsize. If I were on the coasts or a bigger city, I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to afford my own place. ",auntiepink,t2_enzuc,2,0,reddit3

Rather than raising the reward for work, by more fairly distributing the resources of society, perhaps by taxing the people who can actually afford a cushy lifestyle, with jets, multiple empty homes, garages full of super cars, etc, you want to create an environment where people are forced into whatever jobs conditions are available.

Inevitably this coercion will lead to wages being driven down to slave rates, since no one has any choice in the matter. The alternative is suicide or life on the streets. 

You better hope you're already very rich(in which case lucky you), or in an ultra secure, high demand job, that almsot no one else has the cpaability to do(again, lucky you).

Everyone wants to work. No one wants to be a slave. Give people a fair share of societies wealth. Give them a say in what happens to them ad semblance of cotnrol over their lives, and people will feel guilty about not working.

Congrats on being so good at life. I, too, worked full time from a young age. I was 15 when I started. 

Worked my way up at a good job, lost it because of the Olympics. They shut down several facilities in my city to renovate for practice spaces. Despite having been there 6 years, I was still not senior enough to keep my job. 

I had some savings, though, and found a new job. Significant pay cut, but had benefits (this is pretty standard here in Canada at any full time job). Worked there for three years and when the price of copper fell, I was literally reduced to handing out resumes at fast food places despite having not one, but two degrees. 

So I got a job as a supervisor at a fast food place. Worked my way up. Still hadn't recovered from a divorce where my ex husband would stalk me at all hours, call me hundreds, if not thousands of times a day, and the death of my only living relative.

Got a job in my field, but it was on call to start. Also picked up a job as a night janitor. 

I was able to pay bills. That was it, and some months I was short of any extra expense came up. I was 29. Not a starving college student who could mooch the occasional meal at home or maybe beg for $20 for groceries for the week. 

I was working more than one job but several times I had to go to the food bank. I couldn't even afford the food at my job sometimes, despite a heavy discount. 

I also didn't have a fridge, so I ate frozen meals that were on sale at Walmart. Again, at 29, 30, 31 years of age. Not a college student. 

I ended up realizing I was going into debt month over month trying to keep up. Quit my job, went back to school, and now I'm doing well, but I always remember those days when I was so poor I couldn't afford laundry detergent, dish soap, or any kind of ""treat"" food.

dlrelo1,t1_dlq06d9,2017-08-17 17:45:35,science,"If the doctor/healthcare provider is working in private practice, you absolutely can ask how much it will cost to get a procedure done.  If they don't know, they can refer you to billing, who will know.  That is because providers that are in private practice--especially those practices in rural networks or that work with large amounts of uninsured individuals--do this often. I'm sorry that you don't believe me, but that's the way it is.  This is especially true of minor procedures, in which the outcomes are consistent.  If you call your doctor and ask how much is a physical is (or your hospital) for a cash pay consumer, they will actually give you a price.  Same thing for say, labs, or immunizations, or anything else that is simple and consistent.  This pricing scheme is no different than how a vet or a mechanic works--i'll give you an estimate, but i can't guarantee that's what it's going to cost exactly--and nobody is sitting here crying that they aren't part of a market.

Although it works for small procedures, what you are saying about calling and getting a price, on the whole, doesn't really make sense for major procedures because of how those procedures are performed.  I had a very basic, one-hour procedure done in a hospital last month.  In order to do that, there had to be a facility, a surgeon, an anesthesiologist, and a nurse anesthetist, as well as nurses on call.  How, exactly, am I supposed to negotiate with them?  Do I call every single provider and figure out what their fee will be?  Are we assuming I even have the kind of medical literacy to know, for example, that I will need both the anesthesiologist and the anesthetist?  How are pre-procedure labs going to be billed out?  What if I have a reaction while under anesthesia, and they have to use more medications?  What if they open me up and find something unexpected?  Do they stop surgery until they can get a guarantee of further payment?  How do they know I am fiscally solvent--do they run a credit check on me, before performing a giant financial transaction in which there is no collateral?  (After all, why should they take a risk on credit payment from somebody like me? Should only people with the time and resources to develop good credit get healthcare?)  What if I die during the procedure--who pays them for their time? What about the salaries of people that YOU may not care about, but that are  required to make a hospital run correctly, like nurses, aides, janitors, quality assurance specialists, compliance officers, billers, etc., etc. etc.?  Are you negotiating in some kind of payment for those people, too?  Your doctor isn't a some mechanic that works out of his house.  Advanced, first-world healthcare requires a giant team of people--a team so large and so specialized, many members of that team don't even understand the essential job duties of other members of that team.  (Seriously, ask an Occupational Therapist - master's degree education, and most doctors don't actually know what we do.) And say they are able to do all those things with me--do they then do them for every single other person that they have as a patient?  At that rate, just negotiating payment would take many times the time that performing the procedure takes.   The idea is kind of absurd.

Insurance allows providers to basically guarantee a steady stream of customers and a certain amount of money paid per procedure, because insurance negotiates the ins and outs of what they will pay for and won't pay for ahead of time, with an entire team of people that are familiar with the procedures and know what is necessary.  

There IS a market.  The market is between 1.) your employer, who is paying 1/2 the cost of your insurance and gets to decide which plans you are offered, because they receive those plans at a discount as a result of being able to buy many plans at once, 2.) the healthcare provider, who decides what procedures they want to do, what insurances they will take, and what insurer-offered rates they will accept for procedures, and 3.) you, who can decide to proceed forward or not with your procedure given the terms of the health insurance that you signed up for.  If you're not happy with those terms, then you probably don't want a market, because, again, there IS a market.  YOU just aren't the person the hospital negotiates with for the price, because cash-pay consumers form a very small and incredibly unreliable base for them.  Your insurance absolutely calls them and tells them exactly how much a procedure will cost, and if the hospital bills out more than that, they have to eat the difference.

If you have insurance, you can call your insurance at any time, and ask what the maximum agreed upon amount for a specific procedure is--or just check your giant policy documents, because it's usually in there.  You can also ask what your maximum lifetime and yearly out of pocket costs can be to establish the upper end of what you might pay.  If you are a cash-pay consumer, you absolutely can call around and get quotes for procedures, and while they cannot always give you an actual, exact price, they can give you a range of prices.

Even IF hospitals had 100% price transparency, one of the requirements for price transparency to be of effective benefit to the consumer is a level of medical literacy high enough to know exactly what procedures are indicated.  For example, if you need a hip replacement, would it be best to have an anterior, posterior, or lateral surgical approach?  How much rehab will you need, and of what kind?  Knowing which option costs how much isn't exactly going to tell you which will have best long term outcomes for you.  That requires a doctor, which is already part of this whole needing to be paid equation.  

As a burgeoning healthcare provider, the idea that transparent pricing and more ""choice"" will automatically give people better healthcare is actually kind of absurd.  For example, before the ACA, rehabilitation and habilitation services were not a required benefit, and most people never stop to think that this is a benefit they might need.  So if you had a stroke, your insurance might cover your initial hospital visit, but would they cover the many hours of PT, Speech therapy, *and* OT you would need in order to be able to independently live life again?  The answer, in a lot of cases, was no, but people don't know that those things are things they need.  They don't know, for example, that stroke after depression is really common, or that 1/2 of all anal abscesses end up as fistulas that require surgical correction, or that not developing bedsores requires a coordinated team of people working together.  So why would they seek out and make sure all of those benefits are available in their health plan?  They didn't, which is why a lot of plans before the ACA just didn't have those things.

dlq3a8v,t1_dlq06d9,2017-08-16 22:14:00,science,"You apparently are not aware that cash pay, fee based medical services are available in many locations nationwide.   They are not usually available   at hospitals, but smaller practices all over the United states do cash pay.  You don't ask the doctor, you talk to whoever does the billing.  I have done it myself numerous times and many people in my field (rehab medicine) do it because reimbursement rates have dropped from several insurers, or the insurance doesn't cover a service the patient wants.  

The fact is that providers within the market HAVE to cater to insurers to get patient volume.  That is a direct result of the free market not being regulated.  

At this point, I'm starting to think you're some kind of troll, because the fact that healthcare operates in a market in the US is pretty well established.  I mean, by your definition, any business that can't give you an exact price up front don't operate in a market.  So I guess construction or the sewer guys that have to go over their estimate aren't a market.  Or lawyers that bill hourly until the job is done.

What is a legal scam? I seriously can't think of any.

If they aren't happy with the cuts in quality of the product they can decide to not buy the product. Nobody is forcing you to buy it.

I'm acting like that because it is. Nobody spends money on things they don't want or need. Except for taxation, which isn't a voluntary transaction. 

>And things that seem positive can also end up being negative, for example buying a drug that kills your pain but will significantly lower your life span. 

Which you bought willingly. It is only a transaction that negatively impacted you if you made a bad decision or if the other party withheld information, which is and should be illegal.

Does it help former coal miners in rural regions to have their jobs be replaced by hundreds of trained engineers in another part of the country?

The reality is that there are a lot of workers out there who cannot so easily be retrained for a new job. Some could, and would be willing to, but I think many would not be able to transition into these new jobs.

If this restructuring of the energy sector results in less unskilled manual labor jobs (and by unskilled I mean requires no education, not that it is easy or simple) in favor of more highly educated jobs, then that former group still ends up being unemployed as a result of this shift.

And while the article touches briefly on issues like many of these proposed new manufacturing jobs can be located anywhere because they are not bound by the presence of natural resources the way jobs in the fossil fuel extraction industry are, there are no guarantees (and I would say probably no reason) for why these proposed new jobs would appear in the same places - meaning the individual workers losing their jobs will not be able to work these new ones.

It seems like to me this is very much a top-down perspective of the situation, and the article fails to account for the human side all that much. The net profit of jobs will go up, and it will be beneficial for both governments and the energy sector as a whole, but it is still a less than preferable solution if the reality is that thousands of people lose jobs that will afterwards no longer exist, and thousands of *different* people get new jobs elsewhere.",bobosuda,t2_5958f,1,0,reddit1

Meanwhile the developing world is increasing their energy demands; rightfully so and their increase in quality of life is amazing. But unless we can get the world to drastically decrease energy consumption, we’re going to need to transition to all renewables incredibly quickly to avoid 2 degrees Celsius.

If the rich countries want the developing countries to decrease pollution as they increase energy consumption, they should invest and subsidize substantially more than they are.

Including the eventual carbon sequestration industry where we literally just produce energy to distill carbon dioxide out of atmosphere and process coal (and synthetic hydrocarbons for necessary applications), you're basically looking at the foreseeable future of human species to undo all the fossil fuel release in the prior 300 years. And that process can really only start after we first get rid of all of the fossil fuels, and build enough surplus energy production that we can use any significant amount of energy for this.

But the first step really is to improve our carbon capture processes. Improve the efficiency, and use the produced synthetic (carbon neutral) fuels to replace fossil fuels for those applications where you really need the densest energy storage besides nuclear power, and eventually we would be able to build enough collection capacity to make a dent into the CO2 concentration.

But it will take a long time. Let's say that most of the CO2 has been released within the last 250 years; I would say it might take at least ten times that amount of time to re-capture the released carbon.

So, a hundred generations might actually be low-balling it. And assuming one generations is approximately 25 years, that would mean 2,500 years.

Perhaps all those coal miners moaning about losing their jobs to climate change will actually be hired to *dig the captured coal back into the mines and seal it there*, like a bizarre time reverse story from Vonnegut.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,75,0,reddit1

I don’t get why Americans are fine giving so much money to renewables, often for horribly inefficient projects that just line special interest pockets, anyone remember Solyndra? I know large real estate funds that is all something like industrial warehouse space, or multi family housing, class A office space, etc, but then will randomly have some giant solar or wind power property in the portfolio. When you ask the portfolio managers why that’s there they laugh and say because they get a huge tax credit basically making the bulk of their distributions to investors tax free over the life of the fund, and they buy or develop these assets in states that guarantee some base level of purchasing of the electricity produced regardless of the true market rate. I remember seeing some back in the day where they literally built solar farms and never actually operated them, just wanted the tax credit and would plan to sell the equipment at the end of the fund.

You're right that the money has to come from somewhere. Does it make sense to throw all the money in already existing equipment away?

h7c97by,t1_h7c57x8,2021-08-01 18:26:20,science,">Why not nuclear? Why wait to find a dense energy source when we already have one.

I was referring to applications where you need high energy density, but nuclear power is not practical for weight or safety reasons.

For large scale energy production, nuclear fission is an excellent choice, probably among the best available at the moment (opinions vary on what is number 1 at different times).

However: While nuclear energy is the highest in terms of energy density of fuel, the reactors to use that fuel in have to be quite large, both in terms of the actual pressurized reactor vessel, and even more mass in terms of radiation shielding (although if you live in Soviet Union, you might not get that luxury).

The reactor needs to be large because if you make it too small, the power output decreases faster than its physical dimensions. A reactor small and light enough to be feasible for aviation application would not provide enough power for an aircraft big enough to carry it, and the same holds true for automobiles. In other words, an internal combustion engine or a jet engine can have much higher *power to weight ratio* than a nuclear reactor small enough to replace it.

Because of this, nuclear power is not practical to use for aircraft or road transportation. The smallest types of vehicles where nuclear reactors are really practical are certain types of ocean-going ships: Nuclear submarines, nuclear-powered icebreakers, and nuclear aircraft carriers.

Anything smaller than that has to be powered by something else. 

Solar has too little power for vehicular use outside special tech demonstrators.

Wind is a good supplemental energy source for ships, has a long history for maritime propulsion, and will likely be taken advantage of more in the future. But wind powered cars are not likely to be a thing despite Veritasium's faster-than-wind propeller cart.

Electric vehicles are great! They don't have any emissions during drive, which makes them ideal for large cities that currently suffer from poor air quality, much of which is caused by noxious particles from internal combustion engines.

However, you can't really use batteries for aircraft because of two main reasons. First, batteries don't have nearly as much energy per mass (or energy per volume) as hydrocarbon fuels do. This means an electric aircraft would not have the same range as an aircraft powered by chemical fuel, or if it did, it could not carry nearly as much payload because most of the aircraft would consist of batteries, leaving no room (or lifting performance) for paying customers or cargo.

Second reason is that a battery pack catching on fire on a Tesla is manageable because you can stop reasonably quickly, exit the vehicle, and you'd probably be all right as long as the battery doesn't explode and cause a crash or render you incapable of exiting the vehicle.

If a battery pack catches on fire in an electric aircraft that is in the air, getting out immediately is usually not an option. You'd have to land first, and hope you can then exit the plane after the landing.

So, because of these limitations, internal combustion engine powered cars might see a 70-80-90% replacement by electric vehicles, especially in large cities. But people who need cars for longer distances, and especially in cold temperatures, will likely have to continue using cars powered by gasoline.

And for air transportation, jet fuel is going to remain the only viable option. Likely forever. What we will need to do is make sure that the fuels consumed by road and air transportation needs are not extracted from underground - rather, we will need to replace fossil fuels with carbon-neutral fuels synthesized from atmospheric CO2.

For that, we will need a lot of energy. Which is why we will need all available power production methods: Wind, solar, currently existing hydroelectric plants, tidal power plants, ocean wave power plants, nuclear fission power plants and - in the future - nuclear fusion power plants. We will need all of them, and as their capacity increases we can start dropping the use of fossil fuels, starting from coal which is the worst in terms of CO2 emissions.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,2,0,reddit1

Notice how you didn't contest my figures on loss of life, because you *know* how massive the death toll is from carbon?

This is not an actual debate. One source of energy is pushing the entire planet off the edge, and kills thousands of people a day, mostly the most vulnerable and poor. The other has a few downsides, none of which are even 1% as terrible as the downsides for fossil fuels.

Harnessing a river's flow by damming it is essentially a death blow to migratory fish population upstream of that point, and the effects from that can vary from minor to severe. Overall it's not good for biodiversity.

Additionally, methane emissions from rotting biological material on the bottom of reservoir lakes adds its own load onto the greenhouse gas situation.

In my opinion, building new large scale hydroelectric power stations with fully dammed rivers should not be done if we can avoid it.

h7bhoyw,t1_h7bc9xd,2021-08-01 14:53:18,science,"Solar has its own issues. I think the biggest one is that you only get 1.366 kW/m^2 of solar energy *at maximum*, and that's in a situation where the solar panels or collectors are directly pointed at the Sun, and never shadow each other.

The other issue is that the Sun is only visible from half of the Earth's surface at any given time, and gives light to each individual solar energy collector for about 50% of the time. And since actuated solar collectors are much more expensive than static ones, you usually see solar panels or collectors set up on roof tops with a rough optimization of what angle they should be pointed at.

Large areas covered with solar collectors or solar panels also seem to become deadly to local insect populations and vegetation. What this means is that large scale, centralized energy production with solar is unlikely to happen.

The best use case for solar is probably a distributed model of energy production for supplementing the daytime energy consumption of individual households. Either by solar collectors to utilize the heat of the Sun, or by solar panels to generate power. Although I would point out solar panel production has pretty significant environmental impact, and the efficiency of solar panels isn't the greatest.

Wind is good, and wind exists on both day and night and even though there's a variation in wind speed, by choosing the wind farm locations carefully, you can get good power for most days of the year.

Nuclear is great for its energy density and high safety record. The problem with fission is mainly the human factor of operation and planning, and secondarily the long term storage of nuclear waste.

Personally I think we are going to need fusion power until we can really start to sequester carbon on an impactful scale. But while we're waiting for that we have the resources to replace fossil fuels. I just don't see how we could have the luxury to afford to not use every option at our disposal.

What this means, in my opinion, is that the conversations about what is best carbon-free energy are a waste of time and effort. Wind, solar, and nuclear should not be seen as competitors. They should all be seen as equally important alternatives to fossil fuels.

There might be people who don't like wind, or hydroelectric, or solar power, and certainly a lot of people dislike nuclear power, for some deserved and many very much undeserved reasons.

So the assumption is that the free market creates jobs for everyone (partially true when it's not in the bust phase of the business cycle), therefore if you aren't working and doing something for other people, you don't *deserve* them to lift a finger for you.  Unless you are among the 'deserving' poor, example you worked in your life and are now elderly.

Anyways we *already have mechanisms* for helping though society believes *deserve* help.  And AGI/robotics would make it *very cheap* to provide for people, at least without the *intellectual property* costs all this stuff will cost.

So it's viable.  I agree with your point though it took just a few months for the federal government to print money and give everyone in the USA a check.  So it seems like it might be easier than it sounds once AGI/robotics are here and commonplace.

Revenue neutral tax and dividend system, where all proceeds of the tax are paid out in equal payments to everybody in the country, to avoid poorer people being prefentially hurt when they can't afford to switch to other options. Essentially a wealth transfer between those who pollute a lot, and those who don't. 

This would add: 

- $2 / gallon of gasoline (in effect a lifetime subsidy to electric cars charged by renewables of at least $10,000)

- $180 / MWh of coal electricity (wholesale electricity is around $40 / MWh, so this would quintuple the cost of coal)

- $80 / MWh of natural gas electricity (triples its cost)

- $40 / 1000 miles for economy Air fares. (Nearly double a lot of low cost short haul air fares)

- $1000 per year to costs of heating a house using natural gas. (Doubles the cost)

- $4 / kg of lamb or beef (about a 50% increase).

- $2.5 per board-foot for clearcut timber without replanting (about $40,000 for timber for a typical house)


This would all provide real strong incentives to switch things over. 

To give time for switches to happen, without demolishing the economy in one go, these should probably ramp up over a period of 10 years or so. So put a tax of $20 / ton in now, increasing by $20 per year until it gets to $200 / ton by 2030. Everybody will know its coming and have to make the switches. But you would have the devastating effect of suddenly bumping the price of wholesale electricity by a factor of 2 or 3 overnight, before any changes can happen.

Edit: Regarding traded ""credits"", there shouldn't be credits for ""we went low emissions and therefore emitted X less"". However, I'd be completely fine with equal amount tax credits for actual negative emissions. For instance, a mature forest will trap about 125 tons of carbon long term if left undisturbed.

You may be overestimating the space required.

An area like the US southwest gets insolation of [2,000kWh/m^2 per year](https://energyinformative.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/global-irradiance.jpg); with a 25%-efficient solar panel (up from 2019's [22% average](https://about.bnef.com/blog/solars-hot-new-thing-nears-production-qa/)), that's 500kWh/m2/yr of delivered electricity. The world's total energy consumption is around [600 quads/yr](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=87&t=1), which is 180T kWh/yr. Most of that is burned in heat engines at low efficiency (e.g., oil in cars, coal for electricity), so let's round that down to 100T kWh/yr / 500 kWh/m2/yr = 200B m2 = 200,000 km2.

Which seems like a large number, but even a densely-populated nation like India has regions like the [Thar desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_Desert) with 170,000km2 of land (in India) and a population density [similar to Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Scotland).

For the US's 100 quads of energy consumption, the area required would be around 33,000 sq km, or [around 2/3 of Coconino County, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_counties_in_the_United_States_by_area) - 0.3% of the US.

With very few exceptions, land use is not a meaningful constraint on solar or wind power.

> The other issue is that the Sun is only visible from half of the Earth's surface at any given time

[Most utility-scale solar projects being installed in the US now include storage](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/wind-solar-make-up-70-of-new-generation-in-2021-while-batteries-gain-mome/593278/).

They typically include 4h of storage, which is the duration [this study](http://www.2035report.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2035-Report.pdf) used to show the US grid can be 90% decarbonized with 600GWh of storage (p.16), or about $100B at today's battery prices (~$150/kWh * 600GWh), which is roughly [2 years of power sector investment for the US](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2019/power-sector).

> The best use case for solar is probably a distributed model of energy production for supplementing the daytime energy consumption of individual households.

[Household solar PV is about 5x as expensive as utility-scale solar PV per kWh](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020/).

> The problem with fission is mainly the human factor of operation and planning

And *time* - neither the US nor EU has managed to build a new reactor without massive cost and schedule overruns in *decades*, meaning it's *highly* unlikely new nuclear will be able to make a meaningful contribution to their power grids before the 2030s. By contrast, renewables have their supply chains operating at massive scale right now (in fact, [wind+solar+storage are now the large majority of new power generation added world-wide](https://www.carbonbrief.org/exceptional-new-normal-iea-raises-growth-forecast-for-wind-and-solar-by-another-25)).

100TWh of nuclear is simpler for grid operators to deal with than 100TWh of wind+solar+storage, but due to the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions (as well as deaths from air pollution), a good solution for clean power now is better than a great solution in 20 years.

That being said, in my opinion it's a good idea for the US and EU to rebuild their nuclear supply chains, and for nations which already have them (China, Russia, India, Japan, S Korea) to build more to diversify our power options.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit1

h7e194c,t1_h7dnurk,2021-08-02 03:29:15,science,">**You may be overestimating the space required.**

Well, the solar constant can't really be changed. What it means is an absolute upper limit of power per surface area, and in reality things like panel efficiency (if we're generating electricity), time of day, length of day, and whether the panels articulate to track the sun will drop that significantly.

Even somewhere at the equator where the Sun reliable goes almost perfectly overhead and you can just lay the panel flat on the ground, the power curve over daytime starts from zero as night turns into morning, then goes up in a sort of sine wave / bell curve shape, and back down to zero as evening turns to night.

So while the solar constant is about 1.3 kW/m^2 (that's the amount of radiation the square metre receives when it's facing flat towards the Sun), if we want to figure the *average power over day* we need to consider the variable amount of light over the day. For 12 hours, it's entirely dark. Then during daytime, let's assume the amount of light hits 1.3 kW/m^2.

Since work is the integral of power over time, we can look at the *surface area* covered by the light cycle, and from a very simple visual estimate I would say the average power over day is somewhere between a quarter and a third of solar constant.

So this is about equivalent of being 70% in the darkness and 30% in light with full solar constant. That comes up to about 9.36 kWh/day.

Over a year, that would come to about 3,416 MWh/year without counting losses from weather variation etc.

This figure is in the same magnitude as the quoted figure here:

>**An area like the US southwest gets insolation of 2,000kWh/m^2 per year;**

...so after that sanity check, let's accept that as a reasonable annual amount of energy per area.

So what does that mean?

> **with a 25%-efficient solar panel (up from 2019's 22% average), that's 500kWh/m2/yr of delivered electricity.**

I would prefer to look at power figures rather than absolute amount of energy, because that gives a clearer picture of how much area you need to cover in solar panels to get a certain average power output.

So, 2000 kWh per year comes down to about 228 watts per square metre. That is the average power of sunlight that a square metre at US Southwest receives.

Let's further assume a 25% efficiency solar panel.

What this means is now you get about 57 W/m^2 of electricity, measured at the source (each individual panel). Add in a rough estimate of 5% of energy being lost in electric power transfer, so that's about 54 watts per square metre.

>**The world's total energy consumption is around 600 quads/yr, which is 180T kWh/yr.**


World's electric consumption is indeed around 600 quads/year, or 180,000 TWh/year. That comes to around 20×10^12 watts.

> **Most of that is burned in heat engines at low efficiency (e.g., oil in cars, coal for electricity), so let's round that down to 100T kWh/yr / 500 kWh/m2/yr = 200B m2 = 200,000 km2.**

Whoa there, the electricity consumption measures the consumption of *electricity*, not the fuels to generate said electricity.

If we need 180,000 TWh of electricity per year, we won't need any less electricity just because we switch to making all of that with solar panels. We just stop using the fossil fuel power plants for making electricity - we'll still need the same amount of it.

So if we take that need for continuous average of 20×10^12 watts of electric power, now we can divide that by 54 watts per square metre, and the result is the amount of square metres required to cover the Earth's entire electricity production: The grand total comes up to about 381×10^9 m^2 or 380,517 km^2 by my count.

>**Which seems like a large number, but even a densely-populated nation like India has regions like the Thar desert with 170,000km2 of land (in India) and a population density similar to Scotland.**


It is indeed a large number and the problem isn't even so much the absolute amount of area that needs to be covered, but rather the *amount of solar panels required*.

From a brief google search, the most powerful solar panels currently in production (or soon to be released) seem to be 2.4 metres tall and 1.3 metres wide, giving each unit a surface area of around 3.12 square metres.

Again dividing the total required panel surface area by the area of individual panel, that means you'd need to manufacture *and maintain* 122,115,384,615 units of these solar panels to cover the entire world's electricity demands.

To put that number in perspective, in order to build that amount in one hundred years' time would mean that each year, you would need to build approximately 1,221,153,846 solar panels.

That is, 1.22 billion units per year and you'd be finished in a hundred years' time.

***Assuming that none of the units need to be replaced in that time.***


The big concern with this is that, at some point, you'd reach a point where your production capacity was overwhelmed by *just the need to swap out broken panels for new ones*.


Oh, and you can't pack solar panels completely side to side, you have to leave a bit of a maintenance gap so that it's possible to repair or swap them in a reasonable manner. So let's say a massive panel installation would have them in rows, with access paths 1.2 metres wide at each side. That would mean each panel would require a (minimum Amazon grade) surface area of 1.2 m x  1.3 m = 1.56 m^2 for maintenance access. This increases the area taken by each panel by about 50%, so the actual area requirements balloon up to about 570,776 km^2 which is pretty close to the surface area of Kenya.

Of course we're not going to cover Kenya in solar panels, that would be daft. We're definitely going to be using solar panels among every other carbon neutral energy production method, but we most likely won't be able to fulfill the world's entire electricity consumption needs with solar only. And building huge solar farms just seems impractical to say the least.

Storage helps to balance the load locally, which means solar panels will likely be used to supplement household power needs more than anything else. Putting solar panels on the roofs is the most sensible place for them anyway - that area is already denied for normal biospheres, so might as well use that area effectively, right?

I'm not trying to bash solar power unjustly. It is, and will continue to be, an important and worthwhile tool to supersede fossil fuels in our energy production. But it is not going to be doing it alone, and talking about exactly how much solar power we would ""need"" to power the world is ultimately futile because that's not going to happen. Or, in other words, I'm *not* trying to say we shouldn't build solar power because building enough of it to power the world is impossible - that's not the point.

If anything, I'm saying that *trying to rely on any single energy production method* to power the entire world would be silly, and we would stand much better chance of replacing fossil fuels sooner if we just built up *every non-fossil power source at the same time*.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit1

If your parents didn't have good jobs and save money you don't ""deserve"" to go to college because you will not be able to pay the fees yourself with available jobs (unless you 'earn it' by risking your life/limb in the military).  You don't get government subsidies for health insurance or mortgages unless you have a source of income to pay for the cost upfront.

No, that's the total **primary energy** consumption, per the EIA page linked to from the 600 quads/yr figure.  Most of that is burned in heat engines at 20-50% efficiency (coal plants, car engines, etc.), so the amount of electricity needed to replace that primary energy would be *much* less.

As a result, I'm going to reduce your solar panel count from 122B to ~70B below and your watt count from 2x10^13 to 1x10^13.

(Of course, a factor of ~2 doesn't make that much difference in a back-of-the-envelope feasibility calculation like this.)


> the problem isn't even so much the absolute amount of area that needs to be covered

So you agree that the power density and area required for solar is not a major problem?  Good, that was my point.

However...

> but rather the amount of solar panels required.

Why is that a problem?

Yes, 70B is a large number, but *anything* to do with the entire world's energy supply is going to be a large number, so it's a non-argument to just say ""gosh, that's a big number!""

[The world builds 100M cars per year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262747/worldwide-automobile-production-since-2000/) (pre-covid), each of which is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger and more complicated than a solar panel.  At that rate, the world will build 3B cars between now and 2050; given that, 70B solar panels does not seem outlandish.

To sanity-check, note that the average price of a new car in the US is [$40k](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-now-the-average-price-of-a-new-car-11613683827), vs. a capital cost of about [$900/kW-peak](https://www.lazard.com/media/451419/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-140.pdf) for utility-scale solar PV (p.16); at a 25% capacity factor, that's 250w/$900, or $3.6/watt.

3B cars * $30k (75% of the US price) = $90T of cars manufactured in 30 years *assuming manufacturing stops growing*.

$90T of solar panels @ $3.6/watt-constant = 25T watts = 25x10^12 watts = 2.5x the amount calculated above.

In other words, the challenge of manufacturing and installing enough solar panels to replace *all* world energy usage by 2050 is just under half as large as the challenge of manufacturing the number of cars the world typically manufactures in a year.  The sheer number of panels involved is not an issue.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit1

Nuclear power is complex and expensive, but the waste it emits can be stored safely and remotely. Moreover, it is efficient enough, and does not require the same rare minerals as solar panels and batteries, nor does it have the inconsistency of wind. Remember, we do not have enough rare earth minerals for battery storage to work worldwide.

It is not perfect. But it does not spew lethal CO2 into the air, to say nothing of the other downsides. Fossil fuels need to *go*, the sooner the better.

Right, I misread your post. Apologies. 

So, yes, if we *only* intend to replace the world's electricity consumption with solar panels rather than primary energy consumption, then it becomes a lot more feasible task (by a factor of about seven, if the world's electricity consumption is about 25 PWh/year and primary energy consumption is 180 PWh/year).

[But if the goal is to replace fossil fuels, that would only make a fairly small dent in them.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Energy_Flow_US_2016.png)

That means, as we wean the world of fossil fuels, the final electricity consumption will increase correspondingly. The good thing is that electricity is a lot more efficient in most cases, so the efficiency losses will occur mostly in the electric production end (i.e. the efficiency of a solar panel is around 25% for current high end units). So yes, you are correct, assuming all of the ""Energy services"" in the above diagram were covered by electricity, we wouldn't need as much primary energy output as we currently do with less efficient fossil fuel-based turbines and generators.

However, some of the fossil fuels used by transportation and industrial applications could be replaced with electricity (EV's, induction furnaces instead of blast furnaces, etc.) but in some cases it's not going to be practical. In these cases, moving from fossil fuels to synthetic carbon neutral fuels will be necessary. And that process has a lot worse efficiency than just generating electricity, so that will probably offset the calculations towards the other end.

>So you agree that the power density and area required for solar is not a major problem? Good, that was my point.

In a fashion. It isn't *as much* of a problem as the production and maintenance volume required.

Wind power kind of suffers from similar issues, by the way, but it's a lot more forgiving in terms of surface area because wind power extracts energy from air currents, which are essentially convection from solar energy absorbed on a much larger area than the wind turbines themselves. Because of this, a single wind turbine can have average power of 1.67 MW; with solar power, that would require covering a square of about 175 x 175 metres with solar panels somewhere in the tropic. In terms of ""how many panels"", that comes up to 9,912 panels - let's say 10,000 panels (size 3.2 x 2.4 metres) for one wind turbine.

>Yes, 70B is a large number, but anything to do with the entire world's energy supply is going to be a large number, so it's a non-argument to just say ""gosh, that's a big number!""

The number itself is a problem because it represents a high unit number, and with high unit numbers come many issues.

10,000 panels is many panels to build, monitor, and maintain. One wind turbine is just one wind turbine.

Likewise, 1,000 wind turbines is many turbines to build, monitor, and maintain. One nuclear power plant is just one nuclear power plant.

It's not that I'm saying it's a problem just because it's a big number, but rather to illustrate problems of the scale of production required.

>Why is that a problem?

For example let's say there's a thousand factories (production lines, really, but let's call them factories) that produce these solar panels. They make one panel every 10 minutes, so in 10 minutes you get 1,000 new panels. In one hour you get 6,000 panels. In one day you get 144,000 panels, and in one year you get 52,560,000 panels. That's a lot of panels, isn't it?

So with this pace, to get to 70 billion units, it would take these 1000 factories running for 1,331 years to get up to the required amount.

For 10,000 factories, it would take 133 years to hit the target.

For 100,000 factories producing solar panels day and night, one unit per 10 minutes, we're getting to human-relevant time scale of 13 years and 4 months, but 100,000 factories doesn't honestly sound reasonable considering the amount of rare earth metals required for these solar panels. So let's assume the slightly less ludicrous 10,000 factories which *might* be doable.

But is it feasible to expect these factories to produce this many solar panels?

To answer that question we need to figure out how often a solar panel needs to be replaced.

First of all, current solar panels are built to work for 25-30 years. Let's give future tech a benefit of doubt and assume they can last for 50 years.

Secondly, failure rates among solar panels are currently around 5 failures per 10,000 units in a year.

Third, there's damage from external sources (sand storms, hailstorms, floods, exposure to extreme heat or cold, damage caused by animals, and of course vandalism).


The second factor is low enough that even with the full 70 billion units, you would ""only"" have to replace 35 million units every year (around 100,000 every day). If you somehow got to this point, you could keep up with this demand with only around 700 factories.

But the real problem is that once you have been producing these solar panels for 50 years, the first ones will need to start being replaced.

In 50 years, you can only produce up to 26.28 billion solar panels. But since you have to basically start replacing the first units at that point, it turns out you'll never be able to build more than that with only 10,000 factories.


So the amount of factories you need to pull this off depends on the ""expiration time"" of these solar panels, and of course the actual production rate that each factory can maintain. If they can make significantly more of these things than one every 10 minute, then you'd be fine. If you can make the solar panels last significantly longer, then it might be doable with ""only"" 10,000 factories.

But if the solar panel's life time is ""only"" 50 years per unit, then that means you need to be able to build the whole amount of 70 billion solar panels within that 50 years, after which you will need to keep those factories working forever to replace the units that are expiring.

For panels that are good for 50 years, and each factory producing one every 10 minutes, you'd need about 27 thousand factories.


By the way, wind power also suffers from similar issues because of the relatively high unit number compared to more centralized power plants - but not nearly to the same extent as solar does. Because of this, I think wind power has more potential than solar. Also producing the wind turbines doesn't produce as much harmful toxic waste.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit1

It's not helpful to make up an arbitrary number and then pretend it has relevance to the question of whether this scale of manufacturing is feasible in the real world.

As I showed, manufacturing and installing the needed quantity of solar PV by 2050 would require ~40% of the manufacturing capacity the world already devotes to building cars.  It's - empirically - well within our manufacturing capabilities.

For interest's sake, let's calculate what fraction of current-day manufacturing capacity it would take.

I agree. It's more of a way to split the numbers into more manageable pieces and to figure out exactly how much production capability you *would* need to fulfill the quota in a reasonable timeframe.

I don't think it's quite that simplistic. That's manufacturing capability measured in dollars, which doesn't really mean anything - it's just an economical estimate.

Besides the point, building solar panel manufacturing into an industry that covers 8.7% of global manufacturing capacity *within 30 years* is unlikely to be practicable.

Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy if I'm wrong if the production capabilities are much faster than I thought. In fact, that seems to be the case: In the year 2019, solar module production was 140 gigawatts of capacity (nominal capacity, as in ""this is the maximum power the panels can deliver in full daylight""). If we divide 140 GW by 54 watts per square meter (which was calculated as the effective average power of a solar panel in the tropic), we get the surface area of solar panels - and when we divide that surface area by the dimensions of ""standard solar panel"" I've been using, we get a figure of about 338 million units per year.

If you remember from my figures above with the completely arbitrary numbers, I estimated that 10,000 factories would produce about 526 million units. So in terms of production, I'm happy to learn that we are already now at the level of about 6,426 ""factories"", which was the arbitrary production unit that produces one reference solar panel in 10 minutes.

What this means is that with current production capability, the time to cover world's (current) electricity needs would be measured in hundreds of years. If we multiply the production capacity by ten, then the time would shrink by one order of magnitude, to tens of years.

To be exact, with current production capacity the 70 billion unit mark would be met in about 207 years.

So yeah, it's more feasible than I thought. Still a hell of a large amount of units that will need to be cleaned, serviced, maintained, replaced etc.

Would rather see roof top panels than covering vast amounts of land with them, though.

There are also other sides to this, such as the fact that we don't need to replace all current electricity production with solar because a bunch of it is already carbon-neutral.

[Citation Needed]

You might be right, you might be wrong, but ""I think that number is too big"" is not a compelling argument.  Without tying it to real-world data, ""I think"" is quantitatively meaningless.

To get a sense of what is possible in the real world, we can go back to car manufacturing, which increased from ~60M/yr in the early 2000s to ~100M/yr in the late 2010s.  That increase *alone* represents the total amount of manufacturing we're talking about needing for solar panels, and was built out in *15 years* just as part of business-as-usual.

Again, taking the abstract numbers and comparing them to real life contextualizes them and allows us to see their size relative to real-life capabilities.  In this case, building out that much manufacturing capacity for a single industry actually happened over the course of the last *15 years*, so it's clearly something that could feasibly happen again over the next *30 years*.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit1
h7m7yw6,t1_h7luxbq,2021-08-03 23:57:41,science,"Solar panels are not as complex as cars, you're right about that. But just like cars, their production volume is directly affected by things like availability of the components and raw materials required to manufacture them.

Even if the demand for a product skyrockets, the supply has to keep up in order for actual production volume to increase in the same ratio. If demand increases more than supply, then the economic value of the production goes up, even if the actual production doesn't.

For example, the semiconductor shortage (caused by manufacturing issurs with increased demand) has caused a general shortage of computer components, and that has affected the production of not only things like computer CPUs and GPUs, but also seemingly unrelated products like cars, household appliances, and everything else that relies on semiconductor electronics becaise they are so dependent on computers.

Just like you have called my doubts into question, I would caution against simply assumimg that it's physically possible to increase production volume by some arbitrary amount. Economically, growth happens when demand increases. I could certainly see the demand of photovoltaic panels increasing ten, hundred, or even thousandfold in a short time as the climate catastrophe progresses. But increase of actual production depends on whether the production of raw materials and base components can keep up with the increased demand, and whether new production facilities can be built quickly enough.

The increase in car production you mentioned was about 67%. But solar panel industry would have to grow much faster: If I remember correctly, the kind of volume required for solar panels would be equivalent to 8.3% of the global manufacturing capacity (in terms of monetary value). How much is it now? I don't think it's currently anything close to 5.5% of global capacity, which is the same ratio as with car production increase you mentioned.

I don't think it's currently even half of a percent (though I vould be wrong). But almost certainly the relative growth required would far surpass the growth of auto industry.

With the kind of production increase you're talking about, I think it's more than likely that one or more of the base components in the supply chain would become a ""bottleneck"" that limits the entire industry's production capacity.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit1
