I worked in the IT department of a small company and was the only woman on the team. My boss was otherwise a fantastic mentor, my yearly reviews were always excellent but the yearly raise % was terrible.

After a couple of years, I found out my male colleague was getting significantly higher raises. Knowing it was possible, I started a conversation with my boss basically saying I know Matt is getting higher raises, what do I need to work on to get to Matt's level?

My boss responded with ""You're actually a better employee than Matt, but you're a woman. One day you're going to get married and have kids and it's not worth investing as much into you as an asset. He'll need the money to support a family someday. I'm sorry, it's just how the world works.""

I was absolutely stunned, and young so I didn't do the right thing and call him out on his sexism. Instead I replied ""Oh I'm never having kids so that won't be a problem!""

I suggested they at least put their policy, whatever it may be, unpaid, etc. In the employee manual. 

Big mistake. I was told that women rarely come back to work if having a baby so there’s no way they would be investing in maternity leave, that that was an unreasonable ask and most women don’t receive maternity leave.

Which yes, is true. Doesn't stop it from happening though, and if employers are careful, they can't/don't get in trouble for it.

I once had a job where hiring/firing was part of my duties. I was specifically told not to hire women in childbearing years for anything other than minimum wage/disposable jobs. So there were a number of female employees, but they were all unskilled and easily replaceable. 

When it came to hiring for more senior or skilled jobs, they had me hire women 45+ that appeared to like working (ie would stay with the company for a long time) And used the justification that these women had 'years of experience, making them more qualified than the 26 year old with 4 years experience.

They knew exactly what they were doing an how to cover their tracks. I didn't stay there a super long time, but I needed the job when I had it. As to why I didn't 'whistle blow' them, they never put anything in writing, and it was a male dominated industry, more than 50 but less than 100 employees. Would have been difficult to make a case. Also, small town, would have been career over for me.

Just saying that was my experience, and it's not even an isolated one in the US, it just isn't spoken of very often.

Not hiring women because we may have children, or not offering full-time hours or promotions for this reason, or not providing maternity leave because we may not return to the job after giving birth, or generally disadvantaging females in the workplace because of our ability to become pregnant and give birth and the expectation that we will be the primary caregivers for any children we have, is sex discrimination.

And as you have noticed, you are feeling the impact of that sex discrimination despite not currently being pregnant, despite not having children, and despite not planning to ever have children.

This hurts all of us.

Frankly, it hurts male workers too, although in the short-term they seem to benefit. If any worker is disadvantaged or abused, it hurts all workers. It lowers the standards for all workers, spooks workers into ""behaving"" and doing what the bosses want lest they be next (what happens if one of this boss's male employees wants to take paternity leave or go part-time for parenting reasons?), and undermines solidarity among workers, AKA the willingness to unionise and fight for better conditions.",,,2,0,reddit4

... and some companies ONLY want female workers.  
Imagine a man complaining about not getting hired because he isn't a woman. Nobody would care even the least bit.   


I feel for you, because finding a job is exhausting for everyone, but I personally don't see any problem in hiring practices. The company owner(s) risk their money building the business and keeping it alive. They decide what kind of team they need to achieve the most success. If hiring more women is the best strategy, then those companies will outperform the other ones and it will become the norm.  
Hiring practices are only a problem because people make them into a problem. If a company doesn't want to hire you, then good, it's probably a terrible environment for you anyway.  
Having governments step in and force companies to hire certain people is not going to fix things, because companies will ignore them if it is better for business.  
If the boss actually stated that they don't hire women because they can potentially get pregnant, then they are probably going to lose out on a lot of good potential employees, because there are more women in universities.  
Also, getting a clear answer these days is amazing. Currently, I see that when people get rejected from a job interview, they no longer know what the reason is and thus don't know what to do to improve their value in the job market, because businesses are too afraid of getting sued to speak the truth.

There are other reasons as well like an increased probability of harrasment lawsuits etc. All those things considered if you dont have a job which specifically needs a female perspective, it akes absolute sense if you have two similarly competent applicants, to choose the male one every single time. Because why would you voluntarily take that risk for your business?

And this is why most developed countries demand a certain percentage of female employees. Because except for the smallest of businesses we understand that empolyers also have a certain social responsibility.

hul48tt,t3_sensb2,2022-01-28 14:34:47,TwoXChromosomes,"Ironically I learned the hard way that getting in despite there being a bias against you is not ideal. The irony here is that in my case I was rejected for a room in a student home after an interview and they actually used the excuse of sex. These were student flats owned by a rental company that allowed each group (where the group shared a kitchen, bathroom(s) etc) to select new students so that they would fit with the group. They invited me for an interview/tour, and afterwards called me to let me know that they had decided after all they wanted to add a guy back to the group since a guy had left that room and it would keep the balance of M/F. Upon which I wondered why the h*** they invited me in the first place since they knew I was F. About a week or two later the rental company called me to let me know I could have that room after all. Apparently if the group rejects too many candidates they override their rejects at some point. I did live there for a while but I never felt comfortable, first of all because rejected at first, secondly because I really didn't fit in that group. They were incredibly incohesive anyway. I think the group had 16 students in it and we never really cooked together. One night I was one of three students who cooked pasta for 1 person, one after the other. 

Maybe a bit off topic but this is the issue: You are definitely within your right to fight something like this, but in the end, do you want to work at a place where they think this way? Would you feel good in that group? That's the shitty thing about it. And that's probably why a lot of people don't fight against something like this and it remains 'done'.

If the HR advocates for diversity hires (which it's a STEM position so females are almost in that category) then they'll legitimately work through the issue by either having another person conduct and approve the interview. 

It's a gamble though, HR exists to control liabilities within an organization and coming in hot like that likely won't go too far but it also shows you how that company operates to begin with.

I had to point out to her - ""X and Y in the other departments are both only about 50, both guys have been off with a heart attack in the last few years, and nobody complains about that; they make every accommodation to help them get back to work."" A few years later, one fellow in our department died in his 40's, within 6 months, of prostate cancer. 

The hypocrisy was that she had a son (18 at the time), almost every other woman in our department also had children. I also pointed out that nowadays, most people only had 1 or at most 2 children, but we were hiring someone who would likely be around for 30 years. If we don't begrudge people who are truly sick, why would we complain about someone who will still be healthy as a horse when they return?

Funny thing was - my next female boss, about 4 years later, *did* go off on maternity leave. But she only took the minimum 6 weeks. Her husband took the rest of the year's leave from his job. Canadian Unemployment Insurance only pays about $30,000 a year - too substantial a drop in pay. Her husband had a much lower paying job, so the impact on their finances with him collecting was not as serious.

Besides, my logic for all such cases - look at the demographics. Anyone who will be creating new taxpayers to keep Canada Pension or US Social Security solvent in the decades to come, deserves all the support we can give. 

And most of all, exactly your issue - whether by choice or situation, many women will not to have children at all. 

Not sure about your situation, but here in Canada such discrimination is blatantly illegal.

Yes, women have babies sometimes and that takes them out of the workforce temporarily.

They are after warm bodies to fill seats. And they want to /expect to treat those warm bodies horribly. 

So now you have a company staffed with employees who tolerate discrimination, are fine with their employer breaking employment laws, are willing to work where they are treated like crap, and didn't even half to compete with women for their jobs.

On a team conference call, my new manager came for me for NO reason, like he totally broadsided me, yelling about me being incompetent.

But are you a new/soon to be graduate who now wants a first job without going through a drawn-out legal case? This hiring manager and company are a hot turd so drop them now. Consider working remotely/virtually--you'll then have access to countries and jobs that respect female workers, and a lot of different opportunities. If you must have an in-person job, then try to expand your search range to get access to more jobs. How far are you willing to commute? Do you have a relative or friend in another location with whom you could stay with during the week and then come home on the weekends? What about using your social connections to get to an employer for whom you'd like to work? Be respectful and appropriate, but riding in an elevator with a manager of your desired company to give a 90 second description of you, your skills, and your goals, and then ask for a chance to email/text/chat with her/him about what would make a candidate like you more appealing can and has worked.

huprugx,t1_humazq7,2022-01-29 13:10:58,TwoXChromosomes,"But the same assholes who would consider ""she could go on maternity leave"" probably have the same condescending attitude I'm sure you've encountered from friends and family - ""Oh, you'll change your mind sooner or later...""

(My wife used to get that from coworkers who were mothers - ""You should have children. They're a joy and a treasure!""  Except the parents of teenagers, who told her ""DON'T EVER have children!"")

And here in Canada, the rules were changed decades ago - the woman can take up to 16 weeks maternity leave (probably for medical recovery, mainly); then the other 34 can be split between the father and mother. They just can't both be taking it at the same time.  So hiring a male does not guarantee the parent will not be off on maternity leave.

The problem for most young professional couples is money.  Unemployment Insurance pays 55% of the first approx $50,000 of income. So someone making $80,000 a year, for example, would get 55% of $50,000 or  $27,500 a year. Whereas, someone making $40,000 would make $22,000 a year. The higher paying, so possibly more educated and technical that your career is, the less likely you can afford on top of everything else to take maternity leave.  (And on top of that, if you make more than $70,000 that year, you pay back a portion - so depending on where in the year the birth falls, you may have to pay back part of it.)

This is what happened with my boss (15 years ago). She was head of the computer department, fit into the $80,000 category. Her husband worked in a museum and probably made  $40,000 or less. She was only gone for 6 weeks and he took 34.

The government sucks & standard of living for disabled people are based off the Reagan years… I would argue corporate America sucks & politicians do too… so think if you have to have health insurance to live- now your stuck… either you have to find a job actually willing to pay you a livable wage with decent benefits & work with your disability or you are stuck inside a draconian system that is ssi/ssdi… (& yes disabled people are penalized for being/getting married…)",rhiannonla,t2_7irt3aki,4,0,reddit4

fhbezoz,t3_f29uh2,2020-02-11 17:08:47,TwoXChromosomes,"I have had this exact conversation with someone in my office. We had hired a receptionist on a temporary basis to cover someone else while they were pulled into another role. Her contract was for a period of 6 months. Nearing the end of that 6 months, we determined that we still needed her to fill the role for a while longer, and extended her contract another 6 months.  

For this entire period of time, I was this person's direct manager, but I was also filling that role on a temporary basis for someone who was on maternity leave. Near the end of the now 12 month temporary position, I made a recommendation that she be kept on full time. She was good at her job, I hadn't heard a single complaint about her, and we still needed to fill the role, as the previous receptionist was still in her other role at the time and it wasn't looking like it was going anywhere. I argued that we should give the temporary receptionist a full time spot because it wasn't fair to keep stringing her along. She's got kids, a home to pay for... not fair to keep her on 6 month contracts.   

The person I recommended this to immediately went on the defensive of ""really? She doesn't even smile. Hardly says hello, just has her headphones in and doesn't really interact"". Now, I get that she's our receptionist, but it's because we need SOMEONE to sit by the front door. Her primary role is administrative duties for an office of 50 people, not to sit and smile and say hello. She does that for strangers that come into the office, not every staff member who happens to be walking by.  

I argued to the guy that smiling isn't her job, and if she works better with headphones in, so be it. I hadn't had any complaints about her and her work was solid. He just kind of shook his head and said ""ok"" like I was missing out on the opportunity to replace her with someone more pleasant. Then he said maybe we should move her out of the way, so she can focus on her work, and we'll get highschool or college girls to come and be the receptionist on 4 or 6 month contracts. He laughed like it was a joke and honestly I chuckled too so that I could just end the conversation.  

My role as temporary manager let me in on some history with a number of our other admin staff... all women... some had been held back from roles they wanted to take on because the higher-ups didn't want them out of the lobby. Some had had their salary held back to less than comparable in our other offices because the higher-ups didn't want to have to pay them any more.  

This newest lady was the last straw. I made my recommendations, and then said I'm done. You guys can find someone else to fill the role for the remainder of the actual manager's mat leave.",CatpissEverqueef,t2_5eh6d4x9,34,0,reddit1

1. Do you best not to acknowledge his complaints directly to him.
2. Hand write logs of all his direct comments to you.  Write this down on a personal pad that you can keep in your pocket. Write as descriptive as possible right after it happens. Edit: You are under NO obligation to show this to anyone until you want to. It is not company property. And don't use your phone. Hand written contemporaneous is best.
3. Don't change one way or another. Be pleasant, professional and courteous.  That should be the expectation for anyone interacting with the public and guests.
4. IF there is an actual formal complaint that is put in front of you, DO NOT RESPOND off the cuff. Ask for it in writing and also ask for a handbook outlining the job responsibilities.
5. Be very careful not to get into a discussion about subjective interpretations. ""I was smiling"" ""I smiled like 'this'"". None of that matters.
6. It is likely that if you ask for a written complaint, they will drop the issue and back him off as long as you are performing your job.
7. If not, you have the option to take your notes, the handbook and the written complaint to your state's department of labor.

I remember that I was happiest at a library because I was allowed to be relatively aloof to people and not smile or pester them like sales clerks are forced to be by their managers. Anyways, I was let go from one firm because “‘I didn’t fit in.’” I’m sure it didn’t help that they had an office manager, student employee banging a lawyer, and myself. OM and student would tell me to do the same job in precisely different styles, whomever was watching invariably found me doing the ‘wrong’ one. And, reception and filing is already very annoying as is, with trying to tiptoe around to do one’s work when the employer doesn’t pay well, you have to answer for their bullshit, and the environment is terrible for women. Honestly, I felt like I should have said something about the student, but there was no one to report it to when it was a partner at said firm and they both took the bathroom key and had ‘breaks’ together... so she kept telling me not to file his cases, which pissed him off. It’s just sheer toxicity on every level. 


If you do or have the means to shop elsewhere for a job, I’d honestly recommend working at a library. Do you think you can take charge and say he’s being sexist before he does damage to you?

Pao Ssu was given in marriage to the Emperor during the Time of the Warring States. Homesick in a strange land, the beautiful Pao Ssu refused to smile.  The Emperor lavished silks, jewels, and treasure on her and made her his favorite, but still she wouldn't smile.  Finally, the Emperor offered a thousand ounces of gold to anyone who could make Pao Ssu smile.  Still, the homesick Queen refused to smile.

Eventually the great Emperor embarked on the building of the Great Wall to try to put an end to the wars.  There was a collapse and two hundred of the Emperor's soldiers died.  The Emperor was inconsolable.  And Pao Ssu smiled.  

This is how I heard the story in a book I read a long time ago.  There's another version on Wikipedia that she smiled when someone tricked all the Emperor's nobles into coming to the Capital ready for battle in vain and the Emperor lost the trust of his nobles.

Firstly, idle chat is rarely appropriate between staff when you are working with patients and treating them and having to concentrate. Chat should be with the patient.

I'm not saying I exactly understand, but not smiling definitely was the norm. And I found it very difficult to stop doing it every time a man met my eyes in public. Which made me realize what I was really doing when I smiled, was trying to appease men. What a terrible reason to smile. 

It really struck me how ingrained it is in our culture and I really appreciated the fact that no one wanted or cared if I smiled at them.

wrong

I worked as a bank teller. The other tellers were all female. Our Sales & Service Manager expected us to greet customers warmly the second they entered... from across the bank.

""Helloooo thereeee!"" ""Hiiii!! Welcome to US Bank!"" 

It was even turned into a competition- when he heard/noticed tellers greeting customers he gave them a 'point' on his tally

My greeting strategy was to wait for initial eye contact after they entered the building and began approaching my window, then say ""hello!"" in a friendly way, and give a polite little head nod and smile. 

This was apparently unsatisfactory. I was talked to because I wasn't bubbly enough. It was pointed out to me how well the other tellers were greeting people walking in, how many 'points' they all had accumulated, and I was told I needed to be more like my female co-workers.

This sounded great in theory, but I am a 6'4"" 290lb male and I knew it would be easy to show them the error of their ways. 

The next person entering the bank received a bellowing sing-songy ""HIIII THEREEEE!!! WELCOME TO US BANKKK"" from 60ft away, with a dozen people in between.

I think, like secretaries, the receptionist position has historically been filled by women. And women in these positions have been told they have to be warm and inviting.

Yes. There are lots. It's just another admin role. Any historical bias towards women for receptionist jobs specifically would be due to leery older men wanting some ""eye candy"" for the welcome desk. If the workplace isn't sexist there shouldn't be any sexual bias to who gets the reception job.

For a woman? Clean isn't enough, you also have to smell like sexy flowers. Depending on your hair type, you may need anywhere from three to six different hair products and at least one hot tool to look ""professional"" (women of color spend WAY more money and time to achieve this than white women, at baseline). You can't just be ""not fat,"" you have to have a flat stomach but also a bigger ass (not too big, though, and it has to be tight), bigger tits (your arms still have to be skinny, though, so don't have tits so big they push into your arms), and slender legs that aren't too muscular, even though you have to work out a ton to get that whole flat stomach/tone ass combo. Clothes can't just fit you decently and be clean, they have to accentuate your body in a way that is sexy but not so sexy that men black out and find themselves harassing you (this is entirely beyond their control so do your best). And makeup...well the best makeup is done on a flawless base, so that's gonna require cleanser/exfoliation/toner/moisturizer at baseline, with some weekly masks thrown in. Then it's primer/foundation/powder/eyeshadow/eyeliner/mascara/brow pomade/blush/bronzer/contour/highlighter/setting spray (that's my daily routine).

Like I said, if you're actually a business owner you can hire people and have whatever expectations of them you want, Outmoded and jaded or not.  But YOU didn't hire this woman.  You're quick to point out that the info about the guy is third hand, and say you'd fire 'troublemakers', but walking up to a superior and aggressively demanding that they tell her she's 'not the very definition of a great receptionist' is definitely troublemaking.  I was a -great- receptionist.  I believe in old school customer service.  But even I was intimidated by people who could cause issues for me at work.  And people DO cause issues.  Case in point, 35 year old douche causing issues for a nice receptionist. 

Its great you're so privileged that you never had to do this sort of work, and you apparently are all balls and no empathy and can hit this scenario head on, but not everyone can do that.",apeculiardaisy,t2_zkmd6po,5,0,reddit1

I wouldn’t say anything even jokingly about being reimbursed for the make up and time, because your goal isn’t for him to solve the problem of you wearing make up by paying for it. Also, the other women are wearing make up and not being reimbursed, so it’s just not a useful direction to go in. It makes it sound as though the reason that you aren’t going to wear make up is strictly about convenience and cost, when you don’t have to wear make up because you don’t have to wear make up, period.

Hi boss, I just wanted to touch base with you about the conversation we had earlier about how I should wear makeup in the office. 

Could you please email me the dress code policy where it outlines the requirement for Cosmetics? 

If this is a new policy will there be payment rendered for the expense incurred by this new policy?

If it comes up again more insistently, or you really want to fight it already, make sure you get convos confirming the exchange in writing and always keep copies offsite. Consider CCing at least one higher-up, make what I've written include them, be more polite/match expectations in communication as works in the overall company culture etc.

Here goes: 


""Dear (Manager)

 I've been thinking about the conversation we had with the others in the break room the other day. You provided guidance on my appearance in the office. I appreciate the feedback. I also just wanted to clarify that it's a company requirement for all employees to wear makeup during shifts? Thank you!

If he says nope, great. Save a copy of that email exchange.

If he says or implies yes, or says you'll do better with makeup even though it's not a requirement:


""Hi (Manager)

Thank you for clarifying. 

I hope you can help me with some more guidance: 
Does the company have specific brands of makeup it requires all employees to use? I was looking under the benefits package and couldn't find how or where to submit makeup expenses. I want to make sure I'm selecting products that are covered before proceeding to purchase them.

I'm also hoping you can help me with how to punch in time used for applying & removing makeup.""

We are told from a young age not to judge a book by its cover, but it is extremely naïve and often dangerous to ignore those pre-judgements. Because of that, these auto-judgements bleed into every non-dangerous situation, too. Some people would say these micro-judgements are used to determine hierarchy, but that’s a whole other bag of dicks that I’m not going to unpack. 

Look at it this way. Chalk it up to pretty privilege. Imagine a graph with a line going up: the more attractive someone appears, the more intelligent they seem and the better other people respect them. There’s a point on that graph where the line starts going back down. Get too pretty and now the person is just a ‘dumb blond’. This is true no matter the sex of the person.

This is my experience. I get better customer service when I am dressed nice and wear makeup. I don’t wear makeup daily, but if I’m going to return something to a store or interact with the service industry, I wear makeup.",twatfantesticles,t2_cbe3v3ww,-4,0,reddit2

I don't normally wear make up, hair in a pony tail.  I'm in a small community and know a number of people with regular casual contact.

A guy I knew fairly well, ran into me at a Christmas party. I had made up, hair down, for the occasion.  He walked up to me, and properly introduced himself.  I was stunned. Of course we knew each other. I started to laugh, and said ""I'm samanthasgramma"".  

As he's sputtering with embarrassment, my husband strolled up.  The guy briefly explained, and without missing a beat, and a cheeky grin, my husband said ""She cleans up really well, doesn't she?""

I thought it was funny as all get-out.  And my husband is cool with my no-fuss beauty regimen.  When I was younger, If I've worked a client-facing job, I have voluntarily worn a bit of make up. And have, as I got older, not even bother with that, without any push-back from anyone.  I feel lucky that people were more interested in what was going on inside my head, rather than what I decorated it with.

I still make up for occasions, and my husband does a double take because he's not used to it.  But no one is asking me to. I just like a little more fuss for special moments.

I had a similar situation to OP where my boss at my old job told me during my 90 day that I had to look “more presentable” on a daily basis, even though I only saw guests maybe once a month and was in an office with coworkers the rest of the time. She expected curled hair every day, full face of makeup, high heels, etc. I eventually started doing a bit more just to avoid the convo again, but no one else in the office was told to wear more makeup and most of my coworkers wore none every day. It was honestly personally offensive and unacceptable.

I wouldn't change what I was doing either. But I also would have a frank conversation if he brought up the suggestion again or created any ""performance"" related issue about it later. Only if he fixates.

Talking points I'd be prepared with (and there's probably more tactful ways to talk about them): 

1) Bodily autonomy: For the health of your skin, pocketbook, and time management, you aren't going to wear makeup. 

2) Time wasted: As it doesn't effect your performance, it doesn't seem an issue to continue conflicting about or discussing. 

3) Job Security: If your lifestyle needs are going to threaten your employment, he needs to be clear about that.

If you have an HR, that's who I'd have this conversation in front of...And whatever his responses at the point of challenging you outright, you might think about your future in the company. Maybe it's not a good fit for you. Maybe there are better work environments you'd enjoy better.

That absolutely doesn't matter. As they say, intent is not magic. Just because someone doesn't realize their actions or words are bigoted or harmful, that doesn't negate the harm. 

So, yes, you can say something snarky. But it might be more valuable to ask a question like: why are you asking a woman to alter her appearance in a way you would never ask a man? *Especially* in a public forum. Would he criticize a man publicly like that? It's pretty gross behavior.

I made this comment on another post, but I’ll say it again: y’all need to have a sit down with your husbands AND older children.

My mom did this several years ago because she was tired of me and her working all day while the men just sat around and enjoyed themselves. She put her foot down and said “either you guys help or we’re not doing this”. When given the choice (help or don’t have Christmas), they stepped up to help with shopping, meal prep, and especially clean up. It’s been this way ever since.

There is absolutely no reason why husbands and older children can’t complete certain tasks during the holidays.

Even though my dad was a bit lazy with Christmas for many years, he never failed to have at least one REALLY nice gift under the tree for my mom, and when we were little he would take my brother and I shopping to pick out a gift for her. Ladies, this is the BARE MINIMUM expectation for men during the holidays and they need to know that (even though they should already).

Of course, going into this conversation, it is important to internally acknowledge which Christmas tasks are important just to you… and those are the things you’ll want to be prepared to either continue doing yourself, or let go of if they’re too much stress.

However, things that the rest of the family ask for/enjoy/demand (things like a Christmas tree or baking or wrapped presents or the big dinner)… those are the ones where you need to demand contribution.

IMO, anyone over the age of 10 should have an age-appropriate job. Setting the table was my job as far back as I can remember (pretty sure I started at like 4 years old), and then of course more and more responsibility as I got older.",tits_on_bread,t2_axhlb,964,0,reddit3

Our house had too much stuff in it, their houses had too much stuff, so for Christmas each family makes some kind of edible treat: cookies, fudge, candied almonds, whatever, for everybody else.  That's what our family sends theirs, and theirs send ours.  Everybody gets lots of kinds of treats, but nobody has to make lots of kinds of treats.  Instead of stuff, you do things with your kids, and experiences are better anyway.  Plus less expense, less shopping hassle, less time wrapping, and way less stress.  It's just better in every way.
You might see if your relations are amenable to such a system for next year.",WontHarvestAKidney,t2_4chu0au2,134,0,reddit3

The only way to force the mental load onto your spouse is to just stop enabling. I quit doing all the work. 

It’s still annoying but slowly he’s picking up the slack. I make a lot of lists and explicit requests for things he can do. Give directions for timing and execution of things I want him to do. Like if it’s a Saturday in the holidays tell him to pick up the tree, pop it up. Go to the storage and get the stuff, on this day at this time so that we can decorate. 

Sometimes he dazzles me with making up for my “slack” (he bought a gift for my sister in law this year, for example) sometimes things just don’t happen (we didn’t do a holiday card because I didn’t force it) you have to be comfortable with things not happening and he has to get comfortable with doing more.

When it comes to gifts and planning for our families, she will handle her side and I will handle my side. Our names go on both sets (we both have pretty big families).

If one of us makes food, the other one will stand by in the kitchen to help as needed so we can get through the task seamlessly. We both love to cook and bake so we spend a lot of time here.

We’ve always split tasks. I do dishes and she does laundry. She cleans the bedroom and bathroom and I clean the living room and kitchen/dining room.

She’s in charge of decorating the spaces, but I’ll be the one to move everything around for her so she can keep an eye on the broader picture with minimal effort.

Relationships are a two way street. Give and take. Won’t always be 50-50. Yes, there will be days when I give 20 and she gives 80 or vice versa, but there’s got to be a balance somewhere. Having a willingness to understand this and work together is where it counts. The best thing you can do is talk to your partner and try to build more clearly defined lines/roles, TOGETHER. You won’t get anywhere until you start a conversation.

And if there’s an unwillingness to working together, it may be time to consider couple’s counseling. This is never meant as an insult. This is only as a recommendation when there’s been a breakdown in communication, and it becomes difficult to have these conversations.

Husband and I have always given each other a few gifts, nothing crazy expensive, but 4-5 that each other would like. 
Opening gifts this year, I got a Japanese tea set from my husband, sure it was really beautiful but I have never liked tea ever. He likes tea. The only other thing I received was a gift card from my mother. 
It just felt so bad to put in so much effort for everyone else and feel like absolutely no thought was given for me. My husband had a nice stack as usual geared towards his interests and I got a tea set that I guess I can put somewhere to look pretty and collect dust.

I'm really not trying to be an asshole. I get the argument that if something is important to you, it would be nice if others put in the effort to make you happy. I think it is fair to point out how terrible it is that you can't expect your partner to care about your feelings. But I can't help but feel a lot of the work that women put into these holidays is just misogynist/capitalist conditioning. You don't really have to make an elaborate turkey dinner for Thanksgiving. You don't have to do anything for Valentine's day. You don't have to buy gifts that often find themselves in the landfill because X day. 

Like, I love a pretty Christmas tree with an elaborate dinner, too. But at the end of the day, I simply can not understand putting in the effort to complain about the effort. I'm simply not willing to do the clean-up, so the Christmas tree stays in storage. I mean, I get the rage at a piece of shit partner demanding one put in the effort when he is not going to do anything. But to me, the solution to this issue is simple. If no one appreciates your effort and no one is willing to help, why are you doing this to yourself? Again, I understand the societal conditioning, but this is an issue where women need to start changing expectations, just like the whole issue with housework and childcare.

Not all men... maybe very few men, care about family, other than for posturing purposes and saying They're In Charge. If you stopped doing the things for which he is insufficiently grateful or participatory, maybe he would be just as happy but spend less time at home. 

It comes down to how you select a partner. It's hard, when you're young, to get beyond hormones and see what your life will be like. And so often we repeat our parents' patterns. 

You may have to have a difficult conversation, and a partner as you describe him will possibly not be open to that. So much work, listening, and what will feel to him like constant, unnecessary, humiliating apologizing. 

If anyone participates with you on these things, maybe do the celebrations for them and not for those who just sit there and watch football. They want a roast beef? They can make it. Don't kick them out, but don't put any effort into doing things just they want.

j1w4l28,t3_zwccxb,2022-12-27 21:06:51,TwoXChromosomes,"I used to hate Christmas. This was what I always saw in ky family growing up. The women would cook the men's favorite foods, and do all the cleaning, shopping, planning, all of it. Then I'm my family the men were always served food first, then the kids, then the women would get theirs last and try and eat while wrangling the kids. Then the women would clean up. I hated it! 

So when I got married I hadn't been much for Christmas as a single person. My husband loves Christmas and was super excited when we had kids. The first couple years I really tried hard to do everything he asked and swallow my own feelings. I was met with complaints and little thanks. So I didn't do it the next year. I got a couple gifts I wanted to get and I put up the decorations I wanted, and I watched the Christmas shows I like (gremlins, original grinch), and did activities with the kids that I wanted to.  I invited my husband to do the stuff he thought was important (Santa, stockings, gifts). He did a little and was disappointed in how it turned out and was awe struck by how much energy goes into planning, thought, shopping for the groceries, all of it. Now we split the effort evenly, and have a bunch of new traditions that make it all more relaxed and enjoyable for everyone. The kids are older now so we pick names for filling each other's stockings. We each help one of our 2 kids shop for thier person. We let the 7yo decorate this year (it looks bad but shes so proud and happy). We made goodies with our best family friends and we all pitched in. I now like christmas again and my hubby still likes Christmas and likes that we do our own style of celebrating. 

Oh also for dinner we do a veggie tray, good cheeses, summer sausage, and other snacks stuff. Easy to prep, easy to clean up, we can have it out while we do other stuff. And best yet that was a tradition his grandma did he never knew why. Now he does, it was so she and everyone could just visit and enjoy each other on Christmas day. It brings him good memories and understanding of the person that made him love Christmas in the first place.

I'm glad I did that when my kids were too young to know a difference. That first Christmas of me not doing all the stuff wasn't exactly amazing, and there was definetly arguing involved lol.",ironmanstinkysocks,t2_her4n11,2,0,reddit3
j1w7ybn,t3_zwccxb,2022-12-27 21:29:31,TwoXChromosomes,"This year I told my family that they could help decorate the tree (after I'd told them they needed to tidy the house, got the tree down and made my 13 year old daughter help me set it up and put the lights on, then I put the baubles on myself - this took about 4 days when I'd stated repeatedly I wanted it all done in a day).

As I stood watching while baking cookies for gifts I suggested my husband open the box clearly marked 'unbreakable ornaments' for our six year old son to hang, instead of the one clearly marked 'breakable or precious ornaments'. Our daughter helped a bit, and when they were done she jokingly asked if I was going to rearrange it all once she was in bed and my husband at work. I was, til she called me on it! But I was happy to leave it...until 3 days later when my son knocked the tree over! Miraculously nothing broke, and I pulled all the breakable ornaments off while my mother held it at half-mast. I then redecorated it with all the unbreakable ornaments after my husband and I tried to make it more stable (2023's project).

I decorated the rest of the house, including outside with only a little help from my daughter with the outside lights. I baked and iced 5 dozen sugar cookies (normally it's about 10-12 dozen) 2 dozen cupcakes and a cake, made 3 batches of home made crackers, caramelised onion jam, peanut blossoms, cherry chocolate slice, packaged them all up for a friend, 2 teachers, a scout leader, our priests, and another friend group of 6 families - this year we cancelled our cookie exchange, otherwise there would have been an extra 10 dozen cokies. I potted up plants, helped my son make ornaments for his people, wrote cards with him (that my daughter made after I first made 6 demo's for them to choose from), wrote screen of lists and bought every gift (though my husband did come shopping with me most times), Christmas t-shirts. I cooked made salads and dips and prepared meat, made a pav and cheesecake and meringues (and froze dough balls for 6 dozen choc chip cookies to use up the leftover egg yolks) and berry ice cubes and four grazing platters for the 6 meals we went to over 10 days - including a birthday cake for yesterday's catch-up.

I went to two school prize-giving ceremonies, Scout end-of-year break-up at the beach, a work-do... I declined invites to a staff farewell, baby shower and a gender reveal party, and had to put our apologies in for Altar Serving training in the next town, two days before Christmas as I couldn't borrow a car to get there, and our ride was unwell. I was up until 3am that night baking, so I'm kinda relieved I didn't go.

And did the Elves on the Shelf.

All this while also working about four days a week instead of my standard 1-2 days.

I hurt all over, after my 3am baking night I could barely walk, my ankles were swollen and the soles of my feet hurt - and hurt even more once I finally lay down. My back still aches. At my friend's yesterday to visit with her sister who'd flown down to introduce us to her new baby/share a belated Christmas, I was beyond tired but happily pushed myself to stay longer because I knew that once I got home I was going to spend the next week either on the couch outside reading or crocheting, gardening or maybe driving to the river or bush... maybe with my family, maybe on my own while my husband takes our son to the pool. That's it. Meals will be grilled meat and salad, the cake tins, both in the pantry and in the freezer, are full. I'll buy the groceries online and my husband can pick them up. New Years Eve meal may be Indian takeaway. I'll go to bed when my son does, my daughter can hop in with me and we'll watch a movie together before she goes to bed and then I'll sleep. I am done for the next few days. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd I'll think about doing something, or seeing someone. It's 10:30am, and I'm just about to get out of bed, and eat a decent, healthy breakfast for the first time in about ten days.

I know my husband appreciates the work and doesn’t mean for me to provide all the “magic” but I also know that if I didn’t do it no one would. Case in point, I threw awesome and personal parties for my eldest’s birthdays, but when my youngest turned 1, I was suffering from a deep episode of depression was barely coping. He didn’t plan a single thing. No cake, no presents, nothing. He just didn’t think to. So like 2 days before her birthday, I rallied and bought and wrapped all the gifts. Since our house was a mess from having 2 little ones with a depressed mom, I asked my sister to host the party, and her chef husband made an amazing cake. I dressed the girls, organized the party and took all the photos. 

This year was the first year our girls were into Santa but we were also on a strict budget. We didn’t have any decorations or ornaments because we’ve always gone to my family’s for presents and dinner. So over the course of a month or so, I crafted all of our ornaments and decorations. I picked where we we’re getting our tree, and had to pick it out my self because I just couldn’t get him to engage. Like I’d point to a tree and he’d be like “that’s fine.” He wouldn’t look and got annoyed when I changed my mind in favor of a better one. He wanted to be able to just go and grab the first one a be done.

The next day, it's just a matter of putting pans in the oven at intervals, and I can actually enjoy the day with everyone else. It wasn't always like this, and ai had a flashback this year.

This year I told my husband how sad it makes me that women are expected to carry the holiday for the entire family and then spend the whole day in the kitchen making perfect feasts for families that are in the living room not helping. The judgement is unreal, there is no time for a break, and all the people you brought together for the holiday have gotten together without you. It's a silent standard and it is horrendously unfair.

I used to be that person years ago with my ex. He would be bullshitting in the living room with his family while I cooked from scratch the courses he had requested, served them, cleared plates, and washed dishes by hand (we had no dishwasher). I'd spend all day in the kitchen, struggling to get a bathroom break in, or some air away from the stuffy kitchen. I'd be in there long after guests left, packing away food, then the last dishes, then clearing the gift wrap from the living room floor, then putting the furniture back to rights.

Anyway! Now I'm a parent, and I love finding ways to get the kids to participate and get into the season (construction paper snowflakes, making ugly little painted wooden ornaments, baking cookies for Santa, etc.)

So we started hounding their husbands in October about what they are getting their wives for Christmas. Giving out a list of photographers that do Christmas photos. Offering to babysit so they have time to go Christmas shopping behind their wives back. 

Only 40% of husbands got the memo and pulled a little extra weight this holiday season. You can lead a horse to the water but you can't force the horse to drink.

Why make a giant fuss when you know damned well there's not much to fuss over? The Santa myth was dead and gone early in our family, we knew our gifts came from our parents hard work. My dad worked 2 jobs and my mom couldn't work due to her back. Most of our extended family wasn't in the country so our Christmas consisted of the 5 of us so we didn't need elaborate dinners with 50 people over. I do not need and do not want an insanely involved situation where everyone is miserable because everything needs to be perfect for overly judgemental guests who are more worried about whether our house is perfectly clean than they are about spending time with us. I find the whole situation toxic. For the folks are there that DO want all of that and don't bother to help, they're terrible people. But I doubt I'm the only person out here who helps out of obligation, is miserable doing it, and then has it held against me that I'm not overly giddy about the whole thing.

However, please consider whether it needs to be done at all (by either partner, or anyone.) Your (male) partner is unlikely to pick up the slack if you don't send Christmas cards, but if it's such a burden on you, maybe consider whether you can spend your time better just relaxing.

My partner and I don't send out Christmas cards. We don't receive a ton of them either, but we do get a few each year. We read them, and thank people, and it's a net positive thing, but honestly it's minimal. It makes us smile for a minute, and then it's in the recycling. Don't bend over backwards for stuff that doesn't even make that much difference for others.

For the stuff that really DOES matter, talk with your husband in advance of the holiday and get him involved.

We bought Christmas presents for each other (he bought one big sentimental gift for me and I bought several smaller gifts for him - he's awful at buying necessary things for himself so I got Really Nice Versions of things he needed).

 We coordinated Christmas so we spent Christmas Eve and Christmas morning with my found family, then drove an hour to his family celebration and spent two nights/two days there before coming home today.

\- Assigned specific tasks with deadlines (""I need you to get gifts for our nieces and nephews by tomorrow night at 8pm"")  


\- Asked explicitly for help (""I am going to be wrapping gifts after the kids are in bed so please come help me as soon as the baby is asleep"")   


\- ""Exported"" labor I usually do myself (for example, ordered catering for 30% of the food, did frozen Costco appetizers for another 30%, and cooked the rest) 

\- Explained the consequences of potential inaction and let it ride (""If you don't your office picked up by tomorrow, then I am not going to be able to do any of the deep cleaning in there and you will have to do it yourself this weekend"")   


Despite the double work it could've been.... it actually worked. But it was hard. It gave me immense anxiety for some reason.

j1vgxao,t3_zwccxb,2022-12-27 18:28:59,TwoXChromosomes,"I am feeling this so hard. I come from a family that doesn't celebrate Christmas. After getting married I used to put up the Christmas tree for us, I used untangle the lights and get new batteries and painstakingly hang them. I used to buy all the gifts for his family. Sometimes he would remember to get me something. One year I didn't do the decorations. There were simply no decorations. I scaled back the gifts, too. The next year I told him that I am giving up Christmas. I'm not buying any more gifts. Not doing any more decorating. He had to buy his own. Instead he informed the family that *""we""* had decided to stop doing Christmas gifting.

Many years later and I only do gifts for him and his mom (whom I adore), not the whole extended family. I unexpectedly had to go on a business trip to Egypt this December. I got back 2 days before Christmas. I had made an effort to get gifts before and while I was away because I knew I wouldn't have the time after. At Christmas, his mom got 4 different gifts from me, one of which I had bought months ago already and for which he was supposed to get the other part. He never did. He denies any knowledge of this part of the gift. He got 2 gifts from me - one I bought months ago and one extra I got in Egypt. We each got a gift from her, which I greatly appreciate because she is on a very tight budget. He didn't get me anything.

It's my birthday in a few days. Birthdays are important to me. I was unavoidably away over his birthday this year but I made sure to call him, sent him messages and pictures, and had a gift for him as soon as I got home. I told him months ago what I want for my birthday. I even sent him pictures and pricing. I am not going to remind him about it. I shouldn't have to remind him. But I don't know if I can handle the disappointment of him forgetting or not bothering yet again. I guess I will just have to wait and see if he paid attention. On the flip side, his dad became very ill three days ago. My husband left the house at 6am to drive 45 minutes to pick his dad up and take him to a hospital. He pays a significant amount of money each month for medical insurance for his father. He has driven 45 minutes there and 45 min back twice a day almost every day to go visit his dad.  He was planning to go deep-clean his dad's house while the man lies in the hospital because it's pretty dirty and he refuses assistance. My husband thought he would just do it himself quickly in an hour or so. This is a man who doesn't even mildly clean up the bathroom behind him. At my suggestion he hired a cleaner at some cost to assist. He clearly had no sense of how much work it is to vacuum and sweep and dust and wipe and mop etc. I already know that if I try to talk to him about the fact that I didn't get a Christmas present or a birthday present, he'll cite how busy he was dealing with his work and his dad's hospitalisation and having to clean his dad's house etc.

My mom is an artist and there have been many times I would just go into her studio and watch her paint or sculpt, ask questions about certain works, and if I wanted to get her something she needed I would just find out more *and just talk* because usually people will eventually get comfortable enough and tell you what they need or what frustrates them.

Gifts ...make a list break it up into two sections one that you feel is your responsibility and one for him, if he doesn't want to buy his family and friends gifts then that's that, if you have kids together then split the responsibility of purchasing gifts, if he buys them nothing well that's on him.
Christmas lunch/food in general talk about the food for the holidays if he doesn't care then it's going to be hard to split the work, think what is important to you or you will be back doing it all.

I have not been working for 18 months and he makes a decent salary. 

I resent him at times for not being as affectionate or emotionally available as I would like. He cried in front of me several times before we got married so I know he has the capacity, he just has a very tough exterior.

I guess what I’m trying to get at is just like you and me, no one is perfect. I’m sure there are things about him that make your relationship worthwhile. Reddit isn’t the best place to get relationship advice as no one can see into your specific relationship and situation. I do think it’s nice to vent and get some outside perspective.

When I was a few years from getting divorced but didn't realize it, someone had me read a book that helped change my life.  It is called Parenting with Love and Logic.  There is also one for Teens.  It can be applied to all people of any age, co-workers, partners... I don't know if you are familiar with it, but it involves letting some natural consequences happen.  We can choose which ones, nothing to endanger the child (or partner).    


One of my kids failed math one semester,  the year I read this book because I told them to do the homework, which we had been told would be 50% of the grade, and they didn't.  Many previous years I had tried to force them to do homework and they would even leave the work home after doing it.  So I let go and let it happen, better in high school than later in life.   It was a one semester course.  They definitely learned from this, they own their own business in their 30s now - but it was SO scary.  My now-ex was SO furious.  

Only you can know when to draw the line.  But these books helped me to understand that there was a line to be drawn, if that makes sense.  I grew up in a very damaging home, and I know a lot more about life now.

j2ub6s8,t3_zwccxb,2023-01-04 00:14:40,TwoXChromosomes,"Reading these messages from other women does not surprise me. I have done Christmas for our family for 44 years of marriage, always an uphill battle. Hubby is ASD, and was very poor as a child, and emotionally abused by his father and older brother, but shockingly enough, he was a good counselor, although never very well paid.  But his lack of empathy for our kids' Christmas experience was something I fought against all their childhoods.    
This Christmas, our long-distance kids were able to come home for the holiday for the first time; it was financial, not personal, reasons that kept them away.  I finally shared with oldest child my struggles with their father; Hubby would say, ""The kids don't care if the gifts are wrapped"", trying to talk me out of the work of wrapping (but not actually wrapping anything himself).  Offspring said, ""YES, we DO care if our gifts are wrapped!""  
The past couple of years have been rough: husband had health crisis and nearly died; he has been up and down, mostly down and sleeping, for the last two years. For about 10 years before, he was a bit of a d\*ck, which chipped away at my heart; so by the time of his health crisis, not much love in my heart, but I have stuck it out, mostly for financial reasons.  
This Christmas visit was long planned; I did EVERYTHING, including taking husband to a couple of specialists as he was starting one of his declines (he sleeps about 14 to 18 hours a day when it's bad).  And I was working part-time at a job he knows I dislike; I have to because he is retired.  All the cleaning, shopping, planning, wrapping, bedmaking, EVERYTHING, I did by myself.  
A couple of weeks before Christmas, I had managed to talk him into replacing my 12 year old car, since I did all the driving.  I got a nice used car with that remote start key fob, after about a month of research and doing the entire process, except the final signing, myself.  
On Christmas morning, when kids, grandkids, and spouse were opening their gifts (I got spouse a nice shirt and jammies), spouse hands me a gift bag. The key fob to my ""new"" car was in it.

So your kid is going to be here for the holidays, I was thinking we could make things Christmassy for him, what do we want to do for that? Then you talk about the tree, decorations, cookies, presents etc. Talk about what's important to each of you and why. Then pull out the calendar and go, ok so we want to do X, Y and Z. When's your kid getting here? Ok so let's do X (get the tree) by this date so we can decorate it on this evening we both have off. Can you manage the getting of tree, great, now cookies...

This way it feels more like a business meeting where tasks are agreed on, distributed and given timelines based on the consensus. You feel more like a team together.

I left the bin with everything in the hallway. He never bothered to put anything else up so I just left it as is. I realize that it will be *me* who has to take it all down so why bother?

I usually remind him about buying gifts for his side of the family. I haven't been doing that anymore and he'll be semi-freaking out because he missed one of his parents birthdays. I'm sorry, why do *I* have to remember *everyone's* birthday? Luckily he hasn't blamed me for his own forgetfulness because my response would automatically be ""when's my mom's birthday?

Oh, and I was just a *little* disappointed this year. I didn't get any gifts from him. If my mom didn't sent me a gift I wouldn't have had anything to open. His reasoning? He purchased me a new monitor and graphics card last month. So he told me *that* was my gift. Well... I would have believed that if you told me when you gave it to me then that they would be considered my gifts. But that was never said until Christmas rolled around. So it kind of hurt.

Even our anniversary, which is right before Christmas, made me sad. I got nothing. ""I didn't think we were exchanging gifts."" But we never spoke about that? We exchange gifts every year, since the first year we were married. ""I thought the big dinner was our gift to each other."" Oh, the big dinner I prepared *on my own??* Nothing about that day made it feel any different than any other day for me. I wasn't upset so much about not getting a gift, but him stating the dinner was the gift when I did all the work made me depressed.

Someone mentioned ""walk away wife syndrome"" and I think that explains my lack of anger. I wasn't mad, I was just so incredibly sad. I no longer want to fight about things because I don't feel like there is anything worth fighting for.",bunnyrut,t2_goray,855,0,reddit3

Saved my sanity and probably my marriage. There is nothing better than a cold hard dose of reality- for both of us.   


For me, I learned how utterly magical and lovely holidays can be when you are appreciated and rested. He learned how utterly entitled and delusional his expectations were. He had a little-boy Xmas fantasy, and my role was supposed to be the doting loving mommy, so no matter how many talks or sit-down negotiations we had, deep inside the resentment brewed for any level of participation beyond fun and enjoyment from him. The final year he had a literal tantrum in front of our 35 guests because he *just didn't wanna* stand at the other end of the table to help me put the table leaves in. I will never forget watching our entire friends and family circle snap their necks and scowl at him.  After I got over the humiliation of it, I decided never again.   


The best part was that my in-laws were the ones that paid for my spa weekend away over Xmas. It came with a heartfelt letter about how much they appreciated me throwing the family holidays for the previous 15 years. They told me to take off and they'd have my back.   


Flash forward six or seven years and my in-laws are coming for a small dinner tomorrow. I woke up to the kitchen scrubbed and my shopping list completed for me. I didn't ask for any of it, nor did I expect it. He's so fucking engaged and in tune since then that I sometimes wonder what exactly my in-laws said to him, or what happened on that Xmas away.

It’s not fair, but you have to hope that your husband will be your partner and understand how important this is for you once explained. The men can do better. If you can get your husband on board, he can subtly get the other men to do things more easily and help change the overall family dynamic. He can start clearing the table and gently ask other men things like “hey can you bring dishes over” or “hey can you help take out the garbage”. Obviously delegating small tasks like that are not really that helpful but they can start changing the family dynamic away from having all the men sit on the couch while all the work happens in other rooms.

Dad has his job, and she is the one who loves Christmas, so she always ended up being the driving force. We'd all clean, help put up the tree, I love wrapping presents, and whatever else, but she was always the one making the list and making it happen. 

There's been a bit more on their plates this year. Not so much time for Christmas. But as an adult child on holiday break, I have more time, I have a license, and I know how to do shit. I just never really wanted to before. But I got out the tree this year, I put up the lights, I did the traditions, I made cookies and some food, I cleaned, and I helped my sibling shop for presents. I got mom gifts and family gifts, both usually done by my parents. Overall? Really not that hard, actually. One of my favorite Christmases yet. Especially since everyone else did pitch in, just not as much as usual. Hell, I was throwing up sick in the week leading up to Christmas, but I still wrapped presents and got it done. Obviously not *all* of it, but definitely more than before. 

I think overall everyone had a good time. Sometimes there's things that people do because *they* like it and then feel like no one else is caring to help when in reality the big Christmas dinner is only something they really like. Everyone else thinks it's nice, but not a necessity. Which is fine, that's your tradition and people should still help out a little, but I for example don't care as much about the house being spotless before the holiday whereas my mom does. Definitely not as clean this year, but we did tidy up. And that's fine. I did my piece, especially in the areas I care about, and if someone cared enough to find a mop they were welcome to have at it. What really pisses me off is the tales of 'if you want a tree, here's the box,' and then the tree never gets put up but the person still bitches about it. Hey, I put up the tree all by myself, bar ornaments. Takes a bit of time and annoyance, but if it matters even a little bit it'll get done and it takes very little effort. But once you have a mountain of holiday tasks...that tree becomes much more daunting and a real mental tax to to. So getting everyone involved in some way, especially in something they care about, is critical to avoiding that holiday-maker burnout. Kids can 100% help tidy up, even small ones.

Hell, the thing I saw about gifts for other relatives? Yeah that is split too. My dad gives books for people mostly while my mom is the one who likes giving LEGO to the kids and shirts to others. My mom doesn’t cook at all and my dad would until I grew up so now I do. 

Now that we are older my parents do less and so me and my siblings do most of it. But even now my dad and my mom do things still and even shop differently for us and each other and others. 

I was thinking this must be because of my role reversal household since my mom makes more than my dad and he is the more hands on parent and she is the workaholic. But that can’t be it. I was so shocked by what I was reading I asked my other relatives. It is mostly split as well, even on my more conservative branches.

Women are taught to ways sacrifice themselves for love and that love can change a man but men are taught that women will and must accept any scraps men give them and if you as a man don't  feel compelled to act lovingly towards the woman who's your partner then it means she doesn't love you enough to change you, not enough of a woman to be respected and be seen as an equal.

I'll make this as short as possible but I want to paint a clear picture in the hopes of trying to answer your ""why"". November 20th my mother in law passed away. December 9th my grandma passed away. December 17th we had a memorial gathering at our house for my mother in law. We had 40-45 people come through between 2pm and 1am. I planned the food, the drinks, the decorations, everything. I cooked, I cleaned, I cared for every guest that came through our home. I didn't expect my husband to help because the passing of his mom was and is very hard on him. That was fine. This past weekend was another gathering at my house for Christmas, around 10 people including us. I cleaned the house again after the memorial dinner, I planned another menu, I got the groceries, I prepared the gifts, I cared for the guests and have just now, 2 days later, finished cleaning up. This weekend will be the third gathering for new years and our anniversary. Generally we don't host this much but this hasn't been a normal month for us. I've planned the menu, the drinks, and have most of the groceries I'll need. He set up a folding table yesterday and claimed that as his contribution. I'm frustrated. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally. But we did have a damn good time the last 2 weekends. 

He irritates the life out of me sometimes. He doesn't see things the way I see them and that isn't entirely his fault. Me communicating clearly my needs and him ignoring them IS his fault. But he also makes me laugh like no one I've ever known. He makes me feel beautiful every single day. He is patient. I know he will always be there. He is open and willing to communicate with me. He tries in his way even though it isn't always the way I need him to try. No two people will ever be in perfect flow with one another, someone will always have to be flexible. I'm sure I irritate the life out of him sometimes too! He may never walk past something on the floor and just pick it up without being asked but he's my guy and what we've built is bigger than my frustration. That doesn't make the frustration any less valid. 

Maybe that helped answer your question, maybe it didn't. But I've been struggling with this today and typing all this out certainly helped dispel my frustration. You've earned my husband an extra hug tonight, friend.",kaerfehtdeelb,t2_wnbn3d,3,0,reddit3

Because we are ALWAYS made to be default home manager. Men are largely completely apathetic and inept and happily expect the women in their lives to do and put in the work on everything, whether it is for *his* side of family or not.  


The best thing we can do as women is to just **Not Care Anymore**. Don't Do It. We must become the ones that care *less* when it comes to these details than they do. Once they realize the cleaning, Christmas, holidays in general and birthdays *Don't fucking happen without them putting in the work,* either they will happen or they won't.   


It happens or it doesn't. Men just expect us to make all of the magic for this shit and the only way for them to wake up is to just stop doing everything for them. Let his dishes pile up. Don't do any laundry that isn't yours. Step over the trash or hairballs or cat puke laying around the house. Set boundaries and just wait for him to bitch about it so you can tell him he can do it or it's not getting done.   


I've found shaming them works well also in front of their friends/family:  


""*Partner* doesn't even act like he knows how to operate the washing machine. I stopped washing his clothes for him and he ended up *wearing the same dirty socks, undershirts and underwear for 2 weeks!""*   


""*Partner* attempted making some boxed macaroni on his own and didn't even know he had to boil the macaroni before putting the cheese on it.""  


""The last time *partner* tried making anything in the oven he left the carboard on the bottom of the frozen pizza and set the oven on fire, he flipped out and I had to put out the flames!!""  


Literally unless something is made a HUGE deal of it'll just be forgotten and the dumb shit repeated.

j1wmh87,t1_j1v4v5w,2022-12-27 23:09:37,TwoXChromosomes,"My husband and I have been having this conversation in pieces. 

First was the year he got me the worst birthday gift I’ve received in my life. The next was the year he got me the next worst gift I’ve ever received. Several other conversations later we arrived at this past Christmas Day. 

His mom was joining us for supper at 6-630. On Christmas Eve he slept in until noon. We’ve discussed this ongoing situation where he sleeps all morning regardless of his responsibilities multiple times. He still does it. It is silently killing out relationship. I didn’t lift a finger to clean or tidy until he got up and started doing something. He promptly quit at 5pm because that’s quitting time. Fewer than 5 hours of effort from him. Fine. 

Christmas Day was the same. I got up and took care of the morning chores and started getting food prepped for supper time. He gets up and tries to be all lovely-dovey. It pissed me off. 

By 3:30 I had done a huge number of tasks and he had…???? Tidied the kitchen all fucking day, shoveled the snow, and took some boxes to the garbage. Then he asks me “what can I take off your plate?” 

Some people might stop me here and say “awww but that was thoughtful!” Fuck that. I shouldn’t have to tell another inhabitant of this domicile that the bathroom needs to be cleaned, the floors swept, the garbage emptied and the table cleared before we have guests for supper. 

So I told him exactly that. I said: you should know at this point in your life (M34; homeowners of 10 years) which tasks need to be done and how to do them PROPERLY before hosting guests. 

You can see there were things in the floor in the hall; why didn’t you pick them up? You put things directly in my way as I was doing a different task because you were too lazy to simply move some things out of the way to put them away yourself. 

There are certain tasks that HAVE to be done by me because you literally have never done them, and wouldn’t even know where to begin if you tried. Even if I accept **that,** I still cannot look past you simply not doing things that you **are** capable of doing because I didn’t tell you they needed to be done. 

You need to put some real effort into improving your ability to self-direct in this home because currently helping you “help” is actually just another task on my list. If I have to do the things we are both capable of doing as well as the tasks only I can do, then you are actually hamstringing us. By forcing me to redirect my attention away from tasks that only I can do you’re single-handedly stressing me out, and putting both of us behind. I can’t count on you to see a full garbage and take it out. Even if I tell you to take the garbage out, you only do the kitchen garbage, not the bathrooms and certainly not the office. 

So then what’s the solution? Do you expect me to make you a list of common sense things? Why do *I* need to make that list? My solution is this: learn how to do everything I do. Take things off my plate by first learning how to do them, **then do them without asking me or without me having to direct you.** 

“What can I take off your plate?” Is just another way to rephrase “what do you want me to do?/what should I do?” If you want to be a teammate then don’t make me responsible for your actions. If you want to be a teammate, tell me what you plan to do, do it, then come back and ask me “what’s still on the list?” That way at least you’re not making me entirely responsible for managing you and actually will be helping me if I need it. 

Finally stop “helping” by randomly doing things that only I can do because all you do is fuck me up and prevent me from getting my own work done by forcing me to stop what I’m doing to tell you how to do that task. 

He was upset but honestly, I’ve had enough. I feel like most of what I’m asking for is not only reasonable, but info on most of the stuff he’s confused by is readily available online. I told him that next time he should do it all and I’ll sleep in till noon and quit at 5.

Men don't suck, it's not the way it is. It happens to the same people over and over again because they shape their lives and relationships around ensuring it happens. They didn't get their by accident, it's not something their husbands did to them, it's not something they were ever powerless to prevent. It's a dysfunctional relationship dynamic both them and their partner put effort into creating. 

And almost all of the time it's hard to get out of, not because 'men are lazy' but because they've spent however many years building a relationship where it's foundation is both of them treating the other person as *less than a person*. There is no repairing that, it requires tearing the relationship down to it's bones and building a better one. But no one wants to even imagine doing that, or that there's any actual issue at the core of their relationship, or that they've just fucked up having a functional happy relationship in the first place. It's an easy pattern to fall in: Silent-Self-Sacrifice-As-Womanhood is baked into a lot of western culture, because  Christianity comes with all kinds of brainworms about feminine virtues. But it's also entirely avoidable by just not doing that. 

The number of genuinely useless men is far less than the number of people who just behave the way their partners expected them to. There's a reason why people with healthy functional relationships where they treat their spouse as a whole person just 'magically' don't have this problem. It also doesn't even suck to have to advocate for that. If you're not advocating for yourself in a relationship like that, you're sabotaging yourself. Your partner can't advocate to themselves on your behalf, expecting them to do so is screwed up to the point of bordering on abuse.

Luckily my partner was very perceptive of our conversation, and really had not realized what was important to me, and that I wasn't being appreciated at all by him. He made some big changes and made efforts to be better. He's honestly amazing now, but it was stressful for a number of years before he realized I won't deal with no effort from him anymore...

The thoughtless gifts were sometimes mingled with more thoughtful ones - it would ebb and flow, but it did reach a point of being forever endlessly careless and low-effort. Like many women I’m a high achiever and was able to carry the weight of it all for a long time, until I just couldn’t anymore. But I definitely think my little stories of profound thoughtlessness is a warning sign for a person that’s totally dismissive about your wants and needs. All he could register from me was “name” and “necklace” - I had shown him picture and talked about why I liked it so much and why it would be meaningful to me. He was profoundly disengaged. Here’s the worst part - both he and I had fooled myself so greatly about his love and investment in our marriage, and enabled him so much that I was sure he would continue to be a good father to our child. He had seemed like the best dad. No more - he remarried almost immediately and she’s super manipulative and has destroyed his relationships with his family and our child. I had to sue him for more custody, which was a nightmare, but at least I won. My child became suicidal at age 7 due to the weird shit and stresses they put in her. Somehow I married a person that was unaffectionate, shut down, isolated, didn’t have many friends, wouldn’t go to therapy consistently, lazy, was derisive of anything that wasn’t his own interest and would say anything I wanted to hear to escape accountability. But he put on a great show of looking capable to the rest of the world. He was handsome, made a great impression, is a lawyer with three degrees. Took me 20 years to piece it all together. Finding a good partner is definitely tricky, scary business. I’m 46, so just scraping by with the emotional skills I’ve developed after being raised as a Gen X kid.

But when we were living together we would just throw a load in when the hamper was full. But when he washed my clothes he ruined a lot of them. I needed black pants for work. And I would buy new pants constantly because when he would wash them they would come out with white streaks all over them. I have *never* managed to have a pair come out like that when I did laundry. And I told him he was washing them wrong, by either using too much detergent or overstuffing the machine, and he just... kept doing whatever he was doing. So I got fed up and told him to stop washing my clothes because I was tired of throwing them out and moving forward we do our own laundry.

I grew up in a household and watched my mother continually work herself to death, figuratively, and my dad never assisted. Yes, he worked often and was gone from home because of it, but when he was home all the duties fell on my mom. I was a little shit back then too who got my stubbornness and laziness from my father, so I rarely helped as well.

When my fiancé and I moved in together into our little apartment, the first thing I did was sit down with her and set some ground rules as preventive measures. I initiated the conversation because I didn’t want to become my dad. I wanted to ensure we acted as a team. And I know, with my habits, the moment I fall into a routine it becomes incredibly difficult for me to pull myself out. I knew my short falls going in, that’s why I was worried she might be overworked some day unless I was proactive.

She also has Acts of Service as her primary love language and this is one way I can truly love her in the way she needs to be loved to feel loved. And she reciprocates with the ways I need to be loved to feel loved because of this.",WeightlifterCat,t2_xvvtz,18,0,reddit3

When you make certain traits as proper and instinctual for one gender but not the other then you have a weapon of oppression. As you can see many posts are about women wondering if their partners abuse is normal, if this is what everyone's lives are like and when they see another point of view they might get a wake up call.

But that doesn't mean you're ready to leave. Maybe it's the kids (women are usually the main caregivers),  maybe its the lack of education or lack of income (women usuallt put their education or careers on hold to care for their families) or maybe it's that the endocrination and pressure to be the perfect woman is mentally crippling and you don't have the safe network to leave.

Once children arrived the violence and denial started. There was this tragic increase in apathy which completely contradicted what he talked about and he still refuses to acknowledge the gap between his words and actions. It's why there's so much talk in this space about narcissism. the refusal to acknowledge and connect brings a silent devastation but as long as they have attention they DGAF if it's +ve or -ve. as long as the focus remains on them. 

the narcissists prayer: 

That didn’t happen.

Violent controlling men utilize aspects of narcissism to exert power and dominance. the refusal to take responsibility in relationships is real but ultimately they'll try to appear to acknowledge accountability if it means they don't have to actually do anything to model accountability.

I helped her clean and organize her workshop, I cleaned our living room and shovelled the snow/salted. Etc.

If you're just spending time together doing nothing out of the ordinary, it's still nice, but isn't really a 'holiday', it's just 'day to day'. Also the activities don't have to be high maintenance! Setting up and decorating the tree, or pulling out the fine china for my mum weren't that hard, but the unique effort made it special for the season. 

Plus everyone has different traditions and rituals for the holidays. Some family friends of ours would go all out on a big turkey/Filipino/Ukrainian feast and a party for everyone, my family would have our little personal seafood feast, my partners family all just get together and eat cheese and crackers and play cards through the night. But no matter the level of high or low maintenance, everyone would try and pitch in and do what they could so no one had to feel like they were working solo or burning out.

I guess it all depends on people plainly communicating their expectations and limits, compromising where necessary, and helping out as much as they can.

In fact, no matter what he says, if the price of moving is sorting and getting rid of stuff, that might be something that never happens at all.  


It's super common for hoarders to mix genuine valuables with trash.  When it's time for me to sort out my mom's house, I'm going to have to go through it with a fine toothed comb, open every book, every box, even the box of tea in the cupboard, looking for jewelry and cash.  


It's so hard to see in someone that you love.   Hoping or wanting a hoarder to sort things out is a lot like hoping your friend with two broken legs is going to run a marathon.  With a \*lot\* of motivation, and a lot of therapy, your friend \*might\* in fact be able to rehab themselves, but it's going to take a lot more than hopes and wishes (or even friendly help from friends and family).  


I can only imagine how hard this is on your mom or anyone else who ever lives with him.

Do you think you could get him to do a blood test?  There is a condition called MTHFR, it's a fairly common genetic mutation that, in layman's terms, means that people who have it do not metabolize nutrients well.  As an example, where pregnant women are told to take a 400mg dose of folic acid each day, I was put on a 10x dose to make up for the inefficiency of how I metabolize things.  Folic acid is a B vitamin.

When I had a panic attack that landed me in the ER they told me that I was deficient in magnesium.  Magnesium deficiency is common in people who drink coffee and/or soda.  Zinc too.  B vitamin deficiency can lead to depression and other mood disorders, and can just generally zap your energy.

Another thing that might be going on is some form of adhd.  I don't know a lot about it, but one component is getting excited about a project, starting the project, and then getting distracted and never returning to the project.  But of course not wanting to ""admit defeat"" and get rid of the project either.

I bought the presents, therefore the presents are from me.  The grandmother is buying disproportionate amounts of gifts across the children and I'm pointing it out.

Versus passive aggressive which is supposed to be an indirect form of control.  I think passive aggressive would be doing something like buying less nice gifts or choosing not to gift at all but not being direct or honest about why.

I was using the phrase colloquially but it turns out there is a behavioral sciences application for the terms.

I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder. But whatever sey of actions they take, I think they should make their feelings clear instead of choking them down and doing what they think is polite.

If i was posting about how much I suffer from my weight and made no allusion to any efforts for weight loss, then someone comments if I have tried eating less than my TDEE, they would be right. And if I were not eating less, then when someone comments : ""That would require him wanting to fix the issue rather than complain about his body.""

Part of being an good ally is knowing what kind of conversations you shouldn't be intruding in.  
The OP is venting about an imbalance in emotional and domestic labor.  While not universal, that is a situation that is most often tied up in gender norms: it may not be relevant for all men, but it is reflective of too many men and their outlook on relationship dynamics.  
  
More generally, sometimes the point of communication in a support group is not to give or receive advice, but rather to vent and to grapple with stress via social interaction.  That is the case here.  Those conversations are not generally ones where disagreements from an ally are productive or useful.  
  
The OP is not creating a policy debate or organizing an action which requires careful critique.  She is venting about her frustration with a gendered and common (but not universal) problem.  It doesn't matter if you and some other men don't contribute to the problem the OP is venting about.  Her partner does, as do many others.

My wife is Jewish and she hates that word, because she has heard it used a slur more often than not. 

Personally, I think you either have a bit of a superiority complex for your people/culture and don’t realise it/are playing innocent, or you are just optimistic to the point of naïveté about gender roles in the Jewish community. The Jewish faith and texts, like basically any religion, has *hardcore* misogyny and female subservience to men built in. While there are some interesting differences spiritually speaking such as Jewishness being passed down by the mother, for the most part it’s just good old fashioned male superiority baked into the life manual. 

My father in law doesn’t lift a finger around the house. Neither do my uncles. That’s not to say that they’re more misogynist or putting more baggage on their wives than non-Jews, just that I have no idea where this notion that Jews respect women like no other culture and Jewish marriages are all 50/50 is coming from because they seem to be just as flawed as the rest of society.

j1vdzuf,t1_j1v8b9i,2022-12-27 18:10:00,TwoXChromosomes,"> And again others disagree with her take but you are singling me out for being male.

I don't actually: I think she's missing some nuance that would be needed if she were, for example, trying to actively study the problem rather than expressing frustration.
But the basic complaint - that the emotional and domestic labor around the holidays is often imbalanced in a way that is tied up in social gender roles, and that it is damn frustrating to be on the loosing end of that - is one I find to be valid.  
  
> Your entire take is that my voice is bad and harmful BECAUSE I'm not a women.  
> Why the hell would this specific topic be one where a man's voice shouldn't matter?  
  
I wouldn't say either bad or harmful.  I would say unproductive, and off topic.  
Moreover - I'm also assuming you're not trolling, but simply missing some of the context clues about the implicit topic.  
    
Communication in a support group serves many different purposes, and sometimes the topic is implicit.  
You are providing a secondary textual critique of the OP's post - the fact that she attributed the problem to ""men.""  
You seem to have taken that to be a critique of all men (an interpretation I would advise against in most cases) rather than taking it as a critiques of social gender roles which have a decided but not inherent slant.  
  
The actual implicit topic of conversation is, to my eyes, the OP expressing frustration with both her situation and with the social gender biases that contributed to bringing it about.  
That is a valid thing to be frustrated about.  
It is a valid thing that might cause someone to seek to vent to a group of people who have also experienced the issue.  
  
Pointedly, it is also something that an ally on the other side of the gender gap cannot have experienced first hand.  
You might have experiences an analogous issue.  You might have a empathetic understanding of the frustration.  
But you can't have experienced the issue - and thus the the implicit goal of the conversation (""I want to vent about this frustration to others who have experienced it"") is not one that you can directly provide.  
  
The same thing applies to other contexts.  If black teenagers a the youth center I volunteer at are venting about their frustration with (for example) their school dress code not supporting natural black hair, I cannot meaningfully contribute to the venting.  
I understand the issue intellectually. I can empathize.  I can try (internally) to tie it back to my displeasure about strongly gendered dress codes that prohibited me from wearing slacks as a teenager.  
  
But I cannot participate in a collective expression of frustration with experiencing that particular injustice.  So I sit quietly unless invited to speak.
  
  
In a different kind of conversation, a different approach can be appropriate.  If those same students were seeking to change the offensive dress code in question, then critiques of their exact language and presentation might not only be valid but helpful - that's the kind of thing that can be very important in getting an organized action off the ground.  

Likewise: if the OP were seeking advise on the topic or advising/advocating some form of action, then a good ally should speak up if they have meaningful insights into how to improve success.  
  
> This is a horrible destructive sexist take on your part.  
  
The opposite of sexism is not sex blindness or gender blindness, any more than the opposite of racism is race blindness.  
There are topics where I limit my participation because I am not male: if someone want to have a discussion about a policy to combat toxic masculinity, I'll participate.  If a man wants to vent about their frustrations from struggling with toxic masculinity, I'll listen quietly unless explicitly asked for input.

Your commitment to the just world hypothesis where bad things only happen to people who somehow invite bad things in through their choices is a classic example of victim-blaming. You can read a whole article about it here: [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-psychology-of-victim-blaming/502661/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/the-psychology-of-victim-blaming/502661/)

Victim blaming a way to feel safe and maintain a belief that the world is always just, and people always get what they deserve, a belief that confirms that as long as you make good choices, you will never become a victim yourself. That's naive self-soothing that comes at the expense of victims and ignores the circumstances that led to them bearing the consequences of other people's shitty behaviour.

Not being at fault for a situation is not being without options or power. Recognizing that a victim is not at fault means not believing the childish fairy tale that victims are to blame for what other people do.

Maybe one day you'll be in a situation where you made all the best choices you could and you still end up someone's victim. If that happens, I hope no one tells you you got yourself in that situation, because it sucks to hear.",TeaGoodandProper,t2_1aq12cxi,3,0,reddit3

now, i have a rather dirty mind and i make crude jokes but the examples listed are near-to flirts in my books. (wanting you nearer) whereas my jokes are usually when i phrase something weirdly and make an innuendo. but i can understand that there may be a very thin line between them and itd change person to person.

i dont know why some men feel like they must always half hit on every 20 something that breathes. its kinda fucking gross, especially considering theyre usually 15-35 years older, may have wives...

just to clarify: my verbiage is not diminishing the fact it is sexual harassment; i understand op was made uncomfortable regardless of how many halves of a hit i feel were made. 

the fact op mentioned therapy for things that id never think twice about is making me really think over how i act going forward.

Obviously it is horrible and demeaning to explicitly address, first and foremost, when dealing with a practitioner who happens to be female, her age, marital status, relationship status, and appearance.

The thing I wonder about, though, is whether there was a time when it was terribly impolite *not* to do that.

There is a clear difference between being a patient and someone who is borderline sexual harassment. 

OP posted this...

> Ex. Doing a skin exam in dermatology to check for skin cancer ""don't worry, she looks like she's seen a man naked before, she can stay in the room."" Or, while weighing a patient on an old scale where you must move the weights physically: I said ""sorry, this is a small space don't mind my reach,"" while he said ""I wouldn't mind you getting closer to me"" 

This constitutes sexual harassment as everything said here is said towards that person in a sexual way. This is way different then someone saying something because they are nervous or in a ""vulnerable"" state.

You said this.

> Patients are allowed to **say** almost anything that they want to staff because they are in such a powerless position. 

I've worked in the healthcare field and I've worked in patient therapy and this is so not true I don't know where to start. Patients ARE NOT allowed to say almost anything that they want. People are responsible for what they say, especially if it sexual, in any way shape or form. Thinking like this is what is causing the problem and allowing sexual harassment to not only happen but to continue. 

You also said this.

> Standing your ground to prove a point with a patient regarding words not related to their healthcare needs shows misguided priorities. You are working where they came to get help. Dressing down someone in a vulnerable position is not help. 

While this may be true in some cases like arguing if the charts are done in blue or black ink, wait times, or even habits, this does not pertain to sexual harassment.  This is a choice up to OP to decide if the comments the patient made are a form of sexual harassment or not. If they are, then I don't care who you are, what you are, what  you do, or who you know, they are UNACCEPTABLE.

As the first person he interacts with every week I agree it’s crucial how I interact with patients and make them feel welcome. However, I won’t do this if I feel it will eventually lead to more difficult situations for them (or worse, anger I “lead him on”)

You're thinking how long back? 50s? Earlier? Later?

I think it was more universally accepted as women were seen as ""inferior"". You know, the ""fairer sex"" and women didn't have the support (unlike today) to rebuke the advances/comments that they do now. If they did, they were probably told to ""calm down"" or stop being a ""prude"" it's just a compliment! /s

Think about how hard it was for a woman to enter the workforce, not even how hard it was to be more than just a secretary. Women were expected to stay home and mind the house and children. To have a hot meal ready for when their husband came home.

Which, as I type that I realize things really *haven't* changed much, because we still hear the same things. It's worse now because some men (NOT all) make themselves out to be the ""victims"" especially with the rise of #metoo

I've heard/seen so many people say ""I'm afraid to say hi! to a female co-worker now! She may think I'm harrassing her"" and many things along those lines.

No. You can say hi. You can ask how we're doing. Just don't add on Honey, Sweetheart, Doll etc and don't talk down to us.

All women are asking for is respect as people, the humans we are. 

Not being combative here, just my thoughts as a woman. And no, I don't think you were ""man-splaining"" it's a legit question and only natural to wonder about it :)

My grandfather,still alive, grew up in the 20’s and 30’s -ish...he was Army or Air Force. I could never nail down the time frame. Sometime between the Army Air Corps and becoming the Air Force, he would NEVER talk like that! He was involved in the old war, I’m sure he has said plenty in his time, around his boys (friends).

Yes, times were different; slang was different then. Drunk Driving was NOT criminal, it was an ‘accident’(even with fatalities). Grabbing a women’s buttocks was just like, “Good Game”! 

All of that was inappropriate, even in the Tardis! It also was not ‘socially’ inappropriate at the time.

A served in the Navy as a Corpsman, and if you are unaware of what that is think of it as a medic or LPN. But basically they are trained to work anywhere and everywhere in the hospital. So I've worked in a wide variety of clinics and wards. And I am an African-American man, and while I'm not Denzel out here in these streets I'm not a bad looking fella. 

I've been groped, called names and innuendoes of overtly sexual natures, subject to racism, and villainized for being a man, etc. My favorite is a sweet old lady who'd only refer to me as ""Brown Boy""... I want that brown boy to take my blood, where's the brown boy with my food, etc. She was a woman who was as politically incorrect as she was sweet. 

But, you have to be able to roll with shit like that. If you let every off comment, questionable behavior, or just blatant bigotry get to you, some places can eat you alive and burn you out faster than polyester pants soaked in jet fuel.  If you confront every single patient over every little thing, you're going to spend just as much time arguing with your patients as you do caring for them. 

BUT, your mental and emotional health is important and you HAVE to be able to assert yourself and set limits. Some patients you just have to do that with because if not they'll run right over you. In the end its about developing a thick skin to deal with a majority of the shit and provide the best patient care you can offer and growing a strong spine to stand up for yourself when you need to. And then from there its just getting a feel for when to utilize one over the other. 

OP is doing just fine. I thought this was going to be another I stood up for myself and went to HR post but I'm proud that she's developing the courage to advocate for herself. Being called sweets may or may not be a big deal, but that wasn't the point. The point was her to get experience speaking up and setting her boundaries, and she did so wonderfully.

Professional and polite .... that's the threshold.

If any adult patient puts any body part in contact with any body part of a healthcare provider without consent (and vise versa), there are legal standards and professional policies/procedures to create an environment of safety for all concerned. That is an entirely separate scenario that gets incredibly complicated if the patient is impaired mentally or intellectually by disease or treatment.

So what I mean by this is it is up to the OP to decide on the whole situational comments that are being made. We know that people will say things when they are nervous/scared/anxious, however we can easily tell when a comment is being made in said moods. Being that I've worked in the healthcare industry for a while I've seen it for myself. People act differently when under distress and it is very visible. It is also very visible when someone says something in a sexual nature that is meant to be sexual. This is up to the OP to determine if that person is in distress/afraid/scared, whatever.  If you honestly cannot tell the difference between someone saying something that could be sexual harassment then maybe you need to step back and look at the conversation, how the person is acting and the very visible body langue that is being displayed. The tells are always there, you just need to be clued in to what you're looking for.

Also keep in mind that looking from the outside in you will almost always miss the factors involved for you to determine this for yourself. Again, it is up to the OP to make the call, not a bystander.",,,2,0,reddit4

The models are quite slender, especially the woman wearing the full suit with tie. On average Americans are quite a bit heavier, and the slim pants might get snug on big thighs and calves. The maintenance uniform with cargo pants would work well. There isn't really a full assortment of gender/clothing, either. No men are shown wearing the diagonal white/black sweater - maybe one guy has it under a short jacket - and no women wear the buttonup shirt with shoulder boards. The shoes look very practical.

Wouldn't a lot of women not find this flattering at all? Of course many people want to just blend in and be functional, but there are also a lot of women who take pride in their figure and shape. The unisex clothes in general are basically just oversized / mens cut which I frankly feel comes across as a little counter productive, like we are just removing the women's fit.

I see it in a very similar light to mixed gender bathrooms. Mixed gender bathroom means male bathroom and women can come in too if they can stand being there. Unisex clothes just look like mens clothes except ""hey its for women too"".

Of course everyone can wear what they want, but is this really the future? Wearing clothes designed to fit the male frame but in women's sizes?",other_goblin,t2_uvhe3ry5,4,0,reddit1

Staff used to (gasp) PUT THINGS IN THEM. And, you know, it changed the shape of the pocket.

Someone must have decided that it made the staff look less elegant or something, but sure enough, when the next uniform came along, the pockets had shrunk could only fit a pen, and maybe a lipstick. 

The final straw was a uniform issue where (unlike previous uniforms), there were no try-on sessions before ordering your sizes. Instead, we were issued a tape measure, and had to submit measurements. The uniform nazis then made the decision as to what size we would be supplied with. 

This particular uniform was designed (male designer) to be form-fitting. They knew that people, if allowed a fitting, would choose sizes that were comfortable, instead of the skin-tight look that the designer was after. Awful uniform.",Kementarii,t2_ctpdj,451,0,reddit1

jam76ja,t1_jam4m9p,2023-03-02 12:54:30,TwoXChromosomes,"Agreeded, but these clothes are not genderless at all. They all fit the styling of “men’s clothing”, there are no styles or stylistic details that are in the existing vernacular that is “women’s clothing”, in terms of signifiers for gendered clothing. A genderless clothing collection should include signifiers from both “men’s clothing” and “women’s clothing”, sometimes on the same garment, and also should implement a sizing system that is not gendered, but is diverse/dimensional enough to include 2 or more types of bodily proportions. 

“Unisex” is a misnomer in itself, because clothing is devoid of biological sex, but it is an established term long used for clothing of “men’s” styles and size scales, but intended to be worn on bodies of any sex or by people with any gender expression. This clothing fits that definition, from what I can tell. 

I’d be in favor of changing the term Unisex to something else. In fact, what could really also be changed is the terms “men’s clothing” and “women’s clothing” to something less gendered, and maybe more descriptive of the differences in the way they are constructed and scaled, so people could have an easier time finding clothes that fit (women have been shopping in the men’s section or wearing/incorporating the men’s clothing vernacular for eons, yet men still are hesitant to try women’s sizes even if they may fit better, or enjoy to benefits of a skirt). Until then maybe we should just go back to calling unisex “men’s”; nearly always, the only difference between unisex and men’s clothing is the message is that “it’s okay for a woman to wear it” or “this item doesn’t come in women’s sizes.” So, marketing? 

But as it’s an established term that most everyone, even people who know little about fashion, understands when they are buying custom printed T-shirts for their family reunion trip to Disney World, I don’t see it changing soon. It’s a misnomer that stuck, kind of like how it says “font” in the drop-down of the word processor, instead of “typeface”.",eveningtrain,t2_nc0ov,22,0,reddit1

My work shirt is 100% polyester. I do a physical job (housekeeping at a hotel), I get sweaty because I'm working hard, and polyester doesn't breathe so I get sweatier than I should- obviously you end up stinking. No worries, I'll wear a different shirt tomorrow. Same thing happens, now you've worked two days and you're only issued two work shirts. All well and good for me, because I have a washing machine.

But many of the workers are students in student accommodation, with coin operated washing machines, so they can't do laundry every other day. So half the staff shows up in the morning kind of stinky and the other half show up out of uniform. 

Side note; some people show up out of uniform citing this complaint purely because the shirts are unflattering (the men's ones are designed for tall, thin, broad shouldered men and the women's ones are designed for small, thin women with large boobs and both look bad on 90% of us) or because they're not comfortable with the low neckline - bit of a piss take to have a low neckline on a uniform for women where we'll have to be bending down a lot.

I was referring to this part. I don’t think that not looking curvy equates to masculine. 

My particular issue with his comments was telling women to “take pride in their figure and shape” (actual quote) in a post about functional work uniforms. Form-fitting and frame are different and his comment was acting like women who aren’t dressing in form-fitting clothing are wearing menswear.

My waist to hip ratio also isn’t big, but that also doesn’t make me look masculine. Just like a woman with narrow hips. 

I don’t like darts either, and not all women are shaped the same. To me “women’s cut” is not for curves - which differ widely between individuals - but frame which is largely the same. Like not needing a dropped crotch.

Advice that I learned from an NHS doctor: Get him to take turns lying on his back and his front if it's possible. This helps the lungs fight the infection as it helps redistribute the fluid inside the lungs around and stops one area from constantly being irritated by the fluid and allows it to heal itself faster. It will also help prevent pressure points and bedsores. They would do that in ICU if they had space for him. Allowing fresh air into the room is also helpful, especially since a lot of places have seen dramatic increases in air quality.

Consider trying to outsource or bring in some help. Even if it is getting prepared dinners sent to you. 

Take time for yourself (please just follow this one) - you are no good to anyone, husband or job, if you crash.  Plan on five or ten minutes every hour for yourself. Turn the phone on mute, go into a room by yourself away from hubby and computer. Just sit and breath. Five or Ten minutes. Give this to yourself. If you can do meditation take 30-60 minutes every day and do a longer decompress time. You can turn your phone off or only answer calls every other hour. This will allow you to focus. Unless it is an emergency you don't need to be answering the phone ever call.

Cleaning once a day isn't enough, you should be washing hands and changing clothes after every interaction. Just a mask is not enough, also use gloves that you throw away after you're done. Keep physical contact to a minimum, wear gloves and a mask (your husband too!). Even if you're already infected, it doesn't mean you can drop every precaution as every interaction transfers more virus from one to the other. It multiplies within your body, it can mutate or adapt differently to each body so transferring that to another person and getting his version back only increases the strain on your body's immune system which has to work harder and may get overwhelmed and that's when the real trouble begins.

The door of his wife’s car was open, as was the front door to the house and there was no sign of the dog.

Proceeding into the entry, he found an even bigger mess. A lamp had been knocked over, and the throw rug was wadded against one wall.

In the front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon channel, and the family room was strewn with toys and various items of clothing.

In the kitchen, dishes filled the sink, breakfast food was spilled on the counter, the fridge door was open wide, dog food was spilled on the floor, a broken glass lay under the table, and a small pile of sand was spread by the back door.

He quickly headed up the stairs, stepping over toys and more piles of clothes, looking for his wife. He was worried she might be ill, or that something serious had happened.

He was met with a small trickle of water as it made its way out the bathroom door.

As he peered inside he found wet towels, scummy soap, and more toys strewn over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap and toothpaste had been smeared over the mirror and walls.

As he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still curled up in the bed in her pajamas, reading a novel.

She looked up at him, smiled, and asked how his day went. He looked at her bewildered and asked:

“What happened here today?’”

She again smiled and answered, “You know every day when you come home from work and you ask me what in the world I do all day?”

“Yes,” was his incredulous reply.

My husband does ALL the cooking. And he works fulltime in finance. Self taught. And this continued whilenI was a SAHM for a few years.

If you are working outside the home then he needs to take on at home tasks.

A friend has a hubby who does zero at home. So she stopped doing his laundry. She stopped making a meal for him too unless shenis making a big batch of something. She stopped buying him extra stuff for grocery runs.

He didn't really change. He left all the family stuff to her. Years later and at least she still has a lot less on her plate.

Divorce will happen once she has enough money saved to get her own place for her and the kids.

My SO sometimes complains about cooking. So now I get him to help.me haul laundry around the house. Whining adds to what he needs to help with.

One time he pulled the ""I don't know how"" BS men try on cleaning something. I just looked at it. Then i looked at him and said, you're an adult figure it out. And walked away. He was hoping my ""I can do it better, so I'll just do it."" nature would take over.

And makes me wonder if anything exists like a prenup agreement, but for parenting, that is legally binding and clearly delineates fair division of labor and costs.

A successful businessman would never tolerate a slacking partner. Businessmen don’t prioritize seeming like flexible guys, they prioritize their businesses succeeding. This attitude just gets applied to being a father and husband less, for cultural reasons, where the woman doing the bulk of the labor is just assumed. Obviously, since this man is not fully financially or emotionally supporting you- and you don’t have a village of women to divide things up between- that can’t work here. 

Assuming you’ve already followed the standard Reddit advice to calmly CoMmUnIcAtE your needs (and they’ve been ignored), you either 1) accept the situation 2) think like a man and draw up such a document (and you act like a successful man in a boardroom does when you do this- no crying, no suffering fools gladly, no micromanaging his share of the tasks....if he can’t do them at a reasonable standard, he’s fired) or 3) he’s fired. You do the lion’s share of parenting and household labor here. This man is not cognizant of your impact.

Why do I keep seeing these sort of excuses, especially from women defending their useless partners. 

I apologise in advance if what I'm saying will feel accusatory and insulting to you (by dissing on your husband). I feel bad for you in your situation and I really think it's a common situation where women grew up expecting to pull all of the weight in a relationship and for the men to put in 0 effort that ANY small thing is seen as ""OMG this guy is doing something instead of nothing and he's such a great guy!"" Seriously the bar is set so low, doing bare minimum of a functional human being is seen as some amazing feat for a guy while their wife who does everything is just taken for granted because ""that's her job to take care of the house and kids"" etcetc. It's the man's job to create the mess and a woman's job to clean up. 

He takes care of the kids while you're at work? He just doesn't have homemaking skills??? 

These are his own kids. Loving and spending time with his children is the bare minimum of being a father. Looking after them when you're at work is less than the bare minimum. This is not something to be praised for.  You're basically saying he's not some deadbeat asshole who abandoned his family and therefore he's a good guy. The bar is so low I can't even articulate it.

No one just ""have homemaking skills"". Everyone is born without homemaking skills, and you learn the skills by putting in the effort to do it. He isn't willing to put in any effort because if he remains bad at it, you'll just do it for him. Why would he learn when you're just going to willing do everything for him? 

I feel bad that you're suffering, I really do. But you're really not giving your husband any credit - he is capable of doing housework, he just refuse to. Maybe he's also capable of appreciating your efforts in the house, or maybe he's really an asshole who takes you for granted and won't ever appreciate you. Maybe you seriously need to evaluate what you want from the relationship before your mental health suffers worse.

Sitting him down and having a proper conversation to lay out what you do in a day and why you're feeling burnout shouldn't ""feel like complaining"". Two people in a relationship and partnership should be capable of conversations. If the only response you get is that he's not willing to change, and that he thinks you're just complaining, then that's your answer to what kind of person you married. Whether you're happy with it is up to you. I can't tell you how to live your life.

I vaguely recall some research that looked at kids in areas with universal pre-K and kids who didn't. It found that kids with the universal pre-K had larger incomes as adults, not because of better education outcomes, but because their parents didn't have to pay market rates for over 1000 extra hours of childcare per child which gave children more of a safety net through their childhood and into adulthood.

It also noticeably had a larger positive effect on mother's income compared to father's, because generally the mothers could spend more time working, not to mention getting more promotions because their career wasn't paused for as long.",Veekhr,t2_iw2f5,82,0,reddit3

Someone who participates in everything and shows you appreciation and thoughtfulness or care doesn't suddenly stop doing those things because his partner gets pregnant and has kids.

I once broke up with someone who brought me breakfast in bed and went out to get fresh baked goods because he told me he was ""whipped like a little bitch"". He was doing it to show how much he cared about me and how serious he was. If their idea of putting in a LOT of effort is doing very basic tasks it was obvious what being in a long term relationship with them would be like.

let me put it this way:

as the OP has described, she feels shit because of how she's been treated.

so if you are going to accept that you feel shit, why not say something about it and explain how you're feeling over worked and under valued and you need your family to help out some more..

now they might still treat you like shit, but they might not, so in subsequent days, months and even years you are no longer going to be feeling like shit.

when you have two options, but only have control over one, why wouldn't you take control and prevent yourself feeling like shit? and please don't say 'you shouldn't have to'... you're right, you shouldn't have to, but if that's not the case, then take control and create an environment that makes you happy.",nicemace,t2_av26g,1,0,reddit3

Let's say you're in a relationship and you recently lost a loved one but you don't get the support you expected from your SO. It's something to discuss and work on but it's also something that shouldn't be ignored. It is a red flag.

I think before you get to the point in a relationship where you have children, it's your duty to see if your relationship and the person you're with can work with you the way you hope, wish and need them to during hard times and not just the happy times.

If after communicating with the person you're dating about the way you're not getting the emotional support you need from them it doesn't change the situation and even if you have strong feelings for them you're probably not compatible and having children with them would be a bad idea...

So if after having kids you get divorced, your career and earnings potential have basically been ruined. I don't consider that nothing.",Lilith_McGrendelface,t2_5pq78cih,3,0,reddit3

* Say you are expected to be paid similar to your counterparts ($30k raise) unless they can give you *specific details* on why you should be earning less. They should be able to put on paper why you are earning less if they want to keep it that way.
* Say you are disappointed to learn that a person with a lower title earned more than you and has gotten bigger raises.

Do not frame this as a raise (it is not) in the discussion. Its fixing an error they made. If they have any public/internal statements they made saying they care about equity, point to those and ask how the pay inequity is in line with those statement.

And you should be pissed. This is super disrespectful and feels devaluing. I'm sorry this is going on.

Edit: since this comment is now highly upvoted, I can get on my high horse and say a few things less relevant to OP's situation (which I think they have lots of great advice to resolve in these comments, excluding mine).

First, my advice is, as [another commenter rightly said](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qho2k3/comment/hieynvm/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), ""heavy handed."" I have burnt bridges before and have the privilege of having soft landings spaces as a white upper-middle class male. Not everyone can burn these bridges or be as heavy handed as I have the space to. That helps perpetuate these inequalities.

Second, far too many of the comments here are confusing an individual issue with a systemic issue. Sexism and wage inequality is a *systemic issue*. While negotiating, asking for bigger raises, being kick ass at the job *may* help resolve the individual issue, they do nothing to resolve the systemic issue. Saying this person failed to negotiate, or any of the other myriad of excuses here, is perpetuating and failing to acknowledge the systemic issues at play, regardless of the specifics of this situation. 

The hiring person, boss, and everyone in this situation may consider themselves a champion of equality and still feel justified at setting a lower wage because of the systemic issues at play. That does not excuse them from their sexist behavior and role in perpetuating inequality, even if it wasn't their intention. Someone approves the payroll each month and looks at the salaries and can see this senior woman is getting paid less than a newer male employee (I know because I do this at our organization). This is wrong, please stop excusing it or blaming the people harmed.",pdx_joe,t2_aaigl,3197,0,reddit4

Regarding timing, I would be inclined not to wait until review time, because:

1. The pot is likely fixed when they decide to give a general 5% raise (except for Dave who did that thing). You want them to fix your pay first, not say ""oh well we would but this review period is already set, maybe next year?""
2. If you can get them to ""resolve"" this issue now, I see no reason why you wouldn't also get 5% when everyone else does. This isn't a raise, it's a correction. Imply they might backdate it to make them worry.
3. Probably the most important in the long term: if you wait til then, they will treat you the same as the other people that wait to be handed an incremental raise. You are not they, start signalling that right now.  Passivity does not pay.
4. Raises should be big in early career. This is when your effectiveness is hugely changing year by year. 5% is stagnation.",NiceyChappe,t2_b0q7j,1017,0,reddit4

hiez0i7,t3_qho2k3,2021-10-28 18:52:46,TwoXChromosomes,"I am a woman in engineering (environmental consulting so different area), I’ve been in the industry with my current employer for over 12 years. I did not negotiate when I was hired as a new graduate for a number of reasons (mostly it was an economic crisis! None of my friends had received offers yet!). Within my first year there one of my colleagues (also a woman) requested a salary review with respect to her peers (that included me). Short story, as a result of her request - all of the women (representing 50% of staff with fewer than 10 years of experience) in my office got substantial raises, mine was one of the smaller ones and it a $5k raise which just shy of a 10% increase. There’s a lot of advice on here regarding “just” moving to a new job, but if you’re otherwise happy and the inequitable compensation is the sole issue, it’s less effort to work toward salary increases or negotiations in good faith. Part of that is understanding how compensation is set by the company within and outside of a performance review structure and using that to your benefit. Are there other compensation mechanisms (like bonuses, which are great but don’t increase your base salary so won’t necessarily help with annual increases)? 

When I received that first salary correction and learned it was based on identified gender inequity in compensation. I took some time to understand the various mechanisms the company uses to set salary and what (if any) initiatives there were for inclusion/diversity in hiring and compensation. Since that time, when I suspect I may not being paid market value my first steps are to (1) review my job description [does what I’m doing match the description? If not read the ones up the chain to see where I fit.] And then (2) ask for my employee designation (role/job title) match the work I’m performing per the job description, I’ll bring examples to my supervisor to make the argument [the first time I did this I found I was 2 positions behind and was told they can only make one adjustment at a time so I requested one right before I went on maternity leave which was approved and requested another adjustment 9 months into my 10 months of leave which was also approved]. And then (3) I ask for a review of my salary with respect to my peers. And (4) If there is requisition for a role similar to mine I will look at what the estimated compensation package, if there’s a discrepancy and I feel comfortable, I’ll talk to the hiring manager to learn more. 

I’ve used steps 1-3 three times in my career (in addition to the one that happened because of another employees request). Each time I’ve received a substantial increase (8-10%), in addition to my increases associated with the annual performance review cycle. Initiating the review of compensation relative to peers mid-compensation cycle gives managers more flexibility because they don’t need to draw from the set annual increase pot. In some cases when I’ve asked for this review, it’s results in salary adjustments for some of my colleagues too (there’s no harm in bringing others up with you!). I also negotiated a salary increase while on my second maternity leave using the “what is the compensation package for this job posting” method. While on maternity leave I noticed they’d posted a requisition for a job with my years of experience and discipline area - the hiring manager was having trouble filling the role and reached out to me to find out if I knew anyone who might be interested. During that conversation I asked if they’d compared what they’re offering for that role to my salary, I didn’t say more than that. Other than pointed out that our competitors also had similar jobs posted and that what they’re looking is somewhat difficult to find (I had only graduated with 5 people in that discipline and none of them were interested in moving). That conversation resulted in a 10% salary increase with out my specifically asking for a raise.",Ninwren,t2_15px6c,31,0,reddit4

Comfortable asking, it might be worth asking just to sus out the sexism angle. It very well might be, and if it is I’m sure their HR would advise it to be rectified right away, or so I would hope.

I skipped several steps, basically did a really good job in a really high profile visible way and leap frogged a couple rungs on the ladder, but the result is that my compensation got one single “max bump” whereas his got several.

I was once very angry with my HR team when they kept lowballing people we were trying to hire.  We actually had a lady accept the offer, and then she decided to go elsewhere before her start date.  I then found out they offered something like 70% of what she should have been making, and I was pretty angry with them because she seemed like a perfect fit for what we needed.  It's really important to keep engineers long term, and if you are paying them much less than they can make elsewhere, they'll never stay and that is extremely disruptive to getting anything done.  Even though she would have been working for me, I was not made aware of what they were planning on paying her, or the other people under me until it came to review time, and even then, I had to go digging for it.  HR really did not want those numbers going out, and it was only the VP's or higher who got the numbers more regularly, and they're usually not going to scrutinize those things unless someone makes them aware of it.

hifnm84,t3_qho2k3,2021-10-28 21:38:15,TwoXChromosomes,"As someone who runs a hard tech business, has hired people, and has to regularly negotiate, I'd say negotiate a substantial raise at your annual review (or sooner if that's far away). Now that you have multiple data points (your male colleagues' salaries), you know exactly what you can ask for (ask for more). In the negotiation, focus on the value you bring to the company and be respectfully direct (expressing gratitude and commitment to the company goes a long way to ease any tensions) about what you want. Asking for a substantial raise may startle them, but that would be the point to reveal that you know others with less experience are being paid that much -- therefore the company has already assigned a higher value to the work so that's how you want to be compensated. 

While leaving/quitting might be appropriate in some situations, I think this is more likely an opportunity to negotiate since you love the job and leaving after a year may look problematic on a resume. If you do choose to quit, then try it anyway for the opportunity to play hardball (something I wish I learned earlier!).

Found out teammates that were the same role/titling as me were making more AND were getting their bonuses (despite the fact that NONE of us were hitting the nearly impossible to attain goal benchmarks set for us, that I had been told were either ‘you hit those or you don’t get it’).

I was furious. I also wasn’t good at hiding it - so my manager actually requested a meeting with me before I had formulated my thoughts entirely. I stated the facts first, then that I was extremely unhappy with this and that it needed to be fixed immediately. I let him know that while I didn’t want to assume this was related to my gender, I couldn’t ignore the fact that I was *coincidentally* the only woman on the team and also the only person to not get the bonus - despite being the second highest performer - and that my pay being lowest despite me having more experience than two of them was not acceptable. Mostly I was just so worked up that I didn’t have a filter - but I did keep it professional.

They actually agreed, and I received a backdated raise to my last review (which had included a very modest increase), and a bonus that accounted for those I had been denied despite others getting them. 

I was still frustrated I had to fight for it like this. They understood and there actually ended up being an HR review of salary practices in our department at the department head’s request. 

Caveat here for what made this successful: my manager handled all of this extremely well. He hadn’t actually hired me, he inherited me - and while I knew he wasn’t wholly responsible I was very mad at him for enabling the discrepancy to continue. Once I brought it up he accepted the criticism, acted on it, and pushed for a solution. He bit the bullet and took responsibility and accountability for it, he pushed it up to his manager and the head of the dept, and he assured me he would do everything he could to make this right and keep me (while being very understanding of the fact that I was still going to be rightfully pissed). My promotions and raises after this experience were given to me based on my performance and meeting the qualifications - they were proactively awarded to me without asking for them first based on those things. Bonuses were no longer a negotiation that some people didn’t know were negotiable.",maarrz,t2_ax8nw,3,0,reddit4

You might not think you have an “apples to apples” comparison to show a lawyer, but sometimes even differences in job description mean nothing if you functionally do the same job.

Also, you can speak to a lawyer without retaining a lawyer. Most plaintiff firms will talk to you about your case and tell you if they’ll take it (they won’t take it usually unless they think you have a case). You can at least gather that information, even if you don’t pursue anything.

I was told later exactly how raises were done, that it was part of yearly reviews etc. Percentages. Blah. I think those were done consistently and correctly but I never asked because I thought it was being done as stated... 15 years later I find out a male co-worker with 5+ fewer years of experience and WAY less ""additionals"" is making 25K more than I do. I was the head of my office's Social Club - I organized their annual KumBayAh Corp get together, the Christmas Party, the charities, etc.

I arranged a way to bring in new business to the company to the tune of at least 200K/year and asked for a raise of 30K/year. I was threatened with my Non-Compete and told that ""I shouldn't be trying to dictate to a VP what my raise should be."" I couldn't hold business hostage just because I was concerned with my wage. I corresponded with the VP over email and got this in writing. I went to HR and filed a complaint. I was told that after review ""This VP actually conveys himself much better in person and that he can be brusque over email."" I was also reminded of my non-compete by HR.

My non-compete was then not enforcible in New York state. I will never sign another non-compete. I tell anyone who asks what I make and how I arrived at that number. I go into any contract negotion with a backup plan for if my current situation becomes untenable... because I had to get out of that job fast. And thank god I did...

hif139x,t3_qho2k3,2021-10-28 19:06:37,TwoXChromosomes,"This is going to be a long one. Sorry. ...so there are a couple of unfortunate realities at work here. One is that companies know that women are less aggressive in salary negotiations. There have been all kinds of studies that have come to this conclusion by people in the hiring business, and companies do take advantage.

Second is that companies are not obligated to act ethically. Not by congressional mandate, not by constitution. A company, especially one that's publicly traded, is obligated to act in the best interest of its stakeholders. You are not one of them. As far as any corporation is concerned, you are a resource, and the less they can pay for access to any resource, the better. That's the old school mentality. I like to think things are changing, but... it's a slow process.

Every company will endeavor to minimize costs and maximize profits; so if, during a salary negotiation, a company believes it can get away with paying someone less, they will. Which is the story of where you are today. It's also the root of why talking about money is such a taboo. You're not supposed to talk to co-workers about salary. You're not supposed to ask friends, or industry professionals what's common for salaries in your field; because the last thing any company wants is a prospective hire who knows their own value. What does this mean for you and for employees?

Go into any salary negotiation well armed with information. First and foremost,  
know what's normal; and it sounds like you've done that by talking to your co-workers. You know what's on the level. 

Second, stay cool. What the company has done here IS right for them (albeit potentially short sighted because they could lose a good employee), but it's also exploitative to you, and in your shoes, I wouldn't put up with it. That said, if your managers detect anger, they'll be tempted to dismiss you out of hand. 

Third, remember that a salary negotiation is not something that happens when you get hired, or when you're up for a raise and review, it is an ongoing process. It never stops. Ask for what you're worth. Insist on parity. Get everything in writing. Be polite, but be firm. 

And finally... asking for a raise outside of what company policy allows for is often unlikely to succeed. So my last bit of advice is, throw any notion of loyalty out the window. Companies will treat you like a resource, so treat them the same in kind. The reward a company gets from paying you well is not loyalty, it's hard work. That's the whole exchange, your labour for their money. You are out there to get paid, so if the company you work for isn't providing you with the resources you feel like you deserve, find a company that will. My salary increased from 32k a year to 86k a year, doing the exact same work over the course of three years because I refused to continue working for companies that didn't want to pay what I was worth. Chances are, if the company hired you, then it thinks it can capitalize on your skills - so remember that they value what you're offering them in return.

It's not fair that corporations approach negotiations with women differently than with men, but there are things you can do about it. Don't settle, don't resign yourself to it. Go get paid.",,,3,0,reddit4

Ultimately your situation feels terrible, we all know the pay divide exists but you are in a position where it may be difficult or unclear to prove gender discrimination (as they can always reason away pay differences for other reasons).

Usually the best advice is to start looking for work, as you will always get your biggest gains by moving from company to company. If you have a desire to remain where you are, then you should get an offer in hand before you press your management on the issue of your pay as there are no guarantees on how they will respond.

Did they negotiate during performance reviews?

I would definitely consider that this will be taken as hostile - depending on the attitude you bring. You don't deserve money that you didn't ask for.

Don't take advice in this thread which makes it seem like you are spiteful for not being paid more. It is your responsibility to negotiate what you are worth. Your company does not have your financial interests in mind. But DO argue for what you are worth",broxue,t2_j1dig,1,0,reddit4

higkpkg,t3_qho2k3,2021-10-29 01:51:13,TwoXChromosomes,"One of my direct reports makes $30k more than I do as the mgr. (same gender) Doesn't bother me one bit because, quite simply, this person asked for it and I didn't. Higher pay is one of the big benefits of jumping around every few years these days. If you ask professionally (personally I would not bring up the gender difference at first, only because it has a political feel rather than value/skill-based) and can demonstrate comparable skills (i.e. if you're actually worth it), they'd be foolish not to just make up the difference. Make sure all else is equal, of course. Similar education level and quality, practical experience, and any unique value you bring. If one of my direct reports did so (and they were indeed worth it), I wouldn't hesitate to go to HR and advocate for them if I needed them to remain on my team. Bear in mind there may be corporate policies preventing an immediate fix. e.g. Minimum time spans between hiring, raises, or promotions. Lateral title changes can sometimes also come with different salary ranges if a promotion or raise is off the table so you might want to look into that. If rejected, and if you're certain you're worth it and can afford the risk, and the money is that important to you, I think you should absolutely put out feelers. Frankly I would let your mgr or HR know that you intend to do so. This is a gamble, so make sure you're not bluffing. You must have the talent/skills to leverage, not just a complaint. Free market workforce means if you don't ask for higher pay and don't know any better, they have little incentive to volunteer it. Also, unless you report to the VP, you probably shouldn't talk to that person. No need to jump the chain of command until/unless things sour with your mgr. (politics and chain-jumping are both liabilities to an employer). I don't know what state you're in but there's a fair chance your company has much better lawyers than you can afford, especially if they're in a medical industry. IMO the law really should be your last option. Use your actual skills and value instead. Much more compelling argument if they *want* to retain you vs legal force.

I imagine that if the fellow workers moved from one company to another a pay increase was part of the deal and if they made more then you at the other company to begin with, they are most likely going to make more then you if you made less to begin with then them. They most likely didn't move to a smaller company for less money. Maybe they are looking for people with experience and knowledge of these bigger companies and willing to pay for it. I don't know your education/previous working background/ specialty areas , just as we don't know theirs. At that much of a pay difference I would say it has nothing to do with your sex and feel you are taking the easy way out here. Maybe you are not. But if you are the exact same in every way as someone doing the exact same job and they are getting 20k more it's because they are fucking the boss, hahaha. But joking aside this has been the story of my life, a man, no one has ever given me money. I have always had to ask and fight for it. I don't have a Union to go to bat for me. You have to do it and stand up for yourself and make the case why YOU should get that pay as well. You say you like the job, but do you like it enough for 20k less then what you say is someone doing the exact same thing with all the exact same credentials? Have you tried to get an interview with the ""big companies"" to see what they even offer?  And like it or not you need to negotiate and if you want top dollar, you need to be a top tier negotiator. Life isn't fair and never will be for anyone. The sooner we get over that hurdle the faster you can move on with YOUR life and do whats best for you to make it what you want. So my advice is you either say nothing and be mad because someone makes more then you and be ""happy"" as you can be at your job or you take the bull by the horns and sit down, with all confidence, with your boss and lay it out there. Remember no one is just going to give you their money. Especially if you never say anything. If I was a boss and you never brought it up to me I would think you are happy with your pay. You need to make that change. Real world life is tough and nothing is fair. And you are probably making a decent wage being others are getting 20k more, but 20k more then what? If someone told me I would be making 20k more a year that would be absolutely crazy and life changing. So go after it and get, don't expect it. I wish the best to you, I really do.

hihgv80,t3_qho2k3,2021-10-29 07:06:28,TwoXChromosomes,"Did you take the first offer they gave you?  I've hired a handful of people (9 or so) at different jobs.  Most of these positions have been IT positions and in almost all of the cases  zero women applied so I don't have any experience hiring women.   If I remember correctly the only female resume I ever received was for a woman that barley could speak English and didn't have many of the qualifications we were looking for. She never made it past a phone interview.  


However, I can assure you that the offer would not have been any different based on sex.  

With that said, I would say about 60% of the people we made offers to did not take the first job offer we gave them.   Many asked for things like adjustments to benefits and or more money and in some cases different wording on their job title.   In many cases these negotiations got them many of their requests.  

So like I said, did you just take the first offer like the 40%?   Did your colleague take the first offer? 


Another factor is that depending on the timing, market fluctuations change the salary range offered for a given position.  

Another factor is how desperate they are to fill a position.   Sometimes we have job postings out there for a long time with very few candidates applying.  In those cases we may offer more money to get the positions filled,  be more willing to negotiate salary or hire someone with less schooling or experience than we normally would have.  Also. if most of the positions are filled in a department or if we have a bunch of qualified candidates to choose from then we would be less likely to offer more money or cave in to negotiations.


Think of it as if it was real-estate. If you you have your house on the market for a long time you may keep lowering your price hoping to attract a buyer.  If there are a ton of people bidding on your house you may get more money than your asking price ad they get in a bidding war.    

Supply and demand also play a factor in job positions.


Last point. Many people will look for a job while they still have a job that is stable.   This puts them in a much better position to negotiate salary etc.   People that are unemployed are more likely to take the first offer as they are way more desperate to just get a job and a stable salary and don't want to risk that their negotiations lead to the company going with a different candidate that is willing to do the job for less money.",StockShark59,t2_zk9dd,-1,0,reddit4

However, there is a huge shortage of workers right now and salaries are at near all time high levels so many firms are making great offers to new candidates. Seek out those offers for jobs you like.

You may be tempted to bring one of those offers to your current employer. This sometimes works but more often than not it creates hostility and resentment with management.

Also, don’t worry about how long you’ve been there. It is a pain to replace people primarily good people that are already experiences. Sometimes people need a kick in the butt to do what they should of been doing from day 1",iliveonramen,t2_hzzpu,1,0,reddit4

This could end up getting the peers OP spoke to in trouble. It definitely should not, but it's a common occurrence that when workers share details about the salaries with each other, management punishes both sides. They're not *allowed* to do this, so it will come out in other ways, such as labeling those other folks as being agitators, or not being ""team players,"" etc. Especially since the company is ""rewarding"" them with extra pay and they failed to show sufficient gratitude for this largess by keeping quiet.

u/Upper-Upstairs-6218 My advice to you is to start interviewing. In particular, interview at places you are not necessarily interested in working. The point isn't to take a job, the point is to get offers and push the envelope on pay as far as you possibly can. Don't mention anything about money until you get the initial offer, and when they ask you what you currently make, tell them, but then also tell them that you are aware your male peers make a lot more than you and that's why you're looking because you don't feel valued. Ask if you'll be facing this at their company as well, or if they level their pay scales with an eye toward equity.

Once you get a little practice and have been through a few negotiation cycles, you'll be a lot better equipped to start looking for places you do want to work, and you'll hopefully have a better lay of the land.

Realize that you will likely have to leave your current place to get equitable pay for your work. Unless your current company has a lot of fair-minded, mature adults in management, you're not going to get satisfaction here. And you should be pissed.

The majority of our department directors are women, and they fight hard for their employees and themselves. We give more bonuses and raises to women, and they tend to be asking for them more than men. But to be fair, a major portion of our staff are women, and this field attracts more women than men.

I don't know what happened during the interview and negotiation process, but businesses will often give raises or match offers almost immediately. Not all positions align when it comes to salary. It more often than not will depend on years of experience. Someone hired in a higher position than another with only a few years of experience could very well earn less than the lower position. Easily. We get a lot of pushback, and often just adjust salaries on the fly.

It's not always fair, and things sometimes just happen that way. For us, it's a lot of departments trying to talk to each other and we are just people trying to do our jobs.

As a business owner, if I read your resume after you left this company and you told me you left due to unfair pay, I wouldn’t hire you. Not after that short of time. If you were there for a few years and people of the same exact caliber were getting more than you, that’s different.

Honestly, I wish other people would stand up and do what's right, not leave it to those being screwed to put themselves out there exclusively.

And I've put money where my mouth is multiple times. I have called out management for making offers to women lower than they were willing to make to men. I've told them I'd only take part in the offer by way of telling the candidate exactly what they've done. 

I've also had women come onto my team, prove themselves, and get a pittance raise as a result. Had a conversation with my manager, made it clear 'my hands are tied' is bullshit, and let them know they could fix the problem or I'd go over their head, hopefully at least with their support. And done so. And won.

Because if you actually stand up in the face of this bullshit on behalf of someone else, it's hard for management to justify the utter bullshit they're shoveling. 'Are you saying she is not worth as much as he is?' Not a question they want to answer. The only reason this shit occurs in the first place is _because_ they never have to directly answer those questions.

I have a policy in my team. I'm a team lead. We all know everyone's compensation. And we all bat for everyone else on the team. Result is ALWAYS that we all do better, in the short AND long term. 

And I've had GM's question me directly. 'Why do you know this?'. 'Why are you batting for so and so?'. 

Because it's the right thing. We're a team. We work best as a team. We all deserve to be compensated fairly as a team. We do NOT deserve to be pitted against each other in the dark in this area. Do you have a problem with what we're producing? No? Then it's working isn't it. Let's keep it that way.

Can we do anything about my compensation here so I can stay?” Which still gives them the option to make it right and bump her pay and allow her to stay and shows she’d rather not leave.

hifrbd3,t1_hiezszp,2021-10-28 22:05:05,TwoXChromosomes,">“Hey OP, Please don’t get the men in trouble…just look for a different job”

The point of looking around is to determine her worth in the current market, and get practice negotiating. This is advice I give to *everyone*, not just women, because it works. But the upside is particularly dramatic for a situation like this.

She doesn't need to get a different job, either. But if she goes to management complaining and crying sexism they're going to carefully explain that she's not getting paid less for being a woman, but rather *because of the work she does*. She is leaving them NO OTHER OPTION. They have to denigrate her work to protect themselves from a discrimination suit, and start building the strongest case possible that what they're saying is true even if it's not.

On the other hand, if OP has other offers, she can go to management and say, look, I'm worth more. And I know my peers here make more than me, and I want to be paid equitably. (And with actual offers she can, if they don't respond, actually walk.)

The point of this isn't to say ""don't get the men in trouble,"" the point is to say, ""Don't make empty threats.""

I also work in software and started a new job during the pandemic. I was really low balled on the initial offer, it was 10k less than the final offer and I negotiated the first one. Another company had an offer for 10k more and the one I ended up working for matched it. I also want to add that I've negotiated more for every job I've ever had, even for the 15 years I worked in kitchens before. I have no idea what my counterparts make, but I know we're not getting a lot of budget to hire and we've done pretty well during the pandemic. My new coworkers are all contract to hire and I'm kind of lucky to have been brought on full time. Just keep in mind the climate that you started, and the tenure of the people you are comparing yourself to. 


That being said... At other companies I worked at pre pandemic hiring for the same job was almost always more than people with the existing titles because raises at the company didn't actually keep up with competitive market wages which is pretty common I think. Just be cautious but there are two sides to the coin. Either way devs are going to be needed everywhere so if you don't feel like you are getting what you are worth regardless of what they are making go out and test the waters again.

She and I could interview for the the same job, have the exact same background, and be otherwise identical to the employee save for our sex, but because I'm male, my ""negotiation"" works better in my favor. Maybe I was in the same frat as the hiring manager and we bonded over that. There's no amount of ""negotiation"" currently in the world that would give a female candidate that lever to apply.

Given that negotiation depends on a wide variety of subjective and potentially discriminatory cues (even those acting on this may be purely unintentional), we cannot simply say ""you didn't do a good job negotiating"".

In the ideal world, in order to blame negotiation for a pay disparity, it would mean that she got something else of value which the male colleague with higher pay did not get. For example, she gets an additional week of paid vacation versus an extra $10k or something like that.

That said, the path forward at least is straightforward. Assuming she can detail the value she provides to the company relative to her male counterparts, now that the pay information is out in the open, at the very least she should be brought to parity. Failing to do so would be defacto admission of discrimination. 

Some good news, it's slow starting but states are starting to address the issue that everyone has bias, often unconscious and there's no amount of ""negotiation"" practice or bias training that will completely remove it. Colorado last year passed a law essentially saying that companies need to establish and document metrics for pay. So for any two people being hired for a position, if you score identically on metrics for a given position, your compensation should be virtually identical.

If a company is losing candidates because they're not offering enough for the position, then they'll need to increase the pay for the position if they think that's the reason they're not getting people. ""Negotiation"" is not the solution to a company thinking their offer is market rate or candidates or not qualified for their higher income tiers.

I'm guessing you wouldn't find anything wrong with paying $20k even though the employees are paid on commission and by paying less you're thereby effectively docking their pay.

Maybe it's sociopathic, but a company is not a human being. Any firm is going to try to close the deal at the lowest price that will keep both parties happy. Your options are to either undo the entire capitalistic structure of society or just understand the nature of the game and play to win. I'm sympathetic to wanting to do the former, but in the short-term, I do recommend the latter.

Beyond that, I would contest the idea that it's actually sociopathic. Not needlessly paying staff much more than necessary means the firm itself is likely much more financially stable, which means growth is more likely, layoffs are much less likely, etc. If the firm is not financially healthy, then every employee's job is at risk.

I personally had an experience where I was told that I was offered the maximum starting salary (well, hourly) at a job, only to find out that a male colleague was started at more money than I was despite the fact that I had more qualifications and experience.

hig3yw8,t1_hig1tem,2021-10-28 23:42:09,TwoXChromosomes,"Salary schedules are totally untenable in any competitive environment. Companies with strict salary schedules tend to be unable to attract top talent. That’s a recipe for being a dinosaur legacy company that’s left in the dust.

The problem with salary schedules in competitive markets is they are extremely restrictive and slow to adapt. Having to reconfigure an entire organization’s compensation in order to close a single new hire that doesn’t fit into it is a recipe for an extremely slow-moving company that won’t be able to compete.

Keep in mind I’m in the tech industry where there’s immense competition for talent. It would be a death sentence for my company to adopt a strict salary schedule like school districts have. The schedule would be outdated within 12 months and we’d have to give fixed raises to everyone regardless of performance, which means top performers would end up underpaid and leave quickly.

The other issue with salary schedules is they are profoundly non-meritocratic. Everything is based on years of experience or age, not talent, effectiveness, ambition, or output. Imagine having to lose your top talent because they’re too young to move up your salary schedule but someone else will pay them more than you today. You will rapidly be stuck with a team of only your remaining low performers. There’s a reason you only see this in school districts or ancient boomer companies that are dying off.",,,0,0,reddit4

I went out to a farewell happy hour with about 20 colleagues to send off the VP of the company. It's a male dominated company, but still, about half the crowd was female. And the happy hour was during daylight hours, at a busy well-lit restaurant, not a dark bar. It didn't seem like a seedy situation.

Well. 

I only stayed an hour, but by the time I left, the *Director of Ops* had cornered me against the bar with both arms and pressed his body against mine. The *outgoing VP* grabbed me and forcibly kissed me (and when I froze and didn't reciprocate, he abruptly turned around and pretended like it never happened). And *the head of my department* sent me a string of drunk text messages inviting me to meet him in a secluded room back at the office.

I thought about filing a sexual harrassment claim--but like you, I was so far down the food chain that I kept my mouth shut. Plus, I knew my experience would be met with skepticism since I was indicting SO MANY men--not just one sleezeball, but three of the top six people in my company. I feared that no one would believe me.

A year later, I decided to leave the company and explored filing a claim...but turns out, the Virginia EEOC has a 300 day limitation on filing sexual harrassment claims. When I read that I actually clicked up a calendar and started counting days...I was less than 20 days too late. That was a fucking bitter pill to swallow.

Anyway, just know that you aren't alone. These men organize 'company outings' to alcoholic venues specifically so they can target women like you and me. They know what they're doing. They know their fellow mangers do it too. And they all tacitly work together to create a workplace culture where they can get away with it.

*I later found out that all of these men were serial chavs: my boss had at least 4 prior sexual harrassment claims against him, but he was only reprimanded for one of them. The outgoing VP had made a pass at every intern in the company. And the Ops Director had recently remarried his wife--they initially divorced because of his infidelity.

I'd recommend going to the police and filing a report. They won't do anything about it, because it's a he said she said scenario, but there will be a signed report with a statement with a date and with signatures. 

Tell them your situation and your fears of being fired with the trouble of finding a replacement job (from your other responses in this post). They'll be able to guide you and give advice. Even if they just take a statement without an investigation, police signatures with dates will help.

Then go to HR.

If HR does nothing and you get fired shortly after, you will have a police report to fall back on. For a judge to rule on a wrongful dismissal case, having a police report helps.

dj10sn0,t3_6hrd3b,2017-06-17 14:46:20,TwoXChromosomes,"Sorry to hear this happened.

My perspective is that these men won't be held to account professionally, but not because of embedded misogyny, power-systems, etc.

I'm really not sure how something like this would play out if the event wasn't work-sponsored; it seems unlikely your employer is responsible investigating or obligated to answer for or correct these men's personal choices during non-work hours. People can be assholes and beyond, but if it's not happening at work or directly related to explicit representation of the employer in public it's not the company's business, really.

What is it about the nature of the evening's event that makes you feel this is something your employer can help you resolve? I'm in Canada, so maybe UK culture/laws are different in this regard. I don't do a lot of work events, but I don't image a club being a work event venue. Honestly, if this doesn't pass any tests to be considered a work event it's unreasonable to think this is something to bring to HR.

It's understandable that you want to pursue this and I agree the behavior of these men is inexcusable. However; given this didn't happen on work time, at a work-sponsored event, and can't be corroborated by others, it's likely you don't have any basis to use work as an avenue for punishment.

I'm not looking to put your intention down, I just wanted to share a perspective. There are uphill battles and there are futile endeavors. Your current orientation to the situation most likely will result in the latter.

Hoping for the best for you!",,,1,0,reddit1

I was in a similar situation earlier this year, however, one of my co-workers (male, higher up) was there and witnessed it. He told me no matter what my decision he would support me. He did also warn me ""if you go to HR remember they are trying to protect the company, not you..."". So bear that in mind if you do report they will likely try to probe your story and find fault in you ""were you drinking? Who else was with you? Why are there no other witnesses?"" All the usual bs.

For my situation, I like my job and I like my boss aside from this very inappropriate event. We sat down and talked (with coworker there), he apologized many times and admitted fault, I took some time off to decide what I wanted to do, and in the end made the decision for my situation to forgive and move on (we're all human, afterall). I also got a written apology. However, I get that feeling that for your situation you will not get resolution  (admission of fault, apologies) from these men. I know 100% I would not have taken the route I did without that, because it is essentially giving you your power back.

I did find that making a pros and cons list really helped me as well and gave me a channel to remove the emotions from my situation. Depending where you are in your career, perhaps this is the nudge you need to branch out into something new.

Something that is slowly changing here in the US, much for the better, is when people refuse to accommodate shitty behavior from higher-ups. Employers know that (a) social media will destroy them if they protect abusers and molesters and (b) awful people will drag down the company, from the inside, through their actions and decisions. 

If you know these men will be protected, even if you have proof, you should leave and find a company which values you as a person.

>Why you didn't leave after the first assault, i cant figure that one out either. 

Again, read my post. After the first assault the guy was very quickly kicked out. The last thing I expected was for a second guy to assault me out of the blue. 

>I'm lying actually. I do have a clue. You're a coward. I know, the truth hurts. People hate being told things they don't want to hear. Sorry, I'm not here to fucking coddle you.

You're strangely aggressive about this. I apologise for offending you by not handling it the exact way you would have liked me to. 

>If a guy put his hand on my ass i would A- knee him in the fucking balls B- punch him in the fucking throat C- headbutt him in the fucking teeth D- all of the fucking above

Cool. If you had asked me 24 hrs ago what I would do I would have said the same thing. It's a bit different in the moment. 

>Because you and yours acted cowardly, those fucks got away scott free, and no doubt have sexually assaulted other woman as a result, and will continue to do so until someone says ""I don't care about the consequences, this fuck has to go!""

I stood up for myself I just wasn't violent about it, and I came here for advice about what to do. Its been less than 24 hrs, I doubt theyve sexually harrassed that many women in broad daylight since last night.

>You better call the fucking police.

I dont take orders from you. I will weigh my options and decide for myself thanks.

>You're a coward. I know, the truth hurts. People hate being told things they don't want to hear. Sorry, I'm not here to fucking coddle you.

No one asked you to coddle, though if you could take a deep breath and stick your judgemental opinions up your ass, that would be great. Thanks. ",_puddles_,t2_fhgq6,4,0,reddit1
dj1c0m2,t1_dj16ksq,2017-06-17 19:05:18,TwoXChromosomes,"Wow that is an incredibly terrible thing to say to someone who has been sexually harassed. It is extremely obvious why she did not go to the police. Unfortunately not all women have the ability to do so based on certain societal issues that have power over them. Like the threat of her and/or her SO losing their jobs. And she has said that she is usually assertive, and did stand up for herself. So no, she didn't just *let it happen*. It was the men who forced this upon her. But saying you would be a kind of person, and then actually experiencing the situation are very different things. She was frightened, and that isn't something to shame her for.

It is absolutely not her fault that these men forced her into this sort of predicament at all. And they did so, assuming because of their status that she would be too afraid to do something about it. They are the evil ones. They are corrupted. And you would blame her for their actions? Shame on you. ",Ribbons1223,t2_15x2id,5,0,reddit1

I'm not sure what will happen, but you should go in knowing that for all the women that have stood up to defend other women, there are at least as many women who have protected the men who hurt/harass/etc. women for a slew of reasons - in offices, in families, in government, etc. - this is a reoccurring theme.",,,174,0,reddit1

I did get some closure though--I wrote a review on Glassdoor.com advising other women. In my review I included 
● A list of men to avoid
● Warned them about the 300 day limitation
● Warned them to get their HR complaint in writing (3 of the my boss's previous accusers *thought* their complaints were registered with HR--but HR hadn't filed the complaints, because the victims 'did not request to lodge a formal complaint'. But of course, HR didn't *tell* them to lodge a formal complaint, or that there was any difference between a 'regular' complaint and a 'formal' complaint).

Agreed. I don't blame people that freeze or can't speak in these situations; you can't always choose how your body will react.

How has your partner reacted to this? I ask because you are worried about the effects this may have for your employment. Is it possible HR can be avoided?

In the context of his familiarity with the managers, is it possible he could have conversations with them? This I think - all persons considered otherwise reasonable - could be a productive strategy. If you're looking to have them punished, I get why this may seem a waste. However, if you're looking to be effective at mitigating the broader effects of men like this I feel it's worth trying to engage them directly. If your partner was able to speak to them as a matter of a ""professional courtesy"" and also as personally invested as your partner, it seems this could be more efficient than having to make a case to your employer regarding their role in your (effectively) personal matter. This isn't about gender or acceding to misogyny culture. It seems potentially effective. And personally, if I was your partner in this situation, there's a 100% certainty that regardless of all other factors I would be having very terse conversations with these 2 assholes about their actions as just plain sleazy humans.

I said, “But you have heard her say directly, in an official complaint, that she is not hitting on him and does not appreciate that he is making sexual advances towards her?”

Boss said, “Yes, but sometimes she seems flirty towards him, and does wear a lot of tight fitting clothes. You can just tell.”

I've had people refusing to even give estimates unless they talk to my husband too, or even come to look at the work I need done. 

One incident in particular was very disturbing. I asked a pretty large company to come give us an estimate on siding. When the sales guy arrived, he wouldn't talk to me without my husband present. I said, well he's busy, but this guy was adamant. So I got my husband out of his shop by loudly calling out ""this guy won't talk to a woman, you have to be in the room."" I guess that set the tone, but I was super annoyed. My husband was pissed to be interrupted for something so stupid, so he sat stoic with his arms crossed and just glared at the man, who tried so hard to get him to answer questions instead of me. At one point he looked at my husband and said ""can we talk, man to man?"" When my husband just pointed at me, he got so mad. But he went on with his dumb pitch. I realized it's something they have scripted, and I wasn't going to hire them, so I stopped asking questions and let him rattle on until he was finished. When he finally wrapped up, he looked at my husband and asked ""so can we get your signature today?"", and again hubs just pointed to me with an expression of ""don't ask again.""

My hubs is a big guy, very bearish  (big beard, big shoulders, looks kinda mean, but literally the best person in the world) and I think he intimidated this guy. 

When I smiled and said ""I think I will pass and I'm going to look into another company for my project"" he literally ran out of my garage. It was satisfying ... but so annoying.

And while we were sitting down talking numbers my husband constantly had to redirect them to me because it was MY car.  MY loan.  If I had questions, I would ask my husband. 

And as silly as this sounds...in the early 2000's until about 2015....if we went out to a steakhouse and I happened to be the one ordering my steak...it would always come back overcooked.  I would always order a medium rare, and the servers ALWAYS looked like I didn't know what I was talking about. If my husband ordered for me, it was always right.  I guess when I got into my mid to late 30's people were like yeah she's probably knows what she wants at this point but Jesus.

In practice, I’ve never addressed a woman as sir nor have I seen anyone do so. It’s always either Ma’am or their rank. Most women I’ve met in the Navy don’t like being called ma’am since it makes them feel old. My current Officer in Charge is a woman and we usually call her LT(pronounced “ell tee”). She’s a Lieutenant, so we just use her rank.

Once you get higher ranking than O-3, you usually have a job title of some importance. So man or woman, if you’re the Engineering Officer, you’re usually just called “ENG”. Weapons Officer is “WEPS”, Navigation Officer is “NAV”. I’ve only ever seen women get called “sir” on TV.

They typically have a high advertising budget like the company you’re talking about and they usually have very high prices.  Sometimes double other places.  Most also have high pressure sales and you basically have to throw them out of your house.  They’re worse than time shares.  They start at some absurd price like 10x what you expect and start scratching lines through numbers and lowering the price TODAY ONLY UNTIL I WALK OUT THE DOOR.  They’re lies and the sales guy is getting something like half the money.  Check Yelp reviews and contact small local companies.

Edit: wow thank you for all the upvotes and the silver!  We recently had some home renovations done (including a bathroom) and you really get the feel for a lot of these sales tactics quickly.

At this moment, I believe it’s dirty sales punch to make bigger service sale.
Here is my opposite story me (M) and my wife (F) did big home renovation several years ago. I was responsible mainly for structural and engineering things, while my wife focused on cosmetic details (floor color, walls color, new furniture,etc).
Whet it was time to order new windows, she take me “ take something good and it should have white frames”.
I called several contractors for estimates. All of them scheduled “in house measurements and estimate” appointment. 
4 of 5 called day prior and asked who owner and stated that “All Listed owners should present at measuring appointment for obtain estimates”. Of course I canceled 4 out of 5.
My wife explicitly said “She has 0 interest to speak with any window sales”.
Only one person was ok to make measurements and bid without all listed owners.
When we had casual chat I asked about my experience with other companies and why he didn’t ask for all home owners.
He told that it’s “high sale strategy”. If two persons in room, sale person will pick one who more responsible and will push hard.
In case of F, they will push more to add more “nice cosmetic things”
In case M, they will push on add more services that not visible by eye and often not needed, or even push in more expensive models.

 It is a lot easier to make a contractor’s lien stick in court when all owners sign off on the work.  It might have to do with how your state views property with married couples.  I think they might be covering their asses in the case of placing a lien and that’s why they asked specifically what is on the deed. IANAL just a dentist but I’ve seen contractors require all owners present before starting a job and one contractor told me it was for this reason.

hdo23wj,t1_hdnv8rq,2021-09-21 01:53:14,TwoXChromosomes,"I have an aunt who has a STEM degree and she is older than you by about a decade. Grew up in a conservative Italian family with 3 other sisters, but my grandpa & grandma were all about strong women.

Same thing happened to her when they were selling the house. My uncle wasn't involved in the process (he has no desire to deal with shit like that as it isn't his forte,) and some agent tried to pull that shit with her... she went out of her way to make the appointment with my uncle home, and then in person told the agent they weren't going to go with them, and why. Agent was dumbfounded and looked at my uncle like, ""what the fuck?""

Uncle just looked at him like he was an idiot, laughed at him, and just said something like, ""What do you want me to do? Didn't you hear what she said? You should leave now.""

Weird thing about that particular aunt is that while she is all about classic old school feminism... she is also thee stereotypical representation of a 1950s wife. She'll 'defer' to my uncle a lot, and instead of working in her field (she was one of the first female computer programmers in the country) she chose to be a homemaker. She has spent her life raising children, cleaning the house, making sure dinner was ready for my uncle when he got home... but it was always with this irreverence. Like if dinner burned she'd make a comment like, ""Well, I guess your uncle is just going to have to eat pizza tonight,"" and laugh about it. 

They have a very ""Christian"" marriage and are both heavily involved with their church. She will absolutely talk about how the husband is the head of the house, and wives are 'helpers' but simultaneously how they are equal using some weird twisted Christian logic.

It's a very weird fucking relationship, but it works for them, and according to my uncle he never gets tired of other men acting like this when they talk to my aunt. Like he seems to look forward to how it shakes out and getting the last laugh.

They live in the deep south for some added context but are both transplants from larger northern cities, and both have advanced STEM degrees. He was a VP for a very large tech company in the 90s and they did very well.

edit: For some additional context, because rereading this I think I might have misrepresented my uncle. He's probably the greatest husband ever. He is constantly posting things on FB about how much he loves my aunt, how proud he is of her, celebrations of weird minor anniversaries, and even some sort of semi-suggestive sexual remarks which are enough to make things uncomfortable. He is fucking into his wife. He's also the type of person that builds things in his workshop, electronics, wires, etc. He is a very accomplished man, but certain things just for whatever reason are not something he seems to have any inclination to deal with, or maybe my aunt would just rather deal with them. I'm not sure. I'm going to ask them about that. But like with something like selling the house, and buying a new one... he's just ride or die. He just wants to know what he needs to do, where he needs to be, and when he needs to be there. If my aunt somehow fucks up (she's a genius) and loses a ten or twenty grand on the deal... not part of his thought process. She's handling it, and that's it. Most likely she is going to save or make a lot of money given her track record. Now if it came down to something egregious I'm sure he'd be willing to listen to someone who insisted on talking to, ""her husband,"" first, but I mean this only matters of the utmost importance where she might be trying to send half their assets to a Nigerian prince. I think that's why he likes when she schedules meetings so she can kind of be like, ""Uhhh, honey did you want to talk to this idiot, or was I right to decide we're going with someone else?""

I think they both kind of get off on it together.",stiffupperleg,t2_4gu28,132,0,reddit4

When I said I preferred to wait to talk to my partner, who had some experience and could tell me if I was being high-balled (I was), the man passive-aggressively called his manager, put the guy on speaker phone, and both he and his manager tried to shame me into submission by making claims that I hadn't mentioned a partner in the initial phone call.

hdpgxog,t1_hdo6h9i,2021-09-21 11:50:47,TwoXChromosomes,"Sometimes its not ""playing hardball"". Am female and am the one almost always handling any work with any contractors for our house. My husband, God bless him, is very smart in many ways but he knows absolutely nothing about anything along these lines and he really doesn't care about details. He doesn't know the general ballpark of what things might or should cost, and he knows he doesn't have the knowledge for maintenance or whatnot so he is an easy damn mark for expensive and unneeded upselling. 

This is why I handle these things. 

I get a minimum of three quotes for any non-emergent work that needs done. But between the sales/measuring/etc dudes that come out flat out not listening to me as to what I want (""you actually want this and that"" no, I want what I told you I want), and yeah, often I get the quote and what I'm thinking is ""thats massively overpriced for what you're doing""... but nah. I'm not playing hardball. I'm ""I want you to get out of my house because you've been being a massive shitheel for the past 20 minutes mansplaining everything and then dropping a twice the going rate quote, then pressuring me to sign right now"". 

I've tried being honest and saying ""I am getting multiple quotes"" or whatnot. I have tried being forthright about my husband not knowing tile from vinyl or bluntly a wrench from a socket. Honesty doesn't work, but ""sorry. I need to discuss this with my husband, let me call you in a couple of days"" does with the guys I just want out of my house and I'm concerned are going to get aggressive. If I feel like I have to dissemble to a contractor, there is a reason.

I get you don't like ""tire kickers"" or whatever. But I don't like contractors that seem to not grasp that people should be allowed to step back and get time (without harassing texts, calls, or emails) to think about expensive projects and having someone they are comfortable with handling that project.

If I'm ever using the ""I need to talk to my husband, we will be in touch"" line, its because the contractor has set off a ton of red flags, and no, I'm not going with them.

jgs8znt,t3_12qmcj0,2023-04-18 19:29:12,TwoXChromosomes,"This happened to me. I worked at an IT staffing agency in Colorado a few years ago and a women in our office found a camera taped to a toilet in the women’s restroom sometime within the first month or so of my employment. It was my first job out of college and I had just relocated from the Midwest. I didn’t have a strong support system and it was terrifying. I felt disgusted. 

A manager in our office explained what they had discovered, said it had been reported to the police, and gave us the rest of the day off. My direct superior encouraged our team to go out to the bar for a team celebration of sorts. In hindsight, it was inappropriate and felt weird. 

I expressed concern to my supervisor and spoke to someone over the phone who I think was a corporate attorney. The company provided the women access to a different bathroom to use, made everyone in the office use keycards to get into the office, and dismissed the contractors who were renovating our office. A short time later, they loosened security and arranged for someone to come in to discuss “self awareness” with the women of the office. *big big eye roll* ugh!

Not long after, I was fired from my entry role at the company despite being told I would likely be promoted soon just a week prior. They said It wasn’t a good fit and told me to leave and that that would get my belongings to me at a later time.

jgv1ix6,t3_12qmcj0,2023-04-19 10:06:47,TwoXChromosomes,"In Korea and Japan if i remember right, it is a huge problem, hidden cameras are everywhere. They have tools to detect hidden cameras nowadays too, you can search youtube and amazon sells that stuff. 

I often think of it due the layout of my work bathrooms, but i try not to care, because otherwise i get paranoid about everything(i had bad paranoia years ago). 
It is somewhat tolerable to think of it happening to me, but would be totally mortifying and horrible to see an actual footage and have a proof of suspicion/paranoia. 

What makes me more upset is how little punishment anyone gets for anything related sexual exploitation. 

Because im paranoid, public restrooms is just a tip of an iceberg. Any rented space, any space after specialist’s(plumber etc) or even friends visit should be double checked. Because you never truly know who is in your circle, you only prefer to trust. 

So i prefer to be an open book in a way, otherwise i feel nowhere safe at all, including my home. Who knows, a landlord may enter the place when i am not here or a neighbour from next window can use a telescope to spy on me. Anxiety and rich imagination are writing worst case scenarios for me so easily, i don’t even have to consciously think of it. 

I refuse to let the fear control my daily life. I choose to not care, though deep down of course i do care.

What I do know is temperature. Electronics can give off a temperature reading that will be different from the surrounding tiles.

An easier method maybe just get a thermal camera. But that is expensive too. Maybe OP's local PD has one they can use and test with?

edit:

Yeah it might work. They use thermal cameras to detect hidden motors for the Tour DE France.

You can do this exercise when the thoughts or body sensations are spinning out of control and it will calm them down by calming the amygdala. 

You should also look for a therapist that specializes in trauma therapy, and if you can find one that does EMDR, they do an exercise that will make your brain reprogram thoughts and feelings attached to the offending memory.

>and the one on the door was black and the hole is basically invisible in real life. i only noticed the hole when i picked it up after it fell off the door and saw there was a usb port and an sd card on the back.

What you went through was horrible. And then you watched the footage to help others, even though it would have been gut wrenching to see. You are SO incredibly strong for doing that.

It's probably because the police and courts make reporting such a traumatic process for the victims. That's what most survivors say. And because police generally don't give a single shit about sex crimes, they usually spend their energy interrogating and doubting/blaming the victims, and never follow up with the rapist/abuser on any of it.

Mom needs maternity leave for physical recovery from giving birth. Leave is not just for caring for the newborn, it is so that you can medically recover from giving birth. People who do not give birth don't require medical recovery. 

Dad (or other parent) needs parental leave to help w/ care of newborn and mom in early days. 

At least one parent of a newborn needs to be home for the first several months (at minimum, and more is ideal). This often overlaps with maternity leave. Either parent should be entitled to this, regardless if they gave birth or not (e.g. adoptive parents, so forth).",FionaTheFierce,t2_5bnro7w2,20,0,reddit2

We even have tons of open positions and are a bit understaffed at present. Still able to let anyone take leave at will

*When all factors are taken into consideration, the California Employment Development Department calculates the average cost for six weeks paid parental leave to be around $6,400. This may seem like a steep price for small businesses to pay, but in most cases this is better than trying to replace workers looking to put family first.*

Lol it takes way more than $6k to onboard a new employee at any level of my company and at any company I’ve ever worked. Probably more to the tune of 3-6 months of pay +30% overheads, so $20,000-40,000. 

Your current company doesn’t seem to think it has to weigh retention costs vs new hire costs, which makes no sense financially. I wonder what else theyre horribly mismanaging...

2. If men take time off to care for children, it directly benefits the kid's mother (and the kid!)

3. If men take time off to care for children, it makes it much less likely for women to ""fall behind"" professionally or face discrimination for doing the same thing. *Everyone* does it, not just the women.

[A recent study revealed that roughly 40% of U.S. companies offer paid parental leave for both parents.](https://talentculture.com/60-of-u-s-companies-still-do-not-offer-paid-paternity-leave/#:~:text=A%20recent%20study%20revealed%20that,lower%20numbers%20in%20the%20past.)

I expect this percentage to increase, in large part due to the difficulty in US employers attracting employees. The US workforce has recently quit jobs by historic numbers. This shrinking workforce over burdens the remaining workforce which itself produces even more employees walking off the job. Employers that don't treat their employees well, are not likely to see those employees come back. Things like paid parental leave are thus things I expect to suddenly become much more commonplace in the US in the near future.

There needs to be a federal mandate on at least a bare minimum of Parental Leave. In my opinion this shouldn't be shorter than 4 months. We can pay for it with our taxes (like in Washington State) so that everyone is able to get the time off needed to learn to be a parent and bond with the new child.

TL;DR - join the Union, talk to the officers about getting leave added to contract. Do yourself a favor and go to a meeting to find who majority tend to go with and convince that guy. - END

Depending on which licenses is filed with the FLRA depends on the regulations the Union follows. Depending on the bylaws some of what I say might need to be changed or is incorrect.
Join the Union if your job code/position allows it. If not, talk to an officer about how the process to do that gets started. Talk to people in the Union about getting Parental leave. Point out that it covers all bargaining units and prevents management from being too literal, example legal guardian does not mean you are parental, just a guardian. Work to get this leave into the bargaining agreement first and foremost since it is currently in everyone's minds.
Once that is approved you can start asking about maternal leave. The reason this is second is that they can point to the fact that there is already leave used for parental and the company can pay that. It also gives another Union a chance to try and get that with another utility company. Unions do talk to each other.
If you do not get the responses you want run for office. If you have been doing the above, make sure you are a member the necessary amount of time to be eligible to run, and talking to all the people who help move the majority you will have a good chance.

hh7akgd,t3_qanfvo,2021-10-19 05:52:39,TwoXChromosomes,"Here is the strategy for change: 
Step 1.
lots of scholarly research at universities on need of infants for parents to be involved at birth to grow into healthy adults, complete with economic studies of how this plays out lifelong re criminality, earning power, education, health.
step 2
Talk show/media/print/YouTube circus--and the bigger the rings and the bigger the fireworks the better--it has to grow into a national issue across all industries, for everyone, Of course the preachers will preach and the priests will priest and everyone will claim they, and only they, themselves, they know how the Big!1 Creator Being wants things done
step 3 
politicians get into it because their campaign funders see profit potential--temp hires, involved dads want different things for their kids, different accounting structures and oh the court cases--they are inevitable so the lawyers are excited and the finance people will sese the extra time as time to reach the new parents for the all important insurance, house, retirement plans and purchases they now must make
step4
Comedy will enter and maybe books, a movie or three and even the superheroes are likely to get drawn in
stage 5--some governor or president will sign an executive order and Congress will get bypassed but the moms and dads will get to enjoy their newborns
step6
Congress gets aggravated, indignant and insulted, the orders get challenged, the Supreme Court decides not to decide
Step 7
gridlock and the executive orders become the defacto law

Sorry this is long but ""morally right"" on its own has no chance in this reality. However if someone can get those studies funded, at scale, then the parade is launched and change will happen--in some lifetime in some universe eventually.

Or a couple of or a few or several billionaires might decide it is the right thing to do, coordinate all of this at Davos or on the latest greatest thing that moves event or yacht and it will happen in less than a year but no one will quite understand how--so then the books, stories and rewrites of history get started and don't you know this is only the long result of decades of struggle and suffering by...choose a new hero. This is really how just about everything happens now. The one consistent--stories and words, at scale. 

Now, reddit, can we make it happen? WE sur have the stories and we all know how to write words. Might this actually be important enough to be worth our attention? Everyone here was an infant once (shhh--I know, some still are just taller), everyone had parents or caretakers, good or bad and many are parents and grandparents so this really does touch absolutely everyone here.

Your company sucks for using the appalling business practices of their field of not offering maternity leave to justify not having paternity leave. If everyone joins forces in asking for PARENTAL leave, regardless of gender, you might have a shot. Not to mention, it could even be beneficial for the company. If the standard for this field is to offer no parental leave, your company deciding to offer it would put them ahead of the curve, which would make them more appealing to new potential employees, as well as help with employee retention. 

What’s happening at your company with your male coworkers is something we need more of. Often complaints aren’t taken seriously if only one sub-group is asking for improvement, especially if that sub-group is “women”, and even more so in male-dominated fields.

One of the great parts about longer term leaves in the rest of the developped world is that the person on leave will be replaced for the duration of that leave. I’m in Canada and it’s extremely common to see jobs advertised as 1 yr contracts covering a maternity leave, or 6 months etc. I’ve never minded having a coworker go on mat leave (and I’m in a female dominated field so it happens fairly regularly!) because they are replaced and there isn’t a staffing issue, but if I was supposed to just have a vacant coworker every other week for 6 months while expecting to play catch up with their work while they’re away.. I’d be pretty annoyed. 

When someone is only gone for 12 weeks, the incentive to replace them for such a short time isn’t as strong so it doesn’t really happen. The cost of hiring and training someone can take a ton of time, for a short 12 weeks it may not be worth it. But if the person is gonna be working there for a whole year, it’s more justifiable.

that discusses a little bit about the tender years doctrine, which was mostly replaced with best interests of the child principle, and also the primary caretaker doctrine. While on the surface this sounds like a fair decision, we also have issues with the patriarchy that push men to be breadwinners and women to be stereotypical caregivers. Because courts see, well the women do the caretaking tasks, they are seen as the better parent to award custody and tend to win a large number of cases.

It does discuss that more men are winning custody cases over time, which probably has a little to do with the shift in women's and men's role in the household. This is definitely an older source from 1998. While they cite 10% of men win cases, it is now higher at a bit below 20%.",,,3,0,reddit2

Time should be given to all involved to ensure proper time for physical recovery, emotional recovery, bonding, and securing support. Within a marriage or relationship, a new baby also adds new dynamics that requires rebalancing. Time is needed to find this new balance for both partners.

My wife and I were lucky enough to take our parental leave sequentially. She took the first 4 months and I took the next 4 months off. Our son was 8 months when we returned to work full time. This was barely enough time as our son just started sleeping through the night and he was durable enough to trust a daycare (we dont have any family support).",codemise,t2_3cr8yvta,16,0,reddit2

hh519dg,t1_hh4x987,2021-10-18 18:38:45,TwoXChromosomes,"In Canada there’s all of these; maternity leave (18 weeks maximum for mom only), paternity leave (3 weeks max for dad only) and both of these get taken out of the total parental leave of 32 weeks compensated at 70% of your regular paycheck. You can stretch it longer, but the compensation drops after the 32 weeks are used up. 

So that means… if you have a cesarean and need to be both at home then you can do that but that will use your total of 32 weeks faster. But you can break it down almost however you want. I still feel dad’s don’t take enough of the parental leave but it’s better, slowly.

Also, some companies will compensate during the leave for moms only or both parents. Example, my employer compensates me up to 95% of my salary for the 18 weeks. My boyfriend’s company compensates moms (95%) for the whole 32 weeks and dads (95%) for the first 18 weeks too. 

All that to say, I think having maternal, paternal and parent leave together is better for everyone. That way you have options to use your time how you wish. Also, because dads have their own leave, they are more inclined to take it. Whereas my dad took a single day off in 84 because there was no such thing and his employer would not let him take the day off. It makes all the difference!

I understand the sentiment but let me offer a different perspective.

One, there are plenty of studies that show that having the father around benefits the kids just as much as having the mother does.  Not significantly more, not significantly less. It appears that what we've previously been told about it having to be the mother is not quite supported by scientific evidence (shocker).

Two, this issue is approached typically like it's a foregone conclusion that the woman will want to be the one to take the leave. But that's not necessarily true. Women have careers too, and taking months away from it, as lovely and noble as caring for your child is, can still hurt it. Again, there are studies that show that women who don't interrupt their careers for very long periods of time have more successful ones (mega-duh).

Or is the leave written cleverly enough that it refers not to women and men, but to ""the pregnant individual who gave birth"" versus the other partner who did not?

This is just one reason I'm for equal leave for all, whether its birth, or surrogacy. If you become a parent of a newly born child then its for the best that both parents, regardless of sex/gender/whatever get time off.",Orzorn,t2_bgwbu,1,0,reddit2

The partner has to work MUCH harder than normal during a pregnancy to keep everything afloat. Chores, errands, actual income-producing labor, these are all things a pregnant woman is going to struggle with if they're even able to do them at all, and the partner has to pick up that slack or everything goes to shit. And after the pregnancy there is STILL a lot of work that can only be done by the partner, and a lot of time spent helping the new mother that eats into productive work time. Not to mention if the mom has PPD like my wife did/does, then you're struggling to not only raise the kid mostly by yourself but ALSO you have to manage the household AND earn income because literally nobody else can do it.

Equal parental leave is also important for giving the child an opportunity to bond with both parents, which goes a long way towards creating positive social values and mentality versus only ever seeing one parent and dealing with the different levels of emotional connection between child and parent and the impact that can have on a marriage when one parent is jealous of the other for being closer to the child.

By no means is being pregnant ""easy"", but to say that the partner of a pregnant woman isn't working as hard as them? That's some bullshit, it may be the case sometimes but not often enough that we shouldn't be offering equal leave to both parents.",Bunghole_of_Fury,t2_13ykkx,1,0,reddit2

I'm not at all disagreeing with adding paid family leave, I'm actually THRILLED that cities/states have started mandating it for employers.  It's insanely complicated, and not consistent at all by city/state - which is a massive pain in the ass to administer for employers.  So we're seeing more and more employers just moving to a full parental paid leave, regardless of gender/primary caregiver/etc.",scottyboy218,t2_nhphq,5,0,reddit2

If there is a choice about who gets to take the most leave, then women  will be discriminated against by employers who assume that they are going to be taking more leave. I don't know how to put it more simply than that for you, and I don't know why you are refusing to believe that we face this form of discrimination.

Men and women should both take an equal amount of leave and bear an equal amount of the child care responsibilities. To do otherwise is unfair to women because it causes discrimination against us.

Now. Men should *also* recognize that women who have just given birth have gone through a major traumatic medical event and should pick up the slack so that the person who has just given birth can heal. But behavior at home is not something the employer can or should control.

It's really frustrating and goddamn infuriating that you continue to insist that there is a ChOiCe here. If leave *for both parents* is not long enough for the woman to have recovered from giving birth, then leave *is not long enough for either parent*.

You're thinking of maternity/paternity/parental leave as a vacation reward for getting through pregnancy. If those were being handed out, yeah the birthing parent would deserve more. But that's not what it is, it's not a vacation, it's a special time with a lot of really lovely moments, but it is also a lot of work and stress and minimal sleep, and telling women ""you deserve to do this alone because you carried the baby for 9 months"" isn't the gift you seem to think it is.

>My point is simply that the mother needs more physical and psychological rest, and pretending that's not true is just stupid. Sorry for being blunt and cooky-chtting here, but let's be serious lol The mother's body and mind are changed forever physiologically and hormones are all over the place. This can't simply be swiped under the rug.

You're edging pretty close to mansplaining here, but yeah believe me, sir, I'm intimately aware of how much pregnancy and birth can knock a woman on their ass for way longer than seems fair. You cannot rest if you are the only parent home looking after the kid. I had 14 weeks of maternity leave and my husband had 2 weeks off. That meant I really only had 2 weeks of semi-resting, then he went back to work and my infant didn't actually care that I was broken and exhausted and doing everything alone all day.

But you may ignore the fact that i was explicitly not ignoring these cases if you just like to be mad or find human biology inconvenient for political trigger points. 

Recognizing the real needs of birthing mothers who keep their babies (aka vast majority of babies) does not invalidate or lessen the needs of other families.

Also note that this thread is distinguishing maternity leave from PARENTAL leave. Surrogates and birth mothers for adopteees should absolutely be entitled to same healing maternity leave 6 wks vag delivery or 8 wks c sec. And adoptive parents should absolutely be given appropriate leave. But let’s not reduce the whopping life turning upside down deal it is to give birth and nurse full time while healing… it is a lot. Of course baby won’t know the difference if birth mother is caretaker or not. But everything you do to soothe a newborn in the “fourth trimester” is derived from simulating being in the womb no matter who is doing it. But if a newborn is being exclusively breastfed by its biological mom, the whole process is a major all encompassing commitment that should not be minimized.

Altogether parental leave, at least in the USA, is grossly insufficient. 

When my first was born, I was “ lucky” enough to have disability insurance through my employer that gave 6 wks for vag del and 8 wks for c sec as temporary disability benefit at 100% pay. That would apply whether I kept the baby or not, as it was classified as purely medical leave. That was almost 17 y ago, so not new. But beyond that, it became 70% up to 4 months post event FMLA (would be same for any caretaker, be it birth, adoption, sick parent etc). Then i used all my saved up sick and vacation and pto days to squeeze out month 5. For my next kids I was not so lucky (self employed, so working from home essentially immediately… but if I didn’t I’d have no business to go back to … so no good solution there).

I've been lucky enough to have my dad take me to the doctor when my stomach hurt for days and when I really needed new school clothes. 

Any kid should be able to go to either parent for needs.  That trust starts early too.  Infants and toddlers imprint things that people don't expect them to be paying attention to .

Both my parents worked.  I'm a little bit of a daddy's girl probably because he was willing to do that stuff.

That is the stuff that matters when parents divorce and the mom is weighing out what will actually get done that's needed when it's dads time.  Some dads honestly dont know what to do and feel like everything they do is the wrong decision. 

But being involved early seems to create a much stronger bond that fathers are willing to maintain and fight to keep.  Which is really what most moms want in the end.  They want to know their child is safe and taken care of .  And in an ideal world, there can even be a debate about it because both parents have valid opinions based on experience. 

My dad never knew his father because his dad tried to smother him with a pillow when he was an infant because he didn't stop crying.   I just learned this like 3 years ago too.

Maternity leave is not a vacation. It is not a reward. It is a necessary leave for the benefit of the baby. And women are discriminated against for taking it because employers know that they don't have to give similar leave to men in the same position.

We have ample research that shows that women and babies fare better when men are given an *equal amount* of paternity leave. It ends the discrimination against women if men are subject to the exact same leave. It affords fathers the chance to bond with their children and care for their partners. And it relieves the woman of the burden of being assumed to be the primary caregiver.

I said this once already, but I will say it again because you seem to have missed it the first time:

**If leave for either parent is so short that it does not allow the birthing parent to fully recover, then leave for both parents is too short.**

Read and reread that statement until it sinks in.

Women are not choosing to take the majority of the leave. They are taking the leave that they need to recover physically and psychologically and what is left over for men is less than half. That means that the overall leave afforded to both partners is not enough!

Now do you understand my point?

Based on what you have told me, I have more expertise than you do in this subject. I've worked in HR and I've borne children.

Aaah there it is! Throwing insults around based on a comment in which I said ""this is a very complicated topic, and it's pointless to try and argue about it here"", which is quite obviously an *attack* on you as a mother, right?

If you tried for a hot second to read what I wrote instead of superimposing... something? on it, maybe, just mayyybe you would see that what I wrote doesn't mention or address what you talked about. I didn't say it should be a short leave, I didn't say it shouldn't be equal to the one men can take, I didn't say it didn't have an impact on women's career, in fact, I know from first hand experience how thousands of women experience it.

Whether it is the very best solution or not, most countries give more time off work to women, that's also a fact. And you can't deny either that it does make some sense, again, whether or not it is the best solution, simply because the physical and mental strain is at least *somewhat* greater for women than for men. That's it, that's all I said. We have to establish what's happening right now for things to move forward, and why it is this way now.

If you want for this conversation to happen, and for something to change about it, in hopes that it improves everyone's situation, you can try to bridge the gap when you think someone doesn't understand what you're trying to say. *Especially* when it so happens to be someone who's evidently on your side in terms of social progress lol",,,1,0,reddit2
hh7wv3s,t1_hh6nfzv,2021-10-19 11:13:16,TwoXChromosomes,"So in terms of work vs infant bonding men have the same problem, only they frequently don't get a choice. Very few companies offer paid leave for men. Mothers have to take some amount of time to heal which means men often don't get any time off at all because their wife is no longer working and now they're supporting 3 people on one income.

It's just as important for fathers to bond with their children as it is for mothers. If only one person can take time off then obviously it makes sense for it to be the one healing from major trauma (I mean that in word in the sense that the body has been through a lot). However as a society we should be ensuring both parents can have equal time with their kids. Men having more time with their kids isn't taking anything away from women or saying anything about what women go through in terms of pregnancy/birth. All it's saying is, ""this kid has 2 parents and needs to develop a bond with both of them.""",WhereToSit,t2_e8js7iev,1,0,reddit2

No formal agreement is mostly telling ""I'll tell you to charge by the hour but will ask you to prove any minute that you billed, whichi will take you about 3 horus per hours billed"".

Either sign a contract, or don't give a discount at all. No formal contract should triple your rate. Make it a lot more expensive to not work your way.

A bad client like this can kill your business by not giving you enough time to work on more profitable projects.

Based on a number of other things not mentioned here, we likely won't work with this client at all. There are some obvious red flags from what I have said and I'm sure that's apparent. We expect they will not agree to my partner's full rate as they've been pretty ignorant about his worth too.

Hypothetically, if they do sign an agreement and they do agree to my partner's full rate after the email he sent, I don't see a reason for him not to do the work. Sure, their sexism still ""wins"", but if it's this bad on a brief engagement with a potential contractor, it's likely made the entire company irreversibly toxic, and that's not on us to fix or change. Plus, my partner gets more experience, we potentially come out with more connections, and the ""asshole tax"" can be used to further our own pursuits for our business (which is an expensive one).

We're professionals, we're passionate about our work and we know there is huge demand for this expertise. There are also other individuals in said company not mentioned here who have been pleasant to engage with and who we would like to provide this service to.

I am a developer too but not to the calibre that he is. But I have a knack for business and a lot of experience with clients, budgets, scheduling, etc. and it works really well for me to show him these skills and for him to continually train me and upgrade my tech skills.

So one day, if I continue to work hard and learn as much as I can, I will certainly be able to charge the same as him. In the meantime, I work by a fairly standard dev rate, not low but not tech consultant level (which is much, much higher).

You have the right to refuse unsafe work. And you have the right to do so without it causing any prejudice. If you deem part of your task put you in physical or verbal harm you have the right to refuse it until said work is made safe. It works for construction workers (which is the obvious one) but it works with people dealing with the public too.

During my first week, my colleague had to leave for half an hour to tend to some of the outdoor advertising. One of the regular customers (50+ years of age) was in the shop, it must have been after 9pm. I remember being able to tell he was drunk.

He started talking to me about his cats, saying I should come to his and meet them. Then saying he would buy me vodka and we should drink it together at his house.

He then reached across the counter, slid his hand down the top of my shirt and inside my bra.
He started talking about what he thought my nipples would look like and licking his lips as I stood with my back against the back wall to be as far from him as possible.

He collected his things and said he would wait outside for me to finish work. I had to ask my dad to drive and pick me up.

My boss didn’t believe that the customer was capable of doing this, and implied I was lying.
She spoke to him and he of course denied it (despite the fact he avoided the shop for 2 weeks when he was a daily customer - suspect much).

They didn’t bar him, and I was forced to continue to serve him.

I recently quit my job at a retail store where I was working in the home improvement department, which meant selling all kinds of tools, lawn and garden equipment, and fitness equipment, which meant a lot of men, and since this store has been around a long time, the men were usually 45+. I found that, as a 22 yo woman, if I wanted to wear any makeup that was even somewhat noticeable or a dress or try to look a bit nice, suddenly a lot of older men would start to hit on me, make weird comments, call me pet names, and even some goof as far as calling the store to ask me when I was off of work. Whenever I got off work, I was TERRIFIED that a situation like yours would happen to me on my way to my car (almost always had closing shift, so it was always dark by the time I went home and I know that there is inadequate security for the store and for the mall parking lot). The worst of it was when I had older men who felt it was okay to hit on me and then put their hands on my arms, shoulders, or even try to hug me, and it totally freaked me out and made me super uncomfortable. 

It’s terrifying that your job did nothing even though they were the ones that required you to go walk out with customers to their car.

The grocery store probably did have surveillance video, but of course that is for their protection, not yours.   The attempted abduction was probably on video, and the managers' goal was to over-record that video before she took any legal action.

To the people who are minimizing this by saying it was just a ""shit"" store she worked at, I've been sexually abused working at an international level bank, at my local government offices, and smaller private companies.  Their reactions ranged from saying he's a nice guy, to men taking me in a room and screaming at me, to supporting the guy and telling me I needed psychiatric help, to losing work with a contracting company.

At 19, you would not have known this, but someday you may need this:

People are tempted to do nothing when:

- they don’t know what to do - You can help with this by asking them to do something easy.

Could you find out whether there’s a security camera that faces the parking lot?

- they are overwhelmed - sounding calmer isn’t easy but it does help them focus.  Deep breaths, then speak.

-  it’s inconvenient for them - point out it’s way less inconvenient to do a little now than to deal with the price of ignoring it.

When I worked for an Albertsons in AZ as a Bagger, we were a family. If anyone even had a bad attitude toward one of us, we were there to back each other up if the customer was in the wrong. One day our Albertsons announced it was closing, and we slowly had to let people go one by one. As each one left, we hugged and cried through it all until it finally closed down. Many of the employees got hired on by a Safeway nearby, some being able to keep their positions and same pay. When I made the decision to attempt to get hired there, the manager doing the interview used to work at the Albertsons, and he remembered me. When he saw me he said, ""Hey! I remember you Joe! I love hiring my people. Let's get this initial interview stuff over with so you can start with us!"" I got hired then and there, and got a position as a front end clerk, the position I always wanted. I worked there for about 8 months before moving into Law Enforcement as a Corrections Officer.

At 10pm I went outside, and started clearing the lot. A guy in his mid-late 30s started following me around the parking lot with his pit bull. I immediately leave the stall with the carts, and start walking back to the store. 

As I approach the doors-he catches up to me and blocks me into the corner next to a pallet of fall decorations, and grabbed my wrist and started pulling. The dog is growling, and I’m screaming and crying. 

Luckily a male coworker of mine was on break outside, and intervened and got me inside to safety. When we told my manager what happened, he proceeded to say “what do you want me to do, call the police or something? I’m going home. It’s been a long day,” and proceeded to purchase his dog food and leave. 

My coworker put me into the back office, called the cops, and made sure the creep left before he would let me come out. He was mad they made a 16 year old girl, let alone a Zone manager’s daughter the closing bagger. 

The next day my mom called into work for me. She was irate as the store was apart of her district (also foot note; I applied for the job and was hired without my mom knowing. We have different last names, and without seeing me the manager didn’t know who I was until after he hired me and my mom’s friend, an employee there busted me and lectured me about how my parents didn’t want me to have that job...) 

The manager told my mom she was over reacting. The footage was pulled and it shows everything-and he still said we were over reacting. I toughed it out until I was 19, but I should have quit. Props to you for doing the right thing.

At the front desk, our policy was to offer to take luggage up to the guest rooms when they were checking in. An older man, probably mid 50s and fit came to check in around 11pm, while I was the only one working the desk. Out of habit, I asked if he’d like help taking his bag to his room and he smiled the creepiest smile and said, “I’d love that.”


I immediately regretted offering but didn’t know what else to do now! So, I walked around the desk, grabbed his bag, and headed up to the 7th floor and across to the other end of the hotel. We made small talk in the elevator and I remember just thinking that I need to hurry up and get back down to the desk. 


When we arrived at his room, he walked all the way inside to the window ahead of me and pointed to the luggage rack near him and said “here’s fine” to leave the bag. I should have just dropped the bag inside the entrance, but he was one of our Diamond guests and I didn’t want to get on his bad side. So, on my way into the room I flipped the deadbolt around so the door couldn’t slam completely closed. 


He made a big show of pulling out his wallet to tip me and I didn’t want it. He insisted that I take the money from him by making me come to him and lingering with his hands around mine. I managed to pull away and escape back to my desk. By the time I’d returned downstairs I was in tears over my own stupidity. 


I think about this moment and all the mistakes I made so often. Things could have been so much worse though. Really, nothing happened so I shouldn’t feel as traumatized as I am. But it haunts me to think about what would have happened if I didn’t get out of that room when I did. 


Another bright side, when I told my manager about it- he believed me. He spoke to the guest about how inappropriate it was to ask for my help and told him he could stay throughout the remainder of his trip, but that he wouldn’t be welcome back in our hotel. And he wasn’t to interact with me again during this trip. This was a huge deal because he was a frequent business traveler at our hotel and Diamond members are typically treated like royalty. 


I left that job a few months later, but I’m still so grateful for that manager.

I was then banned for the subreddit for calling her out i did use unsavory terms but hey..... my story.... When i was 9 i told my mother i was molested by my cousin she took me down to the police station and we met with a special victims officer after he asked my story, i told him everything i still remember everything down to the way he smelled when he made me touch him. Afterwards i was told there was nothing they can do. He went on to touch my old male cousin. I have been sexually assaulted three times after this once by a police officer. When i reported my first assault again to the local ER the doctor told me i was being overly dramatic. I probably will never report again.

He waited out there for 15 minutes until the girls came out and I walked them to their cars and he started following us.

There was no safety training of any kind for the store so the girls are parked allover the lot, some close, some far as fuck. I have to like, herd them and teach them to all go to one car in a group, have one get in, leave immediatly.

They don't get it and get irritated.

There are 2 girls left and they just split, one in the VERY back row of lot, one on far back left.

Guy picks up pace towards girl walking to back, I tell side lot girl to leave as she is in her car, start heading to back, catching up to other girl.

The guy pauses, picks up a bottle from the ground and holds it like you would a club, looking at me, then the girl, then the other girl STILL SITTING IN HER FUCKING CAR NOT FUCKING LEAVING LIKE I SAID JESUS FUCKING FUCK! She's looking at her phone and picking music my fucking good she isn't even fucking aware. This chick was and always will be ultra fucking ditzy, dumb, and unaware, like omfg fuck that fuck.

he starts leaning kinda that way, kinda moseying.

I get the girl in the back row in her car, tell her to leave, NOW. This guy is trying to get them, she says okay and IMMEDIATELY leaves.

I start walking to other girl, guy pauses again. I tell her to leave, now, because the dude is coming towards her car. She gets irritated and leaves.

I get a hold of a cop across the street and have it all dealt with filed security footage etc.

Male manager is pissed and inconvenienced by having to pull up footage. Doesn't understand the issue, the tatted guy is always there and a nice customer, always chatting up the girls, he's fine.

Turns out guy was sex offender recently released (like only a few months)

To me it sounds like they were assholes.
At my old retail job we had staff run out the back quite often. I was never a supervisor or anything more, just a long time employee. 
We had someone run out and say ""X was apparently being followed earlier and said the guys just walked in and are watching her"" - myself and a manager make our way out, I go to the staff member in question and find out while the manager takes a walk around the entrance.
I find out who the two in question are, meet with the manager, we ask them to leave. They leave begrudgingly.
I go back to the staff member and offer her a lift home if  she needs it, but she politely declines. I take her place on the floor for a while so she can call her dad and ask for a lift.

I have no idea what it's like to be sexually assaulted and I'm sure that the pain is unbearable and unimaginable.  That being said, I think it's a leap to say ""no one will believe you.""  I think it's important to understand the importance and necessity of good, healthy, grounded relationships.  I don't know what it's like to be sexually assaulted but I know what it's like to have your feelings ignored and not taken seriously.  I know what it's like to be told your being irrational when you know for a fact that you are being completely rational.  I know what it's like to be laughed at and told to forget about something by people who you thought cared about you while you feel you are fighting for your life and literally gasping for air and almost drowning.  People who you invested in and built relationships with can and will laugh at you in those situations.  It's hard but I think you have to move on and find the people that will be there for you when you need them.  I believe that people like this exist.  They're hard to find but they're out there.

e7my9pv,t3_9nh6t6,2018-10-12 14:26:30,TwoXChromosomes,"I work at a grocery store. This happens to me where men take me being polite and giving good customer service as a way to ask me out. One guy even asked If I had a boyfriend and I said I’m gay, to which he said “oh I like that.” I told him straight up to his face that was very inappropriate and I had my other coworker (who was male) finish up his transaction . I told my supervisors and one of the managers. They could clearly see how agitated I was. This is what they told me: “we are about customer service but if a customer is being rude to you in any way you have absolutely no obligation to continue interacting with them. Let us know next time he comes in”  and that was that. 

Take that everywhere else you work. I’m glad I had management who cared about the wellbeing of its female employees but sometimes you have to be assertive if no one else sticks up for you. 

My question is: do you guys have cashier assistants who bag/ organize the carts?? I think the lines would be terrible if every cashier had to leave their line every time a customer wants help with their bags. Jesus, I even have new mothers with their 6 week old child who say “no need, thank you anyways,” when I ask if they need help to their cars. That guy (or anyone) is a fucking weakling If they prey on someone while that person is AT WORK.

I might be an optimist but I like to think there are more guys than not that will step up and prevent and assist in a situation like this. Also your business could have gotten sued, your manager was an idiot.

I'm sorry this happened to you, I believe you, and you did nothing wrong.  

What are people's thoughts on strategies to employ in this situation? During and after. For both men and women. 

My thoughts are if you see something in a parking lot like that that seems off, then involve yourself. A kidnapper will be thrown off if they think there is a witness. Just call out to the girl with a big smile and say hi ask about her mom, ask her to come over to you. The would be kidnapper isn't going to escalate in front of a witness. And you get to play it off as just seeing a friend in a parking lot. 

Also listen to your gut, if someone is giving you a bad vibe trust it. The risk is too great to take just to avoid being rude. 

Also if anyone man or woman reports sexual abuse, believe them. There is a 2-10% chance they are lying meaning there is a 90% to 98% percent chance they are telling the truth. 

https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf

Finally if your boss or superior refuses to help, call the police, right then. Report it as an attempted kidnapping. The police can come in and ask witnesses who might still be there, look at security tapes, and get information when it is fresher in your mind like details of the assailant or the vehicle. A boss refusing to help a victim of sexual assault just handed you a law suit. Take it and say thank you very much. 

If everyone, men and women got on board we could really make the world a lot safer for women and a lot more hostile to sexual assailants.

That was horrifying and I feel sad you were exposed to that.
I've went through a lot and my daughter was sexually assaulted.
One of the biggest lessons I learned came from a book series The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz.

Every so often, clear away everything you know and every belief you have and start over. Some of the beliefs you noted there aren't healthy for living over a lifetime and they are only the beliefs they are because they suited a particular timeframe of pain.

1. In many aspects of life, no one will believe you until you have something to prove it. You worked at a little store that had crappy management, but that shouldn't mean that you can't trust again.

2. Many people will empathize, but won't take action for their own reasons. It is up to the negotiation between you to make your intentions of follow-up known, for them to follow through, and for you to verify that they followed through.

3. You are not on your own, but who helps you can vary. The more impactful you are in someone's life is a factor, but there are a lot of people who won't reach out unless you make it clear that you want help.

4. Justice comes from facts and talking to the right people. When my daughter was assaulted, she didn't report it, didn't go to the hospital afterwards, and didn't tell anyone for months. She lost her opportunity to prove it and the only justice now is through vigilante, by trying to bait it to happen again or trying to trick a recording of a confession.

There is a saying that lucky people aren't really lucky, they are just always on the lookout for anything that can help. In the same thought process of awareness and preparedness, I've seen it noted that 1/4 of women are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes and few ever report it. In many instances, they could have been taught for warning signs, martial arts, vulnerability assessments, legal options, response options and how to reduce risk. 

The important thing is to clear away the old beliefs and rationalizations and rebuild as a more stable, confident and mature adult who acts from a center of strength and knowledge.

He pushed me up against the wall and then started groping me and trying to kiss me and I just froze up until I came to my senses and pushed him off of me as hard as I could and screamed at him. I tried to act normal for the rest of the day but I told my managers and no one called the cops. When I told my psychiatrist about it he told me he was a mandatory reporter of sexual assault and he considered it a form of sexual assault so I had to file a police report etc. I took it up with my store manager and he was really kind with me and patient and went frame by frame looking to see if the guy had been seen on any of the stores cameras - and he had. We got a lot of good still shots of him to give to the cops. When the cop showed up she was kind of an asshole to me and was like “y u wait so long to say something” and I told her because my managers didn’t call the police that day and I didn’t know if I was allowed to or not  


Long story short/tl;dr

You can always call the police for yourself. To cover your ass tell a manager first if they do nothing call the police. The quicker the better so they can catch the person. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. Your managers were shitheads. I give mine the benefit of the doubt that I was in shock and downplayed what happened that day but it affected me more than I let on.

The car was driving off, and the passenger side door was open. A woman was hanging out of it, screaming, “Help me! I don’t wanna go!” She almost got out but was pulled back in. The door was still open a little bit when the car peeled out of the parking lot and down the road. One of the employees took out her phone and recorded the license plate number.

The cops were called. We also all reviewed the camera footage, and while the incident itself wasn’t recorded (because of camera placement), we did see who the driver was. He had been at the store for about an hour prior to the incident, and he had unzipped his jacket (without ever zipping it back up so he was kinda topless) to show off a surgical scar to a frightened 17-year-old employee. She was so unnerved by him she was hiding in the manager’s office; I thought she was joking about being scared at first but she was actually really creeped out by him so I let her hide out.

We didn’t see anyone enter the car, so either we missed him grabbing her (because the footage was really fuzzy) or she had been already sitting in his car for the hour that he was there for. We were able to give the cops the license plate number and the footage, but they didn’t find him.",Megwen,t2_14mf1q,1,0,reddit4

I totally get your rage at not getting the response which you should have in this situation but I have when these parts turn into crap like what I just copied. There is a problem with these situations not bring appropriately handled, but that doesn't mean that none is ever believed, that you're on your own, or that trying to tell someone will always do nothing. All statements like this do is let the person who assaulted you win, and when women or young girls who haven't been victim to this activity yet read this, they get convinced that it's not worth even trying. This perpetuates the cycle of non reporting.

ALWAYS REPORT IT! If your boss won't act, then quit and go to the police. If the job is part of a corporation, file an in-house grievance against your boss. File a grievance against the company with the state. 
Take every step possible to get what happened reported and recorded.

e7n49hi,t3_9nh6t6,2018-10-12 15:53:09,TwoXChromosomes,"Not to poke at you when you're down - or at least being vulnerable and sharing your experience..

1. **Your stated life lessons are self-imposed limitations**

When I was sexually abused, I told a person I knew I could trust. They believed me. They cared and still do care about me. They helped me through it, *showing me* that I was not alone.

I obtained justice by confronting and getting the person who sexually abused me to admit to their wrongdoings. We settled it internally, as a family, but I achieved what some victims never do. Which is unfortunate, but the truth - nature is neither kind nor fair. Do best to remember that.

Just because you experienced an instance of nobody believing you, caring about you, ensuring that you were not alone, and did not get 'justice' from telling, does not mean that's a truth of life.

Nature is neither kind, nor fair. THAT is a life truth. Saying those are life lessons - which implies truths, are realities of a victim mentality. You survived that. Nobody else helped, sure, but those are not truths of life.

. . .

**2. Be situationally aware, even if it hurts or is hard.**

You have convinced yourself that he blocked your only exit. When we are in fear, our brain shuts down. I don't discount that you went through a very scary time - being abducted is a sinister fate to face. Being trapped is one of our strongest primal fears.

Yet situational awareness is a skill we all must hone. Situational awareness is not something taught in the classroom. It is something we must learn and work to maintain, grow.

Maybe there really wasn't any other exit - yet what about under the door he had open? Over the car? Were there NO people that came within yelling-range of you? When your life in on the line, we have to think of everything. Twenty minutes is a lot of time to scan and make a gameplan - if our mind isn't frozen in fear. I don't mean to say you're weak or otherwise incapable of thinking of an action plan. 19 is, culturally speaking, an age we are not considered ""adults"" yet. Shame, but not on you or anyone, really, it's just the way it is.

&#x200B;

. . .

I don't apologize to you for what happened to you. Simply because of this: Break a glass. Then say you're sorry to it. Is the glass still broken?

I do seek to express that while we're strangers, I emphasize with you. I've been in a place where I was hurt by someone I trusted, like you have. I have not specifically been in an abductee situation. Yet I am a tactical instructor and teach youth and young adults how to be situationally aware in high-stress or high danger situations, as part of our Youth Survival Mentorship program at the Marysville Rifle & Recreation Club here in Washington.

Even though we're strangers, I'm here for you. I will defend you, if able. We may be miles apart, yet know that I will do anything within my power to anyone who reaches out seeking support or protection that I can provide. Even if that providence is simply to be an ear, to to be a conduit to negotiate with the authorities or the parties involved.

He didn’t threaten to take her away or anything, but he did grab her and hug her for far too long until she pushed him away. He had the fucking audacity to also ask how long they could stay hugging for and handed her a twenty like she was some kinda prostitute.

The work place did ban him but because “nothing actually happened” they can’t call the police or anything. Which I get, but it’s still infuriating. Especially the lack of action could potentially mean her getting actually hurt in the future.

She was really upset about it and I was fuming when I found out. I always thought my city was pretty damn safe growing up, but since graduating high school shit keeps happening. I’ve been sexually harassed twice and people keep bothering my best friend at work and I found out my other friend from high school (who was a teacher) had slept with one of my underaged friends! And the school did jackshit about it and he’s not being arrested or anything. Fucking hell.

Like I used to think that maybe women were over reacting a little growing up, but that was because I was a dumb little kid who had people watching out for me. Now that I’m grown? It’s fucking true. You can’t go anywhere without being prepared, and sometimes it’s very threatening talking to men. Even if they act nice, because experience has taught that’s not always the case.

But then people don’t get it. A lot of men who think we’re being over dramatic don’t get it. Because many of them have never had to live through a reality like this. I just wish they’d understand and start believe us more. ",thefirecrest,t2_q133s,-1,0,reddit4

From childhood, there seemed to be a certain inevitability to being sexually assaulted just because I was a girl & sadly, that has been true many times over.

Sometimes I wonder if how I felt influenced it happening- like predatory people sensed that fear & panic & knew that I might freeze or that I knew no one would believe my account.

But almost all females are taught they need to self-police because men are ‘wild sexual beasts’, unable to control their sexual urges and are rarely held accountable for their antisocial & illegal behaviour towards women & children & each other.

I hope there has been significant change over the years in that people now feel free to report AND demand police attendance.
Moreso, I hope there has been significant change that teach people that other’s boundaries need to be respected and that people’s accounts need to be heard and actioned appropriately.

But I haven’t seen enough of this to be confident. Fingers crossed we continue to validate the lived experiences of victims of sexual assault and harassment.

You should have gone directly to HR and reported your POS manager, if HR fails to do anything, you have some serious grounds for a lawsuit had something similar occurred in the future where things escalated.  

That being said, what would have come of calling the police? The perv didnt do anything ILLEGAL. Unethical, yes, immoral? you bet. Illegal? No. Not even close. The police are not here to comfort you. They are there to look at the facts and make an arrest if necessary. The facts are he didnt touch you, didnt prevent you from leaving, and didnt threaten you. The police would have taken a statement and it would have ended there. 

&#x200B;

The reason im saying this is not to dissuade anyone from going to the police but to advise people to surround themselves with a positive support system. OP would have fared a lot better with this had she had a support system in place.

I agree that he clearly intentionally created a super creepy situtation that forced op into a vunrable position. But I think you actually have to attempt to kidnap someone for the police to consider it an attempted kidnapping. 

Maybe you could take action against the store for something like disregard of employee safty?

Trapped for 20 minutes, with him blocking both exits? He opened his passenger door so he is either behind the door in which case the door is between you and him. The only way you would be trapped is if the car was backed into a fence or wall. In which case you still just walk around the cars next to you since they wouldn't be touching said fence or wall. The other scenario is he opened the door from behind you which you would have stated and would have been super weird. Still from there you can just close the door and get away. In that last scenario I can understand if you froze and were scared but it seems like you're exaggerating parts of the story which is why people are questioning the validity. If it did occur the way you have stated it sounds like he was asking you to leave, and probably didn't even realize you felt trapped if you didn't try and leave or get away. According to the story she just closed the door and walked away. So how was she trapped?

> For one you say he chose you on purpose and wanted you to get away from them

These things are easy to see in hindsight. She wouldn't have put it all together until he was there by the car cornering her, literally telling her ""I chose you on purpose"". She probably did have that bad feeling when they were walking to the car, but as women we live with that alarm bell going off constantly so we train ourselves to say ""maybe it's not such a big deal. I'm probably overreacting. I'll look hysterical if I refuse to go and it will damage my reputation with my employer. I'm probably overreacting, it'll be ok.""

> but you kept walking anyways

See above.

> Especially when they didn't care as well.

This reaction occurs all the time. All the fucking time. It's happened to me - I (along with anothet female coworker in fact) reported harassment on the job and nothing was done (I can go into detail if you want because I'm guessing you'll just think I'm lying too). Why do you think so many women have learned to stay quiet, and are only coming out now when the culture is starting to change and society is ready to listen. Because we learn time and time again from experience that no one fucking cares and that it wall only end up hurting you. Look at YOUR response to this story - you're calling OP a liar when things like this happen all the time, just because it's outside your realm of personal experience. Fuck off with that. YOU ARE PART OF WHY WOMEN DON'T COME FORWARD. Regardless of whether this particular story is true things like this happen to all the time, but you've just confirmed to everyone reading this that has had this sort of thing happen to them that they are looked down upon (told they're lying, that they're stupid for not preventing the situation from happening, etc etc). I hope your jollies over being an internet detective are worth it.

Next time before you speak try to remember that these experiences are common for women. All women. Remember that they are traumatic, and that the trauma is extended by society not giving a collective fuck and often even blaming women for ""letting"" these things happen to them. Let that knowledge inform how you respond when women open up about sexual abuse and trauma. Because if one woman is sharing something many more women that her voice - and yours - is reaching have had something similar done to them.

One can argue he knew he was in a position of power as a customer who could complain to her manager if she just left without making nice to him. 

By blocking her only egress he was making it difficult for her to leave without touching him. She was fearful that, if she drew closer to him in an attempt to leave, he would take advantage of her proximity and escalate to abduction.

Think of it this way. If a person who’s physically MUCH bigger & stronger than you came up to you, stood VERY close, trapping you between himself & walls in an alley with nobody around, & said “Come with me to my far away forest cabin because I think you’re pretty. You won’t have to work any more since you’ll live there with me all the time”, wouldn’t you be concerned that as you try to get away you’ll actually have to move physically closer to him, & that he could try to harm or overpower you then? Wouldn’t you try to talk nice to him while looking for an opening, a shift in his attention so you could get the eff out of there? You can’t just push him out of the way, since unless he touches you first he could claim you assaulted him.

e7mtzkh,t1_e7mrck2,2018-10-12 13:16:24,TwoXChromosomes,"My mom and I worked in the same tiny grocery store when I was in high school. One day when she was off work, she was buying dinner and a customer cut in line. My mom is not meek. She said excuse me, I was there, and he said tough, he was a “real customer” and then said something about my mom running her mouth.

I got bad vibes so when they both went into the parking lot I asked a “spare” cashier to watch my register for me and I went out there with them. (Important to the story: we did this ALL THE TIME, covered each other’s registers.) Got out just in time to see the guy haul off and smack my mom across the face. Me and a meat cutter started running across the parking lot, guy took off in his truck and my mom called the police, who were obviously able to note the giant welt on her face. 

The owners did three things: 

- Wrote me up for leaving my register, which again we did *all the time.* I covered for smokers a dozen times a day, but this was “unfair to my coworkers.”

- Threatened to fire anyone who went to court on my moms behalf. 

- Sent a guy from produce, who wasn’t there, as a “character witness” in support of the customer. 

My mom was a single parent with 5 kids. I had the freedom to walk out and quit, but she’d worked there for almost 5 years at that point and couldn’t afford to not have a job, it was 2006 so there weren’t a ton of jobs anyway and if you quit you have to prove your case for unemployment and she couldn’t count on other people testifying for her (except that meat kid, who did) to ensure she’d even get it, even if it would have been enough to live on.

In the end the guy pled No Contest and my mom said she was okay that he still be allowed to shop there (he was a regular and the store relied a lot on their regular customer base) as long as she wasn’t working, because if he’d been banned she seriously thought she’d get fired for it. When I eventually took my job back under new owners, he’d hover until my line was empty and then come through my line grinning at me. I’d watch him walk back and forth between the coolers watching for it, even while other cashiers had no one in line.

It's not just about the police doing anything. It's about standing up for yourself and recognizing how bad the assault was. Most police will at least take it seriously, whereas her boss did not. You file a police report. You talk to someone who will not just dismiss attempted kidnapping.  

>there’s nothing i regret more than reporting my assault   

I think everyone has to make a choice for themselves, and it's completely valid to not report an assault if that is what you want. I would never say you *have* to go to the police. People can decide if they want to.

He also convinced all of us that pressing charges would lead to nothing so he wound up not filing a report at all. Probably didn’t think the paperwork wouldn’t be worth the dead end. My dad, who was a high ranking Naval officer at the time even reported it to the military police and that lead to nothing. Two days after that no one in my family talked about it again. In fact i was grounded for drinking (i was 19 and the still grounded me, like i said ultra conservative). It was clearly understood that it was a shameful thing to mention.

e7n3ure,t1_e7n0o1v,2018-10-12 15:47:15,TwoXChromosomes,"With this mindset, why ever go to the police for anything?

It is undoubtedly tragic and inhumane and fucking wrong that assault reports are not taken seriously by some people. That does not mean they are useless. If someone is able to report, they should, and yes, a paper trail can eventually contribute to someone getting prosecuted.

As a victim of assault, you can also see the ER or a doctor and get the assault documented, even if you don't choose to file a police report.

No victim can and should be forced to report. But encouraging people to report is important. 

At the same time, when you live in a society where authorities are known to disrespect victims and to belittle their experiences, we need to even more work on changing that. You don't need to be a traumatized victim to do that, and to stand in for a change.

It is definitely traumatizing to be assaulted, and in some cases, the trauma is made worse by bad handling of the cases, unempathic or disinterested authorities. The latter is what has to be changed, and it does not change when we accept that ""reporting doesn't help"" and stop doing it.

When I see victims of domestic assault protecting their partners repeatedly, I feel helpless and frustrated, too. I still work with them, help them and try to support them so one day they can break that cycle.When you deal with dominance, power extortion, emotional blackmail and trauma you need to protect the victims now and in the future. If one report doesn't do anything, maybe the second does. It's bad if it takes a hundred reports and a dead child or adult to finally get heard, but something happens.

The aim is to reach a point where assault is not trivialized and brushed off when one is rich or privileged enough.  The aim is to protect victims and let them file reports without getting further exposed and traumatized. It involves many fields, doctors, police, among others, and it is a complex work that will take years to get better. 

One thing is for sure. If we do not work on it, nothing at all will happen. If authorities don't want to hear you, go a step higher up or shout louder. If one can not do it, that is fine, but encouraging those who can is important, too.",Fettnaepfchen,t2_s1lxt,6,0,reddit4

Such stuff convinces me that every kid should just be signed up for krav maga or some other self defense classes for once because it is good cardio and developes all muscles in fairly natural ways and secondly because it preps people for such situations and gives them predefined strategies to act out while their brain is busy panicking and doesn't have time to even think straight. I know it may seem bit extreme but my good mate is a legit krav maga coach and he is also working with kids and I saw him play with my 4 year old cousin. She thought they ware just having fun and ware messing around much like during pillow fights or in our case full on wars.

Nonetheless, as a father, my desire to make grocery store management accountable is not gender based.

If the management that disregarded her complaints was male or female would make no difference to me - I would be down there to ask them why they ignored such a serious issue.

I'd do this whether it was my son or daughter involved.

This is extremely poor management of an extremely serious issue. Me saying taht i would be pissed if this was my daughter (or son, for that matter) what is wrong with that?

Edit: I have a question. Do you believe that the young lady handled this well?  At 19 it is easy to be intimidated by so called 'management' and just meekly stop protesting. I am a little taken aback by the tome of your post to me. It suggests a Dad would be in the wrong for wanting justice for his daughter.

First of all, she doesn't work at Publix anymore. She's 31 years old and this happened 12 years ago, so your point is entirely irrelevant. And she was 19 when she did work there, so carrying a firearm would have been a felony. Obviously I'm not talking about carrying 12 years in the past and obviously you aren't paying attention.

Second, if you're getting fired for having a concealed weapon, you weren't concealing it very well. I personally bagged and cashiered at Publix years ago and I absolutely carried every now and then.

It's not helpful to say the people who don't take it seriously aren't fully human. Saying that undermines the case of rape culture.  
The fact is that sexual assault and harassment are common and even if the majority of men aren't perpetrators of it, we're (as in the majority, not you and I as individuals) either ignoring it or aren't actively working to prevent it.

So let's start by acknowledging rape culture is real, which means real human men believe they are entitled to women's bodies, regardless of consent. Let's listen to women, and encourage other men to do the same. Let's open ourselves to become more empathetic, and expect other men to do the same. Let's stop rewarding (financially, socially, politically) people, especially men, who harm others, especially women.

Saying that these people aren't human beings implies that one can easily recognize the difference between a good person and a bad person, or that the issue of sexual assault is as simple as good and bad people.

Many instances of sexual assault and rape are genuinely not perceived as such by the guilty party. I was raped by my ex girlfriend. She climbed on top of me when I said I was too tired and not interested in sex. I could have forced her off, I didn't, does that mean I asked for it? Does that mean I consented? Did it make her a bad person? We were 19-20 and living together, we slept together every night, she didn't think she was hurting me, she didn't think I would feel raped. And I don't feel like I was harmed. It was still rape.

I sexually assaulted my wife once. We weren't married yet, but we were living together. Very sexually active. She went to bed drunk and I followed her to bed shortly after and started making out with her. She participated, made sounds indicating pleasure, was obviously drunk but we were in a long term relationship. Eventually got to me going down on her and surprise surprise, she woke up. She had been sleeping. She was drunk and confused and scared and we spent the next 15 minutes calming her down and dealing with what happened.

I am a fucking real human being. I have been raped by someone who didn't understand that they were raping me. I have sexually assaulted a person whom I incorrectly thought had given me consent. Other people have been in situations like this. I'm not promiscuous, those stories were about long term partners. I can count the number of people I've slept with on two hands and I'm approaching middle age.

The issues relating to consent, sexual assault, and rape are much more complex than many people pretend it is. People are poorly educated about the concept of consent. Other people are raised by fucking awful cultures that need to be ""tolerated"" until their fucking kids wise up and abandon the outdated beliefs. Some people are genuinely fucking awful and they need to be dealt with as they're discovered. This isn't a simple issue. It's complex. Each situation is different.",rachelsnipples,t2_ks1rh,5,0,reddit4
e7mwk79,t1_e7mv1fa,2018-10-12 13:59:51,TwoXChromosomes,"We as men can do lots of things.

The first is to always listen to women unless they've given you really good reason not to. Listen to their stories. Listen to them when they say that sexual assault is common. Listen to them when they say that what you're doing is unhelpful even if you think you're in the right.

The second is to act when a Woman comes up and says that something has happened. That might be getting between you and the creep, Helping her get to her car alright (bot not hoovering around like the creep in this story, give her space.), pretending to be her BF because for *some weird FUCKING REASON they have to pretend to do this because just not being interested isn't enough for creeps. 

A more generalized version of the above is if a Woman comes into your shop fewring the creep out front offer to squirrel them out the back, or something similar.

Offer to go and report with Women. Encourage them to report. Offer a safe way for them to report.

A lot of the above has an assumption that you're friends with them already. But the big thing is to not be a creep like the person already being a creep. If you make a person feel uncomfortable when you're trying to help, then you're nearly as bad as the first guy.

The biggest thing is to offer to report though IMO. Offer a way to safely report and help stand up to the sexist cops.",petlahk,t2_a7nzn,10,0,reddit4

For the record, lots of middle aged women think it’s fine to hit on or touch young male workers and that is NOT ok either.

Sure, sometimes going to the police doesn't have immediate results, and sometimes people who try to make reports get brushed off, but if nobody reports anything then creeps will never get caught.  It takes actions to get results.  If the police officer isn't taking the attempted report seriously, the victim can go over their head to their supervisor, or to an organization like RAINN for additional resources and aid.  (In some cases, hospitals and medical personnel can also help file reports.)  

Also, not buying the angle of ""advice to make reports to be similar to victim blaming"".  Victim blaming would be telling someone that it's their fault for being attacked because of something they did, or maybe that it's their fault that somebody else was attacked if you really want to stretch it.  This is not the same thing as telling people what they can do to help get their abusers off the streets.  Advising people to make police reports is enabling them to seek some form of justice over their attacker, and helping them realize that even if it isn't immediately fruitful it could help someone in the future.

If making a police report is that traumatic, one should probably try to see a therapist to help resolve their issues.  Therapists can also help make reports to the police, but wont if the victim does not want to.  I can understand there could be a million reasons for not filing reports, and not filing reports is well within a victims rights and could be important for their own mental and emotional health, but all it externally accomplishes is giving a creep a free pass for his/her horrific behavior.

Some of the good men in their circle noticed that the guy had a tendency to target vulnerable women, like women who were drunk or mentally slow or just younger but above the age of consent, and he was making them uncomfortable.

First, they tried gently talking to the guy man to man, explaining that that wasn't cool. He didn't care, so they got meaner about it. He still didn't care, and said he wasn't doing anything illegal and wasn't going to stop. So the good guys literally set up a schedule before they went out somewhere that this guy was likely to be. They'd take turns being on creepwatch duty, almost like a designated driver. The assigned person would follow the creep around, get between him and women he was creeping on and make sure that they were safe, and they'd loudly confront him about it and make sure everyone knew this guy was sketchy, and make sure the women he targeted were able to get home safely.

I had someone break into my basement suite while I was home and asleep. I woke up and that was enough to scare them away but they stole many items including my wallet.

They tried to use my credit card at multiple locations and they found the vehicle they were driving on security footage at a local gas station but they were unable to find the people.

2 years past and nothing happened, I thought police did jack shit for me too. Until they robbed another house and managed to catch the guy driving around another neighborhood a week later. They were able to use my police report and a few others to string together the areas he was hitting and increase his sentencing for jail. They also informed me that since he was tied to my robbery, since I was home at the time it happened, it was a more severe crime that they could pin on him.

If you spend most of your time wondering if an officer/chef actually cares or if they have the budget and resources to carry out an investigation, you are missing the point of law enforcement and you are systematically making catching criminals more difficult and you are telling victims to not report crimes that happen to them because police won't do anything anyway.

it’s not fear mongering to point out that we live in a horrendous society (pretty much every society i know of, at least) which does not care about women.  they care more about a man’s life not being “ruined” than they do anything else.  in the us, a man who was accused of raping a woman is a supreme court judge.  dr. ford came forward and nothing meaningful happened as a result.  a man who admitted to sexually assaulting women on tape is the president.  not too long ago a man was caught in the act of assaulting a woman and he got six months.  

maybe to you, adding to the trauma victims of sexual assault face is worth it bc somewhere down the line in this imaginary utopia you’ve envisioned, rapists and assailants and harassers will see justice.  but the reality is, there is a high likelihood that they won’t.

My point was that when there is no evidence that a story is fake, and when the alleged perpetrator isn't identified, saying it must be fake because of the reasons the person I was responding to gave (the particularly galling and insidious one being that nobody did anything so she must be lying) only serves to keep other women from coming forward. Therefore the commenter should use more care. People's lives and safety are at stake.

When reading about sexual assault please try to keep things in perspective. False allegations are sometimes made and they have tragic consequences. They should not be looked at lightly. But when someone comes out with their story, and NO ONE'S REPUTATION IS AT RISK, please treat her with respect, because there hundreds of women here reading who have experienced sexual harassment, assault and even rape. What is the point of calling her a liar? What does it achieve? Particularly when the ""evidence"" sited as her lying is that no one took the allegation seriously - we've seen time and again (and I myself have personally experienced) that this is a very typical reaction to harrassment in the workplace and elsewhere. Please remember that real people read these comments and they have real consequences. At best they are hurtful to people who have already been victimized. At worst they become another drop in the torrent of cultural bullshit that tells victims of sexual assault that they shouldn't come forward. They contribute to people being reluctant to come forward, and allow perpetrators to continue to not be held to account and being allowed to continue hurting people. If you've been paying attention you'll have seen how widespread and pervasive this problem is, and how many women it touches.

No one here is trying to pressure someone. That would be the opposite of support. It's important to offer understanding and help, though, and keep reassuring victims that some doors are open if they decide to accept help/file reports/leave abusive spouses or whatever it is they can not do right now but might be able to do later. This is why some doctors would give a domestic abuse victim in the ER their contact number in case they ever feel like needing someone, or just as a symbol that they are not alone out there.

When someone talks about having been let down by the justice system (or their boss in the first place), isn't validating this negative experience/impression / feeling by saying ""why should police take their reports seriously"" the opposite of encouraging?

e7qgs8f,t1_e7p0mt6,2018-10-14 06:02:17,TwoXChromosomes,"I think the term rape culture was purposely coined to create a culture of fear and outrage. Gender studies courses are using the same techniques far right, and far left news outlets use to attract viewers. Their targets are people who have already been victims to some harassment, and so are already filled with paranoia or anger caused by PTSD or some trauma. It's the same strategy Trump used to get into power, and I'm betting will be the same strategy the next democratic candidates will use.

From that site you linked.

* *Sexually explicit jokes*
* *Tolerance of sexual harassment*

I can agree with that, although, sexual harassment has been broadened to the point where it includes unwanted flirting, or men being accused of rape for peer pressuring women into sex. I don't see what's sexist about sexually explicit jokes. I guess they can be. Most jokes incorporate some form stereotype. They arise out of generalized humorous observations of society. Hell, every Trump/republican/religious joke I've heard for the last 2 years has been a stereotype.

* *Inflating false rape report statistics*

This doesn't shock me considering we can't even agree on what encompasses rape or sexual assault. This could be anywhere from half of all cases to almost none. I've personally seen far false data on on rape statistics (1 in 3) being perpetuated.

* *Publicly scrutinizing a victim’s dress, mental state, motives, and history*

If you start of the bat with the premise that the accuser is actually a victim, and the other person therefor guilty until proven innocent, you are [begging the question](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/53/Begging-the-Question). Determining a persons motives, mental state, or history is crucial in any investigation. I think it was perfectly acceptable to do on both sides in the Kavanaugh debacle, if you don't come in with any preconceived assumptions.

* *Gratuitous gendered violence in movies and television*

I don't think I've seen a movie made by western culture in the last 60 years that applauded violence towards women. The abuser is generally portrait as the villain. The only case where that is not the case is pornography or 50  Shades of Grey. The former a medium that's been concluded to be everything from ""empowering to women"" to ""the cause of female objectification"" by feminists. Personally I think the industry has done for more damage than good to both genders. It's sexual liberation without any consideration for it's repercussions, or it's risks. Freedom without a counterbalance of personal resposnability. I find it strange how an industry which relies on objectification, and is known to be pretty horrible to women seems to get a pass and almost completely overlooked by feminists because so many view it as ""sexual liberation"", or because they enjoy it themselves. 

* *Trivializing sexual assault (“Boys will be boys!”)*
* *Pressure on men to “score”*

There is a reason we have twice as many female as male ancestors. Males are at a disadvantage when it comes to reproduction. Our social norms are grounded in evolutionary psychology. I field of science that seems stand more and more in direct opposition to gender studies. You pretty much get lambasted every time you bring it up in this sub, or anywhere 3rd wave feminism can be found. There is more pressure for men to ""score"", because it's much more difficult for young men. I generally don't think feminism understands most men's perspective, or the history of sexual evolution and how the so called ""patriarchy"" came about through hypergamy. Despite having kind of a crazy idea, [this women](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/5gkkj5/is-reducing-the-male-population-by-90-percent-the-solution-to-all-our-problems) was onto something, but got hate hate from all sides. Feminist or not.

* *Defining “manhood” as dominant and sexually aggressive*
* *Defining “womanhood” as submissive and sexually passive*
* *Pressure on women to not appear “cold”*

Men value empathy in female partners. I would hope women value the same thing in men. Self confident, independent, and assertive men can come across as cold and emotionally aloof and mysterious. So I do think women are generally more attracted to these types of men. I know that's not what women want necessarily, but what people want and what they are attracted to to are not always the same. I've personally been told over and over again by dozens of women who are attracted to these men, that they do it because they want to change men, or that they want to fix them. I find it ironic how most of feminism either deny these stereotypes, or blame them on social conditioning. While at the same time fixing men seems to be one of feminism main goals. It's the premise of pretty much every romantic or erotic novel or movie directed towards women for all recorded history. From ""Beauty and the Beast"" to ""50 Shades of Grey"". Girl meats wild, strong, angry, and emotionally aloof,  bad boy of high social standing. He rejects her. They fight ending in her being hurt. She eventually tames him and teaches him the error of his his ways. Woman dominates and tames the dominant wild beast. The fact that this concept has more or less been accepted as a political movement is kind of funny to me. Women (on average) have a sexual power advantage over men in their youth, so men compete among each other to measure up. That was premise of first wave feminism, and why it was thought the sexual liberation of women would fix things. These days this idea of hypergamy is straight up denied to even exist. From what I can tell things have gotten far worse. Many men I know have completely given up on relationships and view women as nothing but sexual objects. Partially due to porn, and partially due to the fact most women still maintain the same double standards for menr. And I don't see why they should change. I don't think it's right for me to tell what gay men should find attractive, or to recondition their sexuality, so why is it appropriate to do the same for straight men, and women.

* *Assuming only promiscuous women get raped*

I've never heard this from anyone in a serious tone. I think women who are more sexually active have a higher risk of getting raped as they are more likely to run into psychos. Being more sexually active generally means being exposed to sexual experiences you might regret after a night of heavy drinking/drug use. Sex is never risk free. That counts for both sides, although women(statistically) seem to have far more regrets afterwards.

* *Assuming that men don’t get raped or that only “weak” men get raped*

I can agree with this, but a persons lack of physical strength does make them more vulnerable to many kinds of harassment. That does not make it right.

* *Refusing to take rape accusations seriously*

There seems to be a purposeful blurring of the lines between taking someone seriously, and choosing to believe someone. A push towards ""guilty until proven innocent"". First of all, [belief is not a choice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201109/disbelief-is-not-choice). It's primary reason I see religions as flawed. You can pretend to believe that person in order to comfort them, but investigations still need to take place even if it risks offending the victim, because actual belief is based on facts and science. Belief without evidence is called faith, or self delusion. Which I don't believe in.

* *Blaming the victim (“She asked for it!”)*
* *Teaching women to avoid getting raped* 

I remember hearing about some university getting in trouble for teaching women self defense because it was ""victim blaming"". I don't like guns, but the idea that me getting a gun for self defense is somehow self blame for a crime is ridiculous.

Victims of sexual assault have this same fear. Many times the people who abuse them can do severe financial or social harm to the victim (in addition to the physical and emotional), especially if they report.

> I don't see what's sexist about sexually explicit jokes. I guess they can be. Most jokes incorporate some form stereotype.

Puns often don't incorporate stereotypes. Maybe you don't think puns or play on words make very funny jokes, but they're definitely jokes that don't rely on stereotypes. Likewise, not all sexually explicit jokes are sexist, but context is key, here. Are you telling a sexually explicit joke to a coworker who you know is uncomfortable talking to you (or anyone in the office) about anything sexual? Then that's sexual harassment. If you roll your eyes and say, ""they need to just get over it,"" that's tolerance of sexual harassment.  
Hell, even your statement of ""unwanted flirting"" being part of the ""broadened"" definition of sexual harassment is a level of tolerance, implying that if a woman came to you and claimed someone was harassing her by playfully poking her arm or side, always making comments on her clothes or makeup, you would shrug and say that he's just flirting with her, it's harmless. She's *telling* you it's not harmless. She's *telling* you she doesn't want it, that it makes her nervous and uncomfortable. Hence, harassment.

> the accuser is actually a victim, and the other person therefor guilty until proven innocent, you are begging the question.

In what other situations do we not believe the accuser is a victim? You're conflating two different parts of a process. We can fully believe the accuser is *a* victim and still have a fair investigation into the crime, including following up with any suspects, including those pointed to by the victim's statements. Believing someone is a victim does not mean we all have to believe the accused is guilty. This is a deflection argument.  
Note that the point from the list says **publicly scrutinizing**, not ""taking into consideration during the course of an investigation."" All we ask is that cases of reported rape be treated with the same seriousness as other violent crimes. But all too often they're disregarded, not followed up on (because officers will brush aside claims due to victims having been drinking during the incident, dating the accused, or any variety of reasons.

> I don't think I've seen a movie made by western culture in the last 60 years that applauded violence towards women. The abuser is generally [portrayed] as the villain.

The point does not say ""celebrated"" or ""heroic"" violence against women. It says gratuitous *gendered* violence. That is to say, violence that happens *because* the characters are women/girls. Of which there is aplenty. It doesn't matter whether the hero or the villain is the one committing the violence, what matters is that we live in a society in which rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse *of women* is a persistent feature of adult entertainment. *Mad Max: Fury Road* is a counter to this, because while the women in that movie are subject to and participate in a gratuitous amount of violence, none of the violence on the screen is exclusive to women (either giving or receiving).  
*50 Shades of Grey* is absolutely an example of abuse being glorified and treated as romance. It's also an example of how living in a culture of abuse can lead people (men and women) to believe that a relationship built upon abuse can seem desirable, even when it is not.  
Porn is a complex subject and I'm not going to get into it, but if you're honestly interested in it in any other sense other than to try to delegitimize feminism (i.e.: you're willing to see it with some nuance) then I'm sure Google can bring up some helpful websites.

> Our social norms are grounded in evolutionary psychology.

Evolutionary Psychology is mostly bullshit. I enjoy evolutionary biology a lot and read about human development from an evolutionary perspective quite a bit. The work most evo-psych folks are doing are [really just-so stories.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/17/it-aint-necessarily-so) Evo-psych tends to reinforce the status quo, rather than reshape our understanding of what our evolution has allowed us to be capable of. For example, most Evo-psych published by western (those based in the US or western Europe) tends to reinforce or provide “evolutionary” explanation for western cultural norms, despite the long history of many, many, many different cultures that look very different from our own. And there’s a place for that, it’s called sociological history. How cultures developed from what was there to what there is now.  
You criticize feminism for not understanding men’s perspective, but that’s a part of what the often demonized “3rd wave” of feminism is seeking to do. Intersectional feminism seeks to understand how the patriarchy affects everyone based on a huge range of identity markers, including the impacts patriarchal cultures have had on men.

> I've never heard this from anyone in a serious tone. I think women who are more sexually active have a higher risk of getting raped as they are more likely to run into psychos.

You’ve never heard it yet you’re making that argument in the very next sentence?  
Okay, a bit of a fallacy on my part, let’s address your claim. Why do you believe that? Is there something about sexual activity that puts women in places where “psychos” are? And how is this the fault of the women? If the “psychos” are going to somewhere they can easily prey on women, isn’t that still the fault of the so-called psycho?

> Being more sexually active generally means being exposed to sexual experiences you might regret after a night of heavy drinking/drug use.
 
“Most sexual assaults that are reported to the police occur between strangers. These assaults, however, represent only a small proportion of all sexual assaults. At least 80 percent of sexual assaults occur among persons who know each other (Crowell and Burgess 1996).  
[...]sexual assaults involving alcohol consumption are more likely than other sexual assaults to occur between men and women who do not know each other well (e.g., strangers, acquaintances, or casual dates as opposed to steady dates or spouses). Furthermore, alcohol-involved sexual assaults tend to occur at parties or in bars, rather than in either person’s home (Abbey et al. 1996a).  
[...][Although alcohol consumption and sexual assault frequently co-occur, this phenomenon does not prove that alcohol use causes sexual assault.](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-1/43-51.htm)”  
Your entire response to this, again, just goes back to feed into other points on the list. I honestly don’t even know how to unravel it without making an entirely new comment this length about just that.

> ...a persons lack of physical strength does make them more vulnerable to many kinds of harassment. That does not make it right.

Should we also hand-wave off murder victims or victims of aggravated assault for not being strong enough to defend themselves? Should we just shrug off elderly folks who are taken advantage of because of their declining mental faculties? None of it is right but, they are more vulnerable…  
The point is that men are assaulted who you would otherwise expect could defend themselves. Men like Terry Crews, where they are vulnerable not because they are weak, but because there is a social/political/financial power dynamic that puts them in a position where resisting and/or reporting doesn’t seem like a viable option.  
And, maybe if we can understand how some men are in that position, we can understand how some women are in that position, too, and we’ll stop asking questions like, “why didn’t she report when it happened” as though it disproves her account and start seeing it as a failure in the system.

> ...investigations still need to take place even if it risks offending the victim…

The overwhelming majority of victims *want* an investigation to take place. They want us to believe that a crime has occurred, and then to take it seriously enough to open an investigation. To process rape kits. To follow up on leads. If the victim says, “I got in a cab with James Jamerson, but I don’t remember much after that, I think it was him,” the cops don’t have to immediately charge JJ with a crime, but they should at least go pay him a visit.  
Think about it like a murder investigation. If a woman was murdered and her friend said, “we were at the bar, she got in a cab with JJ and I didn’t see or hear from her after that,” the cops would absolutely follow up on it. The internet would not be screaming about that statement meaning due process had gone out the window. *That’s how investigations proceed.*  
Victims and their advocates are not saying, “if we say it was JJ, put him in prison immediately!” They’re saying, “believe us when we say a crime occurred and treat it with the weight you would any other violent crime.”

I couldn’t find anything on Google about a university getting lambasted for teaching a self defense class for women. What I found instead were multiple articles from sources across the board saying that self defense is one of the best ways currently available to reduce on-campus rape and sexual assault, advocating for women’s self defense classes to be free at universities.  
What the point is talking about isn’t defense from assault, but avoidance of it. Telling women to monitor their drinking, their drug consumption, their dress, their company, etc. Assault and rape is wrong, regardless of the condition, attire or how well someone knows someone else.

When you tell women you won't believe them unless they come to you with multiple eye witnesses, remember every detail of that day, and don't have a fear of flying (or never ever get on a plane ever--jesus fucking christ), and argue because you didn't say something *sooner* you must be lying to say it *now*, you are 1) supporting someone who has potentially commited multiple acts of sexual assault and 2) enabling others to continue to do the same by discouraging people from speaking up and emboldening perpetrators who see how easy it is to get away with it (""even when someone says something they won't believe you, just shut up and enjoy it"")",DataIsMyCopilot,t2_17c3py3t,4,0,reddit4

I think about the men who did these things to me often and wonder if they've hurt others since. I wonder if my reporting could've helped put a stop to any of it.

If anything, it would've been worth it to face my abusers and make them squirm with fear and sully their reputations with my allegations, even if they didn't end up serving time.

That's fine, but that does not justify calling those cases rape. I see more and more cases where feminism tries to gain control of the power of speech and changing definitions. The ends justify the means. It's manipulative way to achieve the goal. Again, I can see someone pressuring you into sex to be an ass, but not a rapist. I don't disagree with the goal, but I believe the methods used only damages society and the feminists image.

&#x200B;

""*Are you telling a sexually explicit joke to a coworker who you know is uncomfortable talking to you (or anyone in the office) about anything sexual? Then that's sexual harassment.""*

If you are targeting that person directly with that joke I would agree. The person would also have to know about that individuals feeling towards those types of jokes. Where is the line between making someone uncomfortable and harassment? This is far too subjective to enforce a law over. It again is an attempt by feminism to gain power over speech and control definitions to achieve it's goal. 

If someone has post traumatic stress, the way you get over these fears is by confronting them. Similar to how you deal with people who have phobias. This is why psycho analysts use in [exposure therapy](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy.aspx). Although, given how it is exactly the opposite of what promoted among gender studies, I would think exposure therapy is not very popular in that field. You disassemble their fear by exposing them to those emotions, confronting them, and getting rid of that subconscious anxiety voluntarily. You don't make the world weaker, you make the individual stronger. This again gets twisted into victim blaming.  By avoiding your past trauma you are keeping that person naive, anxious, and often child like. Safe spaces might reduce anxiety in the short term, but only damages victims throughout their life. It's infantilizing , and coddling. You need to confront and push beyond that fear to heal and mature. It's simply a more pragmatic approach. 

&#x200B;

""*Hell, even your statement of ""unwanted flirting"" being part of the ""broadened"" definition of sexual harassment is a level of tolerance, implying that if a woman came to you and claimed someone was harassing her by playfully poking her arm or side, always making comments on her clothes or makeup, you would shrug and say that he's just flirting with her, it's harmless. She's telling you it's not harmless.""* 

I should have specified that by *""unwanted flirting""* I was only thinking of the verbal aspects of it. An invasion of physical space is unacceptable. That's where I draw the line. A lot of the fear and paranoia is caused by past trauma, and should never have happened. I do encourage people to accept partial responsibility for their own safety. It's not all one person or the other's fault. I don't think it's possible to create a utopian world where crime never happens, even though it's noble to try and constantly move in that direction. I think it's simply a  more empowering message to tell people they have some control of their fate, and that they are not just helpless victims. As I outlined above, this damages people.

&#x200B;

 *""Evolutionary Psychology is mostly bullshit.""* 

I think your criticism of it is mostly fair, and it does get used to justify human behavior too much. Maybe I'm guilty of that. But that does not justify throwing the baby out with the bath water, so to speak. I still think it holds up far better to scientific scrutiny than gender studies.

&#x200B;

""*You’ve never heard it yet you’re making that argument in the very next sentence?*  
*Okay, a bit of a fallacy on my part, let’s address your claim. Why do you believe that? Is there something about sexual activity that puts women in places where “psychos” are?""*

It's mostly probability. More interaction with men. And crazy men are more likely are more likely swarm to places where their chances are higher as you said. I think it often gets framed that having some personal responsibility for your own safety implies no guilt for men. This kind of feminism takes agency away from women. I should be allowed to run around in the shady part of New York city at midnight wearing gold chains and, and pockets full of my life saving. If I get robbed that person should go to jail and it puts no less responsibility on the criminal. But I still think I'm kind of stupid for having done so. Telling someone to not get blackout drunk at a university frat house to me is wise advice, not victim blaming. This relates to women getting self-defense courses as well, even though I can't find the the story of protests against self defense anymore. It might only be a small minority who were angry about those courses being taught. Lately the controversy has been around the [date rape drug tests](https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/1134401/date-rape-straws) (Come in finger nail polish or [drinking straw](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/05/27/whats-in-your-drink-the-straw-that-can-detect-date-rape-drugs/#38b131de6ccb)).

&#x200B;

*""Should we also hand-wave off murder victims or victims of aggravated assault for not being strong enough to defend themselves? Should we just shrug off elderly folks who are taken advantage of because of their declining mental faculties? None of it is right but, they are more vulnerable…""*

No, we should not hand-wave it away. Yes, they are more vulnerable, and strengthening a person in which ever way possible is a good thing. Everyone is more vulnerable than someone else in one form or another, and part of the solution is to give those people a little more power when possible. 

I think rape allegations should be taken more seriously, but with personal testimony (of people who over half the time are intoxicated) being the primary form of evidence it's difficult to get a conviction, even if the police spend a massive amount of resources investigating their time into these cases. They are probably disgruntled themselves following up on things that lead nowhere because it turns into a he said/she said thing. I have not heard of rape kits being refused because the victim is not being taken seriously. I have heard that a lot can't be done because it has been too long and would yield no results, and that roughly 1/3 rape kids do not get turned in by the victim because they are afraid of pursuing further action. The suggestion seems to me, that we put more faith on personal testimony than physical evidence when it comes to rape, because there is almost no hard evidence most of the time. I think this is a slippery slope.

Or talk to your boss if this happen to you.

Blame would suggest that since she didn't call the police it is her own fault that this happened to her and the guy got away. Blame would suggest that she is responsible for anyone else this guy might hurt in the future. THAT IS NOT WHAT ANYONE IS SAYING. Reporting just puts the guy in the system at the very least. Doing nothing doesn't.

Being realistic about police is assuming they are there to help you, not informing people that they likely won't care, get nowhere, or make any steps to help you regarding your case.  Always report if you feel you can and a crime has been committed against you.

Imagine if half the women that were victims of Bill Cosby filed reports with police? Even if nothing was done at the time, guess what would happen when it was brought up 30-40 years later? You would have filed police reports accusing him, clear written breakdowns in police process when handling victims of sexual violence, and information that you can use to rectify and possibly charge others that were involved in trying to cover up or downplay these reports.

It's just as likely (actually way more likely) that you would have reported and a case wouldn't even have been brought against your assailant. 

So, I don't really think anyone should be ""encouraged"" to report. If they choose to report their decision to do so should be supported and applauded, but statistically, it is likely that nothing will happen to your assailant, and victims need to be emotionally prepared for that, and consider this when making their decisions.

If your intent was really to point out that ""the fixes for rape culture can help all genders"" then your original comment would have said as much.

You’re arguing semantics when in reality, what happened is that she felt so unsafe and threatened that she’s never bothered to report any sexual assaults since then. You feel that being “right” about semantics is more important than how OP felt and how it’s impacted her life. 

Why you think making arbitrary corrections to someone’s story—missing the entire point—is more important than the impact is beyond me. But I don’t look favourably on people who are more invested in making a point than they are in supporting victims. 

It’s all about your perspective of “dense”, I guess. Some people, like me, view “dense” as people who set aside all human emotion and tear apart vulnerable strangers on the internet to prove an arbitrary point to support their own sense of self-satisfaction. 

Some people, like you, feel that “dense” folks focus on supporting victims instead of ruthlessly trolling them on an anonymous form to try to win points on Reddit.

we're talking about getting black out drunk over an extended period of times on multiple occasions. then you keep trying to confuse this topic with a run-of-the-mill court case or someone being overly judgmental at an office party

we are talking about serving on the supreme court. this should have a high barrier to entry, naturally. service on the high court is a high honor, with high standards. many, including you or i, probably are not fit. do you understand?

this is not ""nazi"" it is called character judgment

and your only response in this thread is continued mischaracterization of the facts. ie getting black out drunk continuously on multiple occasions over an extended period is just ""getting drunk"". or and confirmation for the high court is the same standards as a busybody at an office party or a run-of-the mill court case

I remember this happening to me a few years ago. I was a supervisor to a very unproductive employee who missed every deadline and couldn't be relied on for crap.

I gave him a deadline which he obviously didn't meet and I told my supervisors, who told me to just do the project, which I did.

Then, after my supervisors supervisor reviewed the project, he sent out a mass email praising the original guy who didn't do anything. Nobody in that chain corrected him at all.

Maybe the one of the most important principles of great management:  ""Share the credit, take the blame.""

I learned this early in my career over a fairly high profile rookie error when my manager fell on her sword in front of the leadership.   She could have easily blamed the rookie for not knowing better, but simply apologised for the error and promised she would not let it happen again.  She bought a lot of loyalty with that, and I made sure it really never did happen again.",alphagettijoe,t2_36s5h,37,0,reddit1

Knowing this, you may want to repeat an idea that was contributed by someone else in order to signal boost it and ensure it is not dismissed. In this situation, it's so important to get in the habit of naming the person you are signal boosting by saying something like ""I want to revisit the issue/idea that [person] raised.""

The goal was to take a random assortment of objects and create a vehicle of some kind that could make it the furthest across a table.  My team just hmm'd the whole time and then one said maybe we could use the straws for something.  Ok.  I had already done something similar for a preschool class so I decided that it was time to take over since I hate to lose and really didn't want to be the only team with nothing to show.  I constructed our vehicle and demo'd it in front of everyone and yay, we won.  The boss asked who created the design and why we went that way and as I was about to take credit, my male teammate stepped up and took the credit while explaining my idea.  And no one corrected him.  WTF?  In this case I did correct him but I'm pretty sure everyone thought I was being petty since its just a ""fun"" team building activity.  That still pisses me off, and from then on I refuse to participate in any more team building at work.  I'd rather my team lose then steal my ideas.  And I never share my work with anyone.  I avoid giving copies to my bosses to reuse when I leave because I'm so jaded from my life experiences of others taking credit for my work.

That original position you were put in by your other colleagues is basically untenable for anyone.  You can't speak up that it was actually your idea, or you are seen as petty and selfish.   Staying quiet is pretty much the only thing you could do in that situation, and it's what I'd do (unless you can do something somewhat indirect that indicates you were the one to come up with the idea like talking about how the idea was generated, but that runs the risks of being seen as manipulative).  The fact that that was happening to you is just an indication that your prior team had a terrible, competitive culture, and the only success those teams tend to have is in their own minds.  


What your colleague is doing is actually really great for himself and the rest of the team: sharing credit makes you seem secure, and it also helps everyone feel a part of the team. Whenever I'm in similar situations, I try to give/share credit as much as I can: it helps everyone take ownership of their parts of the project as well as helps gain support for the good ideas: the more people who are associated with the idea/work, the more support you all have in making it happen.

She told me a good manager (leader), will give credit to others. So at the end of a project, she'd send out a mass email announcing the project completion recognizing the key people who worked on the project. Generally everyone would be named and their unique added value would be highlighted.

She was mentoring me to be a manager myself and told me that it was important for us to give our reports and those who worked hard the branding and visibility so that others would know their value.

Storytime, unrelated to sub but it needs hearing, I hate harboring it.

Back 2 summers ago, my buddy throws out this idea that would, while complicated to initiate, would be highly efficient and bring a level of understanding to our teams that had never been reached. It would simultaneously make our teams more self sufficient, resilient under major changes, and get each team member to the same page in a week or less.

Getting it off the ground was a matter of simple logistics, and we worked in an analytics team, so no biggie.


They told him that it would not be possible. Full stop. 


He and I were shocked at the short-sightedness. (halcyon days of youth) he said fuck that. He did all the logistic legwork. Checked with every team member, several dozen. All cool with it and enthusiastic. Took it to a team lead. Lead took it to management again. They are still reluctant but ask the lead to take on the task. Lead is like 'cool, no work needed, all T's crossed, just execute the plan, all the preparation has been done.

Management sets a start date. Covid hits and we have to start 3 weeks EARLY. Goes off without a hitch, managers collect credit for the plan like it's going out of style. My buddy gets the smallest annual raise (cost of living raise) he's ever seen.",underworldconnection,t2_nopum,1,0,reddit1

When someone did something that my boss came out of the office to give kudos on I made sure to name exactly who was responsible for that. My boss seemed shocked I did that and my staff looked surprised that I quickly pointed them out for their own idea.

And you know what happened because of that? They all spoke up about their ideas to make improvements. They all came to me with their ideas to see if we could make it work. And daily tasks were just streamlined and more efficient. They buddied up to figure out how to make things work. They got super creative and my department went from being one that struggled a lot to not needing much supervision. 

Now if it was a major fudge up or just didn't work guess who took the blame? Me. I gave it the greenlight and I took full responsibility for it not working. Because I didn't want my staff to feel like they should be afraid to come up with ideas.

Once, at another job, a male employee complimented me at the expense of another female coworker. It made me uncomfortable and I called him out on it and said, ""This is an insurance office; not a beauty pageant."" He apologized.

My takeaway is this: when I wasn't ""pretty"" to men, women didn't feel any need to compete with me. We coexisted peacefully, and they were kind to me. But when I was considered ""very attractive"" women felt it WAS a competition. Women were rude to me and saw me as a threat to them - whether it was a threat to their job, their relationship, or simply their own ego, other women started playing games and I stopped trusting women, which sucks. 

 I hate to say it but based on your description, you and this beautiful woman at your workplace are not even in the same race. It's not a competition for her. 

Straight men can say and do whatever they want to us, but we can't blame them for how we treat each other.

I'm stuck in this very paranoid and afraid place. Just being friendly and having a pretty face, in a male dominated workplace, means men smile at you, go out of their way to talk to you, assist you, be up in your business and try to do your job to ""help"", but when shit hits the fan it's like you're invisible. Your experience is null. You're still in the room, but you're not part of the conversation. Then the drama begins, the expectations, you get upset and put your foot down, somebody else has a conniption about it, and it snowballs until you wish you'd never said anything at all.

If I vent in a women’s space, it becomes super misogynistic against me because apparently life is just easy mode if you’re pretty? I’ve been raped and sexually assaulted so many times by so many different men. I had three jobs at one point and quit one of them because a colleague wasn’t respecting boundaries and being weird despite the huge age gap. I want to quit my second one now because my boss in that has progressed to touching me a lot and stating that he wants me to stay later. I don’t want to quit, I love my students. A lot of men, especially incels, will just say it’s no big deal and that I’m a whore or something for being pretty. Most women I deal with say similar because they’ve been led to believe that we all have to compete for the male gaze like for fucks sake, you can have these pieces of shit if you want it. I already have a partner and even if I didn’t, the idea of competing to be in the spotlight of people who won’t respect boundaries is disgusting. It’s honestly more infuriating hearing it from women and believe me, I hear it all the fucking time. These are definitely the same women who consider their daughters a “threat.” It’s tiring. 

I am constantly violated all the time, physically amongst other ways, even when I’m out with my partner. It is physically exhausting and almost no one fucking gets it unless you also get “pretty privilege.” News fucking flash people, pretty privilege isn’t some fucking gift.

I used to be a bigger girl, never did makeup, not ugly, but very plain and not the most attractive type. Size 12 and up since I was 9-10 years old, never was asked out type of teenager. Never thought it was a big deal or impacted me much.

Then I got an insane GI disorder that made it impossible to eat properly and became underweight within a year and a half. Almost got a feeding tube, it was scary as hell and people were essentially complimenting me on my diarrhea/malnutrition lmao. (As a side note, doctors can be terriblely unconcerned with overweight women with legit issues and I have permanent effects from this getting pushed off). The way men started treating me was noticeably different after getting to a size 8. I eventually turned into a twig before doctors did anything because I looked healthy.

 I got more recognized for going the extra mile at work. Male coworkers would make more sex jokes around me than they ever did after knowing me for years. The boss took more notice and I was given two raises in that year after working there for 4 years. People straight up come up to you more often in public over whatever conversation starter, which is scarier in some situations being a size that can be overpowered easily.  I also got wayyyy better tips than my other male coworkers. It was so noticeable it became a joke to have me run front counter or take me on delivery because it literally generated cash. That part was funny as hell to me. It was so alarming to me how people started acting different, even though I was technically more useless than I ever at work because of the new health limitations. Like, I could lift more before, have to stop less before, and straight up worked faster, but none of that really mattered. 

Even now, I still am a wee bit underweight, and I think that's what got me hired as a host at my new job (there was a bigger girl interviewing the same day that was more qualified and she wasn't hired) because all my coworkers are are VERY attractive and slim.

I saw your post history and look, I’m sorry that you feel the way you do about yourself but the solution isn’t to hate other people or to hate pretty people or whatever. Getting into a relationship shouldn’t and should NEVER be the thing that defines your self worth and gives you self esteem. You are badly hurt and you are taking it out on other people. I’ll let that slide because you’re hurt but that’s not okay. I mean this kindly, seek therapy because it’s not healthy to think that way about yourself. 

Secondly, I have gained weight on and off. I’ve been underweight, overweight, fine, super thin, super muscular, etc. I’ve always been very attractive regardless of how much I’ve weighed and I’ve always attracted unwanted attention at all of those stages in my life. Being overweight did NOT hinder that at all for me. I’m unconventionally attractive as it is already, (not tall, white, etc.) but that has never been a problem for me because quite frankly, I’ve been told my confidence and intelligence are what really draws people and my confidence does not depend on male attention. If people are attracted to me solely on looks, they’re not people I want in my life anyways so I don’t care. That’s superficial and personally not something I’m interested in. 

As for being ugly being my worst nightmare…no. Just no. Like I said, I know you’re hurting so I’ll let it slide but that’s so wrong it’s funny and a little insulting. Like I said, my self worth does not depend on the male gaze. My self worth depends on being a successful, intelligent person who has a positive impact. My worst nightmare would be something like getting into an accident and becoming a vegetable shell of who I was. My worst nightmare would be not succeeding and being one of the best in my fields. My worst nightmare would be being permanently disabled and therefore, unable to ever be a professional in my fields. Those are nightmares that genuinely keep me up at night.

I highly recommend dialectical behavioral therapy. That might be pretty helpful since it centers around the idea of acceptance and that literally everyone is going through something but we need to actively work on ourselves. 

I did not always have validation that I wanted. I was rejected by my parents after being molested when I was 8 by one of them. I’ve been raped and sexually assaulted by two different men on top of that. I don’t care for male attention because I know majority of the time, it is never positive. It takes a special kind of disconnect from reality for you to acknowledge that and still go, “ugh, but being ugly is so much harder than being raped and assaulted.” Again, seek therapy instead of taking your unresolved issues out on random people. I am a person too and I don’t deserve to be on the other end of your baggage. 

I’ve gone to therapy. I wanted validation for absent and abusive parenting. I went to therapy and resolved my issues by channeling it into a healthier way; by throwing myself into work and becoming well respected and a professional at what I do. 

You talked about waiting for attention. Again, try therapy because your thoughts are deeply unhealthy and not good in the long run or the short. I can get into hours long research and studies by established doctors in psychology and sociology on why it’s not okay to center any of your self esteem on one area but that’s not going to help you since you’re determined to believe you have it harder than anyone else in the world despite the fact that a lot of this thread was just about the problems with the male gaze.

c779ov1,t3_13tr7o,2012-11-27 01:21:53,TwoXChromosomes,"Sexual assault is such a tricky subject because people still equate rape with sex. The thought process is: Romo is a cute, young, probably charming guy with the world at his feet, lots and lots of girls would want to have sex with him, so why would he need to sexually assault someone? If he looked like a bum, people probably wouldn't question the girl's account. If he was a trollish-looking old man, people probably wouldn't doubt the girl's account. People do, however, doubt a young, attractive man's willingness/ability to sexually assault people the same way they would doubt the veracity of a claim that a millionaire participated in an armed robbery: the millionaire doesn't have a motive people understand because he certainly doesn't need the money, so that lack of understanding gives rise to doubts about his participation at all. Nevermind he may just get his jollies by robbing someone or brandishing a gun, just like a person committing sexual assault may just be doing it for the power dynamic. Do you immediately jump to calling the store owner a liar? Or do you report the facts that you have and try to investigate further to find more *facts* rather than editorializing out of your ass because you like the sound of your own voice?

I have no idea what the solution is to the wider issue of doubt when it comes to allegations of sexual assault against attractive, charming young men, but the important thing is that people, especially those in positions of authority, should not immediately jump to questioning the girl's story without any good reason to do so beyond ""it is theoretically possible."" Good on this journalist for standing up to a far too-often used journalistic ploy of ""reporting the controversy"" or ""telling both sides,"" regardless of whether there is a single fact to support the other side.

The piece in question was poorly argued but it made one good point: No matter how you slice it, this story is a tragedy.

I really wish it were possible to prevent the names from getting out to the public. Just to make this point: This guy's name and picture is on the front page when he gets charged. If he gets found guilty, front page. In the event that he gets found innocent, months or years later, that story will most likely be in the back of the paper. Even if it makes the front page, his reputation is still tarnished. And the victim, she has to endure the publicity, the gossip, and of course accusations that she's lying.

It is very tricky territory suggesting the victim isn't being truthful. It made me think, at what point do you suggest and lean towards that decision? In all seriousness a false rape charge is a really difficult thing to prove and a grim reality that does occur. It's unfortunate because it is damaging to real victims and the system in place to prosecute real criminals. It isn't so far-fetched that people do this and do it more often than we'd like to admit.  
  
. Also I find it odd that she'd come home and her parents wouldn't notice anything when she came home. It is something that is distressing and very difficult to hide emotionally, especially immediately afterwards. I'm not saying she wasn't raped nor that it is unusual for something to be reported a day or two afterwards. All I'm saying is that, especially for a girl so young, it is really odd no adults in her life noticed something was wrong following the incident. I can understand the position that St. Amant may have constructed. Where I disagree is that she used her position and power to publicly express it. It was premature to do so, unless she had sources within the police department which felt that way. Detectives can usually tell when someone is lying.   
  
Truth is there isn't enough protection for people who are falsely accused and become the victim. Nor are there significant laws in place to punish those who falsely accuse someone. So with dishonesty and a good motive, one doesn't have much to risk with a false accusation. I believe it is an under addressed issue. St. Amant was wrong in doing what she did. She has power and saying something like that based on how you feel from a couple of odd facts in the case is misjudged. She should have kept it to herself or used a source in PD who had reason to believe the girl was lying. 
  
Thing is with rape, we seem to forget innocent until proven guilty. It is understandable too. Why would someone accuse someone of such a heinous crime without reason? How could someone want to be a part of that group of victims, discrediting them. There are a lot of hows and whys. We all know how extreme and disgusting the crime is. It is hard for us to fathom saying, “but wait...”How could we potentially deny someone who has gone through what they went through. I'm not saying we should but if the situation warrants some suspicion there is no reason we can't take a moment to not so quickly judge the accused. It is a difficult situation but we shouldn't forget how the legal system is set up, it is done so in good faith and with good reason.  
  
Please don't think I'm insensitive. I've worked with victims of rape and sexual assault firsthand. I find it revolting. I also find a false accusation equally revolting. I wrote most of this before I remember it was on the net and I could look it up. If she told her mother about it, it is really odd she didn't report it right away. More than likely it was a consensual situation. It still constitutes rape since she was underage. It's disturbing that someone may use the situation for personal gain though. From what I read it sounds like they waited until they had those recorded conversations before reporting it. You wouldn't feel like you needed additional evidence if you felt like you were raped. I think she would have went immediately to the police. It just seems odd.

All a woman has to do is say she was raped and the guy's life and career are potentially ruined, even if it never goes to trial.

Eh, obviously Romo has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; that's true both in a legal sense (we shouldn't lock him up until we can prove he's a rapist beyond a reasonable doubt) but also in a moral sense:  We shouldn't just assume he's a rapist based on an unsubstantiated accusation.

But here's the thing:  Lying about a rape is also a crime, and that same presumption of innocence applies to the girl as well.  She's not currently (and will probably never) be subject to legal sanctions, but she is very much at risk from the court of public opinion.  And just as we shouldn't assume Romo is a rapist, we shouldn't assume she is a liar.

Yes, only one of the two people can be right; either Romo raped the girl, or she's lying (let's ignore the possibility of some shade-of-grey confusion over consent, for the moment).  Yes, we need to presume Romo is innocent, and yes, if he is innocent then the girl is *not* innocent.  But we also need to presume the girl is innocent.

Yes, there's an inherent tension between two competing narratives that (probably) both can't be true.  Yes, it's tempting to resolve it by giving only one of those narratives a presumption of innocence, but that would be very very wrong.  **Innocent until proven guilty applies to everyone.**

(And that's why neutrality is so hard - yet so important - in rape cases.  It's the same situation as when self-defence is claimed in a homicide case.  In most crimes, the argument is about who committed the crime; in cases of rape and homicide in self-defence, the argument is about whether the alleged crime even happened, or if instead a completely different crime was committed by the alleged victim on the alleged perpetrator.  It leads to incredibly vicious attempts at character assassination waged in the media; witness the coverage of Treyvon Martin and Zimmerman.

The tone and additional content would be most instructive.

Strikes me that the report the OP is objecting to is simply assuming the alleged rapist is innocent (but asks in the headline if he's guilty and considers it in the body text) and so by extension asks if the alleged victim is guilty of lying. Both conditions seem valid.

The OP doesn't appear to be as bothered that the alleged perp be falsely accused as if the alleged victim is. That looks like partiality to me.

Sure, there's room for doubt, but the speculation is the thing that's really the problem here.  The correct thing to do is to neither say ""Oh, but there's a chance that she's a tart and nobody ever noticed before"" nor ""Oh, but there's a chance that he's a serial rapist and nobody ever talked before"".

Rape culture?  Victim blaming?  Those are why you almost always see that first kind of speculation, and almost never see the second.  That's the biggest reason that it's important to speak up when this kind of thing is done, because it's *never* in support of being even-handed and fair to the accused.  Being fair to the accused is not assuming that they're guilty.  Being fair to the accuser is not assuming that they're a liar.  You *can* do both at the same time.

If you want to be properly skeptical and fair to both parties, just don't speculate in the absence of facts.  State the facts, and move on.  X has been accused by Y of sexual assault.  Period.

The ""innocent until proven guilty"" bit means you don't sentence someone until convicted, and you don't assume that because he's accused or rape he must have done it.  It does NOT mean that because he isn't convicted yet you have to view evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant while being automatically skeptical of the accuser.  

When a court doesn't convict the Defendant of rape, it's not saying he DIDN'T do it, only that the factfinder in his criminal case could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that he did it.

From Wikipedia's entry on [Negativity bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)

>People retain the impression of information rather than the features of the information. Also, since negative experiences and memories are more distinct in one’s mind, they are retrieved more rapidly and therefore more easily accessible.

What this means in real life is that the headline ""Muttmonster accused of rape"" what people remember is there is an association between Muttmonster and rape. They don't remember the not guilty verdict. And all of this based purely on one persons accusation. If I believed all first-person accounts of things I could believe that aliens probe people and Sasquatch exists.

So the problem with just reporting the facts is that either side can pick and choose the facts the want to report, and this is where logic and rational thought start to break down.

This is a poorly written article to begin with. Nothing should be published until he's found guilty or not-guilty in court. The author of the article seems to be saying that if the girl is not telling the truth then Romo would be suffering more than most people in his situation, which is true.

I need a source for this, and a clear definition of sexual assault. Is having ones ass grabbed a form of sexual assault in that definition? What if it's one child to another? You said ""lifetime"" so that doesn't exclude children touching each other in ways that are inappropriate. 

>Very few rape allegations are false.

Yeah, I hear that a lot, but I never see consensus on it. The Kanin study found that 40% of allegations (this is counting from reports filed, not trials begun) were made with the knowledge that they were false.

Wikipedia claims that the FBI consistently states 2%, but that's not in the citation given, which mentions only forcible rape, so it seems to me that someone just made that up.

The largest study (that I know of), reported 3%, but that had an entirely different methodology, and I have no clear definition of what they mean by false accusation. They also show that 22% are recorded as ""no-crime"" though I personally do not know what they mean by that. I assume they mean that someone reported something along the lines of ""I consented but regretted later"", though I admit my lack of information there.

I believe that the studies finding numbers less than five percent count only accusations which are proven false after a trial has already begun, but this seems disingenuous, since even before trial the accusation, and the name of the accused are made public.

The range on studies goes from 2%, all the way to 40% (I discount the last as statistically insignificant), and it is probable the variance is due to different definitions and methodology, rather than huge variance in the population.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Rumney

If we wish to understand or interpret this data, we need to ourselves what the incentives and consequences are for falsely accusing someone of rape.

If you accuse someone of rape on a college campus, you can sue the university for ""creating an unsafe environment"". Wanetta Gibson falsely accused Brian Banks of rape, and was awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in a lawsuit with the university.

What are the consequences of falsely accusing someone of rape? None, as far as I can tell. I know of no case in which a falsely accused individual has successfully sued the accuser for slander or defamation, despite the often irrecoverable damage to their reputation. Nor do I know of any recourse against universities which expel students based on false accusations.

Rape shield laws prevent the name of the accuser from being made public in many cases, so there's little public backlash, and the greatest amount of legal punishment is a fine for filing a false police report.

Given the incentives and the dearth of consequences for falsely accusing someone of rape, would it not make sense the number of false reports of rape would be uniquely high among violent crimes?

The study didn't simply classify cases without enough evidence as false. The study was careful to only count accusations that could thoroughly be proven as false. 

6 percent may not sound like much but they represent very real people who have their lives ruined by false accusations. Even the ones who don't get convicted often have their names tarnished in their local community. 

To put that 6 percent in perspective you should consider that gay Americans only represent about 6 percent of our population. Just because they aren't a huge percentage doesn't mean they don't deserve laws protecting their human rights. Names of the accused should be withheld by the media until the trial is over. The case will still be held in open court, but the media should he barred from reporting the names of either party. 

I personally think he names of accused should be withheld by the media for every crime, but it's especially important in rape cases due to the huge stigma associated with them and the relatively higher rate of false accusations compared to other crimes.

c778xvz,t1_c7788p4,2012-11-27 00:37:02,TwoXChromosomes,">*It's very rare for someone to make it to rape someone and not have any prior incidents.* //

76 out of 120 men (63%) determined by the assessors to be rapists were also assessed as multiple rapists. That means that according to their figures about one-third of rapists are single-act rapists. I would not classify that as ""very rare"" amongst the group of those assessed to be rapists.

I think your citation disproves your assertion.

Now, your citation does support the position that ""it's rare to be raped by someone who hasn't raped before"". This is because the 63% of multiple-rapists, according to the study, account for vastly more rapes than the remainder [the single-act rapists].

To elucidate the point lets consider some shootings: M shoots 100 people; N, O, P, Q shoot one person each. It's rare to be shot by someone who has already shot someone else - only 5 (4.8%) out of 105 victims fit in this category. However out of those who shot people 80% hadn't shot anyone else. So you can assume a victim was shot by a multiple shooter and be mostly right but if you assume most shooters are multiple shooters then you're mostly wrong.

 = = 

For background the citation refers only to male rapists and doesn't state the sex of the alleged victims. They use a paid anonymous question method to assess alleged rapists, the questions IMO leave much to be desired as far as clarity goes but they are attempting to get college aged men to admit to rape (and violent behaviour) without realising it so the questions in a way need to be inexact. 

One of the particular issues I'd have with the validity of the paper is that one of the questions assumes that if a person that the subject [survey responder] had sex with was intoxicated [drunk  or high] then that was rape and it is the subjects fault (though we don't know from the paper if they too were intoxicated) for not realising that proper consent may not have been possible. To me this is a source, in a college environment, for a *potential* massive over-reporting based on the assumption that sex between a male and female who're both drunk is an act of violent sexual aggression of only the male.

The paper appears to have an agenda, some of the language indicates a bias. I'm not familiar with the journal it comes from is it peer reviewed?

The figure doesn't distinguish women who were genuinely mistaken from ones who were knowingly falsely accusing someone.


Wihout DNA testing many of these primary suspects might well have been convicted. Many men convicted of rape before DNA testing was available have since been exonerated when the Innocence Project paid for the dna evidence to be tested. There would likely be even more people found innocent but many cases did not have any valid dna left to test. 


I'm not claiming that 25 percent of rape accusations are false accusations, because the FBI data is based only on cases where DNA testing was referred to the FBI. It wouldn't be fair to draw sweeping conclusions from that study, but I do think a false accusation rate of about 5-7 percent seems pretty likely. Keep in mind some of these women may be genuinely confused as to who there attacker was and may have mistakenly accused someone who the police suggested as a suspect.

Here's a study published in 2010 by Dr. Lisak that determined 5.9 percent of rape accusations at a university were verifiably false. Dr. Lisak is a reputable researcher on sexual violence and had no agenda in finding false rape accusations. The study was based on ten years of data and only counted cases as false accusations if the case was followed up on and significant evidence existed to suggest the accusation was false. Cases that merely couldn't be proven were not included in these stats.

Five to seven percent may not seem like a whole lot but to put it on perspective consider that five to seven percent is about how much of the population that gay people represent. Just because 5-7 percent isn't huge doesn't mean the people who fall into that figure shouldn't be protected. We shouldn't deny gay people he right to the just because they only represent a small percentage of the country, and we also shouldn't protect the five to seven percent of people accused of rape who may be innocent. Their identity should be protected until they are found guilty in a fair trial.

>The accuser can't be lying, because a crime has been committed.

No. The accuser can't be lying that a crime has been committed (assuming that a crime has, in fact, been committed). However, they most certainly could be lying about who committed the crime. 

> For example, someone's been murdered. The accuser (if there is one) is obviously not lying because, hello, there's a dead body right there.

The person that tells the police that there has been a murder is not the accuser. The person that tells the police ""Mike did it"" is the accuser. Maybe that person just doesn't like Mike. Maybe that person did it and is trying to make Mike take the fall. The point is that you assume what that person is saying about Mike is false first and then you have an investigation. 

>Or money has been stolen - money is missing - so obviously the accuser is not just making up a crime.

Well they could be. Again, the accuser is not the person that says a crime has been committed. The accuser is the person that says ""Mike did it.""

>The only thing left to prove is whether or not the accused is the one who committed the crime.

Not necessarily. Let's take a look at your murder example again. What you first need to prove is if the corpse was indeed murdered. Are there abrasions, stab wounds, bullet wounds, broken bones, etc. or did the corpse suffer from a stroke, heart attack, etc.? 

>The accuser can't be lying, because a crime has been committed... so obviously the accuser is not just making up a crime.

I've got to address this again because the naivety of it is unfortunate. People will say that a crime has been committed when there has not been. There are people out there that run up thousands of dollars on a credit card and then say their card was stolen. In this case, a crime has been committed but it was not theft. It was fraud. [Here](http://wnyt.com/article/stories/s2650065.shtml) is another example of someone saying a crime was committed when there hasn't been. This is why the proper protocol is to first establish that a crime has been committed and then establish who committed it.

No, and this is why these kind of posts bother me. I'm automatically a misogynist if I point out that some people lie.

Furthermore, I'm comparing a crime to a crime. All crimes should be treated the same. Same burden of proof (did she go get a rape kit?) as well as the same presumption of innocence. 

The vagina (and the money) aren't the point. Everyone has money, and everyone can be robbed. The point is that there has to be evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was not only committed but also that the person responsible is on trial. 

As somebody who has been raped, I understand how difficult it is to talk about. That said, everyone needs to be treated the same in the justice system, and one can not have that if there can't be questions about the accuser's motivations or truthfulness. 

Therefore, there should be a full investigation, and the media should be allowed to say whatever they want with the information they've gleaned. That's how a free society works. ",graffiti81,t2_4wta4,-3,0,reddit3

I'm just trying to figure out the law, which I should probably research on my own.

Barring gross malpractice, a high preponderance of evidence against the accused, and a likelihood that the suspect will commit a crime again, I don't see much reason not to presume innocence when someone has been found not guilty.",kellykebab,t2_55xlf,2,0,reddit3
c786ud6,t1_c77jsp7,2012-11-28 19:25:07,TwoXChromosomes,"To those interested, the ""1996 FBI report"" is [here](http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/dnaevid.txt).

I was curious about a source for that statement, and a little Googling found that report and [this op-ed](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,194032,00.html) that lists that report as well as a few other sources for varying statistics.

Keep in mind, like others have stated, that *false* claims are not (always) the same as *fake* claims.

>The category of 'false accusations' does not distinguish between accusers who lie and those who are honestly mistaken. Nor does it indicate that a rape did not occur, merely that the specific accused is innocent.",zomgie,t2_4lu45,1,0,reddit3
c77oqke,t1_c77jsp7,2012-11-27 20:40:15,TwoXChromosomes,"I *do* agree that a fair trial won't happen in the media. I absolutely find intentionally false accusations to be repugnant. I just find it worrying when the media tries the accuser.  I currently work with survivors of sexual assault, and the specter of those women who do frame men makes it much, much more difficult for some survivors to be taken seriously, especially in date and acquaintance rape cases.

Thank you for that information. I've seen that 8% statistic get passed around, and brought up over and over on Reddit. I've never actually encountered anyone who went beyond what wikipedia offered, let alone used scholarly research. 

I do want to emphasize that *some* of the false accusations within that 5-7% statistic aren't those of women attempting to specifically frame someone, which is the narrative that is often presented when rape and rape culture are discussed. Eye witness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Memories themselves can be changed over time (each time it is remembered the neural pathways change slightly, and in stressful situations they can be significantly changed and create an altered memory). When threatened with a weapon the tendency is to focus on the weapon, not the person holding said weapon. And sometimes the police are *sure* that the wrong person committed a crime.",Bajonista,t2_6jeik,0,0,reddit3
c77g3om,t1_c77bhnq,2012-11-27 09:16:31,TwoXChromosomes,">This statistic is almost meaningless, as many of the jurisdictions from which the FBI collects data on crime use different definitions of, or criteria for, ""unfounded."" That is, a report of rape might be classified as unfounded (rather than as forcible rape) if the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect, if the alleged perpetrator did not use physical force or a weapon of some sort, if the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries, or if the alleged victim and the accused had a prior sexual relationship. Similarly, a report might be deemed unfounded if there is no physical evidence or too many inconsistencies between the accuser's statement and what evidence does exist. As such, although some unfounded cases of rape may be false or fabricated, not all unfounded cases are false.

It's *right under* the 8% figure.",sinthe,t2_592v3,7,0,reddit3

c77al8p,t1_c778zsh,2012-11-27 02:15:16,TwoXChromosomes,"> The point is that you assume what that person is saying about Mike is false first and then you have an investigation.

Do you know how arrests are made? I can't just say so and so stole money from me and have the police arrest them without an investigation or any sort of procedure. The only way police make an arrest is if there is reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has done something unlawful. They would probably check whether or not that person has my cash, or debit/credit card, or whatever (and that I actually have money missing). Also, in a LOT of cases, eyewitness evidence (i.e. ""I saw Mike do it"" or ""From this lineup, I saw #4 do it"") is valid and admissable. Obviously they will look for evidence to back up that claim, but eyewitness evidence is very powerful on its own. And with most crimes, like murder, theft, grand theft auto, arson, etc., chances are very high that no one actually witnessed the crime or, if they did, they didn't get a very good look at the criminal - yet eyewitness evidence is still considered valid evidence in those cases. No one says ""well are you sure Bill stole money from you? Are you sure you didn't just give it to him and regretted it later? Are you sure that you haven't given him money in the past, so he thought he could just take money from you forever?"" NO ONE EVER SAYS OR PUBLISHES ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS. Maybe they think them; I don't know. But it's not normal discourse when a theft is committed.

In one of the few crimes where the victim is ACTUALLY likely to know who the assailant is without a doubt (because it's very likely that they are a friend/family member/acquaintance and they are pretty up close and personal for a long period of time), suddenly they get asked all these questions about the validity of their claims when eyewitnesses to other crimes don't. You get mugged in the street from some dude with a mask and you report it, nobody questions you when you try to ID him later on in a lineup. Nobody is like ""are you sure you're not ruining this dude's life?"" You're not just not going to report the crime. If a crime gets committed against you, and you view a line-up, and you see someone who resembles the person who committed the crime very closely (because maybe you didn't get a good view, or don't remember exactly what he looked like), are you just gonna be like ""No thanks, I don't want to point anyone out; I wouldn't want to ruin their life""? Leave that up to the police. If there's no evidence (or even if there is), his life won't get ""ruined"".",owlsong,t2_3lma7,2,0,reddit3

This is a subtle difference but an important one for understanding how our legal system works.  

""innocent until proven guilty"" does not mean we assume the accused is telling the truth unless we have other evidence to the contrary, or that we assume the victim is lying without other evidence to corroborate her story.  ",j0y0,t2_61cwx,-1,0,reddit3
c77k48s,t1_c77dyo1,2012-11-27 16:21:15,TwoXChromosomes,"False and unfounded mean essentially the same thing. Just because an accusation is false doesn't mean the accuser made the false accusation with malicious intent. They could have simply been confused as to what happened or who attacked them. 

A false accusation is an accusation that turns out to not be true. 

Here's a decent study published in 2010  by Dr. Lisak, a reputable researcher on rape that found 5.9 percent of rape accusations at a university turned out to be false. They only classified accusations as false if there was significant evidence suggesting it was false. They didn't just classify any rape accusations that couldn't be proven as false
