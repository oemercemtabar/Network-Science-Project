We also need to acknowledge that living alone this day and age is an absolute privilege that not everyone can afford, so to say you can only reach your full potential if you happen to have this certain privilege just kind of rubs me the wrong way. It‚Äôs up to each individual woman to determine what her own full potential looks like and how she can reach that for herself, regardless of circumstances that may be out of her control. 

I‚Äôve lived alone and I loved it. I‚Äôve lived with roommates and I loved it. Now I live with my partner and I love it. I can honestly say I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúdependent‚Äù on my husband now, nor did I feel dependent on my roommates when I‚Äôve had them. Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have another person around, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be in your own space. That‚Äôs not dependence, that‚Äôs choice. Of course I am affected by the people around me and by my partner. We are evolved to be social animals who live in a society; we affect people just as they affect us. Thats neither good nor bad, it just is. I can still ‚Äúfigure shit out for myself‚Äù while also acknowledging that I‚Äôm both being acted upon while also being an actor in society. 

You put forward the question at any point in my life when I was around other people, could I have thrived in a setting controlled by myself? The answer is yes, I could have, but I also thrived in those situations surrounded by others. Having roommates didn‚Äôt control/ manage me, I adapted and compromised and that was 100% within my control and my choice to do. I chose that because I wanted pleasant relationships with the people around me, not because I needed validation or because I was being controlled. I find having good relationships fulfilling and meaningful so I‚Äôm willing to invest in that and compromise within my relationships. 

I can definitely agree that a lot of people (particularly women) might benefit at certain stages of their lives from the increased self-reliance and independence that comes with living alone, and that when we go through certain struggles by ourselves we can come out stronger in our own sense of self because of it. That being said, I disagree with the statement that a woman can‚Äôt meet her full potential without living alone. There are benefits to living alone, just like there are benefits to having 8 roommates at a time just off campus in university.

There are huge benefits for this approach, for the record, the happiest people are basically single childfree women. Because there is no substitution for quiet focus.

I have had this privilege for a good chunk of my life. It allowed me to make mistakes, learn to recover from them. To seek higher education. Develop as a professional, become skilled as a musician outside my profession.

Again it also turned me militantly childfree and anti-traditionalist. But I see that as a benefit because I ended up fully knowing myself rather than letting the world define me.

I relate this to my point because I think that women at a very young age feel like they **need** a relationship so they end up looking for the wrong people to fill that spot but when a women knows she can live by herself and sustain herself and live a happy fulfilling life she's so much more likely to only settle for a partner that meets all of her standards.

Like we are all individuals with brains and passions and likes and dislikes and talent and skill but for hundreds of years they were just like fuck that and gave all women these chores and duties that aren't unique or satisfying and are mostly repetitive like cooking and cleaning just to suppress us from channeling any sense of creativity. 

It reminds me of another metaphor in A room of one's own where Woolf describes an idea as a fish that you throw back into the water to grow but before it can grow it is interfered.

kp54hoa,t1_kp3lxt5,2024-02-06 05:49:54,Feminism,"Hi, thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate your fresh perspective :)! 

Firstly I want to say that it wasn't my intention to insult you or any woman with this post so I deeply apologize if you felt like the strong language targeted you in a negative way. 

I also want to say that I completely agree with you that women can thrive in different settings. I also completely understand that financial dependance is a privilege that not many people have and I hope it didn't come off as tone deaf to say. 

I would say that in your case it's not at all about dependance as you were clearly financially independent with your roommates :). I would say that a big part of my argument (which you addressed) is the fact that we're influenced by the people around us. Environment takes up such a huge part of our psychology. I definetley agree that you didn't seek validation or feel controlled by your roommates. I just mentioned the roommate thing to reiterate that I meant women should live completely alone at some point in their life, which it looks like you did :). 

While I agree that there are specific benefits to living with others you will always be affected by it. Like if your roommates had a specific taste in music you might be influenced by their taste in music, if they felt badly about something you may inherently start disliking the same thing. Meaning that you might unconsciously be seeking validation from them if you disagreed with them fundamentally or politically you would likely not be as open about it to keep the peace. 

This can't happen if you're living alone. You don't have to worry about pleasing people at all. In any sense of the word. Only pleasing yourself. Even in the sense of labeling your food for example so no one takes it by accident. that is an act you do for the sake of others that you're living with, to uphold manners and respect. 

But what if you were by yourself and you were like fuck the manners and everything else that I've been taught. You leave a mess until you feel like you have to deal with it. You don't have to compromise on plans. On furniture. You don't have to clean anyone else's shit you don't have to quietly compromise when you don't want them making noise or you don't like the furniture they're buying because you chose everything in your home and you choose how to live your life and allocate your time. So you choose to allocate your time and money in yourself and your career consequently meeting your full potential.

Honestly though one of the main things is that I think that women are so smart and have such complex minds that go far beyond their relationships. 

Sure, you should try to find community and friends and go to work and socialize and go out. But when you get home you should actually be at a level of comfort and relaxation that feels like home. So many women go to work and work their asses off just to get home and try to please as many people as they can and then do a bunch of bullshit house chores because that's what they were taught. 

Another important part of my narrative is that in this time alone women should develop their education, hobbies, and careers. Shit that they usually lose once they have a family. You just wouldn't have to sacrifice your time. You like movies? go to the movies. You love knitting? start knitting. You're a bookworm? join a book club. You love working out? join a gym. And definitely find communities in all of these things. 

It's not about staying within a comfort zone and isolating its about a woman finding out who she is, outside of the family she was born into, outside of the family she will marry into, but who she is, what she loves and for her to do what she loves and learn to be okay with herself.",poe293,t2_tdqm9j80d,3,0,reddit1

Unless we are to fully isolate ourselves, we‚Äôll always be influenced by others to a degree. We‚Äôll always have to compromise on some things and adapt our behaviours to coexist with others. That‚Äôs what living in society means. We still have to work, we still have friends and we still have romantic relationships (if we want them) when we live alone. 

I also disagree that we cannot reach our full potential unless we live alone for a while. I would even argue that, in some circumstances, living alone can be detrimental to reaching our full potential. Whether we like it or not, living alone is more expensive. It requires more of our financial ressources. The added expense means that we may have to sacrifice or make some compromises on our goals. It can restrict our ability to travel, participate in some hobbies, take risks, save for retirement, etc. 

In your OP, you mention your cultural background and the fact that middle eastern women are expected to go from their parents‚Äô home to their husband‚Äôs home. I think this background may play a bigger role in stifling women‚Äôs independence than simply not living alone. It‚Äôs the underlying expectation that women‚Äôs lives should serve others rather than themselves. 

I grew up with a completely different background, where living alone as a woman is absolutely normal. I was raised with the expectation that I would be financially independent and that it would be my choice to live with someone or not. I wasn‚Äôt expected to stay home until such time as I was in a long term relationship, let alone married. In fact, I and all of my close friends have lived alone at one point or another. 

Do I think there‚Äôs value in living alone? Yes, absolutely. For both women and men. I believe it teaches self-reliance and fosters independence. Do I think it‚Äôs the only way to achieve this? No. Just like I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed or even doable for everyone.",couverte,t2_br888,5,0,reddit1

Financially it's not possible for people to live alone at some point. But what I'm saying is if you have the opportunity and privilege to, you should take it. People can choose to live alone and don't because it's harder but the pros outweigh the cons. And maybe reading my other replies will help you understand what I'm saying. 

I understand that people are influenced regardless of their living arrangement. My hope is that when a woman leaves work, social events, whatever, where we have to uphold the people pleasing ladylike tendencies that have been ingrained in our mind, we can go home and live truly and authentically. And more importantly, comfortably. 

It doesn't mean not being completely influenced but so much of your life is spent at home. It defines what your life is like at that point in your life. 

The concept is like a safe haven. We can all acknowledge that we aren't truly comfortable around other people. Not as comfortable as we are alone. There are certain things we're just embarrassed or weirded out doing around others that we would be fine doing by ourselves. I think building a home for yourself where everything in it is a reflection of you and you have control over your own life is crucial to finding out who you are. 

I think we can agree that things like social media and outside pressures push women into the pressures that make them feel like they need to be in a relationship. So we look for relationships and companionship in the wrong people and we end up tolerating and sacrificing a ton of our own standards. But if we live alone and build a life for ourselves **before** getting into a relationship we realize that it's not something that we actually need and are more likely not to settle. 

also I wasn't personally raised with those middle eastern norms but I know that in my culture that it's not normal for a woman to live alone. and yeah obviously it's an independence thing?

Don't you think you are perpetuating victim blaming when you say things like ""These are women with agency over their situation and would be livid at the notion that they are in any way victims""? Given the fact that men don't care about women's consent and independent prostitutes/porn actors/camgirls can also suffer from male violence. What's wrong with victimised women that one has to be livid if someone compare them with the victimised women?  Your agency is meaningless or delusional if you feel comfortable enough to disparage victimized women even though the only difference between you and the victimized women is that you haven't yet experienced male violence on men's whims. Or has it occurred to you that men who buy sexual consent/pics from your friends, don't care about your friends' agency? Are you sure ""petty woman"" culture is not responsible for your friends' perceived agency?

Also porn industry is legalised and there are unions of ""sex workers"". What makes you think that legalising a legalised market will solve all problems? And how on Earth a sex workers' union consisting of porn boss and pimps can actually help?

Evidence? 

If anything after legalisation in Germany and Netherlands exposed the level of violence and sex trafficking, pimps are now advocating for NZ style decriminalisation model which completely legalise sex buying, grant more freedom to pimps than legalisation model and partially criminalize prostitutes. In post decriminalisation NZ (a country with more sheeps than people), more than 5 women have been murdered by pimps/Johns, one girls had been sex trafficked 1000 times, teenagers are being referred to as underage sex workers by officials. According to New Zealand government¬†report, ""the majority of sex workers interviewed felt that the [act of decriminalising prostitution] could do little about violence that occurred"" in the sex industry. The 2009 murder of Hungarian trafficking victim Bernadette Szab√≥, who was stabbed to death in a legal brothel in Amsterdam's red light district, illustrates that being in a legal brothel is no guarantee of protection against violence. Furthermore, although the crime happened in a supposedly regulated zone, nobody has been held accountable either for her murder or for her trafficking. Numerous femicide of women involved in sex trade took place in Netherlands and Germany (famous for legalised and unionized sex trade and there's little difference between NZ model and German model. NZ model just grants more freedom to pimps). A report commissioned by the New Zealand government, confirmed that most people in prostitution ""felt there had been no great change"" in their access to health services and information since decriminalisation, and key informants ""were not aware of any substantial change in the use of safer sex practices by sex workers as a result of the enactment of [the law that decriminalised prostitution]"".  Dutch government¬†report¬†found that the emotional well-being of women in prostitution ""is now lower than in 2001 on all measured aspects, and the use of sedatives has increased"". It is a commonly-held assumption that the legalisation or decriminalisation of prostitution reduces stigma towards the women involved.¬†However, government and academic reports from¬†New Zealand,¬†Australia, and¬†Senegal¬†have shown that this is not the case. In¬†Victoria, Australia, one service provider noted that ""women constantly tell us that their status as having done prostitution is used against them"".¬†In¬†New Zealand, a government report noted that ""abuse and harassment of street-based sex workers by drunken members of the public is common"".It is difficult for legalisation or decriminalisation to remove - or even reduce - stigma towards individuals in prostitution, as these approaches do not address its inherently exploitative nature.¬†The status quo is maintained and reinforced because legalisation and decriminalisation give support to the unjust power relationship between a woman and her buyer.¬†Conversely, despite purchasing use of the body of another human being, the buyer of sex is not stigmatised at all by such approaches.¬†This helps to sustain a system, where the woman in prostitution continues to be subordinated, stigmatised, exploited and inadequately protected from harm, while her buyer is given virtual immunity.

T

No actually there's very little difference between decriminalisation and legalisation model. Here's why: ""In discussions about prostitution laws, a distinction is often made between ‚Äòfull decriminalisation‚Äô and ‚Äòlegalisation‚Äô, with the latter defined (by the NSWP) as ‚Äòthe introduction of laws that aim to impose state regulation and control sex work‚Äô. This is something that the NSWP vehemently rejects, opposing ‚Äòall forms of criminalisation and other legal oppression of sex work‚Äô as well as limits on ‚Äòhow, when and where sex work happens‚Äô. New Zealand is commonly the go-to case study of a fully decriminalised prostitution regime, repeatedly invoked as an exemplar by the Open Society Foundations in their report ‚ÄòTen Reasons to Decriminalize Sex Work‚Äô (2012). It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that New Zealand doesn‚Äôt actually meet the criteria of a fully decriminalised regime. There, local authorities can impose limits on prostitution advertising as well as where brothels are located, while women who sell sex are breaking the law if they fail to adopt safer sex practices. In New Zealand, which adopted its so-called decriminalised prostitution regime in 2003, brothels with four or fewer people selling sex from them don‚Äôt even have to apply for a licence before opening. Brothel-keepers operating larger outfits have to get a certificate, although, consistent with the hands-off ethos advocated by champions of full decriminalisation, there is no ongoing inspection system. A government-commissioned review of the country‚Äôs prostitution laws in 2008 even quoted one brothel-owner complaining that licences ‚Äòare too easy to get. I‚Äôve lost confidence in the system. I used to be a car dealer and to get a licence was really hard. For this, there is no training, no interview, no asking what you know. What‚Äôs the point?‚Äô Ostensibly, the point of New Zealand‚Äôs 2003 Prostitution Reform Act (PRA) was to ‚Äòpromote the welfare, occupational health and safety of sex workers‚Äô. Its advocates managed to persuade parliament that this would somehow be best achieved by making brothel-keeping legal, applying minimal certification requirements to brothels, and conducting minimal monitoring. What the law‚Äôs official review uncovered in 2008 only highlights what a thoroughly ludicrous proposition this was. A survey of those paid for sex in managed brothels found that, in the previous 12 months alone,¬†38 per cent ‚Äòfelt they had to accept a client when they didn‚Äôt want to‚Äô. Also in the past year, 5 per cent of those who solicited on the street and 3 per cent of those in managed brothels had been raped by a sex buyer. The conclusion drawn by the evaluators was: ‚ÄòGenerally, brothels which had treated their workers fairly prior to the enactment of the PRA continued to do so, and those which had unfair management practices continued with them.‚Äô One of the big myths about fully decriminalised and legalised prostitution regimes, wherein the sex trade is treated as a legitimate part of the economy, is that women who sell sex can no longer be criminalised as a result of their involvement. Yet once the law recognises people who are paid for sex as workers, rather than as victims of sexual exploitation, it brings them into a legal framework with do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts ‚Äì responsibilities as well as rights. In New Zealand, it means that women in prostitution are breaking the law if they fail to adopt ‚Äòsafer sex practices‚Äô, the maximum penalty being a fine of up to NZ$2,000. Crucially, it also means that, unless a woman is issued an employment contract by a brothel, she is categorised as an independent contractor and shoulders significant responsibilities under health and safety law. As the committee set up in 2008 to evaluate New Zealand‚Äôs prostitution regime points out, failure to fulfil these responsibilities can have what they term ‚Äòserious financial consequences‚Äô for her. As a contractor, rather than an employee, she takes on additional duties under tax rules, while being denied basic entitlements such as sick pay or the right to pursue a personal grievance action through the courts. When the New Zealand committee assessed the impact of the Prostitution Reform Act, they found that women in brothels were classified as contractors rather than employees as standard practice. As in New Zealand, local restrictions can be imposed on the prostitution trade, which here in Stuttgart means women soliciting on the street can be fined up to ‚Ç¨3,000 and even imprisoned. So now, with a fine to pay as well as their expenses as ‚Äòindependent contractors‚Äô, Constabel explained that the women simply couldn‚Äôt afford to be away from the brothels for long: ‚ÄòThey have to at least earn the rent for the room."" 

When they talk about decriminalisation model, they talk about NZ model.

A woman with no higher education (including even high school) will have an immense amount of trouble leaving, getting a job, getting her own paperwork, gaining custody or access to any children she may have had, and may have trouble advocating for herself or even knowing where to start because she has been deliberately deprived of the resources to do so.

As the men DO have these resources, it also increases the divide that the woman is a very separate entity.  She can't understand his world or those higher functions because she's a woman, it's not her role, and she clearly isn't up to snuff or she'd be able to understand her husband.  It's of course, by design, and she's more than capable if she'd been allowed to progress her education past the 4th or 8th grade.

It also means her 'role' as wife and mother will start sooner since she doesn't have college or career to worry about, which means as soon as she starts having kids, the ownership over her increases and now there are small hostages around to keep her in her place.

k3ludzv,t3_170dnjr,2023-10-05 18:01:21,Feminism,"Equality for women benefits men (World bank blog):

Research on women, peace, and security provides strong evidence that women‚Äôs empowerment and gender equality are associated with more peaceful and stable outcomes (see figure 1). Such findings include:

Violence against women is a predictor of whether a society is generally prone to violent conflict.

The larger the gender gap (defined as the differences in experiences and opportunities between men and women), the more likely a country is to be involved in inter- and intrastate conflict and to use violence as a first response in a conflict setting.

The higher the level of violence against women, the more likely a country may be to not comply with international norms and treaty agreements, and the less peacefully it will operate in the international system.

Higher gender equality corresponds with a country‚Äôs lower likelihood of using military force to resolve disputes with other countries.
The severity of violence used in international conflict decreases with higher gender equality.

Countries with low human rights standards, including low standards regarding gender equality, are more likely to have militarized and violent interstate disputes.

Including women in peace processes has a positive impact on the durability of peace agreements, which thus prevents conflict from reoccurring.

Including women as negotiators, mediators, signatories, and witnesses increases the probability of an agreement lasting at least two years by 20 percent, and the probability of it lasting at least 15 years by 35 percent.

There is a positive relation between the participation of women‚Äôs groups and peace deal results. When women are less involved, agreements are reached less often, and the likelihood of reaching an agreement is even lower when women groups are not involved at all.

States with higher female participation in the labor force exhibit lower levels of international violence, and are less likely to use military force to resolve international conflict.

Countries with 10 percent of women in the labor force compared to countries with 40 percent of women in the labor force are nearly 30 times more likely to experience internal conflict (see figure 2).

If men and women participated equally in the economy, the results would add up to US$28 trillion, or 26 percent, to annual global GDP by 2025.

k3maao1,t3_170dnjr,2023-10-05 19:34:51,Feminism,"Your question's answer falls at the intersection of patriarchy and capitalism as oppressive systems. What I mean by that is that keeping women under control benefits both systems. Let me explain:

Would it be beneficial if women had degrees and could join the workforce? Sure, maybe. But is it more beneficial to have women stay at home and provide free labor for the nuclear family? For sure.

When women are at home, they are not just sitting around, they're cleaning and cooking and organizing and running errands. They take care of the children and make sure to fill in for any responsibilities the father may have towards his children. But where's the husband in all of this?

Well, he's at work, able to work overtime, on the weekends, go on long business trips etc... and thus providing more value for his boss to make him richer. And if you think about how many families out there have this system implemented, you can estimate the amount of profit this makes for the system as a whole. But when women work, they either end up working less hours because they have to prioritize their children, or they choose not to have kids at all, which is a BIIIIIG problem for capitalists.

You see, capitalists *need* their working force, they cannot get rich without them, they also need that same working force to be able to buy what they produce, and the less people you have, the less money you're gonna make. This is why Elon Musk is obsessed with the idea of having many children, not for himself of course, I think that's just his ego wanting to spread his ""precious seed"", but when you see him saying people should have more kids, it's because it isn't good for him and his fellow billionaires to have low birth rates. 

The issue is that, while anyone has the capacity to *produce*, not everyone has the capacity to *reproduce*, and while capitalism controls *the means of production* , patriarchy controls the *means of reproduction* . That's women, and yes, sperm is needed but at the end of the day, only bio females are capable of creating life. And if we lived in a world where women are in control of their bodies, a world where access to abortion was legal and free and easy to attain, a world where rapists were severely punished, a world where birth control was readily available, capitalism would not benefit much.

Enter patriarchy, which teaches women that their value is in their ability to have children, encourages them to marry young at the peak of their fertility, instead of getting a job and having financial independence, creates a divide between women, by shaming the ones who refuse to adhere to these norms, and discrediting them any time they try to warn younger girls, by calling them bitter old hags who want you to be just as sad and miserable and lonely as they are. And many other tactics to further this agenda.

And what this creates is a group of women who see no value for themselves outside of their reproductive system, who cannot escape their husbands because they don't have money of their own, who will most likely end up raising their daughters in the same way, giving you an infinite glitch of brainwashed women who will just pop children for the machine to keep using and abusing.

So yes, they may make some money if there were more people with disposable income, but in the long run, if you run the numbers, you'll see that one option is more beneficial to the system than the other. And that's why anti abortion laws are going to get worse, and no fault divorce will be under attack, and LGBTQ rights will be threatened. They want to create a particular world, and they have the money and power to make it happen. And they'll stop at nothing until it's achieved.",afafe_e,t2_3bk8fvgk,8,0,reddit3

Lots of Korean women decided to stop participating in the culture that saw them as just tools of men to procreate and instead claimed their independence. By economic point of view, South Korea is booming, but the cracks in the facade are showing, the country is looking at a serious problem because men do not see women as equals.

The issue with Japan is even more serious, as the whole racism issue leads to a rejection of foreigners/immigrants coming to the country to prop all the gaps that are being created by an aging population that is not having children, again, because lots of women are deciding to go their own way instead of being seen as a household appliance or a child factory by a society that also abuses them constantly.

In the west this has shown to a lesser extent as immigration does fill the vacancies that the lowering birth rates and aging populations cause to the economy.

I'm a man myself, the conversation from this side is exactly what other people here are describing. These men don't se women as people, they have absolutely no respect for them. They don't want a partner, they want a submissive living fuckdoll.
This sort of dynamic only serves to create even more tension and resentment between the genders. Talking points like ""all women are prostitutes, they just have different prices"" or ""prostitutes are better than a relationship because you get what you want, but cheaper"" are becoming increasingly popular among young men.

I find this sort of dynamic revolting, that's why I'm against paying for prostitution, for example. Then again, good luck trying to convince other men to have some ethics above their pleasure...",McRezende,t2_70jpyjxl,18,0,reddit2

They see selling themselves for a man with money as a powerful choice.  Sadly, it leaves them with less power, not more.  Those who benefit from all of this?

Thing is, I've been with my partner for over 12 years. We've had our ups and downs, but he's one of the better dudes I've ever met in my life, genuinely caring and kind and a solid partner that is so loving to me.

My mother has had plenty of opportunities to date, but she has such a warped view of what a man is supposed to be (a bottomless bank account, a ""provider"" that will care for her) and struggles with being an asshole herself so can't even play the act of the accommodating woman to keep these types of men Op describes around, because the quiet part they don't say out loud is that men like this do not view you as a partner/person.

Raising standars is always good thing. Ironically I got higher standards from working as a stripper.

I am speaking about the hardcore very transactional mindset that is common amongst sex-workers that now is being teached to young girls, young girls that can't separate between the two and now willingly put themselves in situations (with older and very manipulative men that have been in the game way longer)

I believe sex-workers have alot of wisdom to share and certainly for ""older"" women that want to settle down but we have to be able to make the distinction between the two and what alot of sex-workers in any form don't tell you is that: Being a sex-worker is like playing with fire. Sex-work is sex-work  at the end of the day. No matter how much we dress it up as ""having a sugar daddy or provider"" the men don't view it as that way. And that's what makes it dangerous.

Personally I really like this solution as for a lot of people it makes it practically invisible without nearly as much maintenance if you don't shave, and that makes it a much easier step in the direction of accepting body hair. I have extremely hairy... Everything and pretty fair skin and this is honestly such a nice solution because it's also kind of pretty since the blonde hair glistens in the sun or for the less hairy makes it almost completely invisible and that's why it's seen as pretty and popular in Brazil to my knowledge. You can look it up on tik tok if you want some references on what it'll look like. For anyone wondering, yes it does also work on dark skin tones. You would get more of a glitter effect if you do it but it also still lessens the obvious appearance of it significantly since a strong bleach on such short hair close to the body makes it easier to go white ""see through"" blonde than yellow blonde. 

I think this kind of subtle shift in attitude (it's pretty but more practical) would be a great step to normalizing body hair and I'm hoping it'll catch on while not making people have to endure the entirety of societal stigma while people still have the ""hair is gross"" attitude. Personally I got my body bleaching kit and I'm going to try my arms, my tummy, and the upper half of my thighs since I haven't shaved those in a really long time/ever and those are my biggest insecurity areas. Not to mention they're way cheaper than razors, you don't have to deal with bumps or have the ingrown problem like I do (my hair is also extremely fast growing and slightly curly), and the whole process including waiting takes maybe a half hour to 1hr from what I've seen. I would like to bleach the bottom half of my legs as well and just shave my armpits but unfortunately I have shaved my legs recently so maybe I'll try that next year.

Women having hair on their bodies should be normalized and not frowned upon. I have dark hair so it'd be noticeable if everything was grown out. I've always shaved since I entered middle school because of a couple kids that made not so nice comments to me, and because my mom engrained it in my brain that this is just a thing women do. My mom still shaves her pits, but not her legs. I still do it now because it's just what I prefer personally. I don't mind hair on other men or women, but I just personally don't like it on myself. I just like how being shaved looks and feels... I love wearing dresses in the summer and I know the types of looks I would get if I had hairy legs and pits. I don't even like the feeling of being stared at either...

I know my husband doesn't care either way, but he at least prefers me to shave my face, and he does like smooth skin. I also have hairy arms but I choose to never shave them because it'd be more often than I do my legs, and course he's fine with me not shaving them. My husband is also Bigender/Bi, and with his preference to smooth skin, is why he's attracted to femboys and not really masculine hairy guys. But when he's wanting to be feminine himself, he will shave his own body, his legs, face, chest/belly, genitals, pits, and anywhere he can reach. So it's not like we aren't equal in that sense. And I enjoy the feeling of him whether he's hairy or smooth.

I'd love to know the feeling of never shaving again, but it's just something I personally don't prefer. I don't even do it often enough anyway for it to be an annoyance to do. I let it grow out until it bothers me enough, but I do dislike having hair on my belly and my boobs. I do say though for those who don't want to ever shave again, GO FOR IT!

""Let's pretend that in the last few weeks there have been several sexual assaults on women after dark on campus grounds. Come up with a way to solve this problem and back it up with your reasoning.""

One guy in the class raised his hand and said, ""We should just enforce a curfew on all women so that they can't be out after dark. That way they'll be safe at home where they can't be attacked.""

I immediately shot my hand into the air and retorted, ""Why don't we set a curfew on all men that they have to be home after dark? That way women can walk around campus without fear and any man caught outside will be assumed to be a predator and arrested.""

Obviously, both suggestions were ridiculous and that's what I was trying to point out. At the time his suggestion filled me with indignation and rage but I laugh looking back on it now.

So many men seem to think of women as being servants, caregivers, sex objects, object to prey , objective derision, etc. etc. etc.

It seems outrageous to a number of men to simply treat women as being equally deserving of dignity with men 

The only way I can think of that things might change is if more and more women start regarding relationships as completely optional, and maybe not even desirable 

Because so, many men are so badly behaved or so careless or so entitled 

If men don‚Äôt choose to commit violence against women, or regard women as things to be subjugated, then they‚Äôre only other choice if they want to have a woman in their life is to be pleasing 

But I know a number of women who‚Äôve given up on being pleasing or fair or respectful, or anything like that some of whom put decades of caretaking into the project 

They‚Äôre not going to deal with manboys anymore 

If men want respect from women, they need to give respect to women 

And the kind of respect they give has to satisfy the woman the man‚Äôs criteria our secondary here 

If they don‚Äôt choose to satisfy women with a quality of their behavior toward women, then women have a right to just not have men in our lives 

‚Äî-

I think a lot of the problem is it men kind of grew up, believing that they would always have access to having a woman in their life to provide caretaking, servitude, placidity, housekeeping, pleasing temperaments, docility , and sex

And many men grew up, believing it was fine to disrespect women to make jokes at women‚Äôs first expense to cat call or demean or insult women, and it was supposedly all in good fun, and women were supposed to be fine with it 

Now a fair number of men are shocked to find out that women just don‚Äôt see the value in them as potential partners and want nothing to do with them in their personal lives

And that many women are skeptical that bringing a male into one‚Äôs personal life even has a payoff that‚Äôs valuable to the woman 

Men used to like women fine when women were good sports, and were willing to be in second place all the time, and never have the authority and we‚Äôre always trying to be pleasing 

Perhaps women would like men, if they were always being docile, and pleasing and amenable, and willing to always take second place

Having said that:

By rolling back Roe v Wade, allowing women to die of sepsis and preventable deaths due to removing even emergency abortions, and now incarcerating and proposing the death penalty for women who have abortions (and sometimes miscarriages), this new American landscape is Taliban-esque indeed. The only reason for all of this brutality is to oppress women - not save lives like they claim.

American government also allows child marriages to occur all the time. Do the minimal amount of research on this topic.

Things are regressing in America,  and the influence of the Red Pill, the Alt Right, Andrew Tate (who actually pushes for Talibanization of the West very overtly).

The person you are arguing with didn't even say there is no difference, they are saying there are a lot of commonalities.  The Taliban serves to remind us of how bad things can get if we allow the current male supremacy forces in the West to gain power.",homo_redditorensis,t2_b34sv,1,0,reddit4

So this is a quota, right?

If coaching is limited for one gender but not the other, the coaching will give more knowledge to the gender that gets less limited coaching, right?

So this will obviously result in women ""with reservation"" getting in with even lower test scores than before. They will get to college with less prep and knowledge, less qualifications. They'll work harder to graduate or graduate with less knowledge.

Also, rich women will get private tutoring because the access of the rich to tutoring will not change, while poor women will disproportionately score lower because their access was more affected.

That said:

-police got the address wrong and are not liable for that piece.

-the judge said ‚Äúok‚Äù to go in unannounced, making the interpretation of the crash at the front door open to, well, anything...and the cops are not liable for either requesting or implementing this lack of announce prior to entering

-the police decided to serve their warrant at 1am, again no accountability or legal liability for this decision


To recap: unannounced group of men crash through the front door.  Resident, who would normally be well within his rights under castle doctrine, wakes up, grabs his gun, and opens fire.  Police return fire, hitting Breonna 8 times (out of 20), killing her.  A woman is now dead and to add insult to injury the man trying to defend hearth and home is charged with assault on a police officer.

Let‚Äôs say no gunfire happened and they entered the house, said oops, and left.  They would not even be accountable for the door, doorframe, or anything burned/damaged by flash bangs or gas thrown in ahead of them.

This ‚Äúqualified immunity‚Äù is bullshit.  This entire encounter escalated from horrid decision making and never should‚Äôve happened.  If they‚Äôd been accountable, then maybe things would‚Äôve gone down differently, starting with the front door.

This is to say nothing of the broader justice system which these protests can't fairly be expected to try to address as unfortunately it's just not as viscerally horrifying as a child being shot or a man being choked to death when a black or brown person is sentenced to years whereas a comparable crime may get months, weeks, probation or even being let off with a warning at the enforcement level for a visually identified white person.  

&nbsp;

I say not just because if somehow it were possible for everyone to be equitable to generic white guy or girl there is still way too much acceptance and lack of accountability for when officers act in violent ways.  I don't have the right answers and I try to listen as much possible when I'm not amplifying those trying to reach a better future, though my worry is that schisms within movements can be exploited by those who want to restrain progress or even roll it back.  It's important to build coalitions and to utilize the political energy to do as much as possible for all of the people victimized.  Breonna Taylor and her surviving boyfriend, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery(which involves a retired policeman and his son), Atatiana Jefferson....too many names to adequately recount, and in *some* cases there seems to at least be the hope of some kind of justice seen like with Botham Jean(though it would be nice if all these people were still alive rather than people pursuing some kind of modicum of relief after the fact).  Even further, there are countless people arrested, ticketed, have their property taken under the guise of asset forfeiture who might not rise to the level of outrage currently being felt but are no less important to be ground out of institutions and individuals as an acceptable par for the course.

&nbsp;

I guess I just worry that if the facets of people are too narrowly focused on it will only bring people in targeted communities up to the level of white people when situations like Daniel Shaver's murder or the women raped by police officers while in their custody, white or otherwise, show that that standard of treatment is not good enough for any of us.  :/   Hopefully there's enough energy and political will to get things to a much, much better place than they are now.",Tynictansol,t2_4dqz9,1,0,reddit1

It strikes me that we as a nation are saying black girls are not children when we fail them in this way. Just as we say black boys are not children when we shoot them for playing with toy guns. Only white children are afforded a childhood and seen as innocent children, depending on who hurt or killed them and how much power and privilege they have.

EDIT:
Women intersect at the places where we are objectified by people,  systems and institutions. 

Black women and brown women have a hundredfold burden of that patriarchal, paternalistic, and proprietary bullshit of old white dudes who feel entitled to all of our labor. 
 
Right now, in June of 2020, it is all about BLM, and the subtext is last month's headline: Covid-19. It ain't over. Wear a fucking mask. No matter what your political views are, do this to show your neighbors you do care about public health. Then wash your hands, and go make money, because the more of us wearing masks, the more businesses can open.

We share this time. Make it matter no matter who you are. Be for the future, and for the benefit of everyone. Corporations are not people, money is not speech. Your neighbor is not your enemy. Be a decent human and treat everyone like you want to be treated.  

Insist on accountability of the police and politicians. Hold them to the same standards as anyone else you would hire to do a job.",puss_parkerswidow,t2_8663g,43,0,reddit1

Derogatis had initially received and then submitted the tape of Kelly having sex with a 14 year old girl.

>The saddest fact I‚Äôve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody. They have any complaint about the way they are treated: They are ‚Äúbitches, hos, and gold-diggers,‚Äù plain and simple. Kelly never misbehaved with a single white girl who sued him or that we know of. Mark Anthony Neal, the African-American scholar, makes this point : one white girl in Winnetka and the story would have been different.

>No, it was young black girls and all of them settled. They settled because they felt they could get no justice whatsoever. They didn‚Äôt have a chance.

It's crazy for instance when people can bring up R Kelly as an example of cancel culture when he should have been fucking cancelled two decades ago. He married Aaliyah when she was just 15 and made an album called ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"". Everyone knew he was a pedophile who lurked around Chicago playgrounds to find another victim, and yet he kept performing and getting invited onto talk shows and performing at festivals etc. Society only cares about black women when it's all up in your face and you can't ignore it, but if you can ignore it, then the abuse and harassment that black women face goes under the carpet.

Every round of interviews had its own ""description"" and none of those descriptions was a perfect rundown of the ""job description,"" which due to this being a last minute referral from someone in the department, I never received.  

Let's just say the C-level interview bombed horribly.  Older male exec, asks me to recite the job description, when I can't do that verbatim he screams at his assistant to get me a printout of the job description, but once that was handed to me, he quickly berates me for wasting his time and essentially sends me on my way.   Needless to say, despite everyone else really wanting to bring me on board, his word was final and that was that: no job. 

I was informed by my referrer that it was the CTO's last week in office before retiring, and he happened to ""dislike"" female IT professionals (""he thinks they are incompetent"") and his incoming replacement was a woman so I'm sure it was a sour point if he was involved in her onboarding.  They admitted I probably would have been hired if they just held off on the interview until the new CTO started, but they needed the position filled and I assume onboarding c-level people are busy so that would have taken too long.

iswlcce,t3_y7f5aj,2022-10-19 06:00:19,Feminism,"Yup. I was a level 2 of a creative PM role and found out I made 2k less than a college grad with virtually no experience by comparison. He was hired a year after me, so technically I made $6k less when I was hired compared to him, but was STILL BEHIND after a GD promotion. Even worse, the white guys on our team were invited to visit clients or offered gifts, while my Latina teammate was asked to show her LinkedIn profile to prove she has the chops to do the same job. She also made less money than me, a white woman. Oh, and one of the head managers was a walking sexual harassment lawsuit who was allowed to do whatever he wanted. This was a job I was sad to leave because I really enjoyed the work and the clients. 

I was replaced by a white guy at the next company I worked at. I wanted to move into a new career, but they claimed they didn't have that title in their system so I was given the next best title. They had no problem finding the title I wanted and giving it to the guy they hired to replace me. Not only was I laid off nearly on the day of my 4 year anniversary, but I was also required to design the flyers for employee appreciation week because I had designed them every year before. My last day was before the celebration though, so I didn't even get to participate. I hid ""fuck you"" in binary code within the design. I was also pretty miserable at that job because my 2 teammates we're boomers who knew each other and complained all the time about millennials - I am one - so that felt super welcoming. It was very cliquey and I couldn't get anyone to go on lunches, even the women. Worst culture I've experienced. 

The next place I went to, there was one white guy PM who was so notorious for being difficult to work with that they were rotating people in my all-female team to find someone he would listen to. I had the misfortune of being added to this project. My female colleague was fired for not getting enough work done on this project, while COVID was in full swing and she had two kids to manage at home, mind you. I was fired 6 months after her. Do you know who this white guy listened to? Another white guy they hired back who had worked on the team previously. It was like fucking magic! That guy was a total arrogant douche too. Only one woman remains from a team of 5 and he's the one who got promoted to manager after the previous woman left. I kind of wonder how she sleeps at night since she was a big part of getting both of us fired. She was the first person to bail from that project because of that PM too. 

Fuck the tech industry. I started my own business after this last layoff and I hope to God I never have to go crawling back to it. I'm so tired of all the bullshit.

I don't actually mind the culture. I'm a geek by nature so I kind of fit in there, though I understand that it needs to be more welcoming to people who don't fit in that box. But Jesus, the rampant sexism was too much to handle.

iswwd88,t3_y7f5aj,2022-10-19 08:35:22,Feminism,"I have worked in multiple companies, and was always the only or one of two women on the team, with the entire company being heavily male-dominated. I'm very feminine and it has not been an issue in being hired. Being taken seriously by the team has also been okay, but I have been lucky to have good team members so can't speak for the general situation. However, I've also been hit on by senior (married) team mates which has led to uncomfortable situations.

Every time I interview I ask about the team and the company's gender ratio, and I think it's a good question to ask! The response tells you a lot about the culture. It also reinforces to the hiring people that having a good gender balance is beneficial for recruitment. Ask the team members if possible, they will be less likely to have a canned answer.

Keep your distance from work colleagues - don't be too friendly, don't hang out one-on-one. Even if they're married or at a different stage of life. In fact, especially then! People say this a lot and I didn't really listen, but I learned my lesson. On that note - make strong connections with colleagues outside of your team, throughout the company. Find out what issues they have that you can help with. Especially seek out other women.

I would aim for more established companies, not smaller start-ups, at least to start out. When I had an interpersonal issue in a startup, there's not much you can do except tell the C-level who are not always going to be helpful. In a big company, if you have a good line manager, this issues can be dealt with. Obviously they can also not handle it well, but there's a better chance I would say. When I had the above issue with the senior colleague, my line manager went above and beyond to help according to what I wanted and was comfortable with. There's also the possibility to switch team or office.

I do want to add that being a woman in a male-dominated team can also be advantageous. I was able to pitch product ideas that would really improve the experience of female users (who our customers were actively trying to target!) that were relatively simple to implement but had not been thought of before by the all-male teams. Huge benefit to the company, big feather in my cap.

Additionally, if your employer is making a big deal about you being a woman or is trying to make you more visible to improve their public image...let them. It's annoying but take advantage of the opportunity.

Push it further if you can. Think of a way to improve life for woman in the company (or users/customers), and show some leadership in making it happen. In seriously male-dominated environments, I've found that it's easy to get approval from management for whatever you need to do it. Then take this evidence of your leadership ability to help get that promotion or backing for a project pursuing your real passions :)",idly,t2_5n3g3,3,0,reddit2

This has gotten better in recent years but the misogyny is still there, especially in male-dominated fields. 

Why are you so defensive about this topic and quick to dismiss my experience as standalone and my own fault? I was inappropriately contacted by one of my male peers which made me feel very uncomfortable and discouraged about a future in coding. I understand you may be trying to make me feel better, but dismissing legitimate concerns is only ignoring them, not making the problem go away.

It's painful to observe how many men lack self awareness and refuse to look inside, to understand how they contribute to the problem. Equal rights in a world where women have to constantly make sure that what they have won't be taken away from them (similar to what Rebecca Solnit said, just because we made progress doesn't mean we can't go backwards) are a very fragile thing.

You need to put on make-up but make sure it‚Äôs not too much or you‚Äôll be called a cat fish or judged openly, but if you don‚Äôt wear any at all you‚Äôre lazy and not feminine. 

Don‚Äôt forget your self-defense keychain when you leave and make sure to check under your car and in your backseat. when doing errands make sure you pay attention to everyone around you because at any moment you could be kidnapped. when walking to and from your car have a hand free in case someone attacks you. dont forget to also check your car when you get back from shopping to make sure it hasn‚Äôt been tagged by traffickers. 

whew, now that‚Äôs done you can finally go to work where you‚Äôll be harassed at least once by a coworker or client of the opposite sex. if you work in customer service, you‚Äôll be harassed multiple times a day no matter how you look or what you‚Äôre wearing. 

okay works done! time to go out with friends. make sure you wear low heels or no heels at all in case you have to run from someone trying to assault you. while out with your friends you‚Äôll have to deal with people once again harassing you but this time you also have to be vigilant because some of them might try to drug your drink to get what you want. unfortunately these people look just like everyone else so you can‚Äôt tell who they are. the more persistent ones you can trick with a fake phone number because you‚Äôre too afraid if you reject them they might kill you. 

once you‚Äôre done having a good time with your besties, you finally get to go home and get ready for bed but not before you triple check all of your safety measures in place (special door jams for intruders, security cameras, etc) just in case someone might have realized you live alone and you‚Äôre an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô target. now you can sleep and do it all over again tomorrow. 

this is what daily life like for women in some parts of the world (especially the USA). I refuse to believe that women would cause the world to collapse when men already ruin so much. I‚Äôm so ready for a societal shift so men like you can be fearful instead. maybe you‚Äôll start to understand.

Second, when programmers ask each other questions on the internet about programming problems, sometimes someone replies with ""RTFM,"" which means ""read the f---ing manual"". They mean that ""this is clearly documented in the manual, don't ask us this."" This is generally considered a toxic response in those circles, because yes, people can simply google for answers - but some people prefer to *discuss* the issue instead. And nobody is forcing anybody else to answer programming questions on the net if they don't want to. Asking a question on the internet is not the same as demanding that any one group in particular answers it. Think of it as, ""if you're willing to answer it, here's a question. If not, feel free to ignore it.""

So, instead of replying ""RTFM,"" programmers on such fora are encouraged to answer with a link to the relevant part of the documentation, or not answer at all.

Radio Free Europe and other outlets for the West have credibility because they basically tell the truth. They need this credibility to gain the trust of those in their audience.

So, yes, Russians are raping their soldiers. There is well known raping and sexual assault of male soldiers in the ranks as accepted hazing.

I know that in my country there are groups of men, usually of the lower social classes that openly harass women and there are now laws in place for that sort of behavior, but enforcing it is quite hard. All other sexual abuse is usually behind closed doors and thus hard to notice, unless the person themselves bring it up. In no way should you take this as me saying that we can't do anything to lower the amount of women that have to deal with this. 

A couple years ago I heard a woman scream and it sounded a lot like someone about to be sexually assaulted, so I rushed down from my apartment building.

> But what we can agree on is men should at least attempt to participate meaningfully and that includes listening and not centring yourself in discussions about women.

Yes, I agree. I apologize for being unclear. My intention was never to say that ""men are pigs"" hurts my feelings and please stop everything else until my feelings are no longer hurt. My (or other individual men's) feelings are not the issue. My concern was that such generalizations might run the risk of alienating potential male allies to the cause of women's issues, which as you rightfully point out, *should* be the center of attention in this context.

> you‚Äôre not helping your case by (repeatedly) attempting to ally yourself with the only other person in this thread disagreeing with women.

Right. I'm trying to offer support for someone who is perhaps misguided (I honestly don't know, if he is I'm probably misguided too), but to me, seems to have his (I think it's a guy) heart in the right place. Perhaps he did make the mistake of putting himself in the center of the discussion. That was a good point that I hadn't thought of. But in that case, wouldn't it be better to say ""You might have a bit of a point at least, but please don't derail the discussion from the much more important subject of this post. If you're concerned with what you're talking about, perhaps consider making your own post about it?"" Maybe you (or someone else) did something like that earlier in the discussion and I missed it - in that case, I apologize.

Well, I disagree. I think I am an ally. I certainly try to be. And I'm not saying I'm a good ally, I've specifically stated that I have a lot to learn, but I do try. If that guy indeed decried feminism, then I honestly missed it. Also, English is my second language, so I may well have been missing nuances in this thread that native speakers would not. I might have misinterpreted him. Or is it possible that you did?

Perhaps. Again, I am aware of the fact that I have a lot to learn. I'm not being intentionally tone deaf.

Well, I don't believe that, so that settles that.

This is not about my feelings. And I will try further.

> You actually commented you are not feeling welcomed on a post about the systemic abuse and ongoing sexual assault on women in order to connect with a man trying to dismiss these facts.

If he did try to dismiss those facts, then I missed that when I skimmed the thread. It was not my intention to connect with someone who did that.

> Do better or be quiet.

Okay, that's just plain not nice. And that's okay - you don't have to be nice to me. If you choose to be not nice to someone who is honestly trying (but is perhaps bad at it) to be an ally, then you are more than welcome to do that - you obviously don't need my or anyone else's approval. I just don't think it's conductive to the goals of feminism.

1. Feminism needs all the allies it can get.
2. If allies feel welcomed, or at least don't feel un-welcomed, then they are more likely to stay allies.
3. Therefore, it is in the interest of women to at least not be un-welcoming to people who honestly try to be allies even if they are *really bad* at being allies - not to spare the allies' feelings, but because the allies are needed.

I have not been intentionally argumentative, dismissive, or abusive to you. Like I said, I have a lot to learn and I'm sure I've made mistakes in this thread (for which I apologize). But my intentions are just. Telling me to ""do better or be quiet"" is not, in my opinion, constructive.

Also, please don‚Äôt apologize for English being your second language as I think you express yourself well (being able to communicate effectively in more than one language is an impressive skill in itself, truly).  

I also appreciate your desire to be an ally to women and clarification of your comments here. I don‚Äôt want to speak for all women in this sub so will share my thoughts with the caveat they are mine alone. I have certainly been guilty of being short with some men who disagree with women in this space because it happens *so* often and the majority are not arguing in good faith. I‚Äôm not sure if this sub is shared in other forums but there is a problem with brigading, where people come here with the intention to antagonize and start arguments (this happens in pretty much every women‚Äôs space, on Reddit and otherwise). Other times, even when a man is an ally, they sometimes inadvertently speak over women and centre themselves and their feelings. This happens in other spaces that are targeted to marginalized groups, such as some white women in WOC spaces. This is not always ill intentioned (I‚Äôd say quite often it‚Äôs not) but the impact to that group is the same. You‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs important to not drive away allies but at the same time I think there should be room for people to (rightfully) express their frustrations with groups that oppress them. I think the term ‚Äútone policing‚Äù applies here as it‚Äòs more important to focus on the factual or logical content of an argument instead of the emotion with which it is expressed. If we don‚Äôt agree with a statement (ie. ‚Äúmen are pigs‚Äù) expressed by a member of a marginalized group, it‚Äôs best to ask *why* they feel that way and how we can address it instead of calling them out for feeling the way they do. As a white person who is actively working on becoming anti racist I have to remind myself that when some BIPOC say white people are awful, they‚Äôre not necessarily referring to me and I don‚Äôt have to take it personally. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not for me to be offended at because I‚Äôm not part of the marginalized group. I can just move on and ignore the comment whereas they can‚Äôt from racism (similarly to how women can‚Äôt from sexism and misogyny).

That's a good point, I'll try to do that from now on. Honest question, though - should we do the same with people who say ""black people are pigs"" and similar things? I'm not saying those two things are the same, obviously my example is worse, but I'm curious if you could perhaps make headway with racists using this method too.

>Proponents of the sex work model sometimes suggest that anyone who is against prostitution is against sex. The sex they are talking about is the real ity of abuse I am describing. It is like saying that being against rape is being against sex. Indeed, it actually is saying that. The same group sometimes also insists that all of the abuse, rape, and beatings are in ven ted or exaggerated by us ideologically motivated, 
repressed, sex- panicked Victorian prudes and whiners who just don‚Äôt have what it takes to make it as whores. The pimps are in ven ted too, apparently. Prostituted women, in their view, are in de pen dent entrepreneurs; well, maybe some have managers.

>Then along came HIV / AIDS, and even this crowd discovered a harm along with a lucrative profit center in purporting to address it.How handy, this disease that sickens the men who use the women as well as the women whose faces they explode all over. How refreshingly gender neutral and symmetrical. Now the pernicious brothel 
system in India must stay in place, or where would the condoms be distributed? Sex trafficking in India is up 300¬† percent since Bill Gates spent his thirty million on condoms. Who is keeping track of whether the women can actually use these condoms, or the skyrocketing prices for the women next door who have no choice but not to use them? I have come to think that these condoms are emblematic of the prophylactic sex work idea that proposes to make the world safe for prostitution by containing and covering up its violations one at a time.

>The first fault line in the denial of prostitution‚Äôs intrinsic harm came when it was conceded that children should not be prostituted, a concession the sex work approach now routinely makes. No one ever says precisely what is wrong with buying and selling children for sex. Just that it is ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù Well, if prostitution is freedom, equality, 
liberation, and empowerment, if it makes a woman‚Äôs life more autonomous and in de pen dent, and its harms are occasional or negligible and can be minimized and contained, do tell what on earth is wrong with children doing it or seeing it being done. Nobody says. And what ever is wrong with children being involved in prostitution, 
they also don‚Äôt say what precisely changes suddenly when she‚Äôs seventeen years and 366 days old. The fact is, and every one knows, if no one could enter commercial sex as a child, the sex industry would be depopulated overnight (making a look- back provision attractive). Few try to deny that most women enter the sex industry as children 
with previously violated childhoods. What is denied is that defending the prostitution of adults supports their continuous violation on the rationale that they are no longer little girls.

>Adults and children in the sex trade are not two separate groups of people. They are the same group of people at two points in time. One consequence of childhood sexual abuse, fought by women in or outside prostitution, is feeling valued and approved when you are being sexually violated, while also feeling fundamentally ashamed, humiliated, and worthless. Sexual abuse in childhood makes it seem 
that prostitution is where you belong, while law, policy, and popular culture just wait for you to live long enough to be written off as a consenting adult.

I was watching the Vice documentary about her and I could see how she was just doing all these activities mindlessly, like if her ""soul"" had abandoned her, with her eyes gone and distracted. I cannot see dignity for a woman while entertaining men just to fulfill their repressed and obsessive sexual thirst. 

I also think that the so-called sex work is empowerment for women comes mostly from men who simply don't want the fun to end, men who don't want their sexual content to end and while it is important to make sure women do not suffer more from the persecution of laws that have a religious background (which also have the culture of controlling women's lives), I think decriminalizing sex work should be a point in between while a robust system is created to support women to pursue whatever dreams they have with the hope of removing sex work altogether in the future.",AlwaysReady1,t2_ksl5o,29,0,reddit1

isq75in,t3_y6g1ab,2022-10-17 21:47:46,Feminism,"I think that the blanket empowerment mantra of modern sex work definitely leaves women vulnerable to exploitation in a more subtle way than before. Before we just assumed all traditional sex workers were exploited and now we just assume that all modern sex workers (""models"", OF, content creators, streamers, etc) are all empowered independent women. And that makes it more difficult for them to seek help or for others to help them if they need it, because it now goes against the narrative and the profit streams to let the secret out that you aren't really single or don't want to be doing this stuff all the time because you're some unicorn nymph.

A slightly tangential gripe i always have with the modern sex work empowerment movement is the internalized misogyny within it. There is often a denial from models or content creators or whatever they call themselves that they are sex workers and they often act disgusted as if ""how dare you presume I'm a sex worker, I'm just a model/streamer/content creator/etc"". But at the same time they claim all of the victimisation and activism for sex workers. Idk but it seems like like an internalized double standard of wanting to fit the empowered modern sex worker stereotype to benefit from it while simultaneously looking down on and shaming traditional sex workers or even the term sex worker itself.

Edit to add that I think some of that internalized double standard comes from a class distinction possibly. It is typically still highly vulnerable lower socioeconomic status white or migrant women who are prone to being trafficked into or pursue traditional sex work while we see a much more diverse and ""privelaged"" mix of women involved in modern sex work. The typical model, OF, content creator, streamer, is often a fairly middle class white woman, hell even celebrities or IG stars who are already making good money are all over this side of the modern sex work too and I think this plays into the double standard.",Alternative_Art_528,t2_74bawrnb,71,0,reddit1

I support it because in a decriminalized situation many sex workers are actually happy with their work. That's the reality.

In this story however, what her husband did was horrible. 

I guess nobody could tell that she was being abused. 
Kinda like many marriages out there, you see a wife with a happy face but in reality she was suffering abuse at home. 

When I read this story I feel this is similar to Britney Spear's. This is a real problem. Artists being controlled by the person who controls money, they are forced to play a particular character to their fans.

I already think this looks like sex work ü§£ (I know enough to know what üí¶ refers to at least) but then I read more and see ""Queen of the Coomers"" ü§î I look up ""coomer"": an oversexed male obsessed with porn.

Anyway, I've spoken to lots SWs and plenty of the them aren't trafficked or living in severe poverty.  That data that shows most SWs are living in poverty is based mostly on police arrest data, and police are more likely to arrest the workers who are in poverty as opposed to the wealthier ones.  So I don't think we can trust the data that stereotypes SWs all being trafficked and/or poor.  

Secondly, it isn't slavery.  Slavery is unpaid and forced labor.  That doesn't apply to an adult willingly selling intimate pictures of themselves.

A bit of a chicken and egg issue.

I don't think incelish is an apt comparison personally. I think all online content creators, not just women doing sex work, are perceived as having it easier relative to typical careers. To some extent that can be true as some of these careers once they gone through the hard work of building a successful brand can have a lot of the work outsourced and become slightly passive as a career.

While he points out some legitimate flaws in the paper, Mr. Weitzer's assertion that a better way of understanding the problem is by looking at specific case studies doesn't make sense to me at all. And then when he actually talks about specific cases, he addresses the incredibly important ""case"" of the Netherlands by simply quoting vague statements from the Ministry of Justice rather than actual numbers. Overall I thought he did a good job in showing how the Cho paper could be better but a poor job of proving that legalization leads to better outcomes than criminalization or decriminalization. 

Regarding the main question: The source I linked does primarily use a study that has some issues. I looked for other research into the issue, but didn't find much that seemed like good quality to be honest‚ÄîI'm sure a more experienced researcher could do a better job here. I did find a study on the issue by the European parliament that seems to suggest that legalization or ""regulationism"" increases trafficking: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2005/360488/IPOL-JOIN_ET(2005)360488_EN.pdf (relevant summary of findings on page 8, 9, and 10 in the pdf‚Äîfull disclosure that I skimmed through and did not read the whole 173 pages). I'd welcome any good sources you (or anyone else) happen to have handy on this topic as well.

There is not a single instance I can remember where something wss decriminalized and this process ended leading to deathly, under-the-table practices for a profit. 

Heck when alcohol was finally re legalized in the USA all the speak easies and alcohol kingpins dried and shriveled away from the sunlight.  

I can bet Anyone here that some of them were mixing their alcoholic beverages with things just as modern illegal street drug kingpins mix their drugs to artificially inflate the weight or concentration for greater profits.  

When Portugal lightened their restrictions on all drugs it led to a decrease in hospitalizations and deaths from ALL drugs cause people there had less of a need to rely on dangerously mixed drugs.

There's no question tht SW perpetuates misogyny, for all women, but I still think its a grave mistake to pit ourselves against one another, when we all have a common enemy in patriarchy, & must place the blame squarely at the feet of men whom buy sex, not women doing what they can to survive or achieve some semblance of financial stability in a world tht fails to recognize women's value outside of sex objects.

It sounds as tho u have somehow misunderstood the very basis of sex work: the provider has to be paid for the interaction *BECAUSE she has no actual interest in fucking this person,* and WOULDN'T, were it NOT for the money.  

Its not, afterall, as tho if she actually DID have any interest, sexual or otherwise, in any specific client, tht she couldn't simply choose to see him WITHOUT pay, or WITHOUT watching the clock. Which is exactly what many do within the context of their *personal* relationships- the ones tht are actually reciprocal; with the partner(s) tht truly know HER, as an individual; the ones she *doesn't have to ACT around....*    

These are fairly clear indicators. And they very obviously do not point in the direction of her receiving actual enjoyment, at least of any notable amount, in 99.99% of said interactions she's paid to be a part of.  

And why would she? Nobody *enjoys* fucking ppl they're not attracted to!

Also, it's def worth noting tht we are speaking in the context of *THEE VERY BEST* OF SITUATIONS & CLIENTS one could hope for while offering to fuck for money, & we are speaking as tho thts the majority, or hell, even a small percentage, of what her interactions actually look like. In reality, the vast majority of these clients are often apparently quite disgusting, despicable, egotistical, manipulative, misogynistic, utterly selfish, uncleanly, unattractive, *& sometimes even violent* Neanderthals, tht are often lying to & cheating on their unsuspecting wives & female partners at home, whom mind you, *were afforded EXACTLY ZERO ABILITY TO CONSENT TO THIS SITUATION tht deeply, deeply affects their bodies, their understanding of their relationship, & their lives.*   

We're talking about men delusional and self-centered enough tht they literally DO NOT CARE whether or not the human being they're fucking is enjoying herself. I mean, at least so long as she PRETENDS to be, thts plenty enough for him.  .....And unfortunately, thts a description tht can be applied to many MAAAANY men, not just men whom rent women's bodies for their own personal enjoyment & power.

And lots of people get paid for work they might otherwise do ‚Äî artists, writers, therapists, yoga teachers. There‚Äôs someone who has a calling for almost every profession that exists. Moreover there is the simple fact that many outspoken sex workers are proud of their work, think they provide a valuable service, and say explicitly that they enjoy it. I agree most are exploited, but not all, and that matters. We haven‚Äôt even begun to speak about non-hetero sex work. There are some contexts in which sexism is moot.

Essentially, I don't know who you are or where you work, but I have a feeling I know the type of work you do. This form is usually seen on construction sites. I've seen this in the office before in different sites. Generally, guys bullshit back and forth with each other and they'll put each other's name on this. I've seen this given out as a joke before to people, they don't normally mean it in a mean spirited way.

In regards to reporting, the owner probably isn't the actual owner. He's more then likely a superintendent or some upper management type who was on tools but is now in the office so that's the mindset he has. Construction workers can be pretty immature, and I've taken part in some of the immaturity, mostly as it keeps the mood light.

I do believe there is some sort of HR. I would bring that up anonymously. I've met some great people in construction but also some fucked up people so it really is a crapshoot. I've met people who if you went up to them they'll be like, oh sorry, I didn't mean any offence and take it down, and some people would make your life hell. I don't know who you're talking about personally so I wouldn't know how to gauge their reaction. But yeah, the company you are working for likely has someone higher up then that person, owners don't usually work in the office, especially if there's 20 people at that site specifically. Email it and I wouldn't give pictures because you're likely not allowed to take pictures at where you work anyway and it narrows you down. Just say you saw this. You'll likely get to HR and they'll email him to take it down. If that's not the case, maybe the HR part of the company you're subcontracted under. Hope that helps.

Take a dated photo to show the location, and another photo every week to show it stayed in place and was seen by everybody.  

Try covering it up with an advert selling some of your junk, to see if you can get proof of the form being actively maintained as visible.

So you are not ok with it? Even calling it 'negative perceptions' implies that it's something we should be ashamed of. Why should there be negative perception at all about stereotypical femininity? Aren't you perpetuating a toxic attitude towards certain stereotypes that we are trying to fight? 

You can't advocate both the power for women to decide what they want to pursue in life, and then, in the same breath, condemn them for doing something that you don't like.

Pressuring women, especially young women into vanity and sex-work is a bit of a far cry from that. At best it is off-beat and not really ""good"" advice.

Sex workers have a high rate of social, financial, and physical abuse hurled at them because people and courts are just so terrible in general to women. Cosmetics and beauty treatments/ surgeries come with a whole host of financial and health related pitfalls.

Sure I'll agree that sex work should be a respectable profession and beauty should be painless and empowering but the reality at this moment is that, for many, they are not.

The test requires films to feature at least two named female characters engaging in a discussion about topics other than men, a conversation which must occur at least once. Recent best picture winners such as Slumdog Millionaire, Gladiator and Moonlight, as well as this year's nominees Darkest Hour and Dunkirk, all failed the test.

What's so ironic is that when the movie industry was born, it had a high number of women in the industry. What killed it was talking pictures. The bigger budget needed meant movie makers needed to go to banks and other business owners, which were male dominated businesses that wouldn't lend to women. 

And there you go. What was once one of the few industries existing where men and women were equal quickly became another male dominated and misogynist industry.

We usually use my account on a streaming platform to watch movies and tv-shows  on. Then one day I got curious about how the stupid algorithms are set up to pick content for each of our profiles. For my husband who had basically just created the profile, it only picked action and war movies. All with aggressive looking, sweaty, bleeding, lone wolf type dirty men on the cover. And when I asked him about how he felt about the selection he couldn't see why I asked. But when I showed him how many different types of movies from a wide selection of genres was selected for me, after I used my profile for years, he was mortified. It was like he was expected to be this violent maniac with a very limited interest including lone wolf type men, violence and disaster, and he didn't even notice because that is the kind of expectations he actually meets everywhere more or less.

I don't remember exactly what content was picked for me when I first set up my profile but I remember having to actively look for content that wasn't only romance or sitcoms with almost the same types of characters. And actually I still have to look for that a lot when we are watching something on holidays. Anything that doesn't fit in a very narrow box I have to spent a fair amount of time looking for and it's a bit difficult getting out of the loop actually.  So much harder than it should be because we pay for the damn thing and should really be able to just watch what we want.

So someone is ordering algorithms that decide that stereotypical content is exactly what a man or a woman should like. Reinforcing gender stereotypes in a bad way.

I'm not saying the company made my husband into something he's not (yet) but it seems like they are working really hard to NOT make it easier to pick something else. And if we didn't share our experiences he might never have noticed what they expected of him. Like I keep falling into traps that feels like they are made just for me, when I'm shopping, planning trips, picking toys etc because the world around us expect me, in fact it insists on it, to want very specific things based solely on rigid gender stereotypes.

It sometimes really is too much work finding something outside of the box and I don't know why the men don't rebel more. I guess they are trapped same as the rest of us.",Free_Layer2116,t2_9i9ajp07e,25,0,reddit1

I think it might be a little more nuanced than ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt want to do more work in relationships‚Äù I‚Äôm sure that is absolutely the case for some men. This might be a bit ranty, but I‚Äôll try to be succinct.

I think there other important considerations that should be accounted for as well. Like the social expectations of who romance novels are for. I distinctly remember being labeled as gay when people found out that I read all of Twilight in high school. It was both an implicit and explicit message of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk about it‚Äù.

 I know Twilight might not be the epitome of good romance but it was popular enough at the time and it caught my interest. My favorite genre at the time was rom-com movies, but it was definitely filed under the, don‚Äôt talk about this tab of compartmentalization.

I‚Äôve also tried books by Hank Greene which I thought was more great story telling but it hit close to home in a couple of ways which brings me to my second and third thought. I‚Äôm curious how many women read books from a philosophically empathetic perspective versus how many men read books from a philosophically sympathetic perspective (kinda like 1st person vs 3rd, maybe it‚Äôs not a gendered thing at all). When I read any book, they are just characters. I do not put my self in the shoes of the protagonist, however my wife will. She will imagine her self as if she is the character. What this means for romance novels for me is it takes a lot for me to be invested in the characters based on how they are feeling instead of what they are doing.

And my third thought, men are often socialized to avoid big emotions such as sadness or to turn that sadness into anger, which is maybe why it‚Äôs okay to have some romance sprinkled in with the action. But it took some self-work for me to be okay with sitting in sadness, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the average person is looking for though when they sit down to read a book for fun. But what I think this might translate to is for many men when there is a theme of grief/loss within the relationship even if it is resolved, it leads to anger/frustration from reading. And at least from my experience, romance novels tend to be more okay with exploring sad themes.

TLDR; Toxic masculinity probably plays a significant role in what‚Äôs okay fro men to be interested in.

Do you initiate all of the time because you expect sex far more than she would naturally choose to have it and so you never give her a chance to initiate? If you are initiating sex because **you** want it and the ‚Äúentry fee‚Äù to get it is actually doing a thing that would make her feel good - aren‚Äôt you still mostly doing that for your benefit?  You‚Äôre doing that work because *you want sex* and being a decent human being means that the person you want sex from should actually enjoy it too. It sounds like really you just want a sex doll, in which case, can you actually complain if she‚Äôs ‚Äújust laying there‚Äù? 

If sex is just about orgasm to you then masturbate. But you can‚Äôt expect to use another person as a sex doll. You do have to treat them as a person who deserves to feel loved and appreciated by the person they are having sex with if that‚Äôs what they need to have sex. When you say that, what do you even mean? Do you need to dim the lights and draw a bath and light candles and scatter rose petals and read her poetry and give her a back massage for 45 minutes every single time you have sex, or does she just want you to treat her like a person and pay attention to her and her pleasure rather than just recreating how they do it in porn?

If they are just ‚Äúlaying there‚Äù - are they into it? If they are just laying there, maybe you need to ask if they want to be having sex. Or maybe they aren‚Äôt just laying there, and it‚Äôs possible to move from the bottom, and you just aren‚Äôt paying attention because you‚Äôre so invested in how much you deserve to cum (but not yet, I guess - is that a thing that *she* cares about, or is that a thing that *you* care about?) because you‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù. 

A lot of the unseeen work that women do in sex is emotional labor. There can be so much ego in male sexuality that for some men, it seems like sex can become a thing that is not about us as individuals at all. Or we have to become cheerleaders or therapists because there‚Äôs so many men place all their self worth on sexual conquest/performance. 


Regardless either you need to check your own stuff about sex and relationships or you need to have an actual conversation and talk about each person‚Äôs wants, expectations, likes, etc during sex.

Of course the quality/success of this kind of arc depends on the skill of the author, but that‚Äôs the basic idea, and it is a kind of female fantasy because many women rarely get that kind of acknowledgment/apology or commitment to growth from a male partner.

k088r0y,t1_k07sm4g,2023-09-12 07:50:52,Feminism,"It's a lot of things, I think.

For instance, straight women are the least likely to end up having an orgasm during sex of any group. Men not only often do not put effort in but are encouraged to believe they don't *have* to... That their dicks will just be magically enjoyable and they don't have to learn how to use it or anything.

Then there's potential biological stuffs. Women are much more likely to receive UTIs from sex, end up with more fluids they have to clean off themselves, etc. So there's often more non-sexy work involved for people who are receiving (also true of ""bottoms"" in gay parlance). There's also a load of extra cleanup required if butt stuff is involved, complications around periods, and that the receiver is more likely to incur injury / soreness in sensitive areas.

Then you add the pre-existing labor gap around housework and emotional labor, and you end up with a tired woman who's put a lot of effort cleaning up after her husband, having to do extra cleaning for this event, *and* she's far less likely to get that orgasmic endorphin rush from it? Yeah, might explain why she might be less eager even with a similar libido.

Societal expectations and shame around women's pleasure probably also play into this... Just look at the outrage around a song focused more on a woman's pleasure (WAP) when compared to another explicit song that happens to focus on the man's (CPR, for instance).

For example, someone on the other side of the debate might accuse you of thinking that all sex workers are bad, and would accuse you of internalized misogyny, because that would allow them to paint you as an extremist and would give them the opportunity to have a strawman argument with an imaginary extremist rather than a respectful discussion with a real person with reasonable concerns. 

In other words, it is a tactic of manipulation that is very effective because it can co-opt supporters of sex workers' safety and rights as a shield against legitimate concerns. They use good hearted people who are trying to do the right thing as a camouflage for their bullshit. They try to make it seem like any question of whether porn is harmful is an attack on sex workers by a misogynist. They hope to camouflage their own misogyny by accusing others of it. 

This is the same sort of thing that US Republicans are doing with their pedophile obsession. They accuse anyone who doesn't support transphobic and other terrible policies of supporting pedophilia because it is a way to shut down the argument. The fact that many of the same accusers are in favor of child marriage, forced birth by children, and other such horrors is brushed under the rug by accusing others.

So you end up with one end saying ""ban it all"", supported by puritanical and religious associations, and the 'other side' fighting against that viewpoint and going for ""it's all liberation and freedom"". And its easy for an argument against the porn industry to be deliberately misunderstood as a puritanical argument, while any argument in favor of freedom and female sexuality is easily misconstrued as a support for the porn industry.

I think, related to the topic of the video which was today‚Äòs fashion, it‚Äòs absolute bs. Women should dress however they want to because they enjoy doing so, no matter what men think of them.

And also: Women should do sex work if they WANT to, not if they‚Äòre forced/coerced or manipulated to do so.

This is a minority opinion, especially at higher levels of power.  Campaigns to ""regulate"" the porn industry will largely remove what power SWers have.

https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/money-shot-pornhub-documentary-news

>But the company‚Äôs attempt to quell the backlash ‚Äî and a censorious congressional act that has since made companies more liable for their content ‚Äî impacted the livelihoods of some of Pornhub‚Äôs most prominent sex workers and porn performers.

If I remember correctly from the documentary, it was more so the grassroots campaign to encourage payment processors to boycott pornhub, which especially hurt individuals making money on the site - and really had nothing to do with better regulating the site as far as non-consent.

This left a lot of the performers who were interviewed feeling burned, because while they strongly supported pressure against porn hub to reform the site's practices, they immediately found themselves vilified by people who reject the whole concept of porn entirely.  Especially in a crowded information space, a nuanced take like ""yes we need regulation / action, but actually this *specific* regulation or action actually harms sex workers exclusively, and does nothing to make porn sites more ethical, because X, Y, and Z"" can't compete with slogans like ""End porn now!!""

Ultimately... People don't think porn is positive, and the general consensus is to shut the whole thing down, rather than tolerate *some* porn, for reasons that most of the protestors - and almost all of the lawmakers - can't articulate.

""People should be allowed to make a living"" doesn't actually cut it, because the same argument could be used for the legalization of drugs.  You need a deeper argument as to why it's a *net positive for society* to allow people to practice SW as a profession, and especially to do so openly.

I think the actual unpopular opinion (but I would say the truth) is that American society has an overall negative view of *sex* itself, as something that's less a positive, enriching experience, and more a necessary evil.  And when sex is evil... Porn is evil.

Edit: Though I should add a note at the bottom to stress that very little of this reflects how I think things ""should"" be, rather it's a reflection of what I have come to believe things *are now,* regardless of whether or not you agree.  It also explains why most of the discussions are currently ""all the porn"" or ""none of the porn,"" which is how I read your original question.

I do agree that things that help you utilize your imagination and exercise creativity are much more nurturing than purely passive content consumption. It also helps you reflect on yourself and your needs, rather than simply escaping into a detached fantasy away from yourself. 

I personally create queer media with my partner, and we really enjoy it, it brings us closer together and keeps discussions around sex and sexuality open between us. 

Queer media also helped me crack my gender egg and realize I was trans. turns out, the reason I could only read male POV, and had a strong attachment to BL stories, was because that was how I internally saw myself (this is not true for everyone who consumes queer media, but it is for some).  

Sadly, this is one of those areas where patriarchy hurts everyone. Cis Men are not encouraged, or taught, emotional depth and internal reflection.

A man was hiring for a project that has a deadline, he refused to hire a woman even though she was the most qualified for the job because he found out she was pregnant by snooping on her social media after the interview, her expecting date clashed with the project. He was also motivated by a bonus he would receive if the project completed before the deadline

My personal and emotional opinion is it's never justified which is why it's also illegal.

But yes logically I'm sure we can all think of thousands of unique situations that require someone to be at work for certain time frames and not take anymore than the statutory holiday leave, especially small businesses/companies not currently producing profit.

I work for a large company and we needed a new upper management person. A woman came to the interview and she was perfect, she told the interviewer she was pregnant and expecting to give birth in 2 months so will not be able to start for I think it was 5 or 6 months. We simply hired a part time person for the that time because we really wanted her.

It's really not that hard... But I'm perhaps bias as I work for a large company that has the capacity to do that?

jx4z4nz,t3_15x5jvr,2023-08-21 14:48:13,Feminism,"Well, i have a sightly different position, but I am not from the USA, I am in the EU. In my country, we have both maternal and paternal leave, so essentially a parental leave. It starts a month before birth and is 12 months altogether, paid by health insurance (I am simplyfing). BOTH parents can stay home with the baby at once for the first 3 months! The mother (if she gave birth) has tostay at home for i think 2months after birth (this is to protect mothers from being forced to come to work a day after birth, so its positive discrimination, fyi). And the rest is then just one person, parents can decide who.
We also have the right to an abortion in our constitution (perhaps relevant?).

What im getting at is that, while mothers are the ones who usually take the whole 12 months (and i think most father also take the first 3months) and it def is a sexist issue, it is also very hard for the employer to hire someone for the job and then that person just disappears for a whole year. Then they need to hire someone else to fill in, which can take very long to find the person etc. We are a small country so most employers dont have many resources to keep hiring ‚Äòfillers‚Äô. Not to mention mothers then usually return to work only part time (the law permits it) and are often home sick due to the children being sick (little kids are sick all the time cause kindergarten, and the employer pays a FULL wage during sick leave from their own pocket). Which essentially means that for about 6years the employer will have to have 2 people for the same position.

In short, living in a social-wellfare country is awesome, but can be burdensome for employers and economy. I can honestly see how it can be a burden to hire a woman of childbearing age.

So, instead of shifting the blame onto employers, what i think needs to be done is achieving more equality when it comes to parental leave and who takes it, who is caring for the children, universal healthcare, abortion rights, education, etc. When the burden of childcare is distributed equally between both genders, women not only get hired more, but arent skipped over for promotions and pay rises simply because they weren‚Äôt there and a male colleague was. They can put 100% into work when they are there, not having to stretch themselves thin between a job and bearing all the weight of childcare and housework at the same time. I think we need to start there.

Yet when starting and planning a business, a business can't be bothered with planning for something half of the population might/probably deal with?!

This is a very illogical way to think and a trash way to run a society...and it's literally because most men are *incapable* of thinking about ANYTHING that doesn't directly affect them.

Yes, let's not hire more than half the world's population because they have the ability to get pregnant...let's tell them that being a woman is somehow less because they can get pregnant...yet cry, whine, and complain, like little boys when they decide to stop having children because society has told them that doing so will cause them great grief simply because the other half of the population doesn't want to be inconvenienced or even have to just take one extra step in planning for something as natural as planning for bathrooms, in a workplace.

It‚Äôs weeding your garden or making breakfast or helping your elderly grandmother bathe ‚Äî work that you have to do over and over again, work that seems to erase itself. It is essential work that our economy tends not to acknowledge or compensate. This disregard for reproductive labor, Federici writes, is unjust and unsustainable.

These ideas weren‚Äôt exactly obscure before the pandemic. But mainstream feminism ‚Äî not to mention mainstream economics or politics ‚Äî has mostly ignored domestic labor. Instead, it has measured women‚Äôs empowerment by their presence and influence in the workplace, which is attained by outsourcing housework and child care to less economically advantaged women for a low wage. Even so, women remain mired in housework. It‚Äôs common now to hear the term ‚Äúthe second shift‚Äù (coined in 1989 by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild), which describes how the work of maintaining a home and caring for children still falls disproportionately to women, even if they have full-time jobs and pay for help. What‚Äôs more, people who are paid to do domestic labor or care work (like elder care or house cleaning) are, as a group, badly compensated and denied workplace protections or benefits. These jobs are held mostly by women of color and immigrants. The arrangement is hardly a success for women at large.

Women in heterosexual relationships still do most of the unpaid care work, like taking care of children and elders, doing house chores, grocery shopping, bringing kids to school and picking them up again. All these activities take up time, during which they obviously can't to paid work. 


Women's unpaid work enables their male spouses to work full time or even over time and in general be more flexible when it comes to working hours or events. Without someone doing the 'invisible' work, society would not be able to function properly.

kp1uez8,t3_1ajawvq,2024-02-05 17:27:42,Feminism,"I told a story yesterday about how I worked in city parks early in the morning and this guy propositioned me for a massage. That wasn‚Äôt the worst experience I ever had on that job. Pretty bad, but not the scariest. 

I went to a new park, really nice and natural place in the middle of a run-down urban area. Not a lot of foot or car traffic, nobody taking advantage of the park. I got there in the afternoon to prep for the next day and this guy was there, looked like he was passing through in his way somewhere. He stopped and talked to me, chitchat about what I was doing (he saw my gear) and then he asked for my number. I said no, I don‚Äôt give my number to strangers. He tried to argue that we exchanged names and weren‚Äôt strangers, and y‚Äôall. He was beyond angry that I wouldn‚Äôt give him my number. He was enraged, but he was very controlled. It was terrifying. He didn‚Äôt do anything, but I was afraid. 

I continued walking the park, looking for a place to set up my traps for the next day, and then I realized. I couldn‚Äôt see my vehicle, I didn‚Äôt know how long the trail was and how long it would take me to walk it, I didn‚Äôt know if he was going to follow me, and I didn‚Äôt have anything to defend myself with. I walked back to the car really fast, passing the guy again. When I got there, got in and he was as still be at me. I offered him a spare bottle of water, hoping to defuse it. (I should have just left, I know.) He gave me that look again, that controlled hatred, and showed me he had a bottle in his bag. I left. Y‚Äôall. I had to go back to that that park the next day. Good news is I never saw him again, but that may be the scariest guy I ever met. 

That park was actually really nice, but I never could feel quite comfortable there because of that encounter.",adamantmuse,t2_hnwp6lq,9,0,reddit1

First I remember when I was about 8 y.o. is when my godfather went to kiss me on the lips and tried putting his tongue in my mouth while my mom and his wife were in the kitchen. I recoiled and ran outside. When I was 15 a middle aged man fondled me when I had fallen asleep on the front row seat behind him. He was driving the bus we were in back home from a river trip with a group of my older sister's friends and most of us were very tired and sleeping on the way back.  Another time I had just turned 18 and my parents took me with them on a trip to Mexico. A family friend around my same age showed an interest in me at a party we went to. He asked me to dance a few times, which I accepted. Then later he asked me if I wanted to take a walk with him to see the lake. I went and we sat down on the edge of the lake and we're talking just fine when he suddenly lunged over me and I fell backwards onto the sandy dirt, he was on top and tried pulling my shirt up and my pants down, his hands were like an octopus just everywhere. I was certain he was going to rape me when he forces his body in between my legs. That's when he fussed with getting his pants undone but his belt buckle was stuck and I was able to roll him off of me, got up and kicked him real hard then ran back to the party.

I'm a 61 year old woman who experienced most of these things prior to age 12.  The stalking I was older about 21 years old.  

One of the worst experiences was when I was about 19 years old.  I was walking in the downtown area of a small town and I passed up two guys that I had never seen before and I didn't know them. They laughed as I walked by.  I should have ignored them and walked on but I turned around and looked at them.  They stopped looked at me and what they said totally shocked me.  They basically said that I enjoyed playing with their thing in public and that really turned them on. They basically couldn't help it as I couldn't keep my hands off of that area.  I was a slutty type of woman. They were a lot more explicit.  I toned down the language so it could be written in here.  

That was the first time I was ever called a slut.  Sexual comments were often made to me (mocking or making fun of me because I was a virgin) but I was never called a slut.  I was horrified and shocked by the comments as at that time I still was a virgin and had never done what they said I did.  People heard these comments that these guys said very loudly and looked at me in disgust.  It appeared that they believed them.  I just got out of there quickly.

I was certainly aware of it before, in no small part because when I heard guys bragging about doing it, ""locker room talk"" style, I took the time to consider how the women involved would feel, but, within the first few months of presenting as a woman, I was:

- Loudly catcalled from a moving vehicle while walking down the street, and the vehicle circled around to do it *again*.

- Groped by the manager of a Texas Roadhouse, in front of my then-wife. Just... Guided us to our booth then shamelessly grabbed my ass as we were getting into it.

- Chased through almost the entire mall by a man who was loudly shouting at me the entire time, while I was pointedly ignoring him and trying to get to my appointment on time, because he... Wanted to bring me back across the mall to try to sell me a phone case at his booth? Yeah, I don't really buy his explanation.

Same roommate would get drunk once a week and bang on my door at 3am trying to sleep with me. 

Once told me he can't accept my flirtation anymore because he had a girlfriend. That part was just funny

2) my roommate upstairs had severe rage issues. Once I parked my new car slightly wrong and he almost busted down my door screaming at me to move it at midnight.

Same roommate got mad the landlord made us pay to clean the roommates trash professionally and he stole the induction spirals from the stove and hid them so the landlord had to replace the stove.

kp7kblz,t1_kp4aya2,2024-02-06 18:10:50,Feminism,"In my experience, the men I am friends with are all very gentle, slow-moving, quiet, introverted people. So for them, they only have their lens of behavior to see another‚Äôs actions through- and there‚Äôs such cognitive dissonance between the appalling action, and my friend‚Äôs behavior they literally cannot understand it.  

They hear about a man putting hands on a woman, and go üò± how? why?! and try to remember if they‚Äôve ever seen such a thing happen in front of them. But none of the men I know are terribly observant, and since they can‚Äôt ‚Äòsee‚Äô themselves doing the bad thing, can‚Äôt imagine how someone else would have the audacity to do it either.   

So it isn‚Äôt that they don‚Äôt believe me when I tell them about scary, abusive men- they just literally cannot understand it. Sometimes it helps to point it out right after something happens, but sometimes they weren‚Äôt paying attention (because men don‚Äôt have to be ever-vigilant) so they didn‚Äôt notice anything happening.

kp4ywzx,t1_kp26mxv,2024-02-06 04:58:42,Feminism,"Mmm... Scummiest place I've seen it was during one of the Air Force required briefings on how not to sexually assault someone. Yes, it's bad enough they have to do training on how *not* to do it. Anyways, this one had a section on ""comforting a woman who had been assaulted"" and for some reason one of the slides said ""be sure to remind her that not all men are assaulters"".

I had to interrupt things right there to point out how terrible that was. No woman wants or needs to hear that, especially after suffering an assault. The only people it helps are the assaulters.

And if a man is reading this and wondering what they *should* do... Call out the assaulters! Be a place women, or hell, other men, can go to if they're attacked. Don't *say* ""not all men"", *show* that you are not one of them, do not stand with them, and do not support them. If even a small fraction of men start doing that, it would actually make a big difference.",Psiah,t2_amk52pk,9,0,reddit1
