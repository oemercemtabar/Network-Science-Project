This is true in the short term, because step raises don't keep up with your market value as you gain experience.  This is especially true in STEM careers because there's a big jump between salary offers at entry level versus 3-5 years experience.
  
Yet you'll find it harder to get hired once you establish a history of ""job jumping"".  That hasn't been a problem lately but in a competitive job market it will fuck you.
  
Take the entry job, stay 3 or 4 years and then move for a big salary increase.  You could hop every 1 or 2 years to try to gain those increments faster but it looks terrible on a resume.

ic48tt5,t3_vakky3,2022-06-12 18:59:56,WorkReform,"This isn't universally true. 

In fact,  often the reason hiring budgets are bigger is because the whole process of hiring has tons of ancillary costs. Advertising, paying recruiters, licensing the software to automatically decline resumes, personnel hours dedicated to interviews, padding to make room for compensation negotiation, productivity lost during the weeks spent hiring and training...

Whereas keeping an employee happy with their compensation usually has only direct costs. You either can or can not give them what they want.

It is usually in the company's interest to give an employee reasons to stay. I think the real failure is that we workers don't negotiate well enough to get what we deserve.

Because let's face it, finding and obtaining a new job is expensive, stressful, and time-intensive. Trying to chase a better salary every 1-3 years is going to burn you out. If the place you are working at isn't giving you what you think you deserve, but is in all other ways an acceptable workplace, *demand better*.  If they are low-balling you, insist on your worth.

3rd move: $36k stayed for 1.5 yrs, left for $50k

5th move: 6 yrs of petty raises from $52k to $58k and left for $70k

Promotion: 1 yr, $70k to $80k with triple the responsibility

Each time I moved, I lied about my current salary and they all offered to pay me what I said I had been making.

Promotions generally don't come with adequate raises, which is comical because it's a sign that they think you're worth moving into more responsibility... just still not worth keeping?

I'm at a point now where I'm involved in hiring and salary discussions and it blows my mind when my boss is all ""*Well, we'll offer him $54k, but if he negotiates, we can go as high as $60k*"" ... and then the guy accepts the offer at $54k and I *know for a fact* that he could have done better - but I'd get fired if I bring that up to anyone.

ic5wab6,t3_vakky3,2022-06-13 03:21:53,WorkReform,"I work middle management for a large company.

It's probably illegal for companies to directly coordinate to keep salaries low.  However, it's not illegal for them to work with a third party to get market data on what is the going rate for salaries.  Here's the one my employer uses: https://radford.aon.com/products/surveys/technology-compensation-survey

Basically, they all talk to this company, tell them what they pay, and in return find out what is the average salary for your position.  (almost like a union for corporations, but not really because unions are evil of course!)

My company aims to have a comp ratio of 1.0, meaning they pay you average for your position.  And arguably that's not unfair, even if it's not fair relative to inflation and job performance and any other reasonable metric for if people deserve a raise.  Then they pat themselves on the back and say ""we pay close to the market average, I don't know what people are complaining about!""

This is a conversation I had when talking about my shitty raise budget this year:

Me:  If one of my guys left, and we had to replace them, we'd pay 20% over comp ratio

Boss:  yeah probably.

Me:  If they left, they could get 20% over what we're paying them pretty easy.

Boss:  Yeah probably

Me:  So how is what we pay them the actual market rate?

Boss:  Doesn't matter, the budget is the budget and there just isn't the money for it.  Oh also we made record profits the last 12 years.

15$/hr new grad hire working as Implementation Specialist running an electric supply company's in-house inventory management system while working directly with a sociopath CIO with him flying us around every other month for tech sales pitches and new customer setup. 3 years and no raises. Their yearly review process happened my first year--then they stalled up until the day I quit 2 years later. 

I went from 15$/hr with crappy bennies to 16$/hr no bennies working IT contractor for a company working for DoD. Talk about a pivot from soft skills to hard skills and a gamble. P.s. I was 29-30 at the time with no kids... so already I could do something many couldnt risk. 

They loved me but IT was already beginning to centralize so decisions on site hires was disconnected from ground level. I work there 2 years, 1$ raise after the first year with no fuss, but ultimately I had to pivot even deeper into hard skills--

Then 23$/hr as Network Administrator for a chicken plant that treated me like immigrant labor. 2 years stint. They loved me too but again... purse strings insulated by a layer of middle managers

Its 2022, a month ago, roughly 6-7 years after I graduated I get somewhere decent... remember that one place I was a contractor? As soon as I left, the on-site full time IT abandoned the site under pretense of the pandemic and it went into a death spiral for two years... until I walked right through the hiring process because *everyone already knew me* and my reputation since has done all the heavy lifting of building a rapport at a new place and winning hearts and minds.

A replaceable part will sometimes fail (quit). It takes time and expense to repair (hire). Now, as a business we can spend a lot of money to service every individual replaceable part. Sure, you will prevent a lot of part failure. But it takes money that could otherwise be spent doing other things. So instead, make a policy of only doing just below the bare minimum of maintenance (COLA). Yes, a certain percentage of parts will fail, but by and large most will continue working.   


And here is where the replaceable parts analogy breaks down. You see, if all the parts demand more than COLA across all businesses, this strategy breaks down. The machine comes grinding to a halt, and doing that maintenance becomes the cheaper route.",neekz0r,t2_7kp3q,51,0,reddit3

There’s a really good management book called Radical Candor that talks about two different kinds of high performing people, rockstars and superstars. Most companies reward superstars far more than rockstars because superstars are usually those who are fast-growth people. The ones who care about accelerating their career quickly,

Good managers know that you need to balance a team with rockstars and reward them differently - the people who are not obsessed with advancing to the next title but are so good at what they do because they’ve done it for so long, and that’s all they want to do.",,,1,0,reddit3

You might consider running the numbers and adjust for an average inflation rate of 3.6%. If you want to retire living a 70-80K lifestyle in 30 years I think you’ll find that it doesn’t get anywhere close to what you need, even with a 3% company match and maximum contributions on your own. When I crunched the numbers using a generous 8% return it fell far short of what I would need. And that’s assuming there aren’t any huge market downturns in that timeframe. Fact of the matter is, these retirement planning systems are still based on archaic thinking. They didn’t intend on us living this long.


I think this approach of jumping ship when the better opportunity comes along is solid. You’re better off making more money and investing it on your own instead of tying your retirement to a company and abdicating its investments to a third party that’s essentially just shadowing the market.

ic3todz,t1_ic3erup,2022-06-12 17:03:44,WorkReform,"I've worked in Corp finance and accounting for about 10 years now, and some of what I've seen: There's a lot involved, but the biggest constraint is that the CFO constrains the pool of money for raises based on the P&L forecast target. If you're HR...well you can complain but you're still stuck with the pool you've been handed.

So how do you identify the people who feel underpaid enough to leave vs the ones who aren't ready to leave yet? Say there's 100k employees, of which 5,000 are ready to leave? Give everybody the same raise and you end up not giving enough of a raise to the 5,000 that really needed it to stay, and those 5,000 become turnover.

Let people complain to their manager, that sends up an signal that they are among those 5,000 on the brink of leaving, and you allocate your raise pool to them and then they stay. Now the raise dollars are effectively spent on the ones who were going to become turnover. 

It sucks, but there aren't a lot of options for being better at allocating limited dollars to where they make a difference. The other is for high performers getting recommended and that's an easier one to say yes to for allocating the remaining pool of raise money.

**The takeaway for employees is this**:
1) Self-advocate to signal that you're the one that should get the raise. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

2) Get on good terms with your manager, they rarely ever have authority to give you more money. However, if they like you, they can stick their neck out and complain to HR and senior management to advocate on your behalf for an unbudgeted raise which will draw extra scrutiny on them to justify. I have seen great bosses make noise for mediocre performers and get their team big raises. While another team with a quiet boss and high performers just has to make do with the regular annual raises. Your boss is a potential ally for getting raises, they are rarely an approver. So help your boss by being a partner and also give them objective metrics they can show their bosses on why you deserve it(this goes back to the self-advocacy above).

3) Job hop. Even if you're really good about pursuing raises, unless you're the cream of the crop employees that management wants to keep no matter what, you're probably only getting your best money by moving around.",yumcake,t2_8blbt,8,0,reddit3

Employee salary market value has been jumping constantly and erratically. It's nearly impossible for an employer to keep up with it. I know I was certainly blindsided about a year ago.

2018-16$ ok guess we gotta pivot. These bootstraps arent working... *we need rollerblades*

2020-23$ fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- this plant is running 6/24s 😭

2022-61K/yr (32$ish? 28?) now working at the 2018 place and it might as well be a european country the moment I walk through those doors 

I suppose thats not a fair summary, but its close enough in comparison to these people churners that are always hiring. Ask me about my current in 1 year, 11 months but I have hope in this one",NasoLittle,t2_88ggy,2,0,reddit3

ic4h9bj,t1_ic3rtbm,2022-06-12 20:05:03,WorkReform,"My brother has a similar story - started at my dad's employer at 16. Worked there until he was like 25. They kept promising big promotions but every time he would try to force the issue they said he was ""too valuable in his current position"". Well that only lasts so long. Eventually he was lured away by another company, and unlike most situations you hear about where everyone is expendable, the department he worked in absolutely *went to shit* within a few days.

Like two months later, the company owner goes to my dad and asks him what he thought it would take to get him to come back. My dad was like, ""that's not something I can answer for you - make him an offer, and see if he'll come back. But I'll tell you one thing - he's not coming back for anything less than running that department, and the upper end of management pay.""

Owner, being one of the few smart owners out there (he just got stagnant in promoting my brother) promptly goes and fires the department manager calls my brother and offers him the position and basically says to name his price, and when my brother said the price, the owner topped that by like 25%.

 Brother stayed there, got promoted from department manager, to area manager, then General manager in like record time. The company then got bought out, and the owner basically said that the place would not run without my brother. He remained as general manager until promoted again to territory manager and he's now rocking an executive vice president gig.

Not saying it's by any means common, but the point is that the act of moving for a job CAN stimulate a smart owner to try and get someone back.",psimwork,t2_gjdny,1,0,reddit3

That’s being said, since I’ve pivoted to corporate retail, it tends to be a year or so before management collapses. Management collapses, they promote me.

But of course that’s today’s money. If I want that $80k lifestyle 30 years from now when I retire, I have to adjust for inflation. I use an inflation calculator for that and set it to an average of 3.6% and get $6,934,320.",simplerando,t2_1r1tmqzb,2,0,reddit3

I think I’m just coming from a place of pessimism regarding the market overall and I don’t have a particular fondness for the idea that it guarantees a 10% return going forward. 

I’m still relatively young in my career and am not able to fully utilize the benefits of maxing out 401(k) contributions, like others have pointed out.

Yeah I guess that’s the catch for my calculations. I’m not able to contribute anywhere near the annual max—at least not now while I’m still paying off student loans. So a 401(k) that shadows the market is a less attractive option for me. 

Going back to the OP, for me personally I think it means I shouldn’t be afraid to “jump ship” for a better opportunity for fear of it affecting my retirement plan through an employer. If they’re already not paying me enough to max out my contributions to a 401(k) and utilize its full potential, there’s no reason to say no to something that would provide me more money that would in turn allow me to invest more in my retirement in the long run.",simplerando,t2_1r1tmqzb,1,0,reddit3

They also need your paystubs from the last month, your W2 from the last 2 years, and bank statements from the year.

ic6dpbt,t1_ic61qdt,2022-06-13 06:49:28,WorkReform,"Thats fine but know that this really depends on where you are. I bought my home in the midwest - low COL - a few years ago and they didn't really care about where I worked, just that I worked in the same field. Houses here are cheaper and plenty. My interest rate was less than 2.1 percent or something. 

However, I remember buying my first property in my 20s on the west coast - high COL area - and they cared a lot more. Being a first time homeowner, they are more critical and it also really depends on your job type/credit/assets/savings. Ex: if your job has a lot of gaps like teaching or contract work it'll be harder to get approved for a loan. 

That's why it's so hard for first time homebuyers right now. It's a seller's market, banks are more risk avoidant since '08 towards newbies, they really want you to show ""stability"" before you can get a loan. Right now as a first time home buyer they are looking at rates from 3.5-5.3 percent rates for loans or worse (also region/COL dependant). 

Banks look at your profile differently if you have a record of owning property, and never defaulted on your mortgages, a history of paying on time, than a new homeowner. Also the max loan amount is $647,200 right now.

Then have very little idea what they are actually doing, hand off things they really should understand to other people or are simply guessing and no one noticed yet.

I was taking my CIPS level 4, trying to get moved over to the procurement team as I was already supporting 60 people who had devolved authority to spend up to 100k but no clue how to do it. While I did 3 other jobs at the same place and was on barely over what I can get flipping burgers, but experience matters and qualifications so ground it out. 

I was rather surprised to find on the same course, several senior strategic/category managers etc on 3-4 times my wage. Who all struggled with the material despite 10 years of experience. Turns out it seemed to be the same year repeated 10 times. Whilst I was writing policy documents, contributing to the guidance, rewriting simplified guidance for lower level spend etc. 

Every question that got raised as past our level to one of them was then farmed to the lowest level above me where they actually knew shit and had the access to do something about it. Sometimes straight to the DB people. Had people working with sql who couldn't put a custom query together, as a team. For simple things like outputting a specific cost centre, job code and/or work stage  

That should have been a form with adjustable fields and access restricted as appropriate so any manager could get their own info. Nope it was a ask for months, find they can't do it, then say there isn't time cos of the new system (which 2 years later still isn't in place). I don't do sql but given a week and access I'm confident I could have knocked something out. My managers son was a DB guy and wondered wtf they couldn't do any of this. 

Latest fail was a full replacement of the timesheeting system, out of service as of April 2020, hard deadline as compatibility issues. Took til January to decide not to buy the in place upgrade, or use the drop in oracle module. Let's build it from an old system that ran on access backend, did not work over vpn, constantly timed out and when I'd looked at it when for no apparent reason I was out in charge of rolling out the first system to our department the guy in charge of it said run away....

So launch comes and I point out the jobs and workspaces are not even labelled, it's all codes. Hundreds of them, customised per coat centre. They were about to send out huge conversion tables to everyone like old PC games with the password off the booklet. Got hold of a dev and he fixed it in no time, wasn't considered important until then apparently. End of the quarter comes, its limped along collecting data but there's no billing unit. 

Accountants are manually journalling shit around. EU and gov don't like that as an audit trail, when I left it had been over 2 years. No functional billing unit, one dev only on it now for 'reasons'. No functional output forms for audi requirements but they could dump to excel for a completely not compliant form. Oh and it was only setup for quarterly reporting, not monthly like half the projects required. Only a 9 figure a year government operation, what could go wrong?

If Senior leadership asked for a budget update it would often take 2 or more days to get even a vague idea. I tracked my shopping better than they tracked budgets.

We appreciate your concern and engagement in this matter. We take these issues extremely seriously, and we want to provide an update on the situation.

First and foremost, we would like to express our deep regret for the negative experience that the employee faced. Such behavior is in no way representative of the values and standards we uphold at Grain & Berry.

We want to assure you that Grain & Berry Corporate is fully aware of the situation and is actively working to address it. Our team is currently in communication with the franchise owner and all parties involved to gather all the necessary information. We are committed to a thorough investigation and will take appropriate actions based on our findings.

We understand the importance of maintaining a respectful and inclusive work environment, and we are dedicated to ensuring that this principle is upheld throughout our organization, including our franchised locations. Wage theft and any form of abusive behavior are not tolerated within our organization.

We kindly ask for your patience as we work to resolve this matter appropriately. It's our top priority to make sure that all team members feel valued and respected.

jxkoqjx,t3_15z6jbk,2023-08-24 16:44:45,WorkReform,"Hello team,

I hope you're all having a great morning. I wanted to discuss a few important points, especially for those who have been with us and those who have recently joined.

Regarding food and beverages, please remember not to consume anything that you haven't personally purchased. Even bottled water isn't complimentary. It's crucial that we adhere to this policy, regardless of what your shift lead might say. Failure to comply could result in serious consequences.

If you forget to clock in or out, unfortunately, that time cannot be compensated. I want to avoid any confusion, so let's make sure to stay diligent about our timekeeping. We don't need to remind you every week when it's time for payroll, as it's our collective responsibility.It's important that everyone takes their responsibilities seriously and completes all tasks as required. This isn't just a paycheck for any of us; it's about contributing to the success of the team and the company as a whole.

Lastly, if anyone handles a bill that exceeds $50, it could have severe consequences for the entire shift. I've been reviewing video footage and it's crucial that we handle transactions with care and attention to detail. Let's ensure we're representing our team well.

I've been closely observing and assessing our store operations. I believe in the potential of each of you, and I hope to see everyone thrive. Please consider this a formal written and verbal warning. I won't repeat myself, and further non-compliance might lead to necessary actions being taken.Thank you for your understanding, and let's continue to work together to make our store successful.

She was actually my employee before I moved to another city, and she was amazing at her job. So when I left for another city and became a manager at another location, I gave her my job because I had high hopes for her.

In the beginning, it was fine. She would text me some questions because she didn’t want to bother her supervisor, and I was always happy to help however I could.

But a few months down the line, she started venting about her team (my old team), telling me that they were lazy, and didn’t do their job right. I was very confused, because I was the one who trained those girls, and they were fantastic employees.

One day I received a text message from one of her team members (we all kept contact after I left because we grew really close after years of working together), and told me that almost the whole team had just quit. When I asked her what happened, she showed me screenshot after screenshot of my ex-friend berating her team in all caps like the lunatic in the post. She would do that every single day. You forgot to wipe down the counter before leaving? She would lose her absolute mind. I’m still mad about this, over 2 years later. She drove away amazing people with passion and drive over stupid shit.

I was so embarrassed to have left my team with a person I thought was competent. Holy shit do I regret it to this day.

1. They'll actually produce something that's worth something;
2. They also quit all by themselves at some point.

See, if you're not manager material, you will HATE your job. Especially when reasonable expectations are laid out before you.

It's the law for about 99.7% of Americans. It's not federal, but it is very nearly universal. I guess I could add ""Montana excepted"", but I'm not really going to go through the effort in most conversations given the extremely narrow slice of people who that exception applies to.

>If a state fails to uphold their laws that weakens their legal system, which a state who's existence is defined in legal code is won't to do.

Abuses of laborers is both one of the largest and most unpunished crimes in the United States. I could be kinder and say that many regulators themselves intend to do their jobs, but, in practice, many Americans live in states where they do not feel they can rely on state regulators to protect them.

If it makes you feel better, it's more that the regime around regulation of labor is quite weak in most states. The fact that regulators need to be handed a workable case (to maybe be resolved in a year or several years, while they're forced to find other work to get by) by the victim instead of helping them build that case is *precisely* the thing I'm talking about.

They also wanted me to sign into the local union right there that would take a surprisingly large bite of the offered minimum wage job.

I said I needed to read the full union agreement at home, took it home and told them to remove me from their system when they called back.

40 years ago, way waaaay more people were with unions in the US than there are today.

As someone who lives in a country where not being in a union is considered very weird, what do unions offer their participants?  
Here in Iceland, the unions often have summer cabins members can rent for cheap during the summer, these are houses in areas often unavailable to regular working people, or otherwise, they'd be so expensive, you'd worry the entire vacation.

They lobby annually for raises in our salaries, have open, free legal services to ask if we're being underpaid, or cheated. Not only that, but they will take your employer to court (free of charge) if the employer is found to be illegally underpaying you.

Unions are also baked into the pension fund system with different unions backing/being backed by different pension funds, offering differing loan qualities (lower tax/protected interest etc).

But wait, there's more.

Seeking re-education? Need/want a permit to drive a forklift? Need or want to get a commercial driver's license? Hit 'em up. They'll literally offer to pay up to 50% of the cost, and here in Iceland where a commercial driver's license (everything included) runs about $5400 usd, having a union pay 50% is very welcome.

The unions here literally offer to partake in paying for re-education of pretty much any kind, outside of colleges because colleges here are dirt cheap.",Brolafsky,t2_umh42,3,0,reddit1

It's bullshit. Its *sales*. Unless it's a *sales* job interview, there's absolutely no place for it in the onboarding process.

Nowhere else in business are you allowed to divulge the price you intend to pay only *after* you get a commitment from the seller. 

I'm selling my labor to cover my overhead costs and hopefully turn a profit. I am a business. Why would I *ever* accept a contract from another business if they won't be upfront about whether I will be able to turn a profit or not?

They don't play these kinds of games when they're discussing business between businesses, because there's a baseline attempt at maintaining a respectful relationship. Employers will burn you down if you decline their job offer, and burn you down just the same for accepting it.

i51gnrl,t1_i50v4c4,2022-04-17 03:29:55,WorkReform,"I have three stories of three generations before me (I’m a milleni-old):

Great grandpa got a job as an engineer with the railroad.  WWII was going on and most young men were at war.  He was too old to go to war but young enough to do the work, and the other option was to hire women.  He worked a good union job for the next 20 years and retired a wealthy man.

Gramps left the coast guard, took a telephone test for Bell, and was hired in the Switch room.  Most employees were women, so he was promoted quickly to management and worked his way up the ladder.  He was an executive for the Houston region of southwestern Bell when he retired at 55 a wealthy man.

My dad (boomer) graduated high school, left the navy, and was referred to the gas company by one of his friends.  He worked there for 25 years before he died at 46.  Wasn’t as wealthy as the other two but he made a very good living and had all the comforts like a nice house, boat, two Harleys, and a new truck.

I went to college for computer science, went to the navy, and my gramps had to help me pay bills because my first IT job only paid 15 an hour.  I’m actually doing very well now but I’d say alot of that was circumstantial.",SweetCosmicPope,t2_169t3k,144,0,reddit1

Those 100-hour weeks everyone's on about in here and on the other sub? Yeah, I worked 'em. Was working essentially full time at age 10, overtime in high school, and 100ish hours through the 1980s. Never earned $30k in a single year, even with all that OT. Lived in an area where people got laid off annually, and was ALWAYS looking for better jobs. Sexual harassment was rampant, to the point where I'd ask outright about that and substance abuse during interviews. They'd lie.

Health insurance was better then--if you could get it. Higher education was cheaper, and student loans could actually be paid back because interest rates (for those loans) were subsidized and reasonable.

I'd also like to point out that we had many of the same complaints. Check out ""Move Over"" by Steppenwolf sometime. It's a good tune that goes with this movement.

A lot of people in your/my parents generation have struggled, and I agree with the fact that blaming boomers is divisive and a gross over generalization.  A larger share of boomers have benefitted from the deteriorating system than younger generations, and the share has been shrinking with each one.  But it's not the fault of baby boomers.  It's a system that has been in place for far longer and has grown more insidious as the years have gone by.  True, there are things that are easier now, but the fact is that there's a capitalist oligarch class that owns the rest of us by profiting off of every aspect of our lives.  This system buried my mother, a boomer, because we have a for profit healthcare system.  She didn't create or benefit from the system.  My dad has, but he's also struggled really hard.

I think people are more pissed off by the type of baby boomer in the first comment, but by blaming an entire generation for the behavior of a few, we're buying into the same divisive propaganda that people like that guy are.

i5fw5ss,t1_i57wopc,2022-04-20 04:17:34,WorkReform,"I’m Gen X. I remember gas being, at its lowest, 89 cents I think. In middle school my dad was laid off from his corporate managerial job when the company got bought out by a guy who ended up moving to the Bahamas for tax purposes. My dad was too junior to get a golden parachute, and too old for companies to want to hire him afterwards. The company gave him a clock and a $300/month pension for his 14 years of service. We had to sell our house and rent for the rest of my childhood.

We had one car. I never had a car until well into my state college tenure, and that was partly from my part time job I balanced with my full time coursework. I never lived in a state where the drinking age was less than 21 by the time I was 18.

I never have had a private sector job that offered a pension plan, only 401k’s at best. Every job I had, I heard from the old timers “ah you missed the good old days, kid.”

At almost every job I’ve had, I’ve had to teach my boss how to use their own computer.

inuqjyf,t3_xad7gu,2022-09-10 13:32:47,WorkReform,"Agreed. Every sales job I have ever worked has paid a base salary. The higher the commissions typically were, the higher the base salary became. That’s how sales is supposed to work. 

These jobs without a base salary are almost all churn-n-burn types. 99% of the employees haven’t been there for more than a few months except the handful of people who might have been there before the base salary got dropped (and they won’t tell you that, so that you think they made it on their own).

The only reason I remain in sales is because it’s often way more beneficial to be a sales employee than any other type of employee (with reasonable exceptions). Sales employees are almost always treated significantly better. It sucks that it is that way, but ultimately it is one of the best ways to make sure you aren’t treated like shit.

That’s not to say I haven’t worked entry level sales jobs that treated me like garbage and weren’t super hard for metrics/KPIs. But there’s a certain point you reach where you aren’t micromanaged to that extent, when you can escape those. 

Also metrics and KPIs do suck if they’re unreasonable and some churn n burn companies will enforce them heavily to prevent you from getting bonuses, so identifying those places before taking employment (or at the very least leaving them immediately when you notice they’re like that) can sometimes be tough until you get used to the warning signs.",TypeNirvash,t2_1kasnx0k,10,0,reddit2

I got lured in to do car sales because I needed a job and was told I could be making $80k plus easy, and that most salesmen made roughly $50-60k. My absolute best month there after four years is probably made $6k as the salesman of the month. Average though? I probably made $2500 a month average. And, that was working 50-60 hour weeks, with frequent 18 hr days and 70+ hr weeks. So incredibly not worth it, especially given how hostile the work environment was. They absolutely churned through sales people. We had a list running and I’d bet it was easily over 100 people that had quit/termed over my four years.

What they mean is they don’t want people applying for just the salary who don’t meet the basic qualifications eg, having entry level apply for VP level roles, because it takes them longer/more work. All I hear when companies tow this line is “We take shortcuts in actually finding suitable solutions to our problems/feedback from employees and implement inefficient processes”
In reality, by not advertising (a shit salary) you’re wasting your efforts interviewing the wrong candidates who will decline your bad offer . By not advertising ( a good salary) , you’re likely missing out on quality candidates who would be enticed by your compensation. Implementing better workflows to vet candidates and actually learning the nuances of the AI software you use to review initial CVs would help solve the problem of “just in it for the money” rather than just crossing your fingers that you didn’t undercut your salary band too much for this person. 

It’s absolutely ludicrous to me that recruiters have no idea what my current pay range is and try to hire me with a 50% pay decrease. My pay range is accessible through sites like Glassdoor. It’s such a massive waste of time when they could be securing candidates who would see a pay increase.

They wanted to bring me in, but the job would have me consulting with and selling products I didn't especially like, with a slimmed-down insurance and benefits package.

So, lessee... doing work I wasn't thrilled about, with worse insurance, and no raise or seniority of any kind.  They wouldn't flex on the salary.  So... hard pass.

Money (fuck you) motivation.


Once during an evaluation for my attitude at work for being the guy that gets called on to assist everyone (but no one shows to help me when I needed it) since I was so well versed in all areas, I complained that I'm doing more than two people's jobs for one person's pay and if I were compensated better I would feel vindicated for my effort.

She asked me (in her 200 dollar MK shoes and with her 65k/year salary) if money was the reason I came to work? I asked her isn't it for you? You want less money? She had nothing.

I don't care what your job advert is, I can (and probably have) done it. I need to know if it pays enough for me to stop doing what I currently do, to come over and talk to you.

My current venture bills out $150/hr, with a $225 minimum. If I take 30 minutes out to chat with you about the job and you tell me it's some 70k, but it's the experience, I WILL send you a bill.

Since it was all grade based this meant you needed something like 25 years to get to the top of your grade. Previously this had taken 5 years but they changed it, froze it for years entirely and this was the pathetic solution. National minimum wage changes actually forced them to group 6 different grades together in order to finally pay them all it. Meaning all the people who had gone up loads to get considerably more, taken years long courses and qualifications, were now barely earning anything more than the others.

If you produce a car and sell it for $50,000 and the workers get less than $50,000, then the workers are getting less than the total value of their labour. If workers don't come to work, no labour is produced and no profit is made. If bosses don't come to work, everything continues without them. Business owners are not needed for a business to thrive.

ilmxblx,t1_ill4tll,2022-08-24 19:43:06,WorkReform,"Pfft. I have no sympathy for people who choose to waste people's time. Ive started looking at it like this. If they don't value your time when you are applying, they will undervalue it when you work for them. The real answer is not to apply for jobs that do not post their salary. If they waste your time and you have time to kill, waste as much of theirs as possible. Time is money and I'm sick of crap employers thinking they are entitled to wasting other people's time, especially when simply posting the salary range would save everyone a bunch of time. 

If they actually cared about turnover, they'd value people to begin with. Employees shouldn't care about the turnover if employers do not. Actions speak louder than words. If a company constantly does things that are likely to increase turnover, they dont care about turnover and neither should you, except to consider leaving because the understaffing makes your job more difficult.  

Having high turnover is not good from a financial standpoint but that isn't on individual employees like you seem to think. Most people ive met dont like job hunting. Most people would avoid it if circumstances are fortuitous enough. Do not frame it as job-hopping that makes it sound like an individual problem the employer can't avoid. Its turnover because it is usually the employers fault and something they can impact and choose not to.

Their approach doesn't even work. They get desperate people who lie about/avoid saying they are only in it for the money. People who accept a low offer out of desperation are likely to keep looking and will jump ship.",WomenAreFemaleWhat,t2_cal4qu84,3,0,reddit3

You learn fast and you begin to bring far more value to the company than at first. If they’re good they’ll compensate you fairly, but in reality most places don’t react. So the smart move, is to move. However as you progress in your career and have experienced a few companies you should be a better judge of what a good company sounds and feels like. 

Once you’ve found a company that treats it’s employees well, it’s worth sticking there and if it takes a little force every now and then to get the compensation you are worth then fine. It’s like a relationship where your partner gets a bit too comfortable and doesn’t put in the effort.

ilowdqe,t1_iln7r8l,2022-08-25 04:04:53,WorkReform,"I worked in recruitment for 7 years and was actually pretty good at it but the entire industry is a scam. Everything that comes out of a recruiters mouth is purely intended to benefit themselves. They are the most money hungry people in existence and every single firm is purely motivated by money. If a recruiter places someone in a job and that jobs pays $100,000 a year then they can charge between 25% to 35% fee. So in this case they would get $25,000 to $35,000 just for finding you a job. You might think well they are highly qualified professionals and work incredibly long hours and do all this networking with company decision makers! In reality anyone can walk in off the street and start being a recruitment consultant. Firstly you promote yourself to Senior Consultant on day 1 as it means nothing and impresses candidates and clients. You may want to call yourself a “head hunter”, it sounds good but just means that you had a job vacancy with a company but couldn’t find any good cv’s so instead you ring up all the rival companies pretending to be a customer try to find the person who does the exact same job role as your vacancy for a rival company. You feed them some garbage to try and tempt them to change companies to take your job role. If they do then congratulations your a “head hunter”. All they do all day apart from browse porn is just search CV websites. The agency’s pay for a subscription to the CV websites and then it’s as simple as using a search engine to find what you need. People put all their persons; details on their cv’s like indoors. Imagine what I can do with your name, date of birth, address, phone numbers, email, even social security number in many cases. Most consultants are just 20 somethings looking to earn some beer money. With a laptop and a mobile phone I can be a recruitment consultant from anywhere in the world. Your probably thinking well surely companies wouldn’t give a job vacancy to a shady random guy who calls them up. Of course they would, besides I’d take your CV and ring all these company’s up pretending to represent you, they might not want you but they’ll probably want someone else somewhere in the company and that’s when I get them to tell me the details and bingo I’ve now got a job to fill. If I’m feeling particularly heartless I’ll just look at your CV to see where you work and then ring your boss up and accidentally on purpose let them know your looking to move on so they will need a replacement. They will appreciate me informing on you and welcome any suitable candidates I might have to replace you. That’s why I just love it when your dumb enough to include your references on the CV because you are giving me the name and contact details of the guy who likely hired you so I can call him direct, pretend I know you and just casually mention that I have other candidates of your calibre looking for employment.  If they gave you a job then that means I know what kind of people they will employ because I can see what job and experience you had prior to joining them. 

As for the don’t ask about salary bullsh*t recruiters are always going on about its best to think of the job interview as like going on a date with an attractive lady. Obviously your end goal is to get laid but you can’t just come out and say that to a woman, instead you have to spend some times making her think you really are interested in her and you are on a date with her because she’s really interesting. Obviously you don’t say your there because she’s got great tits and you think she might be a slut who will give it up on the first date. That’s the salary game, you just charm whoever is interviewing you, throw in 2 facts about their company that you can get off their company website as it makes it look like you really do like this specific company and are not just looking for anything as you desperately need money. Trust me no one will offer you a job without telling you the pay so you don’t need to ask about plus you can always negotiate it when they make you an offer where as if the state it at interview that’s pretty much set in stone now. If you really want to understand why companies insist of lying to themselves that they will get someone who wants the job for more than just the money I suggest you put up a job advert somewhere and just watch as you get inundated with applications from people who haven’t even read the job description. Imagin getting 500 CV’s for just 1 job role because the internet means all of us can just one click apply. It’s soul destroying because it costs the company a lot to recruit and if they choose the wrong person who will leave after a week then it’s considerably more costly. So they just want a sign that you’ll still respect them in the morning before they drop their panties for you and it’s so easy for you to just think about something different to ask at the end of the interview when they say “so do you have any questions for us” and their hearts drop as their 50th person their interviewed replies with “how much will I get paid”. If you just see it as a game and realise the whole process is intended for the company to weed out the time wasters so they don’t hire yet another clown who quits after a week then it becomes bearable. No one in the world applies for a job for any other reason than money and they know that but they want you to play the game. I’d coach all my candidates to ensure they all passed the interview and got an offer and it was easy for me to do because there is a generic formula for all job interviews it’s just most people only do it 4 or 5 times in their entire life so it’s alien to them. I’d be talking to the candidates and the employers for 1000’a of jobs, getting to see both sides and learning how someone can ensure they get offered the job every single time. If they offer you an interview it’s because they think you are potentially suitable for the job already so there’s no excuse to not get the job. The best advice I can give everyone though is NEVER USE RECRUITMENT CONSULTANTS just do it yourself, you know already which company’s hire people like you and 90% of job roles are never advertised so don’t wait to see the job advert in the paper as that’s like waiting for a girl to come ask you for sex.",MARINE-BOY,t2_ja3jjd3c,1,0,reddit3

If you look at the estimates of the jobs that actually need to be done (1970s I saw a report from the Rand Corporation (?) that 90% of the jobs could be automated - with 70s tech!),then paying a living UBI would make jobs a privilege, or a perk.

But I was a freelancer, and the client had a rule that they couldn't hire freelancers for more than 2 years (because of vague freelancer/employment rules by the tax service), but I wasn't ready to go, and I was afraid the project would slow down or die without me, so I became an employee. Negotiated as hard as I could to get pay that wouldn't be too big of a step back, but failed. Nobody doubted I was worth it, but they simply refused to use the two highest pay scales they had available for engineers. It was too big of a step back, but I did it anyway, and don't regret it, but I didn't last a year.

I was passionate about that project, but I left because of money. Now I'm passionate about a project that pays a lot more than that project did even when I was a freelancer.

Whilst I agree with the thrust of your argument, this is oversimplified. The workers making the car depend on tools, machinery, resources/materials, and infrastructure; the eventual sale of the car also depends on logistics, advertising, branding, real estate, and so on. That stuff all has to be paid for.

To put it another way, the value of a worker's labour can in some part be dependent on the business that employs them.

You represent 1% of the company's labour, yet when you negotiate wages/benefits alone, you are across the table from a guy representing 100% of the capital. 100% will crush 1% like a fucking bug. You will NEVER get a fair deal. Even if you're a super-worker doing the work of three other workers, you only still represent 3% of output.  


Now, if you and your fellow 99 employees all vote to unionize and appoint a negotiator to represent you all, collectively, he will sit across the table from the owner and now it's a guy representing 100% of the labour bargaining with a guy representing 100% of the capital.

They are workplaces that function almost entirely like any other place, the only difference is that it is not privately owned. The workers collectively own the workplace and they interview, hire and fire their own bosses. Turns out: when you get rid of a business owner, the business and the workers are much better off. This is because business owners are parasitic in nature. They leech.

In a cooperative, labour gets produced, materials get consumed, sales get made, but the profits go to the workers who then decide collectively where to invest the profits. They can spend it on R&D, they can hire more workers or expand their workplace, or they can give themselves all raises. It's still a workplace, but it's not exploitative of the people who do the actual labour. No one person owns it. If you have someone hassling you about your productivity, it's not because some shareholders or your boss' boss' boss is unhappy, it's because your coworkers feel you're not doing enough. And if you look at the statistics and studies around cooperatives, they are far more efficient than regular workplaces partly because workers choose to work harder when they are a partial owner of the business, and they are far more likely to succeed past the first ten years because they are better at addressing challenges. When you look at, say, COVID, shitloads of businesses closed up, but very few cooperatives went out of business. Workers can collectively choose their own benefits, schedules and quotas, allowing more time off for family or more options for child care. The workers are better paid, less worked and much happier, and the business thrives because there's nobody stealing 300x more than the average employee's income, plus bonuses.

Sadly they are more common outside of the US, because American banks have policies against loaning money to cooperative startups. The only reason that business owners exist is because of private property laws that say one person is allowed to own an entire workplace. Workers are beginning to wake up to the fact that this is just a legal framework for exploitation.


Tl;dr I'm making a statement of fact, not opinion. Business owners are unnecessary.

So your problem is with shareholders who aren't also employees of the business, right? The CEO and most of the board are workers, by your definition, since they produce labour with their brains. As long as an owner turns up to the office/factory/etc and does something, it's all fine?

> No one person owns it. And if you look at the statistics and studies around cooperatives, they are far more efficient than regular workplaces partly because workers choose to work harder when they are a partial owner of the business, and they are far more likely to succeed past the first ten years because they are better at addressing challenges

This isn't all that uncommon now. Most big companies issue share options to employees. You started off by talking about car manufacturing companies and suchlike, but none of those are owned by one person. Perhaps a better example would be a local pizza joint or dog grooming company? Those evil bastards.

> Sadly they are more common outside of the US, because American banks have policies against loaning money to cooperative startups. 

_Most_ startups are cooperative startups by your definition.

> The only reason that business owners exist is because of private property laws that say one person is allowed to own an entire workplace

So if I want to use my tech skills to set up a business building PCs, for example, I should be legally forbidden from doing it myself? If after a couple of years I've built it enough to require another employee, I should be legally compelled to hand them what, 50% of the business on top of their salary? 30%? 10%? How much? What happens when they leave, do I have to buy back my own shares that I was forced to give away?

ilpylvc,t1_ilpgou6,2022-08-25 11:41:57,WorkReform,"Alright fine. This will be my last reply to you.

My original statement was that business owners are unnecessary. I have not backed away from that. I referred to worker-owners as workers in order to keep them separate from owners for the sake of simplicity. That much has been obvious from the start, but you focused on the semantics like it was a win. Well done, you missed the entire argument.

Secondly, everything you've brought up as a point against me is ridiculous. ""If the workers kept all the profits, the business would fail"". At no point did I say the worker-owners should keep all the profits. I said the profits should go to the worker-owners, and as I explained in that same post, the worker-owners collectively own the business. Therefore the worker-owners would decide where the money should go, which could include just keeping it, as opposed to a traditional workplace where workers perform all the labour but have no democratic say in how the profits of their labour is spent, and the bulk of it goes to the owners who did no work. Your question is childish because, like every other question you raised, it would also cause any traditional business to fail if the owner took all the money and didn't invest any into the business, that still doesn't justify executives taking home 300x what the average worker earns.

Every other question you raised follows this same ridiculous logic. You take my argument and pump it up to 1000% and say ""This wouldn't work if we did that!"" It's like you have Ben Shapiro brain, someone says ""I like burgers better than hotdogs"" and you respond with ""You fool! If you ate only burgers and nothing else, you'd become obese and die!"" You're a child, you think like a child and as I said I do not take you to be a serious person.

Lastly, welcome to /r workreform. It's literally in the name. People come here to discuss unfair work conditions and propose solutions. I believe worker cooperatives are significantly better workplaces than traditional workplaces because they are less exploitative, more democratic and more efficient. You haven't raised any argument against me except to raise childish questions that I never intended to address or defend because they are ridiculous. You've wasted my time. You've wasted the time of everyone else who responded to you. I'm not sure if you're a troll or just a kid who thinks this is acceptable behaviour in a work reform thread, and I don't care.

I asked you for clarification on this, given that by this definition CEOs are worker-owners and a huge number of companies that give share options to employees also fit your definition. Wonder why you ignored it.

> Secondly, everything you've brought up as a point against me is ridiculous. ""If the workers kept all the profits, the business would fail"". At no point did I say the worker-owners should keep all the profits. I said the profits should go to the worker-owners, and as I explained in that same post, the worker-owners collectively own the business

Actually what you said was ""if you produce a car and sell it for $50,000 and the workers get less than $50,000, then the workers are getting less than the total value of their labour"". No mention of _profit_ there, that $50k is revenue. And no mention of it going into a company account, you said the workers get the money. Glad to see you're backing away from such a ridiculous claim, though.

> Therefore the worker-owners would decide where the money should go, which could include just keeping it, as opposed to a traditional workplace where workers perform all the labour but have no democratic say in how the profits of their labour is spent, and the bulk of it goes to the owners who did no work

CEOs are worker-owners by your definition, and so is every employee owning stock. Assuming your real problem here is simply with non-employee shareholders, who are the only ones 'doing no work', I will give you an opportunity to show to me a publicly-traded company that pays more than 50% of revenue as dividends. Go.

> Your question is childish because, like every other question you raised, it would also cause any traditional business to fail if the owner took all the money and didn't invest any into the business, that still doesn't justify executives taking home 300x what the average worker earns.

Executives are worker-owners by your definition.

> Every other question you raised follows this same ridiculous logic. You take my argument and pump it up to 1000% and say ""This wouldn't work if we did that!""

It's hilarious how you're trying to accuse me of exaggerated arguments when you are saying ""all companies should be worker owned"" and I'm saying ""that doesn't work in every situation"" and gave you an example which you've avoided addressing like the plague. Only one of us is pumping up to 1000% here, and it ain't me.

> Lastly, welcome to /r workreform. It's literally in the name. People come here to discuss unfair work conditions and propose solutions. I believe worker cooperatives are significantly better workplaces than traditional workplaces because they are less exploitative, more democratic and more efficient

I haven't argued with that, and until you understand that you're going to continue making yourself look stupid. Try answering some of the questions I've asked you, they may bring some much needed clarity to your thinking.

> You haven't raised any argument against me except to raise childish questions that I never intended to address or defend because they are ridiculous

I have raised plenty of arguments and you've ignored them all. If you think that's ridiculous then that's your prerogative, but I would point out that I'm using _your_ definitions to make those points, so is calling it ridiculous really doing you any favours?

File unemployment.

There are 2 classes of employees:  Exempt - Overtime is not legally required to be paid, and Non-Exempt - Overtime is legally required to be paid.

You can be Salary Exempt, Salary Non-Exempt, Hourly Exempt (much much harder) and Hourly Non-Exempt.

There are legal qualifiers for the overtime exemption class.  It is something worth every employee looking into, as, if YOU don't know your classification, you can bet those who are legally required to know the difference will fob you off with an incorrect classification.

JUST BECAUSE YOU EARN A SALARY DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE EXEMPT FROM OVERTIME PAY!

Salaried employees just earn a regular salary for each pay period where any work is done, whether they work 30 minutes or 10 hours.  Now, whether 2 of those hours are at the O/T rate depend on the state and whether OT is calculated daily, or weekly, or over the course of a pay period.

Hourly employees require pay for any work-related activity, whether scheduled or not.  Required for a meeting on your day off? Clock the hell in. Get roped into something before/after work? Clock the hell (back) in!  Employer calls you for something while you are on the beach?

iie94x9,t1_iidtz1b,2022-07-31 16:04:48,WorkReform,"I hear what you’re saying and disagree on a few points.

Labor IS capitol in a capitalist society, and the idea of labor unions functioning as the bankers for labor is interesting. 

However, the main mechanism of capitalism is to keep as much profit as possible for the lowest price. For those who own the means of production, bargaining with individuals for their labor (rather than unions) has historically given them a better (lower) price for labor, which they will take whenever possible. Why bargain with the labor “bankers” when you can set your own terms/price/interest and make more profit? Wealthy people & entities who fight unions to get the lowest price for labor absolutely *are* real capitalists- they are interested in keeping the supply, demand, and price of labor in their favor, which is kind of the whole point.

Labor unions exist as a kind of reform to pure capitalism- ie, capitalism came first and labor unions were born as a response to the problems that arose from it. They function to give the working class better bargaining power with those who own the means of production- so sure, someone from the working class can be a capitalist with the caveat that they support labor unions as a tool for securing the highest value for their labor, but the people with the most capitol will continue to rule a capitalist society. They will attempt to devalue that labor however they can, or will walk away from the bargaining table to get that cheap labor somewhere else. 

Doing so does not make them anti-capitalist, they gained their power by being the *best* at capitalism.

The claim that true Libertarians support unions feels a little closer to the truth, since the ideals of early libertarianism were pretty far left and closer to what we might call social anarchy or libertarian Marxism/communism/socialism or under a modern lens. 

The movement had a lot of anti-capitalist ideals- including a general predilection to abolish private ownership of the means of production. 

But like you mentioned with “what the Republicans call libertarianism”, there are a lot of conflicting offshoots of libertarianism that are based on different ideas of what “personal liberty” means- it’s not hard to see where people who are into intense individual freedom and would see…

A. Being asked to pay union dues, to strike in solidarity, and to refuse to cross picket lines as a coercive violation of their personal freedom

or

B. See labor unions as an unacceptable compromise to the capitalist labor structures which violate their personal freedoms in the first place. 

*Not throwing shade on you by the way, I genuinely like talking about social/economic/political structures and am open to discourse and being wrong.

Why would you think such a thing? Starbucks might feel like they're fighting a losing battle, but closing stores that attempt to unionize is an absolutely timeless strategy for fighting off unionization. Not to mention the numbers that were mentioned where unionizing stores represent 2% of all Starbucks locations, but 40% of closures. I mean if I were interested in unionizing and then I saw stores getting closed left and right for doing so, you can bet I'd be a little trepidatious about continuing my efforts. I'm a little flabbergasted by what you're saying actually. Corporations have a significant track record of closing stores to fight unionization. [Here's](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-unionized-wal-mart-workers-win-supreme-court-victory-1.2689646) an example of wal-mart attempting to do just that, but thankfully, one of the few cases where the justice system saw what they were trying to do and ordered restitution for the employees.

&nbsp;

Maybe I guess I should clarify your thinking. I suppose you do generally believe that Starbucks is engaging in union-busting activity, but you're just not sufficiently convinced that they are closing unionizing stores as part of that effort?",_Sinnik_,t2_14f4yq,1,0,reddit2

Its rare to find someone capable and willing to push past that. I think it was linked to some sort of fight or flight preservation instinct but its been a while since I read the article.

There are two tricks, never tell them they're wrong or directly disagree, its why you hear the ""make them think its their idea"" thing so much in media. People have picked up on it being one of the only effective way to convince someone to do something and if you're objectively right and they're objectively wrong all it takes is time.

The other trick is forcing them to confront or face their issues and realize they're wrong on their own, none of your opinions. There are numerous stories of black men converting racist assholes from their beliefs simply by going out of their way to befriend them, shame the US is such a big place.

Id advise you to avoid arguments about this with strangers. You've neither the time nor (probably) the skill to whittle down their beliefs in a single conversation, pleasantly provide the information and move on if they argue just wish them best, if you're so inclined pray they see sanity and move on.

If you want to spend the time spend it on someone you know, a friend with some questionable ideas, a family member consuming too much of the wrong media. Check in with them, provide them with different information sources, question their crazy opinions in a curious way rather than a confrontational one.

I've converted a few of my closest friends away from the homophobia we were all raised around doing this. I've gutted my sisters crazy conspiracy theory obsession, it works, and I wish you the best, thanks for even trying to fight the real good fight.",greentarget33,t2_7r74854y,8,0,reddit3

I’d appreciate if the bill or law specified that inflation regulation does NOT constitute as a performance review increase in wages and does not replace any bonuses. 

There would need to be a randomized audit and it would have to be overseen until we could safely say that businesses were complying with the new standard, but it COULD be done.

It has been customary to not list it which is changing but to me is not some deal breaker.  I have had three jobs post higher education.

I am in sales so me negotiating with them was seen as a good thing; if I cannot communicate and negotiate for myself, how could I be expected to have the skills and abilities to do the save for them in practice.

For a good chunk of my 30-year career, I've worked for guys like this (they're almost always guys).  Your boss is a broken man, and he will not change his behavior towards you any time soon - for as long as you will know him.  If you do not get him out of your life, he will relentlessly chip away at your drive, motivation, and professionalism until you are as broken and as shitty a person as he is.

*You need to solve your problem*.

Unless you are in an unusually professional company, HR will be less than useless to you.  Plus if he's joking that your wife is a hooker loudly and in public, there is no way that HR or his boss *doesn't* know he's an asshole.  (Everyone in a company knows exactly who the assholes are.)

Your solution has short-term and long-term elements:

Short-term:  Be. On. Time. For everything.  Your boss is what I lie to all a ""time accountant"".  He cares far more about watching the clock than what you do while you are there.  Come to work on time.  Take  *all*  of your breaks.  On time.  For *exactly* the allotted time.  Leave on time.  Precisely on time.  No matter what.  Clearly he's paying you for your time and not for your work, so give him exactly that.  And make sure you don't spend time off the clock thinking about work stuff - especially planning how to do tomorrow's work.

Long-term:  GTFO of there.  He will only change when - *in his eyes* \- his behavior causes him more pain than it's worth.

Then you are classified salaried - exempt. They legally cannot make you work certain hours, you get to pick them as long as the job gets done. If they are requiring you to be there at a certain time, document. Document. And document more. Keep track of all overtime worked. And then submit a complaint with the DoL that you were misclassified and that, since they are dictating your hours, you are owed overtime pay at 1.5x for all time worked over 40 hours. 


You'll get a nice fat payout, and they'll either A) permanently reclassify you as salaried, non-exempt and you'll keep getting OT pay or B) your manager's boss will strong him up and make sure he never tried to tell you what hours you need to be there for ever again.



Edit: to clarify, that is assuming you aren't making 6 figures or more, and a few other things; and is overall a simplification of the law. But having set hours you're required to be there for disqualifies you from most of the exemption options that would let them not pay you for OT.",mcscrewgal74,t2_r83xouh7,0,0,reddit1

ip1vs6t,t1_ip190vu,2022-09-19 11:41:58,WorkReform,"Nope. Salaried workers can’t pick their hours, necessarily. I’ve looked this up. The company can legally specify working hours for salaried exempt employees. However, what they can’t do is deduct pay if the employee doesn’t meet those scheduled hours. They can deduct from a paid leave balance for employees not working the required schedule, including having that balance go negative, but they must (usually) always pay the employee the same amount every week if the employee performed any work that week.

Essentially, my understanding is that they can say you have to work a set schedule, but short of reducing your PTO if you don’t, they are limited to firing you to enforce this, as they can have disciplinary  options but you can’t reduce an exempt employee’s salary for disciplinary actions except for serious violations of policy (essentially major safety violations or sexual harassment), and only then in full day increments.",Crusher7485,t2_3jqphef,2,0,reddit1

I tell them that they aren't my family, that it's a business arrangement where I sell them my time and expertise for an agreed upon sum, where I show up to do the work as expected, and then leave.

1. Fill out the most frustratingly redundant applications online. Already answered that question? No problem, do it again!
2. Do that 45 times a week. 
3. Wait weeks and weeks to hear back.
4. Find out that the person you heard back from is a recruiter and not the company offering the job.
5. Interview. Several rounds of it. This also takes weeks.
6. Finally screw up the courage to ask about the pay. 
7. Get treated like an asshole for even asking.
8. Find out it's an unpaid internship or pays so insultingly little that you cannot support yourself on that job. 
9. Waste 2 months on this.

Most places who don't post their salary or wage usually wait until they make an offer to disclose any pay related information.

I negotiate with a client for a rate to pay the client and obviously pay for company expenses. 

For example if I was billing a client $50/hour for services I could probably get away with paying the candidate up to $30/hour. Even the hourly pay rate is at my discretion. I could pay one person $30/ hour and the next $19/hour for the same services because I also make money on the deal. Higher margin = higher commissions. 

Experience levels also can affect a rate for some things.   In an interview I always ask what their desired hourly payrate is and every deal I've put together, I have been able to pay either the desired rate or higher by 20%.

I suspect they were happy I gave a low number. I got accepted immediately, which was another red flag, and started the next day. I still didn't know exactly what I would be doing, but I needed the money, so I decided to do my best. The next day, they showed me what my job really was and it was not an IT consultant. It was not worth the salary, and I should have been paid ten times more than what I asked. It was also a kind of illegal job. I quit on the spot and they were shocked.

Maybe they should also post the full cost of training, to show why some people were offered less. just hired one guy who will require 20K worth of training in the first 18 months. Once his training is complete, he will get a raise to bring him in line with the rest of the full trained staff.

It is a waste of everyone's time. It should be made a requirement that salary for the role, or even the range is detailed before wasting someone's time.

Usually the types of applicants you get for the jobs where the salary is not specified, they are the ones who are literally desperate for a job, may lack the experience required as well if any, and may not have even bothered to thoroughly read the job specification.

Put it this way, even if I was curious about a job where salary was not disclosed, and I applied, I guarantee I would only chuck in an application if I was able to copy/paste covering letter and drop CV into them.

Every generation, *every single one*, gets their turn to be the lazy, disrespectful, good-for-nothing assholes who are going to wreck everything, and frankly, maybe if we’d actually wrecked *more* things that needed wrecking the world would be in a better state today.

Information asymmetry is a weapon. Hiding information relevant to an important decision is an innately hostile act meant to lead people into worse decisions for themselves. I’m happy for all the people who say they’ve never followed up on a listing without salary stated upfront. I wouldn’t *now*, but I can’t say I never have. It wasn’t even possible early-mid career for me. “Competitive” or “D.O.E.” (“depends-on-experience” if anyone needs that expanded) was on literally every job listing.

I figured out long ago that the point of all this isn’t just to lowball you. It’s to put you on the defensive. Same with ads that offer “$20k-$200k” or the like. What they’re doing is building an opportunity to make the conversation about the ways in which you don’t measure up to some imaginary standard, which in turn just primes you to accept worse than you otherwise would.

I won’t argue with anybody who just won’t waste their time with the whole thing, but if you felt inclined, it might be a really effective (or at least fun) approach to ask hard questions about the foundation of the “you suck” narrative their process is trying to build. “Competitive” should lead to questions like:  

 - Competitive with whom? Who are your competitors for talent?
 - If and when they do, what reasons do people give for accepting competing offers instead of yours?
 - If your pay is competitive, you must have spent some time researching the market. How did you go about selecting comps for this role? Without naming names, describe for me one or two other positions you surveyed when establishing your compensation scale.

For companies with ranges posted, particularly exceptionally wide ones, ask them to describe for you an ideal or actual candidate who would be hired at the top listed salary. What skills and habits would or did this person demonstrate? How much experience would/did they have? In some cases that will just outright earn you a moment of candor from the interviewer, who will admit nobody makes the top end. Most likely the interviewer isn’t making anywhere near it either. Being unable or unwilling to answer just means the top end is a fiction but they don’t respect you enough to tell you so. In the rare case they do give a real answer, that becomes an opportunity for you to talk about your own experience in terms of what percentage of their answer you satisfy, giving you back some of the negotiating power the process is designed to rob you of.",gelfin,t2_4am3z,1,0,reddit2

Don't get me wrong. 15 an hour is great in some places, but I'm currently in the DFW area and 15 an hour isn't shit where these companies are located.

They want to hire a specific person for that position (maybe they already know them, maybe they don't) but are willing to hire other people for other positions with different salaries or wages. 


So If they say 'lead programmer 160k a year salary with bla bla bla benefits' and Jimmy straight out of college applies he's gonna be thinking he's set for that 160k and when they instead give him 60k a year he's gonna be really pissed and decline the offer. After all, he applied for the 160k position. Hell the person applying may even be qualified but they aren't looking to hire them for that position. 

They want to be able to determine how much each person should get separately without them knowing what everyone 'should' be making. Jimmy gets 60. Danny gets 58. Tim gets 100. It keeps applications coming in and keeps potential employees more receptive to the offer.

This is to set up a new niche consulting practice, so high value clients, high billables, very exciting stuff to be helping to build. At every stage I ask what the salary is and they say 'it's a range'. I ask the range and they say they can't tell me at this stage. 

I also talk extensively with the guy who will be setting up this practice with me, we click very well, he seems very grounded and focused on making this all work. So he basically tells me to expect the offer shortly and we can get cracking. 

Well the offer does indeed come in. And it's 20% less than I was currently making. And at the time I was actually being paid under market value because I had stayed in the same job for a few years too long because the location was good for me in my personal life. And this was supposed to be a move up, into a management role. 

So I call the guy back and explain and I hear him pull the phone back and say to himself 'those stupid fucking HR fucks, not a-fucking-gain, bastards!'. Then he explains that he had told them what they needed to offer to secure someone decent and they had ignored him and decided to lowball it to try and keep costs down. This was actually the third time they had done this in the last 6 months. He apologised profusely. Then 3 months later I saw online he changed to a new company.

j61d090,t1_j616mew,2023-01-27 00:36:48,WorkReform,"Actually you should be using median. Like let's say you have 5 people with $1, and 1 person with $10.

The average is $2.5. Now, it's not a terrible number. It's the average. But we have 5 people with $1, and only 1 person with $10. So it makes it look like people are making more than they are. It doesn't show you the reality of the situation. In fact, it makes it look like most people are making 2.5x more than they are. 

Meanwhile, the median is $1. While it does ignore the rich person, it actually shows us the actual truth of that group. Which is that everyone has $1. That's what we should be basing things on


But this was a bit simplistic, which is the point, but let's make this a bit more complicated to show it action. Get more numbers in there. 

* 3 people with $1

* 4 people with $2 

* 2 people with $3 

* 1 person with $10

10 people and $27 total. 

Average is $2.7

Median is $2. 

Now, yes, the $2.7 looks about the middle of the list. A little higher. But if you notice it's leaning more towards the top 3 than the bottom 7. In fact, the bottom 3 only have $1. So it looks like people aren't doing to bad. Outside of the top 1 person, they're all roughly around the next group up. But in reality that's a lot of people lower than that. Much lower. 

The median, though, is actually closer to the reality of the situation.  Again. It's further from the top 1 person, but it's 1 person out of 10, and they have such a high jump that they can be dismissed a lot easier as an outlier than the bottom 3. And the next groups below and above are roughly equal.

Statistically you should be using the median and not the average. If you keep adding more and more to the numbers you will find it tends to have the same patterns. If anything, if you look at real numbers today, it would be even worse and the wealth gap widens and the top 1% gets a higher percentage of the money.

So I ended up being underpaid for my role.

When the company didn't allow him to give me a 50% raise and additional +10% bonus increase he told finance/HR that he'll fire and rehire me at an even higher rate. It worked.

For example: What the heck is ""figuring out the candidate"" supposed to mean exactly? Most employers are looking for someone competent. A personality test doesn't really matter here. Unless they're working with large groups of people i.e school/hospital/store etc. But interviewing someone who is gonna clean windows isn't going to be particularly productive. Plenty of jobs where the personality of the candidate is not too relevant so long as they do their job well and don't harass people. Hence the background/drug tests.

Now, as for finding out if the company works for you, that's something you figure out when you actually work there for a substantial amount of time. Because managers often don't really give a shit about you and just want someone to do whatever job is advertised for the lowest wage you're willing to take.

Honestly I could see this becoming an issue since executive level salaries are ALREADY way too high in the US generally. This could start some kind of cycle like: ""Companies increase compensation for POC executives to attract scarce talent"" -> ""Non-POC executives also demand higher compensation to match"" -> ""Accepted average pay for executives goes up"" -> ""Executive level compensation for POCs is no longer competitive"" -> back to start.

Since there are a smaller number of BIPOC people and women with that type of experience, the demand for them is higher and therefore companies have to offer a higher more competitive salary to bring them on the team.

I think there are a lot of questionable assumptions here.

First, this assumes that companies are genuinely trying to diversify leadership, which I'm strongly skeptical of. The notion that a hiring manager would deliberately select the more expensive of two candidates with equivalent skills is very farfetched to me, especially for executive and manager positions.

Of course, most of the senior engineers are men, while maybe 40% of mid levels are women about 20% of seniors are and only about 5% of principal engineers are women. My last formal review process included the word “phenomenal” but I still have to work much harder to earn that senior title, and I’m at a company many would consider very progressive. 

There are tons of factors at play here including that women are often bullied out of STEM jobs to begin with. My formal education is in math and statistics and I have faced sexism and shitty “you’re just not good enough” / “women can’t think critically the way men can” / “women are just less analytical” bullshit at every single level, from the boss who said “no I want to hear [the male tech lead’s] opinion” when I was going over a process that I owned and created, to the low-level sexism, to the professor that let all the boys call him by his first name but insisted I use Professor LastName (who also invited all the boys to his house for cake at the end of the semester!) to like endlessly being told I’m “just a diversity hire” despite the fact that I graduated magna cum laude and won a pretty prestigious scholarship and have tangibly proven I’m good at my job (to which I’ve been told “yeah so doesn’t it suck knowing you didn’t get hired because of your worthy qualifications???”)

I wouldn’t say society “socially conditions” women to pursue skills that lead to lower paying jobs but I’d absolutely say I have watched many women leave STEM because of the abuse and sexism they face at every single level.

It’s also very hard to make macro arguments because the exact weight of each factor can vary a lot from industry to industry. 

Moreover, there tends to be another phenomenon where jobs primarily occupied by women have lower salaries even compared to jobs with similar qualifications. For example, IT managers tend to make more than HR managers; and janitors tend to make more than housecleaners. Studies have found that wages tend to decrease when women enter a field, but increase when men enter a field.

In a household with two working parents, it makes sense for one parent to focus on their career and the other to sacrifice their earning potential for more flexibility.

Women are more likely to take on the primary parent role because of a whole host of reasons, but it doesn't have to be that way.

Meanwhile, employers are reluctant to invest in women of childbearing age because of the expectation that those women will get pregnant and leave.

It would be interesting to scrutinize some of these independent business owners. How many employees, how much they're paid, cost of basic living in the region, how the owner lives, how much the owner takes from the business, compared with the employees' living situation.  Also, type and worth of cars. 

It's widely known that many places undervalue their employees, but to actually see it spelled out. I imagine a dialogue that would touch on things like, ""If you didn't lease a new Mercedes every year, you could pay us a living wage."" Vacations, luxuries, things employees can't afford. 

And guess whose labor pays for that trip to the Bahamas or whatever...

i3jgw7t,t3_twuo9l,2022-04-05 20:58:33,WorkReform,"I used to work with a physician's assistant. She was one of our top performers, and had been practicing for ~10 years. Got people in and out, worked extremely well independently but knew enough to know when to really get the docs involved, friendly with everybody. Just a super strong provider in general and the shifts she worked were far less stressful. 

A new PA was hired. Straight out of PA school, so a little more than zero practical experience. Her starting wage was markedly higher than the experienced PA. The experienced PA went to her management chain, they nixed her request for a raise. She went to the medical director and he tried to address it appropriately because in what world does it make sense that a new grad with zero experience making more money than an experienced and high performing provider? Despite his intervention, the higher ups said no. 

She resigned and was gone two months later. The new hire PA was awful at the job. Like, 100% awful. Leaned excessively on the docs, even more so than you'd expect out of a new PA, and was still making a lot of mistakes. Simple things that should have been in and out in less than 30 minutes were 5 hour ordeals. She'd see 5-6 patients in a 12 hour shift, whereas most providers were seeing 30+ during the average shift.

I remember walking by a room where she was trying to do a pelvic exam. SHE FAILED TO COMPLETELY CLOSE THE DOOR FOR A PELVIC EXAM, and I see her on all 4s at the end of a bed with her face basically all up in this girl's business. A face does not need to be that close for a standard pelvic exam. Absolutely no need. The patient has a ""what the fuck is going on here?"" look on her face. I closed the door and went and told the attending provider what I had just seen and that he probably needed to go in there. She was eventually terminated because she was too much of a liability. 

So we lost the high performer AND the new grad was fired because somebody didn't want to give the experienced person a raise to at least what the new grad was making. And then they had to hire and pay two people at that higher rate. Fuckin dopes.",PeeweesSpiritAnimal,t2_8hc8owr9,2,0,reddit2

I don’t post anything about what my other employees make.  We hire and train a lot of our work force with an entry level experience bringing them to full journeyman capabilities and wages.   I think that knowing what is earned day one as well as what benefit package comes with the job, how long before benefits kick in as well as (paid) days off.  Holiday pay if there will be requirements for overtime or if overtime is ever offered.  Will there be times that you will have to work weekends.  Will there be opportunities to work weekends for overtime pay.  What is required to move up in your pay.  What can you do to advance you income.  I always start new employees with what I expect from them over the first 30 60 and 90 days including what they need to do and what raises they will get. I also add that after that they can grow to XXX if they can do or achieve certain things.  Also I think knowing what raises you can expect.  We always do a raise of a $1.00 per hour or more. In our field it’s roughly an $8,000.00 per year raise.  These aren’t demanding questions and they can offer your answer to whether this is your next job or if you are about to start the beginning of your last job in the career that you think fits you best.  Good luck and as far as the salary part I think that you could simply call and ask without feeling like you are being rude. Emailing is also an  acceptable way to ask.   Hope this was helpful information and good luck to you.  Also remember that if you are working somewhere and you see an opportunity to make substantial more money with similar benefits go to your employer and ask to talk to them in a formal meeting. Explain what you like about the company and hopefully it includes the people you work with then explain that an opportunity has come up to make more money. Tell them that you don’t really want to leave but you don’t want to feel like you are leaving a big financial opportunity for you and your family behind. Ask them if they can look at your performance and let you know if there is an option to stay where you are with an increase in your salary.   If you are working for a good company and you are dependable with a good work ethic there is usually some thought about promotion or a raise for people.  Also if they say no it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t want to might just be that they don’t have the capability that the other company has so if the opportunity is there to go make a lot more with the other company it’s something that should be seriously considered or taken.

Imagine going in to buy, say, a loaf of bread and all the price  tags just said ""competitive price!"" and nothing else? Would you be able to figure out what a fair price for bread even is? So you'd grab a loaf of bread and scan it just to find it costs $20! 

That doesn't feel like a fair price, but you don't really know what any of the other bread loaves cost because no one really wants to talk about it. Your buddy mentioned once that his bread cost $13 once, but that was a loaf of white bread and you usually buy sourdough so you're not really sure if that's a fair comparison.

You paid a monthly fee to access a website where users anonymously report what they pay for certain types of bread, but it seems like the bread company made the website, and only like 5 people are reporting the cost of your brand of bread and those reports seem wildly inaccurate. Like one guy in California paid 3,000 dollars for a loaf of bread while another dude in Scottsdale paid $.50 for the same loaf.

It's too much effort to go scan another loaf because the scanning process takes like 10 minutes and you have to buy dozens of items today.

I run a small business that employs some very skilled (and expensive) people. Our job listings are intentionally a bit broad because we're always on the look out for smart people. Someone on the more junior end of the spectrum might apply and expect a $60k salary. Someone else, mid-career with leadership experience, might apply to the same listing and need double that salary. Both of them may be hired off that same posting, but they're obviously going to be doing different jobs.

I'm not trying to hire a $120k person and pay them $60k. That just doesn't happen. In fact, I've had people ask for $50k and I tell them I'm going to pay them $60k because that's our floor. Someone who's asking for undermarket rates normally means they don't know their worth.

The seller sets the price, not the buyer.  That’s how you maximize the sales price.  Imagine a car dealership that, instead of doing market research and setting the maximum price the market can bear instead asked buyers to set the prices for them!  They would go broke!  Sure asking a higher price will get some customers to pass, but if your goal is to maximize income that’s how it goes.  Expecting the buyer (companies) to have your best interest in mind is not a winning strategy.  
 
When I hire I ask what they want and if they are worth more than the number in my head I will pay more.  I’ve paid people more than they asked for before (to prevent compression and risk of leaving) and I’ve negotiated paying people less if I didn’t feel their skills were worth the higher rate.  If I post a lower number I will miss out on those high performers that I’d be willing to pay more for, and if I post a higher number I will get flooded with people not worth the higher amount so it makes sense to post the requirements and let my counter offer flex based on the value of what is being sold.   You sell me your labor, you tell me what you are selling it for and I’ll decide if it’s worth it to me.  The number a buyer has in their head is simply a budgetary target so don’t let that convince you to sell your labor for less than it’s worth as long as other companies are willing to pay you what you are worth!
 
Sorry, that means you have to do your homework, but if you want to earn more that’s the way to do it, not expect companies to do that homework for you.

The average German is only paid like 30-40k€, Google offers 5-6x more for developers, which is ludicrous. We're in the 1.5-3x range for software developers.

I told one recruiter “based off all of these variables, I’d need at least (making up numbers here) $100/hour.”

He was honest and said “That’s just out of our range - the top is $95/hour. Would you be willing to go into the next interview knowing the offer might be capped at 5% under your asking, while I try to see if we can meet your numbers?”

I said sure and did the interview. 5% under was still more than my job at the time. He eventually came back with an offer that was 5% over what I’d been asking for, though it added a couple other small changes in responsibilities.

building your own business is one of the ways people get out of poverty. that’s why this really should be too down IMO. pay should be tied to profit & top earners salaries & businesses should have to pay progressive penalties if their FT workers are on welfare 

if we hit the large corps with this first, who have the most employees & profit the most, we can flatten the curve so small businesses can actually get off the ground & pay their workers a living wage.

There are certain thresholds which really decrease stress and when you hit them allows you to focus on happiness more.  However, there can be diminishing returns after certain points.  Working 80 hours a week to bring in max cash isn't going to make you happy if you never have time to spend it and have a heart attack when your 50.

What it does buy  though is a feeling of calmness and confidence, which in turn reduce one’s stress and ultimately should leave them happier. Not having to worry about fixing your car or buying groceries and paying bills in the same week certainly makes one less stressed.l. Essentially I’m saying that happiness is a side effect, not a direct effect of money. 

So does money buy happiness? in a round about way it does.

Although Manning had to leave for greener pastures in Denver to get his second ring, he was still ""appointment television"" for me until his departure.

The franchise, as far as I'm concerned, never really found a suitable replacement. Andrew Luck injured himself beyond help in his second season and I promptly ceased wasting Sunday afternoons watching the NFL sometime in, like, 2013.

OP check with your doctor. Certain pregnancies, especially those with complications, qualify as temporary disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I mention this because You mentioned having anemia in your comment, and US courts have ruled that this condition is considered a temporary disability. You might be able to get a doctors note that says you have a disability that requires frequent doctor's appointments. Also, check your state laws. Some states have additional laws in regards to pregnancy. 

I'm not sure if the FLMA applies here based on your comment. The FMLA requires that the business have 50 or more employees within a 75 mile radius of your store's location.

Additionally, if your employer has a general policy of excusing or accepting call outs with a doctors note, then you may be able to file a complaint with your EEOC office. Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, your employer can't arbitrarily decide not to accept your doctor's note based on the fact that it's related to pregnancy.

I worked at a small cakery out of town until I started to experience morning sickness... They fired me because calling off in the midst of feeling very ill meant I was ""unreliable"" (so they essentially fired me blatantly because my pregnancy was too inconvenient for them... very illegal). 

I asked my current manager with well over 2 weeks notice (per company policy) to give me this day off and told her it was for a medical appointment. She knows full and well that I am anemic and that I go to a high-risk clinic because my baby has two swollen kidneys. She scheduled me for the day anyway and I told her earlier in the week that I am not budging on this appointment - this is for my anemia. I told her I MIGHT be able to come at 6 but couldn't guarantee because this was out of town. Well, I couldn't make it at 6 and called in. This is the text I get very soon afterward. She tried to get me on a no-call-no-show while she was at it. 

I am so tired of this. I have heard of other pregnant people getting no paid time off, having miscarriages due to bad work conditions without compensation, etc. I wanted to bring this to a public platform because this is incredibly unfair and happens to people all the time.

One of the men went as far as to talk about how birth wasn’t that serious because “people do it all the time” and go on to brag about a colleague he’d worked with in a restaurant who’d had her doctor induce labor on a Thursday night so she’d be back for her shift on Monday and how “she was fine.”

 That being said, your best option with regards to this (and generally speaking, everything else) is to move to a state that has legalized recreational marijuana. You will still find businesses that will random and disallow marijuana use, but they are much fewer and further between.

The state has warned businesses that abusing this distinction will not be favorable in court, but some businesses with conservative anti-marijuana leadership essentially classify *every* position as safety sensitive. OGE is an example, even their part time data entry technicians are somehow “safety sensitive” which is ridiculous.

Many businesses **do** try to accommodate the law as written, but for some positions their hands are tied. If they are federally regulated or contract with federal government, there’s not a lot they can do. For those that don’t and honor the law, they may still have safety sensitive positions. These usually involve any operating heavy equipment (if you get a vehicle for your job, forget MMJ), dangerous substances, health/safety of others, or any kind of potentially hazardous object (weapons, etc). 

You could try to report to the OMMA or justice, it’s doubtful that will go anywhere at all. 

If anyone hasn’t figured it out yet, America is a country by the corporation for the corporation, we essentially have no power anymore and are too socially divided to regain it right now.

Currently in Oklahoma the law states that employers for positions that are exposed to or work with certain types of equipment/conditions can test and turn down candidates.

Most jobs that fit the description are going to be jobs such as the technical trades, or anything that requires the use of power tools, working at heights etc. Basically if it's dangerous they want to make sure no one gets hurt on the job. OSHA violations and recordable incidents can be expensive, and so are lawsuits.

I think the realistic way to solve this problem, and IMO potentially the reason it hasn't been federally legalized yet, is due in part to the lack of an instantaneous reliable and non invasive tests to see if someone is currently high.

ie9j7qi,t3_vnjy8a,2022-06-30 01:39:21,WorkReform,"Some states, like New Jersey, have anti discrimination sections in their medical marijuana (and recreational marijuana) laws. Usually these prohibit employers from taking a negative action against an employee for using unless they are high in the job. There are usually exceptions for safety positions and like other people have said if the employer relies on federal contracting.

There is a full list here:https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/medical-marijuana-laws-anti-discrimination-provisions/.

I do not know how up to date this data is.

The relevant statute in Oklahoma appears to be 63 Okl. St. § 425 License Holder Protection — Non-Discrimination — Authorized Use — Zoning — Location — Research License.

Here is the relevant portion for employment discrimination:

B. Unless a failure to do so would cause an employer the potential to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or regulations, an employer may not discriminate against a person in hiring, termination or imposing any term or condition of employment or otherwise penalize a person based upon the status of the person as a medical marijuana patient licensee. Employers may take action against a medical marijuana patient licensee if the licensee uses or possesses marijuana while in his or her place of employment or during the hours of employment. Employers may not take action against a medical marijuana patient licensee solely based upon the status of an employee as a medical marijuana patient licensee or the results of a drug test showing positive for marijuana or its components.",Philly_Estate_Law,t2_4ditsob2,1,0,reddit1

Yes, federal law can play a role depending on the job, but most states with a medical marijuana bill have language prohibiting an employer from discriminating and/or taking adverse action against an individual solely on the basis of their being a medical marijuana licensee. Let's assume this employer is beholden to OK state law. 

Oklahoma's initial medical marijuana bill, State Question 788, did have the protections mentioned above. But a 2019 ""Unity Bill"" introduced one exception to those protections: employers may terminate, discipline, and/or refuse to hire a medical marijuana licensee whose ""position is one involving safety-sensitive job duties."" 

This seems to be the language this employer has honed in on and is attempting to use. Whether or not the job in question's duties are legitimately ""safety-sensitive"" is unclear and would likely need resolved through legal proceedings (i.e. if you want to fight it, hire an attorney).

Tldr: OK state law does provide some protections, but this employer is appealing to very specific language about ""safety-sensitive"" jobs. OP would probably need an attorney for this one.",SlyWishv2,t2_9kicvqo8,1,0,reddit1

Part of his argument was that it was an invasion of privacy, however as the plaintiff had cigarettes in his work vehicle, and was out in public smoking frequently so the judge ruled it was not an invasion of his privacy.   


Additionally, it was for prospective employees, not current employees. Scotts did not fire current employees who quit but only used it as screening for new employees. While he was allowed to work for Scotts it was contingent on him passing the piss test which came back to show nicotine in his system.  


And again, it was not medicinal. It was recreational. Medications grant you a certain level of protection, within reason.  


Because it happened in Mass. it was legal, there are however several states that have laws protecting what employees do in their off hours in regards to smoking.

Other states, even those where marijuana is legal, may not have similar protections (or the protections potentially exist haven’t been affirmed in a court ruling you could point to).

Nothing good ever came from an employee trusting their employer, potential or actual, to do the right thing. At least not for the employee.

The paradox of power is that those that truly want and pursue it are almost always the worst possible choices to hold it.

ie8w2ig,t1_ie7ptmg,2022-06-29 22:42:27,WorkReform,"Honestly, I think the biggest issue is that we can’t test for active intoxication from cannabis. If you blow a 0.3, you’re clearly drunk and that’s that. But if you test positive for cannabis, you could have consumed it as long as a month ago, depending on how heavy of a user you are and what kind of test. Which is why I think we should get rid of drug testing altogether and replace it with performance testing, which would measure if someone was too intoxicated (or tired) to safely perform their job. 

Also, I live in CO and have had to drug test a few times. Most employers make it very clear when you’re going to be tested and what kind of test it will be. But Fed jobs make it very clear that they can and will randomly drug test you. Same with heavy equipment operation. And if you claim workers comp, they’ll usually test you as well.

Not really? This is employment law, the way you're describing it, a private business is somehow enforcing federal law?

Also, how can a federal law apply when the majority of the States, that make up the United States, have directly contradicting laws?

Marijuana is somehow a Federal Schedule 1 substance, defined as having ""little to no medical value"" and ""likely to be abused""

But Meth is a schedule 2 substance... ""There's more medical benefits to Meth than MMJ"" the federal law tries to say.

Yet most states (28+DC) have laws explicitly allowing MMJ for medical uses.



Hot take, Maybe the federal narcotics act and the DEA WAS created as a way for our government to force it's way into our homes and neighborhoods. 

Nixon's aide was on record saying they continued to criminalize cannabis solely so they could (unconstitutionally) break up anti-war protests, and crack (which the CIA played a big role in spreading) as a way to force their way into black communities to break up groups like the Black Panthers.

ie7wupv,t1_ie7peio,2022-06-29 18:45:54,WorkReform,"The wording in the job description is quite vague. It’s hard to say whether the advertised job would or would not require *any* of those exceptions you listed. 

If the job doesn’t require any of those, then you look on to the federal issue. For Oklahoma, you can still be involved with federal work, but the extent to which you can is the issue. The top comment of “any” federal involvement isn’t true for all states.

>Unless a failure to do so would cause an employer the potential to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or regulations, an employer may not discriminate against a person in hiring, termination or imposing any term or condition of employment or otherwise penalize a person based upon the status of the person as a medical marijuana patient licensee.

If you being an employee would cause them a problem  on a federal level as listed above, they can deny you. If it doesn’t cause any such problems, they cannot. I haven’t read any Oklahoma case law on this, but that’s how it reads to me.

In Colorado, an employer can terminate or refuse to hire anybody *solely* for a positive test for THC. This is because of the specific language of the statute as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court. It’s an at-will state, so you can terminate for almost any reason, except the obvious race, age, sex, etc. Colorado also has a statute protecting individuals from being terminated for performing “lawful” activities outside of work. Our Court said because marijuana was still not lawful federally, they were not protected under that statute as being “lawful” and thus could be terminated for any marijuana use at any time.

It’s not as cut and dry as many may think. As you can see, one state’s interpretation of the sole word “lawful” is the difference between employees being protected or not.",,,6,0,reddit1

That was hotly debated at the time, prior to the formation of the FDA cannabis was used in all kinds of medicines. 
Right alongside Opium, Morphine (an opium derivative) and Cocaine, it was common in tonics, so called 'cure-all's and cough syrup. Even Coca Cola had Cocaine in it at the start...


Yet Cocaine is still a schedule 2 drug even after synthetics (novacaine, lidocaine, etc) were introduced and deemed so safe I've got a bottle of lidocaine cream in my bathroom for dealing with scrapes. 

But Cannabis? 

Cannabis is clearly much worse than Cocaine, Meth, and Morphine. The law says so.    /s

The truth is that cannabis was made illegal largely due to anti-mexican, anti-black racism. There was a commonly held belief at the time that it would make black men and mexican men r*pe white women. 

That's what it was about. Hell, the name ""marijuana"" is largely made up, because it sounds 'hispanic'. ""newspapers"" at the time would use the spelling ""Marihuana"" to emphasize the mexican/foreign/immigrant nature of it.

And it was continued to be outlawed even after the US rolled back alcohol prohibition, so that our government could enact racist policies and undermine our constitutional liberties.

ieaagz1,t1_ie8k5dy,2022-06-30 05:50:42,WorkReform,"Yeah good points.

Your last line makes me think we’re picturing different scenarios.  If you’re working in particular high-risk areas/jobs (such as forestry) you absolutely are getting tested when you show up, not waiting for someone to notice you’re high or drunk.  To use local rules, there is a zero tolerance to any drug tests you take, failing one and you’re out, it doesn’t matter about legal status - the view point is: we don’t care about the legal status, if you want this job you must not be impaired at any time, and so, we will tolerate no positive drug use.  This is made very clear before you sign a contract, so there is no confusion, they are very interested in not springing their on anyone.  They are very interested in going as far as they can to stop people being hurt (because deaths in forestry are way too high).

So for those guys, there is a big problem there that you’re going to catch your harmless weekend joint smoker in that same dragnet as the guy who waked-and-baked, and in the same net as the medical marijuana smoker.  No one seems to have found a way around this yet (should mention local here is New Zealand, the only legal pot use here is medical, it’s way way way more restricted than most other places that are in the process of legalising)",FidgitForgotHisL-P,t2_6avm0ury,1,0,reddit1

But then one day, out of the blue, when I was bent over picking something up, he walked up behind me and slapped my ass. And then grabbed a full handful of cheek. When I turned around to see who did that to me, we made eye contact. He just laughed and walked off. At the time I was more just surprised at the action, but I blew it off. I didn’t think anything of it. Then the next day he asked me for a ride home. Which I gave him. Once we got him to his house he asked me twice to come in and hang out and I declined. After that he got really distant and we didn’t speak much until I quit. 

Looking back on it as I am now, I *know* what he did was inappropriate. But back then I just thought “that’s what guys do lol. Just be gross at work haha. Him slapping and grabbing your ass is just funny!”

People read (or watch) stories like this then act baffled why others are quitting their jobs left and right, struggling to work self-employed, becoming entrepreneurs, where they arguably have more control over various factors this likely being one of them.

u/Super_Crisis_64 was right when they said that you, OP, and everyone is (supposed to be) guaranteed a safe place to study and to do their work.  Regardless who it is, how old they are, or what they look like, people simply need to feel safe and free to most effectively do the thing they're in a place to do rather than constantly looking over their shoulder, walking on eggshells, nursing repeated trauma.

Even after the incident I had my male relatives sit me down and gave me a talking to. Apparently he has his ear licked and sucked by a guy at work but you just stay quiet to keep your job. It’s all banter according to them. Shorts pulled down is normal back in their day, all the trainees get it. I was told to man up, apologise to my manager for wasting their time and promise it won’t happen again. Best laugh is I actually apologised to the boss for demanding they did something over the issue even though every part of me felt like it was wrong. 

I actually had a breakdown a few days later and ended up back in the mental health system. I won’t say the event caused the breakdown because I’d been feeling out of kilter before the shorts thing happened but earlier that day the same guy was burning the back of my shorts and hair with a blowtorch, sending me to ask for things that didn’t exist, giving me tasks that were set ups etc. I forgot to add to my post that the short pulling happened seconds after he slapped gorilla tape down my calf so I had my shorts down and then had to rip the tape off causing a lot of pain and leg hair. Of course everyone thought it was funny but I was literally fuming at the same time as being embarrassed.

I used to be house bound with anxiety so it wasn’t ideal for my recovery. They took pictures of me despite me asking them to stop, printed them out and drew dicks all over my face, stuck it to the work fridge and drew cocks on my water bottles etc. But since the place is owned by a relatives husband I couldn’t do anything without the full family knowing. Any complaints I made for fed back to my family before they came to me. By the time it got back to them it was “he is carrying on at work, losing his cool over banter and being unreasonable”

Ironically the only person who understood was a female relative who backed me all the way. Says a lot about male culture.

someone will always have it worse, but that doesn't mean you don't have it pretty damn bad.

if you choose to look into therapy, i suggest looking for someone who specializes in DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) and PTSD. it's not to say that you have PTSD, i don't know that. but most therapists that are trained to work with ppl w/ PTSD have a pretty good understanding of sexual assault and how to treat ppl who have experienced it. also, finding a therapist can be challenging, so don't be afraid to leave one therapist for another. if you don't ""click,"" it's hard to open up

> a man hits a woman and people intervene

They don't really. https://ncadv.org/STATISTICS 
It feels like they would and maybe in a public experiment they might, but the actual data shows women keep getting beaten by men at levels higher than men get beaten by women. 

For every youtube video that goes viral either showing a man getting ridiculed for even slapping women back after they were slapped there are a hundred women being beaten in private. 

A prime example is Hershel Walker. His ex-wife and son have come out talking about how he threatened them and beat them.

https://news.yahoo.com/herschel-walkers-ex-wife-describes-200900902.html

But Walker has the influence of the GOP so his violence against women is just normalized away. 

And it's not just him. Look at all these people who beat their spouses not only are getting away with it but they may be in power in Congress soon.

https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1094117955

Notice how all these are men, but it's not just men it's men in power. Because if Hershel Walker was a random black man I guarantee he would be arrested and we would have some article about black men beating their wives to further my previous point of the racial divide.

I find I have to keep arguing this in a work reform subreddit but it's always power. It's capitalism caring more about profits than people. If it's profitable to care about this stuff they would.

Look at Al Franken which by the standards of Hershel Walker would be a saint today, but both Democrats and Republicans wanted a power grab by pretending to care about what Al Franken did.

Again you are confusing propaganda messaging with actual care. People don't care when a women hits a man, but they also don't care when a man hits a women unless it helps them personally. That might be to be SEEN as caring for women, but there doesn't seem to be a benefit to care about men. But against it's all about status and perception and none of it is actually what people care about.*

* I know it's reddit and people get very literal here so to clarify these are general claims for majority of cases. I am sure there is a minority of people that actually care but the data doesn't seem to support that.
