Edit: ok people I did gain a bit of a new perspective. Best answer I got is waivers are like charging difference between MSRP and sales price as income. Which is a better way to look at a waiver than debt forgiveness (which I think everyone can agree is income)

Side note - as a Dad who needs to put a daughter through college in 10 years (and is sweating already) I can say there are some GREAT state schools out there that are affordable and won't put you in a crazy amount of debt. If you think your dream university is overpriced maybe consider going with your 2nd or 3rd choice if it's more affordable.

Theres a ""breach"" between the official exchange (about 80:1) that most people cannot access to (Except politicians it seems), the ones that can are limited to 200usd or equivalent in other currencies to which any expense in other currency even if its converted by the company like netflix, counts towards that limit and has an effective tax on it of 65%; Adding to that, anything you earn internationally is forcefully exchanged into local currency (to the official exchange, even cheaper actually because you are selling, and without the tax). Plus actual exchanges like the ones used in bonds or informally (which btw, some freaking how its illegal to exchange currency privately....) have a value that is over double the official exchange without the taxes.

What does that mean? That everything that could bring USD as reserves, be it import/export companies, including software companies and farm sector (which is a huge part of our economy) see their assets halved arbitrarely - not even counting taxes... -  while they have to access the new stuff they need to buy to, you know, keep the business going, at double the price they received (which also has taxes on it).

I mean, what could go wrong, right? /s

 Still some people are ignorant enough to defend this kind of stuff. I mean, iI get theres no reserves and that if they get freed they will go in an instant, but thats exactly because people  fear the local currenycy and theres a breach between the official (Rather artificial, because its kept under market value with public budget afaik) and unofficial exchanges. Besides is not solving anything either. Im not an economist, and I understand that hey are unaffected, and probably want people to depend from the estate to get the populism going and keep getting elected (in the rather stupid voting system that is ""popularity poll"" even), but this hurts the country itself, its completely retarded, and if you hear what politicians say during, after or before (doesnt matter) applying such practices, its also complete hypocrisy.

If something costs $100k and someone says hey I'll give it to you for $5k just bc you don't have enough, you just received something worth $100k for only 5.

Ignoring the fact colleges may artificially inflate prices for a minute, a ""waiver"" is just up front debt forgiveness. If 5 people pay 100k for a car then bigwig politician walks along and the dealership gives it to him for 5k for favorable laws or something, didn't they just basically give him income if 95k? He received a 100k asset for 5k.

Now with tuition let's say this is a big conspiracy to fuck students and put them in debt.

If that degree isn't worth 100k.... Then you don't have to get it? You don't have to go. You can go to a state school or a tech school or an online school and pay a fraction of that.

Monetarist theory versus humanity (two open letters to Arnold Harberger and Milton Friedman)*, by a Chilean and former Chicago economics student who opposed the Pinochet regime.

The first part or so of Naomi Klein's *The Shock Doctrine* covers the history of laissez-faire economic policies implemented by fascist dictatorships (with the help of the CIA and US corporations) in the Southern Cone of South America, with emphasis on Chile. Klein is a journalist so it reads well but may gloss over details and isn't an economics book.

Joseph Stiglitz [reviewed Klein's book](https://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics.html) and adds some economic context:

>Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies. But Friedman and the other shock therapists were also guilty of oversimplification, basing their belief in the perfection of market economies on models that assumed perfect information, perfect competition, perfect risk markets. Indeed, the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes. They were never based on solid empirical and theoretical foundations, and even as many of these policies were being pushed, academic economists were explaining the limitations of markets — for instance, whenever information is imperfect, which is to say always.",wokewightwonk,t2_89bkn52m,7,0,reddit2

There are worse ways to institute a progressive tax system than bringing cap gains rates up for ultra high income individuals. You are well into the 1% making that much, and most people who ever earn that much in a year are only at that income bracket for a year or two. 

That means most people who may get clipped by the tax due to a single spike in income simply spread some cap gains over a couple years and it is no big deal. If you are an individual consistently realizing cap gains with 6 zeroes behind it, you will be just fine. 

Since this is an economics forum, it also wont impact foreign investment cash flow as non-resident aliens do not pay US cap gains unless it is real property. It wont hurt investment companies. 

The only people who get slapped are super high net worth individual who are continuously liquidating massive investments with huge cap gains, who all have CPAs and attorneys to help them.

And I digress strongly, although  theres a limit to how many jobs there are during a quarantine (specially in a country like Argentina when it got to silly levels without much else) which means people need indeed help from the state, remember that  a) the amount of public expenses we have is ridiculous it can always be toned down. 

What is the problem? As you mentioned, people starve (part of it however is strictly due to the quarantine side of things done wrong) so of course the need to spend the public budget on welfare is much higher during the pandemic, but its not enough, so what do you do?

Obviously, cut taxes. Everyone pays a lot of taxes (if working legally) and this wealth tax is far from the only one that bothers the population. If food cost less is easier for the population to acquire it than to redistribute money on an already dwindling and poor economy, much much more if you take into account as I said before, the already exceeding tax pressure.

Yeah, sure, you would still need to give money to a portion of the population, but it gets smaller, both the amount of people and the amount needed. This, once again, beyond reestructuring public budget and understanding that less taxes does not mean zero nor it has to be that way forever.

&#x200B;

But lets say it works, lets say its enough, everything elsse is ignored... you still loose a very profitable part of the population long term which may offset taking debt as a country even (you never know, and Im not sure what conditions we have in front of the IMF) and it sets an awfully bad precedent that ""stinks"" other investments away even more, as theres no trust.

gd1npo4,t1_gd1kdj3,2020-11-21 11:29:52,badeconomics,"Well, it'd require that you get your land to become, as a property, a certain level of productivity for it to be worth your investment. Consider this. Let's say that the property tax is 1.5% (moved it down by a factor of 10 so it's a bit less ridiculous). You own a piece of land evaluated at... say, $100K. You've built a property that's worth $200K, including the value of the land itself. You're paying $3K in taxes. But let's say your neighbor has an identical plot of land and upgrades and develops her property so that it's worth $600K, including taxes. She's now paying $9K in taxes. So $12K in taxes are being raised, in total, on $200K worth of land.

With a land value tax, you could also raise $12K by putting a 6% tax. Your question is: wouldn't there be a decrease in demand for land? My rebuttal, here, is I don't think so. Because while your taxes increased from $3K to $6K, your neighbor's *decreased* from $9K to $6K. But, the important thing is that you have a proper incentive to develop your land, because you aren't being taxed higher on the increased property value. So it does disincentives you to own land and just sit on it and do nothing productive with it (which seems like a good incentive structure to me)

This is useful for, say, a family that is debating building an accessory dwelling unit on their property.

EDIT should clarify:

The goal of a uniform wealth tax ought to be to tax unproductive capital. The rate of this tax should be 1-2% yearly for an amortized return (over periods of centuries) of 2-3%. This way, if you manage to make your capital productive - for yourself and society -, you keep getting richer.

I agree that incel theory is odd and has a huge number of issues with it, but, if we look at the phenomenon, there exists a rational explanation to why incels exist. 

&#x200B;

Let's look at the data:

 [https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) 

&#x200B;

 

>A data scientist representing the popular dating app “Hinge” [reported on the Gini coefficients he had found](https://hingeirl.com/hinge-reports/whats-the-biggest-challenge-men-face-on-dating-apps-a-qa-with-aviv-goldgeier-junior-growth-engineer/) in his company’s abundant data, treating “likes” as the equivalent of income. He reported that heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing. 

&#x200B;

Or in other words, if you treat ""likes"" as currency, then the inequality in sexual opportunity on hinge is significantly higher then the US economy. 

&#x200B;

In criminology, there exists this idea called strain theory. Strain theory states that society puts pressure on people to achieve certain goals, and when these goals cannot be achieved, people are pressured into five common ways of coping: (stolen from wikipedia)

&#x200B;

>Conformity: pursuing cultural goals through socially approved means.   
>  
>Innovation: using socially unapproved or unconventional means to obtain culturally approved goals. Example: dealing drugs or stealing to achieve financial security.   
>  
>Ritualism: using the same socially approved means to achieve less elusive goals (more modest and humble).   
>  
>Retreatism: to reject both the cultural goals and the means to obtain it, then find a way to escape it.   
>  
>Rebellion: to reject cultural goals and the prescribed means to achieve them, then work towards replace both of them. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at it through the lens of the incel community:

&#x200B;

>Conformity: ask out a large number of girls, follow all the guides on the internet, and hope one of them will go out with you.   
>  
>Innovation: just hire a prostitute man...   
>  
>Ritualism: I can't find someone willing to date me/sleep with me, but I got a friend at last!  
>  
>Retreatism: the /r/mgtow idea. Who needs women anyways right?  
>  
>Rebellion: Who needs sex when you got hentai? I prefer 2d girls anyways!

&#x200B;

If we look at incels through the lens of strain theory: Society is telling these young men that sex is something desirable, and that everyone else is doing it. Therefore, their inability to get laid is creating strain. This drives those men to communities for innovation, ritualism, retreatism, or rebellion. 

&#x200B;

During times of high economic inequality, we aren't surprised to see the emergence of various radical, heterodox, economic extremists. The Jacobins, Bolsheviks, and Chavistas all appeared during times of extreme economic inequality. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, during times of extreme inequality in sexual opportunity like today, is anyone surprised that we're seeing heterodox social theories pop out of incel and/or foreveralone communities? 

&#x200B;

In a sense, it doesn't really matter if the theories don't make sense. I'm going to sound like a communist revolutionary here, but for large swaths of society, ""orthodox socialization"" has failed them.

fm3crn5,t3_fsskb4,2020-04-01 05:34:17,badeconomics,"You have not proven that it is always in the woman's best interest to reveal all her information. There are cases where the linkage principle is violated, in other words, where the seller in an auction can be better off concealing their information. One such case, is when there is an auction for an item that comes in multiple types, where the buyers receives multiple signals. In that case, the seller can be better off not revealing the type of the item. [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.574.3202&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.574.3202&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Incel theory does allow for at least two types of women, Beckys and Stacys. [https://external-preview.redd.it/v4wWExzg1P0Fi8lx5ViZnR8FwYv0sDwt0363Rg3gq80.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a72a031dee29a79701d81d59d84fc0c5c840dfb](https://external-preview.redd.it/v4wWExzg1P0Fi8lx5ViZnR8FwYv0sDwt0363Rg3gq80.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a72a031dee29a79701d81d59d84fc0c5c840dfb) So, the question is, can W send multiple signals? I don't know what incel theory has to say about it. But its easy to imagine ways that one could send out multiple signals in the dating market: telling Republicans you want to date that you are a Republican, while telling Democrats you want to date that you are a Democrat, telling Christians you want to date that you are a Christian, while telling Jews that you want to date that you are Jewish. If incel theory does allow for W to send out multiple signals, then its entirely coherent. If it doesn't, then there are still other ways for the linkage principle to fail, like when the private information of the buyers is correlated, in that case, its possible for the seller to capture the entire social surplus for themselves, just like Incels think in this model[https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf) Maybe there is some other way to prove Incel ideology incoherent. However, you have failed to prove the incoherence of Incel ideology by relying on the Linkage Principle, because it doesn't apply in all cases. I think that what you have actually proven is that Incel's believe that mating markets are auctions in which the seller (the woman) extracts 100% of the social surplus. I don't think that any of them would dispute that. Edit:  On closer inspection, the bit about correlated private information said that there is a way for the seller to extract all the social surplus that they would get as if the bidder's private information was public. In the example they gave, the linkage principle still holds. That being said, there are still other ways the linkage principle can fail besides the one that I have outlined. So it still isn't clear that W gets a higher price by revealing her information.",Sewblon,t2_zj09d,45,0,reddit3

Understandard incel theory women attempt to maximize suffering extracted from men by maximizing the difference between between the true value of a relationship and what men pay.  This is why women gossip so much, it's an attempt to solve the obvious coordination problem since women's true goal is to maximize the sum of suffering across all relationships.",Clara_mtg,t2_37vkt1it,63,0,reddit3

It's optimal for W, before the start of the auction and *before knowing the signal*, to commit to revealing her signal once she receives it.  But there is no point at which an actual, individual woman could make commitments to potential partners before knowing her own value.  Rather, the commitment would have to exist implicitly and collectively, as a cultural consensus that people should release verifiable information about themselves, such that people who decline to do so are probably trying to hide some flaw.

But even that only makes sense if the information is *verifiable*.  If an auctioneer's claims can't be verified (and are not trusted for some other reason), and there are no long-term consequences for lying (not true in reality but can be assumed for this model), then there is no incentive for an auctioneer not to exaggerate their claims as much as possible.  This is true even if the auctioneer's item really is of high value!  In this case, it would have to look something like (...ugh, this is so embarrassing to write...) women agreeing to allow potential partners to interview their associates about their personality or something, rather than just making claims about their own personality.",,,14,0,reddit3

This means that if you gave all men more game. It would make no difference. As hypergamy is entirely based on hierarchy. If everyone gets more game, the hierarchy stays the same.

That is scientifically proven to be true.

Incels understand hypergamy. But the problem is they believe that value is only obtained through looks. Since you can't grow taller, widen your jaw or regrow your bald spots, they think they are doomed be remain low value males and never get into the 10% that women desire.

Value and hierarchy amongst men is not decided only through looks. It's also decided through intelligence, via wealth and social status. Wealth and social status can be acquired through intelligence and effort.

That is also scientifically proven to be true. Women, unlike men, are not ONLY attracted to looks.

For some reason incels refuse to accept that you can climb value hierarchy through social status and wealth (ie effort and intelligence).

What are the incentive structures faced by creators of dating apps? and... to what degree are creators of dating apps incentivised to help their users find relationships or successful outcomes? 

- Given that they are free apps, supplemented by optional opt-in pricing schemes, they are absolutely incenvitised against this. If two people meet on Tinder and then form a long-term relationship, thats customers (and potential revenue streams) that are lost. Additionally, given the business model of app-based products these days, they're incentivised to maximise user traffic (more user traffic = higher IPO share price).

- Conversely, if they were completely ineffectual then nobody would use them. 

- I suspect, though given the matching algorithms are private its impossible to prove, that for men - the incentive is to provide *slightly* sub-desired matches on a drip feed minimal enough to keep them on the app, but there to tease them into purchasing the subscription service.

This needs to be padded out a lot - but this sort of emerged when talking to an old housemate who worked in tech and wanted to create a dating app, and we realised that actually, you don't want your users to find relationships.

The revenue incentives are completely disconnected from the customer incentives. An app or website where you only paid on the event of a successful outcome would be a lot better in terms of satisfaction for most men, I'd wager",HasuTeras,t2_aqp2d,15,0,reddit3

fm5k2hp,t1_fm3cl3c,2020-04-01 20:53:31,badeconomics,"There are a few things here that I find odd.

1. Is Gini coefficient a good summary here? If the top X% of the population have Y% of the likes (uniformly distributed within each high/low segment), then the Gini coefficient is Y-X. If the top 50% have all of it, then G=0.5. If the top 20% have 80% then G=0.6. In the second case, which is supposedly less equal, it's possible that a larger number of people can pass some minimum threshold of relevance (e.g. entering a relationship). I'm not used to thinking about Gini in a matching context, where everyone essentially wants a single high-quality good and extra choice may have sharply diminishing returns past some point.
2. If men are expected to initiate, then you might expect men to signal interest more often than women, who only send out the signal selectively. That's not quite the same thing as who they would be interested in if the other person initiated (e.g. women like their top 5, men like their top 20, both underlying lists concentrate equally). The link doesn't work for me, but is there similar data for responses? How well does the number of likes correlate to finding a relationship? Do women usually go out with people they liked, or someone who liked them first?
3. Is this consistent with other more direct data on preferences? My impression from my own conversations (and I believe some OkCupid study awhile back) was that men largely agree on which women are most attractive, while women have a larger spread. I though the situation was something like the example I gave, where more women get a *high* volume of attention, but more men can expect strong interest from a moderate number of people.

At least online you have equality in opportunity. Everybody is just a few pictures and an intro after all. Or in other words, if you are doing terribly online (relative to other men in your area), it's because your pics are ugly or your intro is bad.

&#x200B;

In person is very unequal. What if your program at school has few women/men? One of my best friends used to tell me she was always the ""only girl in class"" in many of her higher level computer science classes. How about if your hobbies are very male/female dominated?

&#x200B;

IE: a 1 year old is expected to know how to sit quietly and not throw a tantrum. A 6 year old is expected to know how to listen to a teacher and pay attention. A 10 year old is supposed to know how to play well in a team, a 16 year old is expected to have undergone their first interview, etc, etc. 

&#x200B;

Socialization is not really intentional for most people. Sure, your dad might sign you up for hockey so you can learn good sportsmanship, and your teacher might assign group projects so you can collaborate, but kids don't intentionally go into these things thinking ""I should work to absorb social norms"". 

&#x200B;

Yet if you're 20 or 30, and you're extremely socially awkward and incapable of functioning normally in society, something must have gone wrong in the socialization process right? The socialization process that seems to work for the majority of society seems to be failing huge swaths of people. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes people have good explanations as to why they never picked up social skills. IE: ""I had a learning disability, so I was home schooled and never had the opportunity to hang out with neighborhood kids"". 

&#x200B;

When you go to incel subs, sometimes you might see is people who turn this failure of socialization into resentment. Either towards a specific individual like ""My mom was a helicopter parent who never let me hang out with neighborhood kids"" or society as a whole ""I moved to \[location\] as a teenager and I didn't speak the language, my classmates bullied me for it"".

And even if it's not a college town apps connect you to ppl closest to you so you'll still have an advantage. Women so seriously outnumber men at most colleges now that being a decently attractive guy in a college town is a once in a lifetime sex pass if you put in the effort. 

The gender disparity has an even greater effect because based on stats I've seen female students are much less willing to date ""townies"" than male students. Men at an elite liberal arts school get to poach not only from their gender imbalanced school but from townies and less elite nearby colleges too. Whereas women at an elite school care much much more about their partner also being at an elite school.

Someone wrote a great article a couple years ago describing a study on dating economics comparing a pretty male dominated school (Georgia Tech) and a very female dominated school (Sarah Lawrence). Despite the male students at Sarah Lawrence espousing much more pro feminism and pro women attitudes than their GA Tech comrades they basically treated the girls they dated like disposable trash compared to GT students who comparatively cherished their girlfriends. The reason wasn't that guys at GT were better it's just they couldn't afford *not* to be better. The gender imbalance made promiscuity unlikely and thus led to much stronger relationship building behavior by guys at GT. They studied Valentine's day at the two schools for example. At SL Valentine's day was no big deal whereas at GT women reported their boyfriends making them breakfast in bed, buying expensive gifts, dinners, etc.

Also at a Uni you basically just have to compete against looks of other guys at same school. In the bay area you're competing in an area completely unique in the amount of super successful young men.

fm5eg70,t1_fm46vi9,2020-04-01 20:03:23,badeconomics,"I think the lack of geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic restrictions inherent in online dating give access to a wider pool of potential partners, but a less equitable outcome. Online, you're restricted to a few photos and a paragraph of text. This means your ability to appeal to the opposite sex is truncated. 

In real life, we have various options to display our potential as mates over a wide range of timescales. Online, you have only two ways: be physically attractive (and photogenic) enough to stand out in a functionally infinite group of men, or be charismatic enough to write something that stands out in a similar way. 

Additionally, a more open dating market, in theory, might create benefits from the top down (where we describe ""top"" as ""most attractive in any given scenario): 

In a closed-off village of 100 people, where social expectations are that you find a partner and procreate, everyone is incentivised in the same way. 

Since resources are relatively scarce (there are only a handful of desirable males) we should expect fierce competition for those males. But we should also expect, once they are off the table, that market participants will readjust their expectations in-line with the remainder of available outcomes (eligible bachelors - or rather, bachelors that look more eligible once their far more attractive peers are out of play). 

Driven by social pressures, people will look for matches to make, enabling less-attractive men to find partners. There will obviously be a bottom to this process, but it clearly extends far beyond the top 2 or 3 men in a village, otherwise we would see enormous levels of celibacy in small, isolated, communities. Historically, we don't see that. I would even speculate that we see the opposite - people in these locations settle down and partner up in greater numbers than urbanites. 

Opening up our little village to the rest of the world is likely to disenfranchise sub-optimal males in the same way that globalisation has disenfranchised a large segment of the working class. 

That hot barmaid Karen who works in the local pub isn't left choosing between the 12 unmarried men in her community - she can travel to big cities, download Tinder, and explore other markets for better outcomes.

For the absolute most attractive people, this creates enormous benefits: not only do they no longer run out of people to bone, but they can also find partners that are as attractive as they are - wherever they may be. 

For the next few tiers of people down, it is probably also beneficial - once they would have been stuck with the best-of-the-rest... now, they can explore other markets for better options. 

Eventually, though, you get to Smeggy David, whose hands are always inexplicably moist, and give off a faint whiff of sardines. Smeggy David has probably been disenfranchised by this romantic globalisation. And the worst thing is - he's probably only half way down the attractiveness-ladder.",leworthy,t2_2956ceaz,13,0,reddit3

From preliminary googling, it looks like the bay area ratio is much closer to 1:1, so there's still something weird going on here.

But that's really sort of evidence for my point - I think some places skew a very specific way, and a lot of incels seem to be in a place sort of similar to mine (steeped in tech, 'smart' but 'stemlordy', etc), and so if they live in places like the bay, it doesn't seem implausible that they just think everywhere is as tough as here when it really really isn't.

Two things to consider:

1. Surely the field in which these students receive education matters? Medieval French literature is interesting, but does it measurably improve productivity? If all these extra students choose useless majors, the productivity does not increase.

2. You have to take opportunity cost into account. Studying at a university means that you spend about 10-15% of your career not working. If a person hadn't studied at university, perhaps they would have learnt a trade, or learnt on the job, or whatever; certainly they would have produced something during these years.

Your example is letting a person voluntarily work for someone else, in an exchange that makes both affected parties better off (they immigrated here most certainly because the alternative was worse, and the hiring individual clearly wants their labor more than their money), and does not take wealth from anyone.

How are those two examples even comparable?

And for what it's worth, as a Dem, the primary reason why I support expanded immigration, first and foremost, is because I think it will make the world better off. The issue is, a non-insignificant number of people are heartless bastards, so if you try to tell them that immigration makes the immigrant's life better, some people will say stuff along the lines of ""I don't care about their life. They aren't American. They can die for all I care."" From there, one must argue to those potential voters that immigration does more than help just the immigrant, but also benefits them personally. That's where lines such as ""Who would mow your lawn then?"" end up coming into play: They are a lot more effective than getting an indifferent person to humanize.

And then, of course, people like you come along, and grasp on to only the last part of the argument, and say ""Hah, I knew those Dems were just as heartless as the people they criticize. Look at them, they just admitted they are only doing it for the mowed lawns. Guess they don't actually care about the immigrant."" From there, of course, us Dems must backtrack and clarify that we care about the lives of the immigrants too, upon which the indifferent folks say ""Woah, first you were talking about how this would benefit me, and now you are talking about humanity and shit. Guess I don't care anymore."" And then we must backtrack again.

From there, the cycle repeats itself.

This is the main reason. The point of this subreddit is to show what economists think when someone posts wrong economics online. 

Economists have mixed beliefs about student loan debt forgiveness. It is basically a big give away to people who are rich, not to people who are poor, and economists tend to think the rich shouldn't get handouts. 

As well, your argument against student loan debt relief is the same one made by student loan debt relief proponents: you can boost GDP by consuming more. This is an argument often made, especially those invoking the Keynesian Cross. That isn't a model of economic growth!

The symptom is ""lots of people can't afford college"". Making tuition tax subsidized is treating that symptom. But the actual problem is ""college is really expensive, much more so than it used to be"". The better solution to paying for everyone college tuition is fixing the underlying problem and only paying for those few people who are truly unable to pay.

It's the same thing with healthcare. Medicare for all and/or single payer are treating the symptom of ""most people can't afford healthcare"". But healthcare in the US is one of the most expensive in the developed world. I realize it's a hard problem, and there actually has been at least some research on why this is, but I have not seen basically any proposed policies, by anyone on either side, that are designed to make healthcare ACTUALLY CHEAPER.

To latch onto this point real quick, I think there are proposals out there to make healthcare cheaper but they (understandably so) often don’t look super appealing to the general public. One that I’m a fan of is trimming off (trimming off, not hacking off) regulations with groups like the FDA to try and lower drug prices while still encouraging research and investment.

That's a galaxy brain take you got right here.

It's almost as if you can decide the incidence of university costs if you use a fiscal policy to fund it.

> But my point is as follows. Once you raise the taxes on rich people, you receive say 1% more of revenue. Once you do that, you can use the money to pay free college for everyone (regressive) or use them to make, for example, public transportation free for everyone (highly progressive, at least in Europe) or to subsidize payday loans (extremely progressive) or give free uni to only people below a certain income level instead of middle and upper class kids.

In a very simplified model, they use education as a proxy level for ""skill"" and editorializing it's my understanding that no one thinks it doesn't take any ""skill"" to be a custodian, rather that it takes more rigorous training to acquire the ability to be say an actuary. That value of time is measured using education/training. 

Their model, which they call Ricardian, does away with this educational proxy and instead considers ""jobs"" as a bundle of ""skills"" necessary to complete a job (e.g. a waitress needs memory, customer service, etc). Then every individual has an endowment of ""ability"" that they can allocate to jobs they have a comparative advantage in.

Like in this post, wages are a great example. A consistent argument made by some economists is that certain low-skilled jobs are destined to be fixed at whatever price the market sets them. While it can be true that market forces will have a strong effect on wage value - and thanks to the time and effort it takes to learn and refine a skill that may even be the morally right outcome too - to deny that there is any part of that outcome that is the result of a political decision (or that a power imbalance might scupper one’s negotiating ability) is naive at best.

I am not an economist, but it seems like a fairly strong assumption to make, especially given you can empirically see people doing useful stuff without monetary motivation all the time. 

Some questions I can immediately come up with:

* How do you combine the existence of volunteer work with your idea that people don't do anything useful without being paid? E.g., I work in medical research, and I know a fair few physicians who don't get paid to do research, but do it anyway. They literally chose to work half a day or a day less, get paid less, so they have time to do research. This costs them literally thousands a year in wages compared to not taking that (half) day off.

* You'd also need to prove that the extra value (however you define that) they add for being paid millions weighs up to the lost value by having people who struggle to make a living wage. There might have been another Bill Gates who never got to work on his ideas because he could not afford a pc and/or did not have time because he had to work a low paid to make ends meet.

* I would also be curious if we really need to pay Bill Gates billions more, would he not also be motivated enough if it was just millions or hundreds of thousands more?

* Does monetary motivation actually motivate people to do things good for society, or does it just motivate them to do things that make money? Again, this seems a huge hole in your reasoning, would Steve Jobs not have been way more valuable if there were billions to be made solving child mortality or famine?

If your argument is a moral one, saying they deserve money for doing good things for society, then that is no argument for paying skilled workers more in general. I'd argue there are plenty of low skill workers more morally deserving of making money than some high skilled worker who makes sure you get the ads on facebook that are most likely to manipulate you into buying or doing something. Ultimately, if your argument is a moral one then it doesn't really make sense to argue it, because someone with different values will reach different conclusions anyway.",n23_,t2_i3g3h,-6,0,reddit1

One very important distinction is that it's not ""we"" who are paying these people, it is individual employers. Employers indeed do think that extra money paid to these people will bring more value to the company or else they wouldn't do it.

\#1: Indeed individuals will take a pay cut to do something they want to do, they may even pay to do so. But just because certain individuals will do so for certain jobs doesn't mean it holds true for all jobs.

\#2: As I said before, employers do deem that extra pay brings in extra value or else they wouldn't pay that much. Other people making less doesn't really factor into this decision. If you're talking from a societal perspective (which i think you are) then we're not talking about how much these people are paid, but optimal levels of wealth transfers and the distribution of those transfers, which is somewhat different.

\#3: First, most of Bill Gates wealth was not from being paid but from building and owning something that is very, very valuable. But second, yes people will respond to more money, even on the order of millions. This is not only through incentivized performance but also through competition. Look at the NFL, there are players who are being paid millions a year who will refuse to play until they're paid their market value.

/#4: Things that make money are generally what people want. If everybody put their iPhone budget towards donations towards solving child mortality, then yes there would be more competition in that market and more advancement. It's also ironic that you chose Bill Gates as the example as he's a perfect example of someone who has amassed a gigantic amount of wealth through the free market and is allocating it towards charitable causes.",,,13,0,reddit1

Combined with cultural notions about inherent ability and math being a uniquely difficult or unattainable subject this leads people to believe that their pattern of having trouble in math-heavy topics is due primarily to a lack of innate ability, a lack that can't be changed or overcome, rather than having missed an important building block of their math education. 

Parents and teachers who have math-related anxiety or view it as a particularly difficult topic are likely to (consciously or unconsciously) transmit these attitudes to their children or students. There's a big gender component, too, with the cultural attitude of girls being bad at math getting internalized and passed on.

I *have* worked with students who have learning disabilities around math, and I think there are some people with, for example, severe dyscalculia who would have a prohibitively difficult time ever doing physics at a university level, much like how a tone deaf person would probably find it impossible to be a concert cellist. But I tend to think (and I don't have data to back this up, this is my anecdotal observation/opinion) that one of the most common learning disabilities related to math is anxiety about it, and that's something that can absolutely be managed and overcome.

fpqrjzn,t1_fpq7x6r,2020-05-07 05:43:04,badeconomics,"The “Laffer curve” is definitely real as long as you accept two points and a few regularity conditions (for the calculus, to guarantee derivatives of the tax revenue function exist)

1. If the income tax rate is zero, no tax revenue is collected. 

2. If the income tax rate is 100%, no tax revenue would be collected as people have no incentive to work. 

If these conditions are met, then we can apply [Rolle’s Theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolle's_theorem) to conclude there’s some point in between 0% and 100% where tax revenue is locally maximized. 

However, the limitations of this argument are

1. There could be multiple such points that locally maximize revenue

2. Local maximization doesn’t imply global maximization

3. We don’t know where these points are, just that they are between 0% and 100% 

And others. In order to pin down these points, you need an actual model. [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393217300156) looks like a pretty decent summary of how you would go about doing that. [Older (free) version here.](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/paper/eAaZ8tyr)

From my understanding, the Laffer Curve either is difficult to pin down empirically or the estimates of the (globally) maximizing point are much larger than what people who taut the Laffer Curve probably think. However, we’re quickly leaving my area of knowledge. But I’m pretty sure most of the literature suggests we (the US) aren’t to the right of the maximizing point. Eg the paper I linked estimated the maximizing point for the US to be around 57%.",rationalities,t2_r8pya,29,0,reddit1

The point of my question is to interrogate to see if anyone does answer exactly as you have.

That you argue an economy can be entirely independent of politics.

A Robinson Crusoe economy is purely theoretical and therefore proves nothing in reality. 

No economist suggest it is reality of course, but they erroneously erase context.

You simply can’t do that. That’s my point, that the question is rhetorical.

And it’s not fruitless because when people are still saying things like “economics is a concept fully independent of politics” as truth rather than the philosophical statement it is, shows that the indoctrination is rife and needs to be questioned.

It saddens me that as economists we aren’t taught to be critical of the things we are learning. We are the one and ONLY science or social science that tries to perpetually uphold our discoveries, rather than to evolve them.

I’m not here to prove one theory over another I’m here to debate and I’m 9/10 met with other economists that just wanna repeat textbooks rather than come up with their own ideas.

The assumptions that you have provided preclude this.  In the framework above you have described a function which is zero at the endpoints and also presumably nonnegative (tax revenue cannot be nonnegative) and not identically zero (there is some level of taxation for which some amount of tax revenue is collected).  Under the weaker assumption of continuity such a function is guaranteed to have a maximum attained somewhere in the interior (proof is trivial: by the EVT the maximum exists and is attained, since the function is not identically zero but the endpoints are, it occurs in the interior).

If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers.

Skill is irrelevant if you are contributing to the economy and helping to make money and keeping the motor running, you are helping to create wealth. 

What is so wrong with wanting people to be fairly compensated at a baseline so they can afford to eat healthier, take their car to the mechanic and fixed it finally, maybe get a gym membership or pay for better childcare or be able to go on a trip with their kids. 

Why are we so obsessed with maintaining hierarchy that we want to make it an impossible shit hole you have to climb out of whilst trying to keep a roof over your head and not get sick and die. Picking yourself up by the bootstraps is an _oxy moron_ it’s meant to be contradictory, not inspirational. Literally go put on your boots and try picking yourself up by your bootstraps because _you can’t._


Corporations have made it impossible for workers to value their own labor. Uber, Amazon, they can afford labor at a wage that would keep people from slipping into poverty, but they just don’t _want_ to pay for it. Well, the rest of us don’t get to control the price of the things around us, yet we’re required to pay it otherwise we can’t have it. 

I’m sick of the argument that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and small businesses. 

Want a small business? Well, if you want labor you have to work towards being able to afford that, you don’t get handouts and cheap labor. Sorry, tough luck. 

Too bad it’s not seen this way and working class people are vilified for wanting to be valued as human beings. Why do poor people have to get fucked sideways and live on a knifes edge? They didn’t do well enough in their first 20 years so fuck them for the rest of their lives i guess. 

People  like Ben act like it’s not a zero sum game when it comes to acquiring wealth when you’re at the bottom, someone else having money doesn’t prevent poor people from making more money, 

But they’re the ones who treat it like it’s a zero sum game! Paying people more for their work isn’t going to ruin the economy and make you poorer either, and if it does than you lied about it not being a zero sum game.

I feel like almost too much value is placed on ""skill level,"" as if unskilled jobs are easy. Unskilled jobs can require physical strength and endurance, a willingness to put up with unpleasant environments and experiences. Is there no value in that?

There's the old story about the mechanic.

>A guy is having some trouble with his car, so he takes it into the mechanic. The mechanic sits there for a moment and listens to the car. He takes out his wrench and turns one nut a quarter turn clockwise, and suddenly the car is running perfectly. ""That'll be $500,"" the mechanic says. ""$500‽"" the owner says, ""all you did is turn one nut. I could have done that!"" ""You're not paying me $500 to turn the nut, you're paying me to know which nut the car needed turned and how far.""

So that's a story of skilled labor, but you can flip this for unskilled labor instead.

>A guy's driveway is falling apart, so he hires a laborer to repave it. So the laborer comes in with his truck, and a big asphalt mixer, and a bunch of tools. After only an hour to demolish the old driveway, and three hours to lay out all the new asphalt, he hands the bill to the homeowner.
>
>""$1,000? All you did was swing a hammer and shovel stuff onto the ground, I could have done that!""
>
>""Yes, but you're paying me to put up with the asphalt fumes, to be strong enough to do it all in only four hours, in the hot baking sun, and to guarantee I did the job right the first time, so you could do something you'd rather do during that time instead.""",Kichigai,t2_31nm3,42,0,reddit2

Isn't this Ben's MO. Like, no joke, didn't he write in his book all the bad faith tactics he employs to ""destroy"" liberals or whatever?

 [http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how\_to\_debate\_leftists\_and\_destroy\_them.pdf](http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how_to_debate_leftists_and_destroy_them.pdf)  

>Rule #10: Let The Other Side Have Meaningless Victories. This is a parlor trick you can use to great effect with your leftist friends. Leftists prize faux moderation above all else; by granting them a point or two, you can convince them that you aren’t a radical right-winger at all. After all, everyone can admit both parties are terrible! 

Bad faith

&#x200B;

> The left is wildly intolerant of religious people and conservatives; that’s why they’re interested in forcing Christian bakers to cater to same-sex weddings. They are anti-intellectual diversity, particularly in areas of American life in which they predominate; that’s why they stifle conservatism on campus and in the media. And as for social justice, if social is supposed to be opposed to individual, then social justice is by definition unjust. 

Not understanding the other argument, equivocation (""social""), misrepresenting the other side, ignoring the paradox of tolerance (it is true that tolerant people may not tolerate intolerance, this is not an internal inconsistency)

> the left won’t argue openly for what they would prefer: forcing people to practice medicine for patients deemed worthy by the government.  

...What?

&#x200B;

I hope this goes to show Ben is a bad faith actor who should not be given the benefit of the doubt and he isn't as interested in substantial, good conversation as you believe him to be.

&#x200B;

He also does have terrible economics.

ex7vw4u,t1_ex6ry1c,2019-08-17 18:11:21,badeconomics,"But your critique here just has so very little to do with what he's saying...in other words, if there is a way to break down Shapiro's statements into economically falsifiable claims; but instead you say:

>What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods.

Looking at/for market power in employers has almost nothing to do with what he is claiming. Shapiro's claim may be wrong and insensitive, but he's not saying it's entirely ""your fault"" (that's just standard leftist reactionary smear tactic to what conservatives are actually saying, and has no place here): he's saying that, the tools to increase one's skill and productivity level are readily available **enough** for just about any mentally-sound poorer person to avail themselves of.

Again, my hunch is that that is not entirely true; but the type of evidence necessary to falsify this claim is clearly not in the existence of monopsonies or undue market power (which should also hurt even more skilled workers, if to a lesser extent); but would have to come in the form of showing that those who personally made the efforts and sacrifices to educate themselves (e.g. take out loans to go back to school) and other very-hard-to-measure factors like ""hard work"" and engagement into that process, still fail to gain skills and promotion most of the time.

Ben Shapiro knows that it's harder for poor people to do this than for people born well-off (who you know, easier risk taking, don't have to worry about living costs while you educate yourself, etc.)

Most of Shapiro's statements are just not worth the time to respond to...but this critique is simply not worthy of the standards of rigor for /r/BE...this belongs in /r/politics.

Shapiro perpetuates the narrative that you ""just"" have to take higher paying jobs and/or educate yourself. Which is just empirically bullshit. Yes, some people can just do those things. Plenty of people can't. That's a problem. And it can be alleviated with good policy. Perpetuating this idea of poor people just not doing those things, not putting in the work for whatever reason although it's simply a choice, doesn't help anyone.

Imagine that your alternatives are a) move to where there are better jobs, or b) starve to death. This makes moving to where there are better jobs a very compelling option.

Now add a welfare state. If you can't find a job in the place where you already live, or a job that pays enough to support a certain standard of living, the government will provide a subsidy that allows you to get by. You might still choose to move! But choosing not to move no longer results in starving to death, which makes it a much more attractive option than it would have been in the first scenario.

Note that this is true even in a third scenario where the government will give you a subsidy if you stay and a bigger subsidy if you move. You might entirely reasonably decide that the subsidy you get if you stay is enough.

Another possible explanation, of course, which doesn't necessarily involve the welfare state, is that even in places in the US with low wages, wages are high enough that people don't feel a compelling need to move in search of higher wages. Rather than being too poor to move, people in these areas may be rich enough to stay.

My main point, though, is that the ""too poor to move"" story is hard to reconcile with the observation that even poorer people are routinely making even more difficult moves, so that's unlikely to be the whole story.

It's one thing to say that firms have some labor market power and can moderately depress wages relative to the optimal market-clearing price. I'm deeply skeptical that this effect is large in the low-skill labor market, but sure, it probably matters somewhat.

But the above is a terrible, terrible way of phrasing this. ""Markets decide wages"" is much, much more true than ""firms decide wages.""

He has been very critical of the apparent rise of the alt-right, racism, and antisemitism.

I think he has been pretty good about criticizing Trump at appropriate times, as well as praising him when he has done things that are consistent with Ben's values.

As for Ben's values, I find them to be quite consistent. He has certain principles, like violence is never okay in a civilized society, unless in self-defense. He has applied this principle many times while covering instances of protesting and rioting, no matter who is protesting and who is being violent.

Agree with his political philosophy or not, he does a pretty good job of laying out what he believes are the boundaries to government power. That would take a while to explain, but I remember finding these discussions very interesting when I first started listening to Ben, since conservatism/libertarianism was very new to me.

His general views of how people should treat each other has inspired me to be a more upstanding citizen, and more polite. I used to be a bit of a troublemaker when I was younger, committing minor crimes, but now any crimes, minor or not, that are bad for communities disgust me.

That's pretty related to his views on the importance of strong communities. He says religion is among the strongest ties a community can have, but since I'm not religious myself, I don't fully agree with him there. But he did make me see the importance of community in a different way.

As much as many people dislike his almost exclusive focus on personal responsibility on economic issues, he has motivated me to be much more financially responsible, and really just responsible in general.

I'm realizing now that much of what I get out of listening to Ben Shapiro has to do with bettering my behavior which is interesting.

I'm just not sure how you can interpret his words as anything other than a statement about mostly past and somewhat present personal responsibility for one's skillset and hireability or ability to start a business or provide for oneself in some other way.

Conservatives tend to chalk up everything to choice and personal responsibility...that's their whole schtick.
People on the left tend to always disingenuously interpret conservative views on choice personal responsibility as selfish, uncaring, ""fuck you, got mine"", which just isn't true, and they chalk nearly every outcome up to social factors completely out of individuals' control, past choices don't matter...that's their whole schtick.

That is where Ben Shapiro is coming from.  He's a smart enough person to know that a poor person has fewer and less-favorable options in the present, than does a wealthy person. Your critique is silly and just plays into the equally wrong thinking of Shapiro's political opponents that personal responsibility is no factor at all, and poor people are completely at the mercy of evil capitalists exploitation of them and the market at large.  It does not enlighten because it does not seek to understand and to falsify on the actual terms and context that subject is operating under.

Edit: his [recent show addresses](https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Ep-840---Solve-Your-Own-Problems-The-Government-Wont) these interpretations of what he said (in response to Kamala Harris saying that no one should *have* to work two jobs), right at the beginning, and basically confirms exactly what I'm saying: that he sees that the market is imperfect and things are harder for poorer people, but that this doesn't mean that present options are zero, or that taking multiple jobs, in the present or past, isn't in many cases exactly how to get ahead.

Decades ago you had to actually qualify for a student loan, so if you were poor, you had a much lesser shot of going to college than you do today. I know that as economically minded people we typically view cost as a barrier to entry, but when 18 year olds can go out and borrow six figures in one day for college regardless of financial background or status then it's not really the same thing as a typical barrier to entry in terms of accessibility.

>And educational requirements for a lot of jobs is relatively new, so there was a time where a person could move up just by being lucky or having some ambition. 

Economically speaking, I don't think that educational requirements are a bad thing. We live in a much more specialized economy now and that specialization has resulted in increased productivity and innovation. 

Also, suggesting that people can no longer move up by being lucky or ambitious is a pretty ridiculous assertion, though I guess you can get away with saying it because there isn't an empirical way to measure it or debunk it.

Well, sticking with the subject, we couldn't use data indicating QoL increases from geographic movement/immigration since on average people only move once the prospective utility increase overcomes their risk aversion. So I don't have data to enrich the conversation.

However I can tell you at places I have worked, headhunters are not valued for the ability to convince people of a prospective opportunity, but rather identifying which networks need to be made aware that such a position is available. Entirely anecdotal unfortunately, although I've seen that in common across SEA.

People become geographically fixed for a number of reasons that appear to expand the mirage of short term utility in lieu of professional development and status. There is often a sunk cost fallacy involved.

How many people do we know where someone turned down a promotion to a new location for an SO only to be broken up with and burn a year waiting for the hiring window again? That was sub-optimal. They made a decision about an easily replaced title, SO, for a job that would have increased their social status and made them a better prospective partner aside from every other QoL that came with it. Risk existed on both sides of the scenario and they chose wrongly.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I don't know how to show the scenario in data. There are many unsignaled job opportunities, particularly out of network, which is most jobs abroad. Technology gets very close to providing frictionless labour movement, but it isn't quite sufficient in minor economies where skilled labour demand can be very high.

This is not true.  

I suspect that Peterson is looking at *household income*, not wages. Household income has been constant, largely because of changes to the composition of households. See [Where Has All The Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) for details.

I'd also suggest looking at [Autor's Inequality Among the 99%](https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/96768), which shows that we have seen increases in wages for the population with college degrees, while those with HS degres or less have not seen changes (or slight declines)

> Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? 

This is the Borjas gambit. Peterson is looking at how women entering the labor force in partial equilibrium, but has forgotten that they would also consume more. 

> What happens? You halve the value of the labor. 

Peterson seems to think that Y=W*H (GDP = Wages x Hours). This is 1.) incorrect. 2.) causing him to reason from an accounting identity, assuming that GDP is fixed.

> So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. 

This is not true. Labor productivity is increasing. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MPU4900062

> So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.

Peterson is missing that women largely moved from unpaid in-household to paid out-of-household production. Hours worked has actually been remarkably stable for women over the last several decades.

Cheaper labor also means more freedom to substitute labor for capital for the firms that can do so, leading again to an increase in productivity.

I seem to remember there being a fair amount of literature exploring whether that theory has been borne out in reality, and no doubt Peterson gets numerous things wrong here, but isn’t the fundamental theory just standard labor supply and demand?

Edit: [Here's one article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.12336) that seems to echo the point that if women entering the labor force merely shifted the supply curve, then we would expect wages to drop.

I've watched quite a few of his debates and interviews and it seems to me that many on the internet are working hard to paint a horrid picture of the man -- an absurd caricature in most cases. On top of that I see a lot of trying to depict those who agree with him as some kind of second-class trump supporting chauvinistic idiots. I'm surprised to see it on this subreddit to be honest. 

A side note on the bolded text: it is true that wages can fall in some sectors with the entering of women into the work forces, although it is unlikely to have that effect on average . This has nothing to do with women per se. One only needs a group with different preferences to enter the work force.  ",esthim8,t2_4y1qc,-1,0,reddit3

Well, if women leave the home and work now they need cars and transportation, so we have a massive boost in automobiles, repair services, part manufacturers, tire companies, all of that. The one car family becomes the two car family, and that alone is a massive demand increase. 

And the tasks that women completed in the home were real work that now is either done by both in their free time, or often, outsourced.

Instead of a woman making dinner every night, restaurant after restaurant, delivery after delivery place appeared. All of those jobs. All of that money. 

Instead of women cleaning clothes fastidiously by hand, dry cleaners and expensive washing machines became popular. 

Instead of raising young children, daycare services and services for children got more popular.

Now it's routine to hire a maid to come by and clean your home. It's routine to have pay babysitters and nannys. It's routine to pay extraordinary amounts for daycare.

“I don’t think there’s any legal expert that would say that [this] would meet the threshold for hate speech in Canada,”

What I do enjoy about his work are the 12 rules of life (self help book) and his youtube lectures centered around his other book maps of meaning. He is a clinical psychologist and a lot of his work on self authoring program to overcome depression and anxiety I do find to be empowering. When combined with his articulate lectures I find his work on self improvement at times to be poetic, logical, and genuine. His self improvement lectures might not resonate with everyone. 

As far as his other views on college campus politics, economics, and postmodernism, I take with a healthy skepticism. He brought somethings to my attention in regards to certain actions by university administrators I find concerning. But its something I need to explore further before I can come to a conclusion. 

The reason I think he resonates with young men in particular because he is seen as a someone willing to stand up for them. I think young men might feel, whether justified or not, marginalized in certain aspects of modern university and societal settings and he is seen as a champion for them. 

Hope this provides some insight into some of his works and why he might be popular.

dzgjsez,t1_dzfygr4,2018-05-23 18:58:26,badeconomics,"I think there are alternate ways of fueling demand compared to less at-home-production. 

Don't you think it would be a better society 

. if the currently less at-home produced goods were produced at home as we will produce health and well being oriented goods(rather than profit oriented) for our consumption and the surplus produce can be aggregated by e-commerce or other marketplaces(they can be profit oriented) and sold, thus providing money to households and to marketplace businesses but only now households earn the extra money, have also entered the workforce in a different way and are keeping stuff healthier. This whole ecosystem can be supported by enforceable contracts. 

. Also since we are producing certain foodstuffs and other home oriented stuff for ourselves, more income is now disposable and we can pay for a lot of stuff that is being consumed for free(apps like Facebook, Games, etc.). If we were willing to pay $2/month  for Facebook, that would translate to billions of dollars of revenue which they can earn instead of selling our data and earning from ads. 

. The stuff that cannot be produced at home like hardware, software, vehicles, petrol, etc. can be produced by businesses. 

Higher family income and a consumer mindset is required for demand. Just having the money but not having the desire to buy all those things will not fuel the demand. Overall I have a feeling that this whole everybody earning by working at small businesses /corporations /etc. is part of the ecosystem that fuels the consumer mindset.

can you explain a bit more? i still dont understand. the study's argument is that household incomes have declined because the number of people in the households who are earning incomes has on average declined. yet pew states that there are a lot more households who have 2 people earning income than before. so on one hand we have a study which states that a lot of dual-income households have switched to single-income households (i.e. now there are less dual-income households) and on the other hand we have pew which states that there are more dual-income households. this is a contradiction, is it not?  

which sentence is wrong in the above explanation? 

> There have always been two workers in the household. But the advent of the washer/dryer/refridgerator/vacuum/textiles/IKEA have dramatically reduced the workload associated with household maintenance, such that many women entered the workforce.

so with a single income, it would be easier for a family to live now than 'back in the day' because of technology like washer/dryers that make household maintenance easier? please correct me if i am misinterpreting what you are saying. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,8,0,reddit3

He is popular partly because he offers adrift young men a sense of heroic purpose, and offers angry young men rationalizations for their hatreds.

>Men get frustrated when they are not competitive in the sexual marketplace (note: the fact that they DO get frustrated does not mean that they SHOULD get frustrated. Pointing out the existence of something is not the same as justifying its existence). Frustrated men tend to become dangerous, particularly if they are young. The dangerousness of frustrated young men (even if that frustration stems from their own incompetence) has to be regulated socially. The manifold social conventions tilting most societies toward monogamy constitute such regulation.

dzepywz,t1_dzeo6rs,2018-05-22 21:10:27,badeconomics,"I think I've got this, so let me take a crack at this.

Household incomes have declined because the number of people in a given household isn't as large as it used to be, on average. In plain terms, people tend to get married/co-habitate with a spouse/long-term significant other at older ages, or you live with your parents for longer (which would qualify as a family household rather than increasing the number of earners in your household. At least that's how I'm interpreting it). So if more people are legally single or in a family household for longer, than the number of people in the average household decreases as well. 

So in the terms you outlined, the average wages of the individual have increased, but the average number of people in the household have decreased. Thus, the gains of the individual don't quite outstrip the delay of adding/loss of a second earner to the household.

And your second point is a bit off. A household replaces the domestic labor of a homemaker with a washer, dryer, etc., but that stuff costs money. Which should theoretically be seen as income earned by the formerly domestic spouse who is now free to earn from their labor at a job. But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).",ToastedMayonnaise,t2_bpdts,7,0,reddit3

You can test a woman’s preference in men. You can show them pictures of men and change the jaw width, and what you find is that women who aren’t on the pill like wide-jawed men when they’re ovulating, and they like narrow-jawed men when they’re not, and the narrow-jawed men are less aggressive. Well all women on the pill are as if they’re not ovulating, so it’s possible that a lot of the antipathy that exists right now between women and men exists because of the birth control pill.

are you saying that people nowadays tend to delay working in favor of living with their parents? or that they work while living with their parents? if it's the latter, i dont see how this wouldn't be increasing the number of earners in a family household. 

> or in a family household for longer, than the number of people in the average household decreases as well.

i don't get this either. are family households not a part of the broad category of 'households'? if more people are living in family households than before, that will correspondingly increase the average just as much as it is decreased by people not living on their own/with spouses.

Which should theoretically be seen as income earned by the formerly domestic spouse who is now free to earn from their labor at a job. But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).

i don't quite understand how my point was off. isn't what i said largely similar to what the implied conclusion is of this above paragraph? how does your explanation prove in a different way than mine that it is easier for a single-income family to live now than it was before?  

or are you disagreeing altogether with the conclusion posited by besttrousers? im not sure if you are arguing that it is easier or harder than before for a single-income family to live. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,10,0,reddit3

>The lump of labor fallacy is the assumption that the quantity of labor required in an overall economy is fixed. This assumption in regarded as fallacious, as the consensus view among economists today is that the quantity of labor demanded varies with respect to many factors. Foremost, these economists argue that employment of labor can expand the overall size of the economy, leading to further job creation. In contrast, reducing the amount of labor employed would decrease overall economic activity and thus further decrease the demand for labor. The lump of labor fallacy is also known as the ""fallacy of labor scarcity,"" ""lump of jobs fallacy,"" a ""fixed pie fallacy,"" or a ""zero-sum fallacy.""

* I do not want to know your anecdote.

So, you have a story about your own job search, or your own employer. I don't want to know. Individual experiences are very different. That's why we have overall statistics. I have deleted more than 20 anecdotes already.

* Remember Rule II.

If you want to make some long-and-complicated claim then you must provide a cite for it.

* Multiple jobs are irrelevant.

Lots of people claim that employment is high because lots of people are working multiple jobs. This is not true. The BLS do not double-count. If you work two jobs you are counted as one worker.

* Are the statistics faked?

The BLS' *Employment situation* for September 2023 – [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) – says:

* men between the ages of 20 and 24 have an unemployment rate of 8.4 per cent (for comparison for men 25 years and older that is 3.3 pc and for women aged 20–24 that is 5.7 pc);
* within persons above the age of 25, high school graduates have seasonally adjusted unemployment at 4.1 pc while for college graduates this is 2.1 pc.

If one were to combine those two statistics, I would expect they wouldn't be uniformly distributed either.

A couple of things to keep in mind:

1) The US is large and moving from an area of low unemployment to high unemployment to find a job with a certain skillset can be difficult if not impossible if you're living paycheck to paycheck.  

2) Not all job skill translate *or* many employers *feel* not all skills translate across professions or industries.  Employers need someone who can come in and start being productive immediately, not 6 months down the road. 

3) It depends on what jobs are in demand and have low occupancy rate.  A factory worker that's out of work can't immediately start working in an IT job at a computer help desk as they don't have the skills to effectively communicate with customers on a phone, navigate potential issues in the operating system or troubleshoot issues without having the exact steps needed to follow.  Even then, the employee would be much less productive than their peers until months down the road with some experience.   

&#x200B;

That's just a few reasons I can think of.  It's not great, but unfortunately there's not a collective  force between states to work together to allow areas with high unemployment with certain skill sets to influence businesses to expand there or re-locate where the labor is.

k6yidmn,t1_k6jbbms,2023-10-29 14:59:26,AskEconomics,"I would add to this that there are large skill gaps. Trades, in particular, are in a bad way. Trained, qualified boat mechanics had a deficit of 40k jobs before the pandemic - those are the numbers I heard at least. Electricians are a facing -225k deficit, and in the next five years they are expecting a “silver drain” due to retirements. Aircraft repair is in a similar situation - I don’t recall the numbers. I’m sure HVAC, plumbing etc are in the same boat. 

With all of the retirements, a lot of “tribal knowledge” is about to disappear. That’s a huge hit to productivity. There’s another issue, however. Many of the people with the tribal knowledge can be dicks about handing that down. Poor education standards, that weird, 30+ year drive we have had for “go to college to get a good job” propaganda (never mind the predatory nature of college lending) has created a workforce incapable or unwilling to climb around hot attics, unplug sewage pipes or spend their evenings getting grease and grime out from under their fingernails. These are no longer desirable jobs. It also doesn’t help that the cost of entry can suck. Low pay, cost of tools, productivity expectations, health hazards and knowledge deficits vs knowledge expectations can all be barriers for entry or longevity. 

Having worked adjacent to manufacturing for most of my career, I can’t help but roll my eyes when politicians promise the return of manufacturing. Because of the export of manufacturing jobs starting 30+ years ago en masse, there’s far fewer qualified individuals available to manage and run manufacturing facilities.

One thing stands out to me, which I wanted to note: people forget the value of institutional knowledge (or “tribal knowledge”), especially the knowledge contained in the heads of workers which gets poorly communicated for one reason or another. (And in a lot of cases, that knowledge was hard-won on a manufacturing floor. Knowledge most managers may not even be aware of. Hell, knowledge *workers* may not be aware of as vital; to them, it’s just “well, that works, so we do it.” Unknown-knowns: thing we know, but we don’t know we know and thus don’t know need to be communicated.)

It’s one reason why as a software developer I get cranky about poor documentation—because that’s “institutional knowledge” that is getting lost otherwise.

k6oj1at,t1_k6kbopy,2023-10-27 13:49:47,AskEconomics,"I’m sorry? Companies routinely hired more people then they needed during the last 2-3 years precisely because it’s hard to find certain skill sets, and the companies that could afford the underutilization of said skilled workers stood to benefit if the economy kept running hot and they picked up more work. 

As it stands, the opposite happened because the fed raised rates and companies couldn’t expand anymore, so they laid most of these people off. 

Lastly the people that can’t get a job I’d wager are probably applying to jobs they just aren’t qualified for. For every open position we get a hundred applications. 80% of these resumes are completely unqualified or can’t even be bothered to run their resume through a spell checker. 

Of the 20% that remain, by the time we get to interviews half of them will already be working, 5 of the ones remaining want way to much money, so we’re left to choose from MAYBE 5 candidates for the position, 2-3 of those will have little experience but at least the right skill set.

These are both nominal variables of course CPI is record high; the Fed targets a positive rate of inflation. The important part is the \*real\* wages and incomes are at or near all time highs. Same thing with your debt variables you link later, you need to adjust them for inflation.

The household income is also partly because households got smaller post-COVID, If you look at **rereal** median personal income you'll see that the 2022 numbers are about 1% lower than the all time high in 2019, if that's your definition for ""the economy is collapsing"" then sure, you got me.

&#x200B;

My point is that CPI and inflation are seemingly disconnected with the cost of living for the majority of people. 

&#x200B;

Hence, the flat looking lines for the bottom 60%, moderate growth for the 2nd quintile, and meaningful growth for only the top quintile.

In this case, you’ll often find that your best bet to get a pay increase is sometimes just to find another company with a higher salary. If you aren’t getting wage raises,  that might be one’s best bet. Just make sure you have the job before you leave your current one. Your employer doesn’t have to know you are looking elsewhere until you give notice. They might give you a raise if they value you, otherwise why would you want to stay if you have another job offer with better pay.

It’s unfortunate, but in some industries it’s become pretty common. Even for low wage workers, $17/hr is the new $15. Until and if prices come down. You can’t sit there and hope the cost of living will go back down. The truth is, it might go down some, but it’s really uncertain nowadays. It might not go back down much. I’m serious about minimum wage needing to go up. It was a problem before and is just getting worse.

Processors generally only make around 45-50k depending, and they are laid off in droves along with all other operations jobs.  I see processor positions go up all the time with 1000+ applications within a few hours.  The only ones that don’t get a ton of apps are the ones paying even worse, like $18-20/hour, which in my area is less than you make at Amazon or Wendy’s which require no degree or experience.  Most of the jobs are just not there due to the government royally screwing things up.  Bouncing rates around so much and now seeing a huge hike after record lows, combined with house prices super inflated, has led to over 50% of the mortgage industry laid off.  People are saying it’s worse than the 08 housing crash.

The only really higher paid mortgage professionals are underwriters, and they barely scratch the six figure mark and that requires years of experience and fairly strict testing to get certified for govt loans.  Sales people can potentially make six figures, but generally it’s only the top 10-15% of producers doing that, you have a lot in the middle and bottom not coming anywhere near six figures.

A processor has intermittent knowledge of everything but their main job is getting docs uploaded and reviewed and doing preliminary checks.  They coordinate between multiple people as well.

Some areas have city lots, others are subdivision lot numbers, while other areas use legal descriptions based on section town range or military survey numbers.  Each county with their own way of indexing.  In the counties with name index only, you have to view each documents legal description to see if it's one you are searching for.  Might take a long while if you have a common name, company, or slumlord with tons of properties to look at.   

But no matter what you change today, there is still the issue of all the old documents and indexing.  Not many options when you are talking about looking at 200 year old handwritten deeds on a 1970s microfiche. Commercial searches tend to be 60-100 year searches.  Even longer if issues like mineral rights.  


Let's say you come up with the perfect idea.  It would be nearly impossible to implement unless you can get every county official on board.  Even if you did do that, next election rolls around and some new politician might have his way he wants it done.  


There are companies out there trying.

The entire idea of title insurance and checking that the title is in good standing should have been modernized long ago and be ready for another round of modernization today. It should be incredibly easy and digital to have this stuff tracked and available to whomever needs it.

It's just all legacy processes. The amount of stuff I had to send my mortgage guy for my last purchase was insane. Underwriters requiring form after form and having to verify how long I've had my money or what account it sat in. There's some limited value to making sure that the buyer didn't take a short-term loan or falsified their income, but in the end, A lot of this shit should have been able to be intuited from credit score and purchase history, and it's not like the bank doesn't have the fallback of owning the property in the end of something DOES go wrong.

I know, I know, the bank doesn't want to assume the risk of the property going down in value AND the buyer falling through, But at scale the incremental value gained by these marginally improved securities is getting sucked up entirely in the middleman and processes that are used to provide it.

You keep saying businesses wouldn’t spend money if they didn’t have to buy the reality of it is that banks only do this to mitigate their risk and they shift the cost onto the buyers and sellers anyways. Between that and regulation are the only reason real estate closing is a thing and that all these people are employed in it.

I’m not bad with money, I’ve paid cash for my last two homes and vehicle, I also have money sitting in treasuries that expire this September that will go into my 3rd house, and by the time that rolls around my goal is to have enough cash to buy two houses if the market is kind. The negative remark on my credit score I contested and its in the amount of 980 bucks for 1 month rent. The property management company took my 1k deposit then came up with a bullshit itemized bill for repairs to the house after I moved out that magically added up to exactly one extra month of rent. I contested it 3 times and they won’t remove it. Its also listed as “professional debt” on my credit report which I asked credit bureau to change since it was a dispute related to rent and had nothing to do with professional debt at all. In the end, most of this is TMI and probably too personal but I’d like you to understand that bad credit score doesn’t equate to bad money management. Most of my bad credit boils down to me being a saver and buying everything cash because I hate paying interest. If I could go back, I’d pay that company the 980 even though they fucked me.

The argument has been that statistics say that a variable rate loan is on average cheaper than a fixed-rate loan. Obviously this is only relevant if you have the income to mitigate the risk of high interest rates.

The thing in sweden is that when you apply for a mortgage the bank is legally bound to calculate a stressed situation with about 7% interest rate for the household income/expenses.. and if the surplus isn't high enought the loan can't be approved. So in sweden most households have historically had a large margin and opted for variable rate loans.

Sweden also has an important law regarding housing - you can never be forced to sell your home as long as you pay the interest on your loans, along with the minimum legally allowed amortization. So even if the market super-crashes and the valuation of your home is suddenly half of that of the loan, you can't be forced to sell your house as long as you pay the interest.

First, we're dealing with real estate title and plats of survey, which is a government thing that requires verification, often involving a person literally sifting through paper documents in government filing cabinets. That intersects with insurance, which is both highly regulated and fundamentally responsible for making sure that this closing doesn't create future title clouds that they could be financially liable for a decade or more in the future.

Then you have financial underwriting. This is highly regulated (in theory) since the 2008 crisis to make sure that loans conform to secondary market requirements for accurate reselling and scoring. That requires an extremely robust and validated paper trail of documents that are manually reviewed to prevent fraud or future liability for misrepresenting loan quality. This underwriting process is often compounded by borrowers being kind of a pain about getting documents back on time.

Add to this the fact that the finance department is trying to keep an interest rate that was originally calculated using LIBOR or some other constantly-fluxtuating calculation. That involves regularly calculating and recalculating spreads, point buys, variances, and whatever else needs to happen so that the buyer doesn't flip out over an eighth of a point sixty days after the first soft pull.

Then add appraisals, inspections, attorney reviews, contingencies, the cost of wasted labor, and eventually you get a picture of why this seems so backwards.

If you're a cash buyer, this is essentially what happens - and it is very easy.

You're completely free when making a cash purchase not to hire an attorney to do a title search or make sure the closing documents are in order.  Of course, if you're going to hand over a couple hundred grand in Bitcoin or cash, you might want to know that the person purporting to sell you the property actually has clear title to that property, and that you are getting an unencumbered deed to that property.  You might also want to know if there are any existing covenants that run with the land, or any liens against the property for money owed to other parties.  Few people have the skills to do this on their own, but if you really want to do it yourself and save the expense, by all means.

Just don't complain when you get sold the proverbial Brooklyn Bridge and the seller absconds with your $xxx,xxx worth of Bitcoin/cash leaving you holding a worthless property (or nothing at all).

People hire professionals for a real estate transaction because most people cannot answer these questions on their own.  But there is nothing to stop a person from buying a property with a big bag of cash or Bitcoin if the seller is willing to accept that.",crake,t2_97ly,19,0,reddit1

As per your other comments, your lack of knowledge of the subject really shows through when you make baseless statements like “people who’s literal job is to hand you things”.  Who do you think is doing that exactly?  Processors?  Disclosure specialists?  Because they aren’t.  

A processor, like I mentioned before, communicates what is needed if there is any confusion from the borrower.  They do an initial overview when docs get uploaded to make sure there aren’t issues like I previously mentioned (missing or cut pages, missing docs all together).  They make sure HOI amount is correct.  They make sure no docs are expired, such as title or credit reports.  They make sure title docs actually list the buyer and seller as the transaction is set up as (seller actually owns it and buyer has nothing like outstanding liens and such).  

On top of just reviewing docs they also order a lot of stuff behind the scenes that most buyers probably aren’t even aware of.  They order a UDN every few days to make sure no new hits to credit have showed up.  They do a verification of employment at the end to make sure the borrower is still employed.  They order tax transcripts to verify they match w2s and nothing was falsified.  They get FHA case numbers and log them, along with the appraisal so the government has it on file since there are tons of requirements that go along with that.  This is just scratching the surface of some of their job responsibilities. 

So no, there is NO ONE that is just hands you things.  I understand most people don’t see any of this so are completely clueless about the fact.  But your comment would be like saying why do I need an anesthesiologist when I have surgery, they “only” put a mask on my face and put me under.  Why can’t the doctor do it?  Why are assistants needed, can’t the doctor just put tools on a tray and pick them up himself?

Let’s cut to the end though, if given the choice most people wouldn’t pay for what closing provides, it is forced by banks and it also satisfies some government regulations. The government should be able to guarantee titles and if they could then title insurance would not be needed to mitigate risks for banks. Same with properly lines and anything else that would ultimately get decided by the government. If that were the case then everything could be streamlined down and most of the intermediary steps would disappear. 

Sorry for not being sympathetic but from buying/selling property multiple times the closing process just doesn’t add value from my point as the end buyer/seller. I’ll have to go look at my itemized breakdowns of closing costs but from what remember there were some questionable items in there.

Honestly I see it mostly as a bank/government forced process which basically means it’s just a political/legal fee. Like anything else in that category it simply doesnt have to provide value to the end customer because for the majority of people it’s unavoidable. If this were actually a competitive market then it’d show through with people actually improving it but since it’s not there is no incentive to do so and actually a disincentive to charge anything but the max. 

Also I love it when people say it’s the biggest purchase, it’s on a loan, etc because obfuscating fees is part and parcel with home buying/selling. Oh a few percent here for this realtor, more for that other realtor, a few more percent for closing but what does it matter because it’s nothing when compared to the full cost of the house right and it’s your dream home right. Just charge fees that would equate to a huge portion of someone’s yearly income but it’s ok because it’s housing.

Edit: my other big qualm with closing is they’ve never told me anything I didn’t know. Everything had already been disclosed, I’m already familiar with the loan terms, etc etc. It seems like regulation that makes sure the lowest common denominator isn’t screwed over but for everyone else they are paying to be told things they already know.",bender_the_offender0,t2_3cjf68f9,1,0,reddit1

It encourages deprioritizing long term gain and protective strategies to achieve consecutive short term advantage on a per-quarter basis; the least resilient outcompete the more resilient over each consecutive short term period until that resilience is tested - by disruptions, such as a pandemic - at which point the disadvantage of resiliency in non-disrupted environments ensures an insufficient level of market share/economic activity remains with resilient actors to prevent the disruption from collapsing the entire system (absent outside assistance to the non-resilient, further encouraging the dismantling of resiliency strategies and making future disruption more and more dangerous).

igl2y69,t3_w13ljl,2022-07-18 00:47:27,Economics,"Biggest problems with the global economy as I see them:

* Lack of affordable housing in North America. This disincentivizes immigration and strangles the economic potential of the most prosperous continent of the last century. As this market is so huge and real estate is such a large part of this market, this in turn acts as a brake on the potential of the top end of the global economy. A brake which when tapped in 2007 caused the Euro to all but fail and the global financial markets to collapse.
* Lack of regulation of financial markets, especially where they straddle borders. Money moves faster than regulation, and in recent years it has evacuated increasingly via loopholes & tax havens into the richest individuals. This wealth inequality further acts as a brake on the global economy, as the uber-wealthy are rarely willing to invest in the high risk endevours & strategic spending that tends to benefit society the most in the long run (Elon Musk & Bill Gates are notable exceptions to this rule, but even then they can only spend their money so fast and it would likely benefit more people directly if most of that wealth was spent by the government).
* Demographic collapse in East Asia, especially in China & South Korea. Japan has been struggling with this for a while, and the net effect we’ve seen has been a lack of innovation and a slowing of the appearance of novel businesses. Additionally the demographic imbalance tends to be a self-feeding problem if social spending is not geared towards children, as people are forced to pay a premium to have children since so much of the potential socialized wealth is absorbed by white hairs. No country on planet Earth has this priority in order, and the only reason it hasn’t happened in NA or Europe yet is a much more robust dating culture among young adults, no gender-selection among infants, and plentiful immigration from Latin America & Africa (which now appears to be stalling in Europe).
* The steady rise of the global price of wheat. Wheat is the most important calorie crop globally, accounting for most of the international market in calories. As this price rises, the poorer & already cash starved nations in Pan-Arabia & central Africa are going to grow increasingly unstable. These regions are important sources of many natural resources, so instability here will have a very immediate effect on other markets. This is of course not anywhere as important as the human cost, with literally millions of people facing famine in the next 3-5 years at the latest if something does not budge with the global wheat market (Russia has to let Ukraine’s grain ships go).
* The immediate effects of global warming. Rising salinity in water tables, acceleration of the water cycle with longer drought periods, and the expansion of deserts are the most immediate impacts of global warming, and have already had a very real global economic impact.

We are a primarily consumer economy so if the average consumer has to pay more in rent but they aren’t getting more in wages their buying power goes down. Meaning they are spending less on consumer goods and local services. Meaning less money circulating through the economy. Causing lay offs in local stores further decreasing local buying power.

SS was and remains very simple in concept.

Tax the working to support the retired.

The plan was *never* to be a government savings account where you pay into it throughout your career, and the government holds your money then supports you in old age. I offer as evidence the fact that payments to retirees began in the same year that the program and its associated payroll tax was implemented.  The ""trust fund"" was a demographic accident. Now that pile is eroding.  

The biggest always true and not terribly significant twist to that is that the excess ""trust fund"" (misleading name) was invested in US Treasuries. This is what people mean when they say it has been raided, but it really just meant it earned some interest.

Soon we will reach a point where we have to reduce payments to correspond with current payroll tax revenues, or increase the payroll tax rate.

igixv5r,t1_igijps9,2022-07-17 15:16:29,Economics,"The government is able to borrow against the social security trust fund (the $3T pile of cash that is what we colloquially refer to as social security). That money is borrowed as government bonds and we routinely pay back the interest on it. When the bonds expire that lump sum of money is given back that was borrowed the same as most bonds.

Im sure there are more, but there are multiple major problems I know of with social security that aren’t being addressed:

1) the number of people receiving money vs the number of people paying in has gotten worse over time. This mainly just exacerbates the problem as these people live longer and longer.

2) Spouses who didn’t put money into the system (or not enough to qualify for benefits) can collect benefits off of their working partner. See spousal benefits.

3) Wages for the majority have stagnated for decades which means that the 6.2% you put in isn’t keeping up with the benefits which get COLAs due to inflation.

4) the money borrowed from the trust fund can only be invested in government bonds which more or less only helps to fend off inflation (on average) with hopefully a very small real gain. Social security is essentially a poorly constructed annuity with massive longevity issues.

The remedies to the problem (assuming we want to keep SS) are:

1) Increase the cap on taxable wages. Essentially we only tax the first $147,000 dollars for social security (as well as the employer contribution). Maintaining the cap on the benefit while collecting this additional tax does mitigate a size-able portion of the problem, but it in no way solves it. Only implementing this is kicking the can.

2) Raise the tax rate from 6.2% in order to sustain the current benefits.

3) I don’t believe stock options are taxed for FICA (I very well could be wrong, but I don’t think mine were taxed when I invoked them), but I believe this would also have a sizable impact.

4) raise the FRA (full retirement age) significantly to reflect peoples increased longevity.

5) stop COLAs or significantly raise the minimum wage. This will help to mitigate stagnant wages and the affect of them I mentioned previously. This may very well have other unintended consequences of the system and our overall economy.

6) Increase the employers portion for major corporations. This is one solution which will take money from these “greedy companies” though they will likely just raise prices or flatten wages at the bottom to compensate. (I don’t support this, but it’s a possible solution)

Disclaimer: All this being said I am a very big supporter of eliminating social security. I think the people would be significantly better off allowing that money to be invested in something reasonable like a 50/50 index/bond portfolio. There is a reason that pension plans have fallen by the way side and 401(k) and similar plans have dominated;because they’re more efficient and cheaper to operate.

I do recognize that a significant portion of the population has absolutely no financial literacy and giving them access to potentially millions of dollars on a particular date would not be good for their retirement because they can’t manage their money properly , but I consider that a form of natural selection. If they’ve lived that long they should no better and if they don’t it’s on them.

Sorry to get political. Hope that helps.

Edit: I forgot means testing a method of reducing be if it’s to those who actually have assets. It’s been discussed before.

The truth is, raising children is hard, often thankless work, and involves huge sacrifices. This is true even in the most supportive of environments.

And ultimately, when given the choice, people are increasingly deciding that it's just not worth it.

And that's for people living in situations/places where social support systems are well established. The tradeoff only becomes even worse for women in societies that don't adequately support children and families.

There are very apparent differences for example when looking at the fertility rate of different racial groups in US. Asian-Americans lowest, than White-Americans second lowest.

If people value their own upward mobility, then children are fundamentally an opportunity cost.

Kids used to be labor for the family. They were a net-positive economic contribution to the parents income statement, starting at an early age and increasing with the years. Then we started moving to the cities and changed the rules - and the economics.

Now, and with the best intentions, we use urban-centric regulations that restrict the work children are allowed to do, we price them out of the labor market with artificial wage controls and we monopolize the vast majority of their time for the decades between 5 and ~~15~~ 25.

Further down the line, in a modern tragedy of the commons, we have shifted responsibility for care of seniors from the family to the larger collective, further diminishing the value to the family of having children.

Thus, children are no longer the future in the urbanized West. With children representing an increasing economic drag on their parents it's no wonder that so many young adults are making the entirely rational decision to forego the expense of having them. Instead, children have become  expensive entertainment and socio-economic status symbols and that ain't enough incentive to perpetuate the species.

Point of fact: women that do have kids are having the same amount they've been having for decades. The reason the overall reproductive rates have crashed is because of the explosion of childless women which was about 10% in 1970 and at least in the US is just over 50%. I strongly encourage everybody to watch the full Birth Gap documentary.

https://youtu.be/KfBL_Qn9jug?si=mtdV113YCeFssOsl

This guy gets into the weeds with the historical trend and economics:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwIeDuHwXJY

Economics - People can barely afford to live, how are they supposed to start a family? The average age of first time home ownership has gone from mid-20s to ~46! If women want to have a traditional family and be provided for, then they're going to have to do so with men MUCH older as the guys their age are struggling economically more now than ever. And the data bears this out. Bumble is calling 2024 the year of the (large) age gap relationship.

Education and getting their bag - Many modern women have been mistakenly convinced to focus on getting their degree and starting a career before having their family. This frequently causes the hypergamy success paradox where the higher up the socioeconomic ladder women climb, the fewer suitable men there are to date (up to), and is a major component why half of childless women are NOT childless by choice as they ""stayed in the casino too long"". 

In the end a ton of women squander their fertility window for 10-15 years of fun, education, and career, and it's not until the wall approaches as their fertility begins to wane they decide to settle down and pencil in a husband and kids. Often to find the men they want are already married or otherwise unavailable. 

This is why my advice for women who know early on they want to have a family, to do so young when they're 18-23 in your physical prime. You'll never have a better opportunity to attract a man and your body will bounce back after birth far easier in your prime. After you have the kids and they're off to school, THEN go get that degree and start a career. You'll be much more attractive to employers when they know you're not going to disappear on them to *start* a family as you're already established.",rpujoe,t2_ung2sof2,2,0,reddit3

It's also worth noting that this change has happened quite rapidly in the bigger scheme of things, less than a human lifetime. People and economies have had relatively little time to adapt their family planning and reproductive choices to a world where there are so many contradicting narratives about labour shortages and overconsumption.

Speaking from the only developed country with over replacement rate BR, and 4 kids of my own. 

It's much easier to have a raise kids when the society supports that, which means that most of your co workers, boss and his boss have kids and understand when one of them gets sick, or the day you have to take off during summer vacation. It also means you're not behind everyone else at work during the summer vacation.

It means getting help from the grandparents, and siblings. 

It means having a large support network of friends and family members all raising kids together to comisserate, share advice, toys/cloths/baby stuff, babysit your kids or just give a hand with chores.

Couple that with significant subsidies for those with low income for child raising costs like kindergarten, a very well developed second hand market (with many items for free) and child raising is not as costly for those with low income. Virtually free healthcare for kids is also a must as they get sick a lot and really you don't want to be taking any chances.

For instance, we bought almost nothing for our first baby, only safety equipment like car seat and stuff you really want new like pacifiers were bought, everything else was hand me downs in excellent or brand new condition. We've passed a lot of those on.

I’m actually happy reading most of this thread, because the actual answer of “people simply don’t want children” is being accepted, rather than Reddit’s favor boogeyman of “it’s because it’s expensive!”  
   
The poorest demographics and poorest countries, opposite of your point, have far more children and significantly higher fertility rates than rich, developed nations.

Income is not the reason. The strongest correlation is the deeply negative one between women’s’ educational attainment and fertility rates. Surprise — when women have the opportunity to build a career, earn money, travel the world, etc. instead of sitting in a house all day being a homemaker, most choose to do so. 

We are in an era where child rearing requires a near complete and total sacrifice of your time. Unlike previous generations, where your children were a labor source and you (definitely by modern standards) abused/neglected them significantly. 

Per the Economist, parents spend TWICE as much time with their kids as they did 50 years ago, and it’s increasing. In 1965, mothers spent 54 minutes per day on child care and fathers just 16 minutes. As of 2012 (and it’s increased since!) it is now 104 minutes for women and 59 minutes for men. So despite women now having more options on what to do with their time and careers/work occupying it, it STILL takes even more time somehow than it did 50 years ago, when far fewer women worked and far more women focused on child rearing.

Anecdotally, my friend circle is 27-42 ish living in a very expensive city but we all make great money. We have couples of surgeons and lawyers, data scientists and engineers, etc. and yet nobody wants kids. Why? We all have several vacations across the world planned for this year. Why would we give that up for years of doctors appointments, sleep deprivation, temper tantrums, perpetual colds from your kids bringing home sickness, etc. 

That sounds like so much work and absolutely exhausting. We’d rather keep the happy hours, vacations, going dancing w friends, etc. it’s way more fun. Will that change? Maybe, but for now despite having the incomes (I’d guess the typical couple/household income in our ~30 person circle is about $350k), kids just seem like a massive headache.

Sweden offers 16 months of paid maternity leave. Their fertility rate still fell from 1.9 in 2011 to 1.66 today.

Norway offers 1 year of paid maternity leave. Their fertility rate is one of the lowest in the world at 1.48.

People have options to live their lives the way they want with far less judgement.

Previous generations would pop put a bunch of kids and throw them out into the street until dinner time. Raising kids is far more intense/work than ever before as we're more educated on children's development and needs. Can't just hit/abuse children into submissions like ""the good old days"" and rightfully so.

Also social media has made it so women get a more honest and real look at child care and birth, the realities of labour division in the house hold etc. Women can't be lied to like that where before ""it's the best thing I've ever done"" anymore.

Simple. Contrary to what people say, it isn't that everyone wants kids but just can't afford it.

Increasingly, people simply do not **want** to have kids. The desire is not there.  The sexual urge is still there, but not the reproductive one. Or at least, not strongly enough to overcome the desire to do other things. 

Due to prosperity, people also do not **need** to have kids to survive or thrive.

Due to changing social mores, people also do not **need** to have kids to gain a modicum of respect.  And as fewer people have kids, childlessness goes from being rare enough to land you social stigma, to being common enough, and it's on its way to being so common that having a child is gaining a social stigma, at young ages.  (Look at how we consider teen pregnancy as a problem, for instance.) 

When people neither want nor need to do something.... they don't do it.

“In a 1962 edition of Scientific American, the ecologist John B Calhoun presented the results of a macabre series of experiments conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).1 He had placed several rats in a laboratory in a converted barn where – protected from disease and predation and supplied with food, water and bedding – they bred rapidly. The one thing they were lacking was space, a fact that became increasingly problematic as what he liked to describe as his “rat city” and “rodent utopia” teemed with animals. Unwanted social contact occurred with increasing frequency, leading to increased stress and aggression. Following the work of the physiologist, Hans Selye, it seemed that the adrenal system offered the standard binary solution: fight or flight.2 But in the sealed enclosure, flight was impossible. Violence quickly spiralled out of control. Cannibalism and infanticide followed. Males became hypersexual, pansexual and, an increasing proportion, homosexual. Calhoun called this vortex “a behavioural sink”. Their numbers fell into terminal decline and the population tailed off to extinction. At the experiments’ end, the only animals still alive had survived at an immense psychological cost: asexual and utterly withdrawn, they clustered in a vacant huddled mass. Even when reintroduced to normal rodent communities, these “socially autistic” animals remained isolated until death. In the words of one of Calhoun’s collaborators, rodent “utopia” had descended into “hell”.”",Codename-Nikolai,t2_7c6azw56,1,0,reddit3

In the US, where the fertility rate is also below replacement, polling is pretty clear that most Americans would like to have more children than they currently do, about in line with where their parents were at--and yet they don't.

I'd like to better understand the secondary economic effects of increasing educational attainment among women--e.g. price increases as a result of more disposable income, daycare becoming a necessary (and significant) expenditure, the decreasing feasibility of single-income households.",ComprehensivePen3227,t2_jfvvmqnmo,19,0,reddit3

I sort of wonder if this type of explanation is quite significant. I think the expectations on parents for how they raise their children are much higher than when I was a child or my parents were. Every parent I know is angsting over the tiniest details of child rearing from birth, trying to make everything 100% safe, optimise everything for development and spending so much time with their kids. I don't think parents used to do that. I would really struggle to do that with a second child on top of working and keeping a home clean, even if I could afford it.

Their population is expected to halve in the next couple of decades so how will those homes ever be occupied in an etho nationalist society? Housing at this point should be free & investors should take their Ls for treating it as a speculative asset rather than a human right. Housing is unaffordable not because we don’t know how to build housing, but because of the sheer amount of wealth inequality & greed. Japan & Singapore does have cheaper housing, but Asia doesn’t really build housing for families. It’s all about density & small living units with often times not even a kitchen. The United States had a replacement fertility rate right before the mortgage crisis & rather than to do loan forgiveness we bought up mortgage backed securities that had the unintended consequence of making housing more unaffordable. People could’ve kept being employed & continued to build more homes but we had to protect investors & the all mighty dollar. The idea is to keep people like a hamster on a wheel. Housing, food, & education hasn’t been a problem of supply or access since the agricultural revolution, birth control & the internet, but we can’t just have people not working.

We surely can afford to build Mr. bezos mega yachts & demolish historical bridges to let it sail the sea, but putting that capital into building cities is a nuisance to the environment. Remember that the rich use to build cities, but many of the billionaires today grew up reading books about population growth killing our planet & peak oil/resource depletion during the 60s & 70s.

Because the monetary benefits outweighs the costs in those countries, as those kids are free labor for the parents, plus a lot of them become their parents' pension plan as their culture encourages the children to send their money back to their parent, especially when they work abroad. This is not the case in places like the Netherlands.

Worth considering: the cities that were the engines of economic growth for hundreds of years are now beginning to collapse under their own weight - the urban/suburban/rural population balance is shifting *out* of most cities as people vote with their feet for better futures elsewhere. Technology has made living in rural areas increasingly difficult and communalism is doing the same for the urban areas. The largest cause of the urban collapse is that cities no longer generate sufficient benefits to justify their costs and the abrogation of child labor is one of those costs. Oops.

kgeopv8,t1_kged2nx,2024-01-05 08:33:07,Economics,">The proximal causes of falling birth rates, and their attribution to women's educational attainment, is something I wonder a lot about. When I see this topic brought up, the language used is often couched in terms such as, ""Why have kids when you could have a fulfilling career or travel?"" but I'm not convinced that's the calculus being made at an individual level by most folks.

It is the calculus people are making. It's a very well researched question in educational economics. As education increases and in turn potential income and opportunities increase, opportunity costs for having children rise. With the same preferences, a woman will tend to have fewer children as her education rises. It's why child benefits do not significantly increase the birth rate, while subsidised child care is the only really effective way to increase fertility somewhat. The latter decreases the opportunity costs for women to hold a job, which is much more effective than any cash transfer to offset child costs.

>In the US, where the fertility rate is also below replacement, polling is pretty clear that most Americans would like to have more children than they currently do, about in line with where their parents were at--and yet they don't.

The desired number of children cannot be taken at face value. It is a stated preference that simply shows you the upper limit of fertility in modern society. It's the number of children a person wants to have if there are no opportunity costs. 

But there are always costs, which is where revealed preferences come in. Stated preferences have one fundamental flaw, people are inaccurate with providing them, either because they are mistaken, to give a socially acceptable answer or because they have a benefit from stating inaccurately. In the case of children, it's easy to state you want some, but to actually have them and to raise them is another matter, which we can see in the statistics and said gap.

The reduction in children is a dual issue of opportunity costs for children rising and preferences shifting away from them. Social expectations/values for raising children from religion, family and society are generally declining. Parents desire a way higher standard of living for their children as well, like one room for each child. Lastly, there are knock-on effects from the fact that people are raised in small families, which in turn makes people raise their children in small families.",RedKrypton,t2_dxeor,14,0,reddit3

The main effect of the claim ""wanting to have less kids"" is the mean age of women's first child has been constantly increasing and many countries are about 30 right now.  The older that mean age is the lower the birth rate.  Education and careers are the one constant force across all cultures right now.

kgg1uwo,t1_kgfo1vy,2024-01-05 15:49:18,Economics,"Indeed, children have transitioned from being an economic asset in agrarian societies to a financial liability in modern urbanized settings.  
  
Historically, children contributed to family income through labor; now, they represent a substantial financial investment, often amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, with little direct economic return until adulthood — and often none of this is a net gain for parents. The return on investment (ROI) for parents is increasingly a net negative.  

With each generation experiencing diminished retirement savings, reduced government benefits, and a significant decline in employee compensation and benefits — exemplified by the shift from pensions to 401(k)s with decreasing employer contributions — the financial burdens extend into elder care. This has transformed into a moral dilemma for the children, whose responsibility it often becomes.  

Thus, the ROI for parents, especially as they live past their physical ability to work, trickles down through generations, compounding the economic challenges faced by each successive generation — parent assets being bled dry via end of life care, and longer lifespans, assets that would once be handed down have been replaced with potential financial burden on the children (caring for their parents, etc.).  
  
Furthermore, life was far more viable as a single income family before the necessity of dual incomes emerged. This shift reflects broader economic changes, particularly in housing affordability and wage stagnation. Post-WWII, the 'baby boomers' in America experienced an unprecedented rise in affordable housing, partly due to government initiatives like the GI Bill. This era saw a surge in homeownership and family growth, facilitated by a robust economy that supported single-income households.  

In contrast, contemporary families face a different economic climate. For example, in the Netherlands, the 'Vinex-wijken' housing developments of the 1990s aimed to provide affordable housing but eventually led to suburban sprawl and increased living costs. This mirrors a global trend where housing affordability has not kept pace with wage growth, making it challenging for single-income families to thrive.  

Therefore, it's not surprising to see declining birth rates as individuals and couples make rational choices based on economic realities. While some argue for government compensation to parents, this solution overlooks the systemic issues at play. Addressing these underlying economic challenges is crucial for creating a society where having children is a viable option, not a luxury.  
  
TL;DR:   
Historically, children transitioned from financial assets in agrarian societies, contributing to family work as early as 5-7 years old, to economic burdens in modern settings, needing financial support into adulthood. This shift, along with the necessity for dual incomes and increasing living and housing costs, has rendered child-rearing a more economically challenging choice. The declining birth rates are a clear response to these economic pressures, a sentiment echoed by many in this thread.",feloniousmonkx2,t2_ar6k9,32,0,reddit3

Often nearly as expensive as one parent's salary. The obvious solution is to just not have children, and it's not even that they want kids and made a tough decision not to. They literally don't have one second to breathe and consider having children as a possibility.

Couple that with the fact that marriage rate has gone down by 60%  and people are getting married older since the 1970s. It's really not particularly surprising at all.

Sadly, that hasn't happened.

And, people can be sexually active without fearing unwanted pregnancies (contraception).

Of course, this will naturally still lead to the positive effect of a severe reduction in unwanted kids and cheap labor exploitation, but because this is a random byproduct of the modern age, we will also face many serious issues (economic decline and potentially collapse, loss of innovation, lack of health care for elderly, etc).",Clarkthelark,t2_3pgwheol,2,0,reddit3

What's worse is the modern globalization and erasure of culture.

No.

I mean that people move from the country to the city creating a sort of artificial birth rate. But when you run out people in the countryside, your population drops.

Tokyo has a birth rate of 1, that means in about 50 years the population should drop in half because there wasn't enough people born to replace people dying.

Buuuut, if people are moving into the city, they can replace that population loss.

Let's do some very basic math. The surface area of earth is 1.3e11 acres.  Mostly water, but let's say we somehow find methods of farming water. Today it takes about half an acre to sustain a person (down from 5 acres in the Tutor period!)

Your claim of a billion times 7 billion would be 7e18. So, you believe not only can we farm literally every square inch of the earth, but also get from 0.5 acres per person to 1.8e-8 acres? For reference, that's smaller than a postage stamp

These calculations do not include space for people being able to stand

Edit: i guess you blocked me, but here is the math you asked for

Alright, let's throw out the needs for light, soil, and power. Most crops are at least three feet tall. The average earth radius is 3950mi. I am going to assume we are building up, but the numbers don't actually change much if you dig down because, you know, it's a sphere. Let's say we build a full mile up, this is very generous because trees stop growing at 4500 ft in the Rockies, not enough oxygen. So between 3950mi and 3951mi. You get about 1e18 cubic yards.

Okay so I agree that kids are too switched onto media. 

Infact I feel parents who use ipads etc as entertainment full time as this generations ""go outside and leave me alone"" lazy parenting.

The parents who'd shove their kids into the street with no regards to safety because it's easier are the same as people who expect the screen to entertain their kids.

Thing is, there's a question of ""lesser of two evils"".

 There's huge risk to both, unattended children are prey to predators, bullying and general injury.

Kids on screens are at risk of being exposed to inappropriate stuff (young kids seem to be super into horror games) and having constant dopamine and not allowed to be bored.

If you where to say ""which would you prefer?"" I'd prefer the screen addicted kid because I could control and supervise that over a child just out in the wild, because I'd rather battle a internet addiction than my kid hiding the fact some older kids tried to bully them into kissing them etc.

Letting kids out unsupervised is neglect. If I left a 8 year old in my home day after day, I'd have CPS called because its neglect even though their in their home/safe environment compared to outside. So you can't accept that letting kids out unsupervised was ever a good idea. 

We learn from the previous generations, and now schools/parents teach ""under wear rules"" and don't let kids go around unsupervised. Why? Because fucked up shit happened to many of us and it could of been avoided if we where not left alone in the wild. Just because it thankfully never happened to you does not mean it did not happen.

Parenting today is not perfect, it never will be. But willfully letting your child just go out on their own knowing the freaks and fucked up people around, it's insanity.

The current generation of kids is one of the dumbest generations we’ve had so far and I think this is the reason. https://nypost.com/2023/03/09/study-suggests-iq-scores-in-the-us-have-fallen/amp/

kpjd5qw,t3_1am3lfc,2024-02-08 20:38:50,Economics,"A lot of confusion in the comments.  This is unlikely to be heavily divorce/custody related as it only refers to women and men living alone (not with children).  Although some divorces are childfree I suspect that is a smaller percentage of the difference here, if any.

Regarding older men and women - this is likely to be a significant factor.  [This study](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/aging%20and%20Disability%20In%20America/2020Profileolderamericans.final_.pdf) on older Americans (which is a real study unlike the linked article) suggests that ""About 27% (14.7 million) of all older adults living in the community in 2020 lived alone (5 million men, 9.7 million women)."" This is a gap of 4.7 million women.  That said, not all of them will own their own homes.  Later in the article we have ""Of the 14.1 million households headed by persons age 75 and older in 2019, 77% (10.8 million) owned their homes and 23% (3.3 million) rented.""  While we don't know if this would apply to those under 75, or whether the split of renters is the same among men and women, if we assume those percentages hold, that means 3.85 million older men live alone and own their homes, and 7.47 million women do, for a gap of about 3.62 million women.

Obviously there are a lot of assumptions but that gap is not that far off from the 2.71 million women in the article.  So it's reasonable to suspect that a majority of the gap (or even an excess amount of it) is due to older women living alone.  Older meaning over 65.",corinini,t2_bbwf3,79,0,reddit4

Let me start off by saying this is all hypothetical and beer talk, so take with grain of salt. But traditionally men bought homes to start a family with a wife and kids. We know with statistical facts that men are single more than ever and less likely to marry compared to previous years (decline in marriage rates) 

With that said, if men are marrying less, they don’t have a *strong* reason to buy a home. Personally I rather just rent a studio by myself and have the freedom to relocate and move around when I feel like it. Only when I’m settled down would I consider buying a permanent home. Until then, since I’m still single and childless, why buy a house? I’ll be stuck in that location unable to up and leave as I please. 

Also men are more likely to relocate for work, so by renting an apartment I can just move states whenever. Until I get married I have no reason to buy a house. 

Im not saying this is the reason men aren’t buying homes, I think for some men, myself included, it is a reason. 

The title even says women who “live” alone are more likely to buy homes. Yeah if I’m living alone, I don’t need a house, just give me a living room with a bathroom and kitchen, I’m good. I just need a mattress, and a computer desk. Men live very minimal, you seen the memes and pics of single men living space.

Basically the entire reason there is a gender pay gap is because of the earnings of married men. Does this mean that marriage makes men more able to earn more, or does this mean that men who earn more are more desirable for women to marry?

My feeling is that single childless men tend to live and crave extremely simple lifestyles and tend to be unambitious/value free time.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/28/young-women-are-out-earning-young-men-in-several-u-s-cities

It's when women don't have children and are single that they out earn men. 

https://womensagenda.com.au/latest/single-child-free-women-out-earn-single-child-free-men/

Also probably the reason why single women own more homes than single men is because when a divorce happens the women usually retain more than 50% custody of the kids and often retain the house due to that. At least this is what I am guessing. 

It's know that married men are the ones that make more than any other group and the primary category of men who create the ""gender pay gap"" also if men and women get divorced the man is more likely to get remarried. Probably because he is not the primary caregiver for children post divorce he is also able to financially recover faster despite often losing the house in the divorce. 

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/divorce-women-research

https://time.com/3584827/pew-marriage-divorce-remarriage/

Children are basically walking financial suppression for women, and probably a huge reason for the ""pay gap."" Is likely that this is also a reason for a lower birth rate as of the last few decades. Women have come to see that children reduce their earning capacity. It's true as childless single women out earn even childless single men. 

The lowest earning category is single women with children. 

So even when women get homes after divorce, even with that assets the do not recover as well financially from a divorce because of having the children. 

So for a woman having children reduces her ability to earn money. For a man if he has children he is likely to lose custody of them and lose his house if he and his spouse gets divorced. People wonder why people are having less kids or no kids?",thebigmanhastherock,t2_gste2ri,2,0,reddit4

I’ve known quite a few women who would get pregnant and essentially use their kids as pawns to extract money from the men. They would take the money and spend it on weed, cigarettes, alcohol, expensive nice clothes, purses, jewelry, shoes, and only AFTER frivolously spending it on themselves FIRST would they then take the remainder and spend it on their child. Then they would have the audacity to try to get even more money from the man.

Also, when I mention the clothing and stuff, these women already had clothing and purses and shoes that were perfectly fine. They made unnecessary purchases and used the money for their WANTS not NEEDS.

There’s also been many instances where a woman would cheat on her spouse, have someone else’s kid, and let the man think it’s his own. And when he would divorce her, he still was required to pay alimony and child support.

There’s times where a woman will get pregnant on purpose, trap the man, and when he wants to get an abortion, she’ll refuse, leave the man after having the kid, and extract money from him for the rest of his life. And when the court decides on how much he should be paying, they hold him to it whether he loses a job or not, or has a reduction in pay.

Most of this country unfairly favors women over men and sets completely fucked up precedents by putting men in jail if they can’t afford to pay.

That doesn't make sense.  Let's presume the couple split, and the female gets the house and custody.  You've just upped the number of single men without a house by one, but unchanged the number of single women with house.  Therefore the percent of single men with houses goes down, while percent women with houses remains same, creating a differential of single women more likely to own the house.

Here's a hard example.  Start in a society, there is one family, one single man with house, one single woman with house.

The family divorce, the woman takes the kid and the house.

Now you have a society with one female with a house, one single man without house, and one single man with house (plus the female-child pair not included in the stats).

I suspect it's more of a preference.  Divorced men may not be eager to take on an additional financial burden of owning a home where renting gives you a lot more flexibility at a time when your life is in a state of upheaval.  They may wait until they're remarried before considering home ownership again.

And it's entirely possible that a significant fraction of the single women who own homes acquired sole ownership through a divorce settlement.  Or through death... how man of the ""single women"" are older widows?

It's unfortunate the ""study"" didn't provide any details about these demographics.

EDIT: the [linked Lending Tree article](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/single-women-own-more-homes-than-single-men-do/) has this to say:

> But homeownership isn’t just a young person’s game, and factors outside of individual earnings also contribute to homeownership. Considering that women typically live longer and are more likely to report being widowed than men, it’s likely that some women who are now single homeowners bought that home with the spouse they outlived.

kpm6ukw,t1_kpkvv53,2024-02-09 10:02:03,Economics,"Basically women earn more than men then it swaps to men later on.  
  
This is adjusting for same jobs/degrees too.  
   
The reason is women tend to have better resumes early on during schooling. Better grades, more academic based clubs, and so on.  
  
But then men tend to be better at advancing in their career and pay. Mostly because women often get anchored down with pregnancy. But also because data shows women are more complacent than men in their jobs. This means men are more likely to seek out oppertunities to get paid more or demand raises.  
  
In my personal experience the good female workers tend to excel at their position and think that will lead to promotion while men tend to realize they need to excel at things that show they can do the next position to get promoted. So when I'm hiring for a manager position and I have 2 employees to pick from 1 woman who is the best low level employee and 1 man who is 2nd best but has consistently shown an ability to manage who would I pick to be the new manager?  
  
It's not women's fault I think they've basically been misled as some men have into thinking company loyalty and working hard get rewarded. I have been consistently hired or promoted above female co-workers I would agree are harder workers but the advantage I have is I am a smart worker. I get the same or near same results while also getting skills and development that lead to more.   
  
Also women still are less likely to be the bread winner in a college educated household. So they have less opportunity to negotiate raises or seek competitive offers that involve moving. Families tend to move based on the job of the bread winner.

Men top engineering and most of STEM. Women top nursing, pharmacy, and education. But women also top lots of liberal arts and degrees like hotel management.  
 
 So when adjusted for the same degree and career women make more than men earlier but less later. Mostly because women have better resumes early on then have worse ones later as pregnancy puts gaps in experience and women are less likely to be the bread winners if both husband and wife have a degree so women tend to be the parent sacrificing their career.

Engineering Canada had a program to boost women enrollment in 2010 long after I left and the goal was to get it to 30%, they only recently reached that as I looked it up.  You are right the stats are there.  Its not 40-60 in engineering.  But remember I was talking about when I was in engineering - the 90s - years before all the efforts showed any results.

You also want to lump everything into STEM but that really skews things.   Its clear that women are interested in Biology  instead which is just a subpart of S in STEM - they most often outnumber men in biology departments.   Chemistry is up there too.  **Women are outpacing men in medical related fields but its just not true of engineering**: the E.  Talking about STEM isn't really talking about engineering - STEM is wide and varied.   Though I started in engineering and ended up with in Math  and later Comp Sci - I graduated with one women in Math, but there was a maybe 20% women when I was in Comp Sci.

What I can't find is historical info at this point, I got my first degree in '96 so my first year was in Engineering in '92 - **it was possibly higher than what Im guessing was 95% male because my first classes of a couple hundred had less than 10 women in '92**.   And at that time they lowered the requirements for women to get in to the Engineering program and many men were pissed - clearly the men that didn't make the cut were outraged but honestly we all were - we all worked hard to get into a program that was hard for us to get into and no one cut us breaks.

We had a humans rights lawyer come in and give a speech to the first year students in '92.  She was clearly there to make a point but unsurprisingly it failed miserably.  She started by asking all assembled if they every felt discriminated against and most raised their hands - that was not what she was expecting, she was expecting the women to raise their hands but only a couple of them did.  She questioned some of the guys that raised their hands but after getting similar responses she dismissed their complaints and said women are discriminated against.  She would not accept that the special accommodation of lowering requirements at that time to allow for women in to enter the program was discrimination and was one of those that said white men can't be victims of discrimination.   She was booed and cut her speech short.  There was fallout.  But none of the students apologized as suggested and none backed down as they shouldn't.  That's how things were with this topic in the 90s.

Its seems so crazy now because it would cause a riot now on campuses but a popular slogan on t-shirts in the 90s was: *I'm white, I'm male, I'm heterosexual, I'm sorry*.   And yes it was sarcasm.",Gullible_ManChild,t2_b76720ab,1,0,reddit4

From your own Forbes source:

“Both lawyers report that very few men walk into their offices with the intent of asking for alimony, even when their situations are clearly eligible for spousal support. Meanwhile, female breadwinners never pay alimony without a contentious battle. “Every guy in that situation has to go through a fight, while (breadwinning) guys go into the divorce accepting they have to pay,” says Rosen. Then, facing humiliation, stress and expense of that fight, they are further disincentivized from pursuing spousal support. “Men are essentially shamed into not receiving alimony,” Ressa says.”

ie7my40,t3_vnhnng,2022-06-29 17:40:26,Economics,"Right now, it seems like companies that grew absurdly during the pandemic are the ones contracting back.

Seems more like 99 than 08. Many stupid, over-valued stocks that got steroid injected by virtual gambling coins (literally, in crypto's case). Not sure how the hell Netflix got to a $300B valuation (larger than Disney at some point), but it happened. All the SPACs and start-ups that flew up. The WSB mania. None of these were sustainable in any way. I'm sure it'll have an effect on the real estate and overall job markets, but a lot of rich people got more rich, and a lot of big gamblers got poor. But at its core, real estate and jobs aren't going to crash just based on the trend line of ""what goes up must come down"" - banking and real estate really crashed in 2008 for a very particular reason.

Unless the same thing is happening in the shadows (which it might be, I don't know), then it won't happen the same way. My hunch from the beginning of the pandemic to now was that big corporations saw that a lot of business models are gonna fly through some epic turbulence due to a global pandemic, and they decided to put a ton of eggs in real estate, knowing that in the short and long run, people need places to live, and collecting rent (or flipping homes) is a hell of a business. Of course it ended up running way higher than anyone imagined and probably recedes, but in many ways it also just finally caught up (well, outpaced) median rent. But for a long time, owning was a cheaper monthly cost than renting, which actually made no sense at all.

(Commercial real estate is a different story...)

Pets Dot com and Peloton are more similar stories than the housing bubble comparisons (not as companies, but the rise and fall). Peloton's market cap was $38B at one point. Today it is around $3.6B. That is a 90% loss in 1 year. It was a good idea to catch the subscription boom, with a quick money injection, but doesn't mean much if the core business plan is not executed well or profitable in the long-run. So for all the doom's day recession fears, it'd be nice to be reminded how preposterous Wall St. was from Q3 2020 to Q4 2021. Yeah - I would imagine there are (and will be) a lot of layoffs from companies that were operating at a loss or not creating any tangible, essential products, yet running 12-figure valuations.

That’s putting it really really kindly. Entire companies shut down all the time even during the best of times. 

> they are lagging indicators... IMHO.

Yes they are lagging, but the positive predictive value (PPV) of Peloton laying off workers as an indicator for larger waves of layoffs is probably not super high, and PPV is really what’s relevant here.",osprey94,t2_skh77,7,0,reddit1

I don't have enough experience in the field of census, but I'd be interested to know the margin of error on these studies.

So a person like me really screws up the statistics. Your average person struggles to save 10-15% of their income, but I save 50%+ because I have two full time paychecks.

I've been doing this for ten years now, but it seems to have become super common since everything went WFH due to the pandemic.

hhvgess,t1_hhv3d3t,2021-10-24 15:53:47,Economics,"That's not what Say's law says. Say's law says that if someone creates a product, the only reason he did it is because he wants to sell the product and buy something else with the money he gets. The creation of supply implies there is demand for *something else*, and that demand must be exactly equal to the value of the thing being supplied. 

If we want to apply Say's law to this situation, we have to be careful about what we say the ""good"" being supplied is. In this case, the ""good"" being supplied is the labor. It is not the job on offer. The supply is the number of people willing to provide the labor, not the number of employers wanting to hire workers. And that supply, if it existed, would imply demand (for something)- the workers would take the jobs only because they want the money, and they would want the money only to spend it on something else.

I'm not saying Say's law is right here. I'm saying you are misapplying the reasoning. During the Great Depression, there was a tremendous supply of workers, and no jobs to be found. What those workers wanted the jobs for was not to simply work; they wanted the jobs so they could buy food and other necessities. The conclusion you would draw from Say's law is that the supply of workers implies there is money to be made producing necessities, and therefore employers would hire people to do that. That wasn't happening. There must be more to markets than Say's law. Which doesn't mean it is ""wrong"", but more ""not quite right"".

As a result, a lot of the top positions were left empty which allowed a lot of people to move up and a lot of people the opportunity to find new jobs. The people who left the workforce aren't coming back. The people who got promoted aren't coming back. The restaurant and retail industry won't have a strong workforce until they start offering jobs with competitive pay and benefits.

Second, shipping is severely understaffed. There's so much demand that they need as many hands on deck as possible. They're suckijg a massive amount of the labor supply and that is simply not going to change. So why would you grind yourself into the dirt working in a restaurant when the pay and the benefits are better in a warehouse?

hhvq94b,t1_hhv0iz3,2021-10-24 17:00:36,Economics,"You’re missing a very important (4): people have decided to live with less. The group is difficult to track (because of the myriad of ways in which people can choose to spend less), but larger than most would suspect. The idea goes like this:

1.	Pre-pandemic, consumerism shaped our society to believe that income needed to be maximized in order to maximize spending. Spending was allegedly equivalent to happiness.
2.	During shutdowns, tens of millions of Americans were forced to abandon the chase for income and sit at home. Fixed income drives consumer behavior towards maximizing happiness through efficient spending rather than raw earning, and these people also had an opportunity to experience the mental health benefits of free time.
3.	Post-shutdown, individuals and households are trying to account for both approaches to happiness. They are willing to sacrifice raw income when it can lead to a tangible quality of life improvement.

Everyone treats to the American worker like they are a solo individual, workers who will work or will eventually starve - that’s not true at all. Individuals have partners, couples that trade dual incomes for one career supported by one homemaker. People moved in with their parents, or their kids, creating households with fewer incomes than adults. People are turning to side gigs that bring them joy over chasing low wage work for a second or third income.

Pundits have railed on the unemployment benefits as somehow spoiling the labor force into laziness, but in reality these people are not going to chase burger-flipping once they can get $18-$20/hour for it. It no longer depends on paycheck size, not unless the paycheck is so much bigger that workers can use it to effectively reshape their pursuit of happiness.",Bobby_Marks2,t2_egwvt,27,0,reddit2

Then I saw it.

There was a small space in front of me. It was tiny, just enough room for a couple of people to sit side by side. Inside, there were two people. The first one was a female, she had long brown hair and was wearing a white nightgown. She was smiling.

The other one was a male, he was wearing a red jumpsuit and had a mask over his mouth.

""Are you spez?"" I asked, my eyes still adjusting to the light.

""No. We are in /u/spez."" the woman said. She put her hands out for me to see. Her skin was green. Her hand was all green, there were no fingers, just a palm. It looked like a hand from the top of a puppet.

""What's going on?"" I asked. The man in the mask moved closer to me. He touched my arm and I recoiled.

""We're fine."" he said.

I looked to the woman. ""What happened?""

""He left the house a week ago. He'd been gone since, now I have to live alone. I've lived here my whole life and I'm the only spez.""

""You don't have a family? Aren't there others?"" I asked. She looked to me. ""I mean, didn't you have anyone else?""

This is a stretch of the truth. There has been a moratorium on evictions. This is not making rent ""optional"".

They pay into unemployment insurance so that they can find a job commensurate with their education and experience, and one that offers safe working conditions. That is for the benefit of society, because it is a waste of an educated worker to force him to accept a job slinging burgers or starve. 

Not to mention that it is a bit simplistic to say that there are millions of job openings and lots of unemployed workers. Are those jobs in the same places as the workers? Will we pay to relocate workers and/or provide them with transportation.

Are the unemployed workers qualified to fill those openings? I happen to know that UNC is looking for a cognitive neurologists.

Sure, but what is the labor participation rate? 

Quick search shows (As a baseline example, fairly similar population levels):

Alabama labor force participation: 57%
Alabama Unemployment rate: 3.1%



Washington labor force participation: 64% 
Washington unemployment rate 5.2%


Sure, you can isolate the unemployment rate and Alabama looks like the more functional labor force, but that's pretty disingenuous, huh?

And that doesn't account for poverty rates, aka which state is actually a more healthy economy.

hhzz96x,t1_hhzksvv,2021-10-25 16:02:31,Economics,"That’s interesting. I thought his technology and military predictions were probably the least meaningful out of all the analysis in the book. Small differences in technology could vastly change the outcomes of some of the conflicts he’s talking about, but the business cycles and demographic shifts are predictable and will occur no matter the technology landscape. 

When you look at his analysis of 50 year sociopolitical cycles, it’s fairly compelling. And the predictions he made based specifically on the epicycles of American economic development are very much aligned with exactly what’s happening today. 

I went back and read it recently, and there is a particular point he makes which leaps off the page. He says that by 2020, the wealth of the global financial elite will have run out of mechanisms for sustaining growth, and that a sudden shock (and he specifically mentions a natural disaster or global pandemic) will stop the large scale churning of the financial engine that drives the global economy, causing the extremely top heavy financialized economy to suddenly crack, and reorganize itself with a strong urgency toward improving the living standards of the working class, which will find itself quickly and for a sustained period in a position of greater power. 

When you get into the weeds of how this occurs, it seems quite inevitable, and really agrees with all that is occurring today. The global supply chain has been violently disrupted, and the sudden shortfalls of products and labor have enhanced the sense that the working and middle class have been losing too much for too long. Suddenly people are demanding not only to get back what has been taken, but overall to get more of the total wealth that has been created. There is now an understanding that the expanding wealth of the mega rich depends on the availability of workers to supply the economy with productive labor, and labor is now much more clearly in control and able to demand that the economy will work more to their benefit as it begins to grow back to its former productivity level. 

It’s like a ship with hundreds of people rowing, that runs across rocks and gets stuck. In the moment that the workers realize that they are needed to get the ship unstuck and moving again, they also understand that when it does get moving, they have the power and the right to demand that it move in the direction and under conditions that benefit them, and not the people who have been leading them until now.",orincoro,t2_11djf8,6,0,reddit2
hi01swj,t1_hhznhvx,2021-10-25 16:19:45,Economics,"Again: you need to read the book to understand the basis of any of its predictions. I promise you, if you just read the first chapter, you’ll understand what the basic conceit is.

The way you are picking at individual predictions based on the way things look today is precisely the criticism that the beginning of the book addresses very cogently. It argues that large scale geopolitical processes occur somewhat independently of changes in culture or technology. There are inevitable epicycles that repeat themselves when similar conditions are met. The Poland/Russia epicycle you mention is one that he analyzes all the way back to the Napoleonic wars, explaining how Poland’s position in the Northern European plain makes it a focal point of the balance of power between Europe and Russia. It’s not about Poland the country. It’s not about the culture or any individual. It’s about Poland the historical concept. 

The same for Russia: an individual can influence politics within a cycle, but no leader can change the basic circumstances of Russia on the global geopolitical landscape. When Putin inevitably dies or retires, the circumstances shaping the future of politics in Russia won’t change. Any changes his power has managed to prevent from being felt in day to day life will simply happen faster and more drastically as political power realigns. 

Historical shifts in power tend to happen a lot faster than people predict because bases of power are built around keeping things the same for those in power. Once their power breaks, change can be incredibly swift. The prussian militarist tradition of Germany that was centuries old was broken utterly in a 20 year period after WW2, for example. No one believed that was possible until it occurred. Similarly, the ascendancy of Poland is not about the polish political system, but simply the facts of Poland’s current geopolitical situation. As Russia experiences decline, Poland will rapidly grow its influence and base of power in the region. New leaders and a new political culture will spring up seemingly from nothing. History shows ha that this can happen anywhere, and can be very hard to predict based on the lived experience of people of that time.

Like I said, read the book if you’re not convinced. No prediction is written in stone, but the underlying thinking is instructive.",orincoro,t2_11djf8,1,0,reddit2
hi17m13,t1_hhyrh9a,2021-10-25 21:01:33,Economics,"Well, when you phrase it like that it's a no-brainer. In general, economic growth in the European Union has been faster in the east than in the west; the economic weight of the EU (and Europe as a whole) has shifted eastward, and will probably continue to shift eastward. A rising economy and a geography which easily leads to one power consolidating very quickly, combined with Poland being the biggest in the event of Russia kicking the bucket, makes it a clear favourite for a new eastern European regional power.

The problem is that it relies on Poland being kicked out of NATO, and a general dissolution of NATO and the EU and Russia. They're not the basis of strong predictions. If this is rephrased to ""continued decline of Russia and increased economic weight of Poland will lead to it gaining ever-increasing soft and hard power in Europe"" I'd argue that that's already the case.",Wazzupdj,t2_npq6p,1,0,reddit2

I always know when I am talking to a conservative when they ascribe the rise of the American middle class as due to the rest of the world being destroyed, completely ignoring the rise of strong labor unions aided by laws that protected worker's rights, the massive spending by government on R&D, subsidized home ownership through mortgage programs, and massive government investment in education (thanks to the GI bill) all funded by much higher effective corporate tax rates and top marginal rates over 90%. 

Your facile explanation flies in the face of logic. Mexico wasn't destroyed by the war, yet they didn't experience a similar boom. The rest of the world was no longer destroyed in the 1960s, yet the outsize growth here endured.

You can't separate the two issues. The reason companies could afford to pay fat union wages is because they had no international competition and their margins were huge. It's no coincidence that the fall of labor unions coincided with the rise of, first, Japan, Germany and the rest of Europe, and then China and the rest of the former third world.

Those haven't gone away. In fact the subsidies for home buyers are bigger than ever. The vast majority of mortgages are financed directly by the government through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.

We still have the GI bill.

>Mexico wasn't destroyed by the war, yet they didn't experience a similar boom.

I referred to the developed world. Mexico didn't have any industrial base in the 1950s. It was a third world agrarian economy. Competition from Mexico is one of the things that eroded our manufacturing industry. Surely you've heard about the trend of corporations building manufacturing facilities in places like Mexico and the effect that's had on our economy.

Either it will be worth it or it won’t, so predicting the future does depend on guessing to an extent what will matter in the future, and this is where technology plays the big wildcard role.

It's a bit different in scope because in the 1940s you had to join the army. Pretending that the same program limited to a much smaller segment of the population has anything near the impact is ridiculous.

> When the Fed lowers interest rates, every borrower in the country benefits.

That is true but you're ignoring a whole lot of benefits of mortgages to the rich. First, lower interest rates make a bigger difference if you've got a mansion than if you have a shack. The standard deduction is $25,100 for a couple this year. Real median household income (pre-tax) is about $67K so you need to be pretty well off to be itemizing. But if we assume that you are itemizing, that deduction is worth more to somebody in the 39% bracket than to somebody in the 15% bracket and costs the government more revenue.

I support the SALT limitation, though it was done by the GOP to teach Blue states a lesson, not out of a desire to make the tax system more progressive. We can talk about the shame of partisan warfare on half of the population but that is too far afield.

> You go through life thinking that the manufacturing sector in the US hasn't shrunk due to moving facilities and processes to other countries? That's either disingenuous or ignorant.

The government could certainly have used money for Trump's promised infrastructure plan or to give us the healthcare plan that they promised as a replacement for the ACA that they promised for seven year, you remember the one that Trump said would cover more people and offer more benefits at lower cost. However, when they control everything we only get tax cuts and spending that is immediately necessary.

Couldn't you argue partially that it is the fault of consumers? They want low prices. Now you are asking them to either:

a) lose their shitty job they don't like (but it's all they have) if we speak about the group of people who are affected (low income earners)

b) no longer be able to go to some of their favorite local businesses (because you deemed them necessary of some kind of massive payroll shift, something they have been avoiding since it has been a societal norm to pay your employees $7-$15/hr for years).

c) pay a lot more than they are now for stuff through inflation (aka cost just gets passed along to consumers)

First, $32 billion isn't even that much.

Second, it slowed down the system responsible for climate change.

Third, it helped bring home *some* manufacturing, but more importantly it helped show us all how dangerous it is to put all our manufacturing eggs in the China basket.

Fourth, it was one of many factors leading to China showing us their teeth and claws which has helped people to learn just how dangerous China is to us militarily and what their global military ambitions really are.

Fifth, it has helped spur home chip fabrication, an extremely important and often overlooked national security issue.  We *must not* rely on China to produce the microchips that go into our tanks, ships, missiles, communications devices, electric grid, weapons, etc. --- lest we open ourselves up to trojan electronics embedded in our nation's critical infrastructure and military.  We must have access to a secure foundry within our borders, ideally at least one that can produce rad-hardened and analog chips (these chips require older processes, like 45nm/90nm.)

Sixth, it has helped put a temporary cap on China's GDP and given them a few domestic problems to concentrate on which in turn has forced them to take at least some attention away from their military ambitions in Taiwan (and possibly elsewhere.)

I work in an industry that orders a lot of stainless steel primarily from China, and this is what we have done. Could we buy American? Sure. Price increases 3x. German, 2x. The idea behind the tax is that is discourages companies to buy from them and lowers our trading activity with them and in turn hurts them economically. Even with the increased tariffs, China still the cheapest by far(for the goods I buy at least), but way more expensive than it was 4 years ago.

The best market is one established on a level playing field, with a multitude of competitors. More competitors eventually benefits the consumer. In this situation to obtain more competitors one \*has\* to level the playing field with tariffs and subsidies.

So, apply tariffs, then use the revenues to create strategic manufacturing subsidies to rebuild domestic competition.

Most agree the trade war was not a success for the US. Aside from helping us achieve some strategic goals with tech products, most of the actions we took didn’t achieve the intended outcome and it hurt US manufacturing.

But the other part of this is... What was rhe point of the tariffs? Did it help American businesses overall? Specific businesses?

Most analyses I have seen make it clear that it was an overall loser for the usa. Loss of gdp, loss of jobs, loss of wages.

For what? Did we protect a key industry we need for defense? For long-term stability?

Trump did this because he was obsessed with the trade deficit.  But the trade deficit on its own is meaningless.

Odds are, that money would instead have to go towards the aid of those that are negatively affected by China's counter-tariffs. 

It would also not take into account that businesses would simply move towards other countries that are unaffected by tariffs on China but offer the same perks such as cheap labour. Hence, there is global interest to migrate towards Vietnam as a secondary manufacturing centre.

Finally, I'd always thought of the US' comparative advantage to be in high end tech services whereas China's comparative advantage is in manufacturing that is labor intensive.

It seems to me that the focus in the service industry is on having precisely the right number of workers on staff, and this often causes the pace of the work to be unbearable, especially when someone calls out sick. If someone hates their job because it always sucks, giving them a couple bucks more per hour isn't going to make the job suck less.

hc32bdx,t3_pkdqtj,2021-09-08 17:49:41,Economics,"Trucker shortages are driving inflation like crazy right now and no one is talking about it. The reason pump prices are so high is not refinery margins, it's a lack of drivers to deliver fuel.

You want a well paying low skill job? There you go.

If I was underemployed right now I'd be looking into trucking without a doubt. A long haul trucker can get close to six figures or even exceed it depending on how much they want to work and so long as you don't have a DUI or some terrible driver abstract, you will get hired.

No young people want to get into it because they think truckers will be a thing of the past in a ""no time"" but that is just not true. There will be plenty of trucking jobs in the 2030s still, plenty of runway left.

Edit: Alright adding this because Im over responding to everyone saying something along the lines of ""Yeah but its actually a terrible lifestyle"" or whatever variation of that. Yes, it is a hard life, thats why its a viable way for someone with no education, skills or career path to literally turn their life around financially in a few weeks time with no investment besides time. If you want a cushy job thats easy and fills your wallet, well shit, build a time machine, go back to your teenage years and early 20s and fix whatever mistake or shitty hand you were dealt to put you into the position you are in now and youre set. If thats not an option and you dont want to wait until capitalism magically starts paying you great money for serving or cleaning after people this is a real way out. Even if you only do it for a few years to unfuck your life.",,,153,0,reddit4

It's a good reason why it's easier to find a job when you already have one.  Especially with government jobs, the process is very time consuming and it doesn't align with the faux cry for workers.

Before '08 there were actual recruiters and headhunters. So much of the vetting process is automated, so it's less work for those HR, but it's still the same amount of work for the job seeker.  Even in SF during their recent tech boom ('13-'17) the infrastructure for hiring simply wasn't there, and those tech firms were just throwing money at job fairs (which are not a terrible way to hire, but I would say quite inefficient), or using university contacts.  That leaves out the supposed experienced workforce they said they were looking for.

I know lots of attorneys. I know some who work public interest, private sector, and DOJ. The latter basically work 9-5 unless they have a big trial coming up. Private sector? Man forget about it. Public interest isn't awful but my buddies there still work some weekends and late nights.

hc6ldut,t1_hc4ogpz,2021-09-09 14:08:14,Economics,"Honestly the best way to get in is to befriend someone who is already in. They'll be able to tell you exactly how to structure your resume and cover letter, and the cover letter especially is radically different and much longer than what is normally used. At least, that's how it is at the national labs. 

If you want a job that requires a clearance your best bet is to find a job doing literally anything, usually manual labor, at the facility you'd like to work at. Then once you have that foot in the door, start applying for jobs at the same facility that require a clearance. Bonus points if you can find someone in the division/department you want to work in and get them to be one of your references. This ensures your resume makes it through the HR filter, and predisposes the hiring manager to have a good opinion of you. 

Realize that for a job that requires a clearance, they have to hire you in at the standard rate. Then they have to either give you a full time baby sitter to escort you around cleared areas while preventing you from accessing anything classified (which means you essentially can't do any of the work they're hiring you for), OR find someplace with no clearance requirements to stick you for the 5 months (if they pay the extra tens of thousands of dollars to get your clearance review expedited, on top of the $15-30k a clearance normally costs) to 2.5 years until you get your clearance. Only then can they start training you to do the shit they hired you for however long ago. So now they're out months to years of time, up to $250k in costs including salary and benefits, and you've actually functioned as a resource drain on the group you've hired into because they still have to manage you while you're accomplishing nothing. And then once you've got a clearance you're pretty free to jump to another team, another paygrade, another facility - whatever. Which means that there's no real guarantee that that investment will pay off for the group that hires you initially. 

I can also tell you that when I got hired without one and had to have a full time babysitter with two other uncleared people, we were just generally in the way of things and couldn't participate in any actual work, constantly stuffed in random offices with not enough chairs because our escorts needed to do actual work, having to ask to be escorted to the bathroom like a fucking child, etc. - it was the worst 5 months of my life. And once I had that clearance I was gone from that group in 6 months because now that I had the clearance I was overqualified for the position.",shargy,t2_169mi2,1,0,reddit4

At the end of the day, there will always be someone who has to take a lower-paying opportunity because other jobs are taken up. And when many job opportunities aren’t paying enough to actually really live off of, that’s an issue.

Much of this isn't service people feeling entitled, but rather a reorientation/restructuring of labor. Many servers (since that seems to be the chosen anecdote here) especially in metropolitan areas make well above living wage when tips are included. I view hourly wages as an unlikely motivator in this, and I suspect it's service industry people getting spooked that those jobs are not recession proof, if any are, and are going for jobs that may have less perceived risk on that front.",,,2,0,reddit4

I’m still lost at the 100k mentioned above. If that is referenced in his book, fair is fair and I’m glad to dig deeper.

That said - subjectivity is the name of the game here. It’s certainly opinion that some of these jobs are bullshit. Who are they bullshit to? Those who subscribe to this theory, or the masses? Is this an objective, measurable metric? An argument can be made that supply/demand of the labor force dictates what is and isnt bullshit. 

Is a survey administrator bullshit if it helps the efficacy of the survey?

Is a PR specialist bullshit if it allows for the continued operations of an entity?

Is a lobbyist a bullshit job because they’re actually vampires out for blood and will sacrifice their own kin? To be determined. (Yes)

It’s noted in the overview that the five types of ‘useless jobs’ are largely in the private sector, “despite the idea that market competition would root out such efficiencies.”

My point - I think a more reasonable way to look at it is by analyzing labor supply/demand as an indicator of what is and isn’t a bullshit job.

hc50stt,t1_hc4txpq,2021-09-09 02:56:10,Economics,"Tangential jobs that allowed me to get exposure to Enterprise level hardware and a coding bootcamp combined with having the right social network.

I went to a 3 month camp for JavaScript and python.  It was more focused on front end skills, but i don't really like that part of tech.  I like infrastructure.  So while most of my class mates went on to get mostly front end gigs, I got a job working as a support engineer for a network monitoring firm.  

They sold and used Linux based servers.  I had a pretty good grasp of concepts from my years of consumer level windows tech support (Geek Squad, hence the username).  So i kept the coding up in my spare time building sites, scripts and apps for things I was interested in. All the while digging into learning Linux at work.  

Coding + systems engineer = DevOps or Site Reliability Engineer.  To know more about what a day in the life of these roles mean, i read https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents and started thinking like an SRE at my current job.  While the company i was at wasn't interested in interviewing a support person for a dev role (bad culture in that regard), i heard that there was another person looking for non-senior SRE candidates from a close contact.  They were able to connect me with the hiring manager and i got an interview then the job.

It took like 3 years from starting bootcamp to landing the big job.  There are several failed interviews in that time as well.  The big key for breaking into the tech world without going through the college + intern pipeline is your network.  You have to establish contacts and keep talking with folks in the positions you want.  When something comes up, they can reach out or pass on your name.

The plan was to take 6 months off, pay $15k for a camp, get a job and make better money.  The plan worked.  Just a little longer than i wanted.  The best advice is, if you know what you want to do, find out what it takes to do it.  From there, make sure you are doing something everyday that brings you closer to that goal.

Yes I said collapse because if you haven't been paying attention; both Russia and China are effectively in a financial/economical alliance and the US dollar share of trade between them is ***less than 50% now***. They clearly intend to implode the U.S economically in the foreseeable future. You know what happens if/when the U.S loses it's world-backed dollar due to it's insane fiscal policy and deficit spending?

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

Sometimes it’s temporary but more often it’s because you can’t keep those positions available for the foreseeable future. Some are planned and others are a result of cash flow constraints. It can be attributed to many things. 

E.g. Target will have planned layoffs for seasonal employees hired around Christmas and then let them go in January. That type of lay-off surprises no one.

g0mngqu,t1_g0lulaw,2020-08-07 01:27:07,Economics,"I agree with the former for the most part, but as for Russia... that's more complicated. Putin is so popular because his administration brought Russia out of the complete disarray that Yeltsin left the country in. That popularity allowed Russia to flex its muscles again and exert hard power across the former Soviet Union. If you ask me, the neo cold war with Russia really began in 2008 with the war in Ossetia. Shortly after that there were allegations that the Obama administration interfered in the Russian elections and attempted a soft coup (eerily similar allegations like what we saw in 2016, would not be at all surprised if true given [the state department's footprint in Russia historically] (https://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960715_400.jpg)). And then it all went to shit with active proxy wars a couple years later in Ukraine and Syria. The US has always had an interest in containing Russia even after the fall of communism, but yes you are correct that whole time China was building and taking opportunities.

China on the other hand... I don't think anybody has a damn clue where that conflict will end up. The West assumed that opening China up to the WTO and etc would end up with China reforming and becoming more democratic. That has not happened and China is extremely tied to the world economy unlike the USSR and it's successor the Russian Federation (whose GDP is equivalent to Italy and was never properly brought into the worlds economic fold). But China is there and eager to gain more soft power, act as an alternative to US hegemony. I expect a long diplomatic battle across East Asia between the US and China to 'woo' counties into their sphere. The US enjoys the post WWII mantle as master of the Pacific Theatre... but the US is on the decline (its credibility was already slipping from the Bush admin imo, but Trump pulled the rabbit out of the hat for the world to see). China certainly has many, many problems to and their international image is ~~not exactly spotless~~ downright loathsome especially given what's going on in Xinjiang... but they have the initiative while the US seems to be struggling to keep what it has.

That's how I see it. I don't ever expect China to lash out first because [its military is still reforming] (http://english.www.gov.cn/archive/whitepaper/201907/24/content_WS5d3941ddc6d08408f502283d.html), but there is still plenty of room for relations to deteriorate and I don't see anyone in the room who's looking to turn the temperature down (Biden is promising to be *tougher* on China.

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

kolo8x0,t3_1ah6nlp,2024-02-02 15:56:06,Economics,"Past the headlines and in the linked article:

*A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts.*

*Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter, noted that not everything in the January report was consistent with gangbuster job growth. She pointed out, for example, that Americans worked an average of 34.1 hours a week last month, the lowest such figure since 2010 excluding the COVID-19 recession.*

*The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them — and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation.*

&nbsp;

Julia Pollak was also cited in [USA Today’s analysis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/25/part-time-jobs-hit-record-high/72331112007/) of 22 million Americans in part-time work:

*Also, about 70% of working men and women over 65 are in part-time jobs, ZipRecruiter says. Because the population of baby boomers in that age group is so large, it’s pushing up the number of Americans working part time, says ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak.*",marketrent,t2_fj9vsvfd,31,0,reddit2

Defining terms:

Median: usually considered better than ""average"" (arithmetic mean) because the average figure gets distorted to show larger numbers by a few people who make a whole lot. The median is the person who has half the population making more than them, and half the population making more.

Real: adjusted for inflation

Wages: income from labor. Excludes capital gains if they have stocks, interest from savings or bonds, etc. 

Household income: includes wages, capital gains, and interest income for an entire ""household."" This means both parents' income, and generally people who live together as a family. This is a weird one to look at over longer periods of time, because household structures change over time. Single parents become more common, people live with their parents longer than typical, and having extended family in the same house is  less common. Despite the shrinking household size though, income is going up over time, in part because this is offset by increased labor participation among women.",guineapigfrench,t2_1e09w5w8,3,0,reddit2

FYI, all of that info can be found in exhausting detail in the jobs report itself.  The raw number of workers is actually up compared to last year, the labor-to-population ratio is essentially unchanged, the labor participation rate is essentially unchanged, and wages are up, month over month and year over year, at a rate greater than the inflation rate.

Nothing will tank the perception of an economy faster than double digit unemployment, or double digit interest rates. Black unemployment? Record lows - 5.3% this time.  Hispanics 5%, only slightly higher than during the best stretch Trump had.

People are crying about interest rates now because they've been irresponsibly coddled with Great Recession remaining interest rates for far too long.  In the grand scheme of modern US history, 5-5.5% is really not bad.

Real wages have increased more than the value of inflation for 9 months straight, now.

Not only has Biden created more overall jobs than Trump, but he's created about 60% more manufacturing jobs then he did, too.

The stock market? Record highs, highs that put the Orange one to shame.  

I'm not sure what other metric to go by.  People cry about expenses, yet if you look at surveys from this year, and then go back to 2018-2019, a similar amount of people complain about being broke, or unable to afford the classic ""500 dollar emergency expense"".   

People in this country just suck at money.

Historically you would enter negotiations with the hopes to protect healthcare, try to improve language for sick days, vacation, holidays, things like that.

Now? If I brought back a contract like that to my members I would be lynched. The expectation now is 7-10% in the first year to make up for all the purchasing power lost to inflation. I have been regularly negotiating multiple dollars an hour for groups that were historically content with $.75 increases. The entire climate is changed, and the employers understand this. Our members were getting 2-3% raises back in 2022 when CPI peaked at 9.1% and the labor market has the most leverage I have ever experienced. It especially helps that I represent a lot of CDL drivers where the FMCSA estimates an 80,000 driver shortage nationwide.

1. Whatever inflation is, improving your wages is good for you. High inflation, low inflation, it doesn't matter from your perspective. One strategy to increase your wages is seeking a new employer.

2. ""When the government prints money, [...] the value of it is less [...]."" No. Imagine the Federal Reserve printing a 100 trillion dollar bill. There's basically only [$20 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) or so in existence. They take that 100T note and sit on it. It's literally under Jerome Powell's mattress. This impacts absolutely nothing- nobody notices. The real world rough equivalent of this, is quantitative easing (done in the aftermath recession, which brought much ado about ""the Fed just printing money"")

What *does* impact inflation? It's simple supply and demand. Inflation *is* changes in prices. If your grocery store sees higher costs on beef because the farmer usually feeds their cows soybeans from China (just an example), and the shipper can't find enough containers to ship all the soy, the shipper raises prices on everything they ship until they only have as many people asking for containers as they have containers to use. That means the farmer has to pay more, so their costs go up, so *if* they are going to keep selling chicken, they only can at a higher price. It had nothing to do with the fed, and everything to do with supply and demand at each stage of the value chain.

Don't get me wrong, things like Zimbabwe happen- but if you're thinking about the Federal Reserve as acting remotely like that, you're just uninformed. That's not what's happening.",guineapigfrench,t2_1e09w5w8,2,0,reddit2

You can't just expect tariffs to suddenly swing the balance in production and supply lines. First, you need some domestic overcapacity to exist in order to take advantage of tariffs. Secondly, most manufacturers will bet on tariffs being just temporary, so they won't invest in more capacity, since it is extremely risky if/when tariffs go away. It is not like current US trade deals aren't full of tariffs, restrictions and protectionism (especially for corporations and patents etc.), but manufacturers know those are probably there for the long-term. That is why sudden tariffs can often have the opposite effect of prices going up, but domestic jobs actually being lost at the same time.",lovely_sombrero,t2_wtfvl,174,0,reddit3

> Free trade consists simply in letting people buy and sell as they want to buy and sell. It is protection that requires force, for it consists in preventing people from doing what they want to do. Protective tariffs are as much applications of force as are blockading squadrons, and their object is the same—to prevent trade. The difference between the two is that blockading squadrons are a means whereby nations seek to prevent their enemies from trading; protective tariffs are a means whereby nations attempt to prevent their own people from trading. What protection teaches us, is to do to ourselves in time of peace what enemies seek to do to us in time of war. - Henry George 1886

We were making lower volume products, but they were high temperature, high vibration, and corrosive environments, so some of the steel we'd chose wasn't generally available everywhere. 2) Better consistency. We had problems with asian suppliers delivering the actual alloys we ordered, and in some cases, were passing us fake certifications for their products.

Some non-engineer managers made an executive decision to move much of our production to China, despite engineering analysis that showed we'd have problems with getting the materials, and that the cost wasn't much better. The alloys and consistency became a nightmare when we tried to certify these replacement lines in China for our existing customers. Quality problems everywhere.

I had the same problem trying to explain to my supervisors that while a 25 cent shift differential seems adequate to them, it is in fact far short of their local competitors. I then tried to explain how, as someone already working 12 hour graveyard shifts, the company offering a dollar of differential (and three dollars additional base) is much more attractive.
I might as well have tried to teach my cat to integrate using substitution. 

Their response : 'But this is a good company!'

""Then why do your process operators keep leaving for the two other outfits in town doing the same work but offer higher wages?""

""Because their stupid and they'll regret it.' Was the most coherent explanation I recieved, and all the supervisors laughed at the production managers joke. I find this particularly foolish and hypocritical because said production manager is always going on about how we're a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to our shareholders because money is the most important thing in the whole world, ever.

They had a special meeting on Friday because there aren't enough operators for one of the pieces of equipment. It's impossible to get enough people in to consistently cover because basically a whole crew is gone and there are only 4 operators in a shift, with 4 shifts. Not a big pool of people qualified to do overtime, and nobody wants to spend 7 days a week in there so they've been running a half crew and dealing with 3-4x as much downtime. We're running at less than half capacity because they can't be bothered to pay market wages, and trying to explain that is like trying to hammer the spaghetti of reality through a brick wall of arrogance and groupthink.",Keeper151,t2_dyr9a04,3,0,reddit3

I had never been here before but I knew the way to the nearest exit. I started to run. As I did, I looked to my right. I saw the door to a room, the handle was a big metal thing that seemed to jut out of the wall. The door looked old and rusted. I tried to open it and it wouldn't budge. I tried to pull the handle harder, but it wouldn't give. I tried to turn it clockwise and then anti-clockwise and then back to clockwise again but the handle didn't move. I heard a faint buzzing noise from the door, it almost sounded like a zap of electricity. I held onto the handle with all my might but nothing happened. I let go and ran to find the nearest exit.
I had thought I was in the clear but then I heard the noise again. It was similar to that of a taser but this time I was able to look back to see what was happening.
The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

That's not necessarily true. Edit: Not only is it not necessarily true, its just not true. Prices of products and resources absolutely affect supply and demand which directly changes how much people are buying and selling. Price is literally one of the most common reason for supply and demand changes, ever heard of the law of supply and demand?

The article even says the downturn in the steel industry accounts for a tiny fraction of jobs in Michigan but it's a wider indicator that trump simply can't get done what he says.

Then you try to equate Hunter Biden being involved with an automotive company and it selling to a Chinese firm as being the same thing as trump sinking an entire industry with his infinite stupidity.

Oh and this deal was back in 2015. Oh and you ignore all the business dealings the trump family personally has with China while trump is supposed to be running the country.

The company sold to a Chinese firm has 6,000+ employees spread out over dozens of smaller entities.

One Steel company laid off 1,250 employees this year as it shuts down operations for good.

The industry has been shedding jobs since trump took office.

75,000+ jobs lost in metal producing industries since end of last year. Estimated 175,000+ jobs lost by mid 2019. 

Michigan alone has seen 2,000+ jobs lost since the tariffs took effect. Manufacturers employ 55,100 less employees than when trump took office.

Costs are up, production is down, jobs are gone, trump has no follow up plan, but don't forget in 2015 when Hunter Biden was involved in the sale of a single automotive company to a Chinese firm which has 6,000-ish employees.

No, I'm reasonably confident this just doesn't work, and you're assuming a perpetual motion machine. You're assuming a company can extract more money from a market than it puts in, *as a result of putting that money in*. I'm not saying that can literally never happen, but I am saying that if you want to rely on this effect to save an economy, you should explain in detail how you think it works.

If you're considering paying your employees more so that your employees spend more money on your product, you will almost always make more money by simply paying your employees less. If the only people buying your product are your employees and their dependents, you will rapidly run out of money and cease to have employees.

If local incentives would cause an economy to collapse, that doesn't change the local incentives. If local incentives would cause a market to disappear, that doesn't change the local incentives. You can sometimes make an argument ""but those things haven't happened, so the incentives can't be that"", but you obviously can't make that argument here because there are other incentives in play.

And I claim that the local incentives you describe simply do not prevent these things from happening. Other incentives do, but not the local incentives of ""if we stop employing people in the US, people in the US will have less money to spend on our products"".

No, I'm sorry, this is completely wrong. You're wrong about what I'm arguing, and you're wrong about what you're arguing. (Bold of me to say that, perhaps. But I say it anyway.)

You argued that literally every firm isn't going to move abroad *because* ""If every firm left the US and there were no jobs here, no one would have any money to spend on the goods that these companies are relocating to create"". The ""because"" is important there. In this most recent comment you've abandoned the ""because"", but it was absolutely there in your previous two comments.

(Maybe you didn't intend to make that argument? But looking at what you wrote, I am forced to conclude that you did make it, intent or no.)

(You made other arguments too, to be sure. But I wasn't responding to those arguments, and I tried to signal this by quoting the argument I was responding to and not quoting the arguments I was not responding to.)

I was arguing, simply and solely, that this argument that you made is wrong. That the ""because"" does not hold; that those actions are not prohibited by that consequence of them, though they may be prohibited by other consequences.",philh,t2_2zl2,1,0,reddit3

As far as I can tell, this cashes out as ""this argument that you said I was making is true, and I've been trying to explain it to you and not getting through. But also, I never made that argument"".

This would seem like a strange combination of things to say, except that ""redditor says two wildly contradictory things in one comment"" is something one gets used to.

> But there are plenty of applications of Game Theory in Economics that only hold because if all the firms in the situation did something, it would end up worse for all of them.

I'm no economist but I know a little game theory, and I basically don't think this is the case. Or to the extent that it's true, the ""because"" is actually ""because people have power over each other and use that to set up decent incentives"". Like, in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, you can get decent results; but you don't get decent results ""because if everyone defected all the time it would be bad for everyone"". Rather, you get decent results ""because, speaking broadly, tit-for-tat is an evolutionary stable strategy that gives decent results"". If you squint you can maybe kind of call that ""because it would end up worse for all of them"", but I think that's a confusing way to describe it.

Of course, even if it is true that doesn't mean the situation you're describing is is well-modeled by them.

Feel free to point to the applications of game theory you're thinking of. I won't reply, even if I think they don't remotely say what you think they say, but I'll be interested to see them anyway.",philh,t2_2zl2,1,0,reddit3

The United States, with the ability of its population to move from where the were born to where they work has always enabled it to be able to optimize its human capital.   Europe, seeing this, established the European Union, with its single currency and just as importantly, the ability of people to move to where the jobs are.   This  is impossible in India due to its caste system, which as Britannica notes, ""has been a dominating aspect of social organization for thousands of years.""   Social mobility is essential for a nation to achieve optimal efficiency, and productivity.    Until India moves away from this caste system, they simply cannot compete.   Of course many other nations have faced discrimination that retarded their growth, the U.S. had its slavery, and afterward racial discrimination, Europe had its many wars between what are now peaceful members.   Neither the US or the EU are perfect by any means.   But India seems to be a case study of a society, unfortunately, too firmly rooted in the past.   Until there is a real and effective effort to eliminate the caste system, India will never reach its potential, and always lag behind the developed nations.  Some will argue that part of India's problem is the tremendous theft of its resources by the British during the time they controlled India.

If they are given a task and don't know how to do it they just won't do it instead of telling you they need help or more instructions.

I know a scarce amount of the economic history of India, but in Mexico, when neoliberal policies were implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by PRI officials, it enabled temporary economic growth but became largely stagnate since the privatized state assets largely came under the ownerships of corporations that had close ties to government officials (i.e, corruption, not unlike what happened in Russia during the privatization efforts after the fall of the USSR) and they established monopolies and that’s why the only other “companies” are small shops that are mainly for localized areas.

We missed manufacturing boat in 1990's for sure because of the thoroughly corrupt Indian Congress and its coalition government.  Somehow, the IT boom saved the economy and opened up Indian minds.

These days startups are doubling and booming on a yearly basis and eventually, India will catch up on manufacturing.  There is enough internal demand, labor and now with legislative support soon India will project itself as a strong competitor to China.  Chinese manufacturing is already showing signs of fatigue.

Anyway time will tell, and I am eternally optimistic about India.  Economic superpower or not, I can't wait to see the billions coming out of poverty to live a happy and healthy life surrounded with opportunities.",bhau-saheb,t2_lb07e,-3,0,reddit4

Of course, to become a superpower, each state has to overcome numerous challenges. While several countries managed to do so and now have great power and impact on the international system significantly, others still have these problems ahead. 

India is an example of the second group of states. Regardless of its fast economic growth, the country faces numerous domestic problems,  such as extreme poverty, corruption, a lack of equal access to education, a poor health system, etc. To become a superpower, India must overcome these issues, which are complicated at the moment.",LatoriaWilliams,t2_4fjlv35k,1,0,reddit4

(this is the real metric to measure GDP and not the nominal which favors the USD and does not account of productivity in the real sense but just its value in USA market for eg.  A tea seller will make a tea and sell for 5rs in india he did exactly x amount of productivity the same in USA will be $1 for a milk tea so in GDP terms those two should be exactly same productivity as its physically the same thing but in US $1 is added to its gdp for its product while only ₹5 or 6cents $0.058 in india. You see that same amount of milk tea leaves and heat that get inside the tea and same amount of productive outcome came but values differ so vastly) 

As i explained why PPP is the only real measure of GDP and nominal is BS metric which doesn't account to real life. 

So India is third largest economy PPP GDP accounting over $13Trillion dollars and within 5-10 years india will surpass the USA and become the second largest economy. 

And believe it or not after 2040 and before 2050 India will surpass china and become the richest or in real sense the largest economy.

1.India is least corrupt big economy. 
USA is the most corrupt big economy. 

2.Brain drain is less than 1% of indian talents so its also a non issue. 

3.Protectionism is what made China develop so fast indeed we need more of it to develop fast. 


All three points u mentioned had no base. 
You lack even basic knowledge about economy. 


The reasons behind Indias slow growth compared to china:-
1. China is an autocracy they dont need to aquire land neither they have these NGO's stopping the progress example:- just look at bullet train project in india due to lack of state government help for land acquisition and NGOs and godrej literally halted mumbai metro for over a decade such thing would never happen in china or have u ever heard of such thing in china research theres no such incident in china bcz its autocracy no one can go againsts the government not even provinces people or companies. 


2. Too defensive loan and investment strategies. China took huge debts India isn't doing so China's bullet train project was over $1Trillion dollar debt project such thing can never happen in india people would burn the nation down. 


3. China exploited alot in geopolitics took grasp of resource full small countries with debt trap like in south america china took grab of lithium mines. 
India would never do that bcz of high morale. 


4. China always copied technologies and put no regard to patterns they steal every successful pattern. They literally developed their industeies by stealing technologies from other nations.


China's bullet train is stolen from japans pattents and RND. They buikt over a stolen technology. 


Chinas smartphone industry developed from stealing iphone and samsung design patterns and pattents. 

BYD came from stealing tesla tech designs. 

Even their space program fighter jets are part to part copy of american fighter jets and space behicals. 

5. China was less than half the size (demographically) compared to India and theres was little competition back then today things are just different. 
And its simple economics bigger the economy harder it is to grow. 

India at more than twice the size of 3decades ago china. 
Will really be slow moving elephant compared to relatively smalled cheettah china was. 

China developed so fast because it exploited every single exploitable illegal and immoral practice. 

Foxconn works with no regard to human life.

Alot of it was by chance. China, too, had massive amounts of corruption, protectionism, and brain drain at Indias stage in the 80s and 90s, what it benefited from at the time was (a) lack of a sizeable industrial competitor that would considerably inhibit it reaching it's full potential (Japan, Korea, and SEA combined are not as big and nowhere nearly as cohesively integrated) , and (b) an era of fast growing Western consumer demand fueling export led growth and industrialization. These two important conditions were, to be quite honest, occurring by chance, and China just got very lucky to industrialize during this era. India is not so lucky; post 2008, Western consumer demand has stagnated considerably in contrast to the 1990s and 2000s, and India has to compete with China, a similarly sized country with a highly developed industrial sector, alongside other aspiring exporters for the ever diminishing gains of export oriented growth. The East Asian development model is past it's best by date. 

India will still grow, just that there should be no expectations of sustained miracle growth for the next 20 years like East Asia experienced 1970-2010.

Just from your comment, this bit about 20% Youth Unemployment (was peddled for 16-24 age bracket, an absolute ridiculous category in itself but made even comedically worse by the math used, i.e. they didn't use THE TOTAL people in this category, they used like 1/3 to 1/5 of that.

And the Educated generation being a 1 off is even more silly. This is the first generation in PRC history (really 4000 Years of Chinese history in fact) that is the most educated EVER.

Modern China was build by the generation that was young in Cultural Revolution time, meaning barely having half the Education Years of today's Chinese generation or even a peer semi-developed country. That is the generation that did all what China is today.

To then expect that getting a next generational cohort that is Twice as educated as the last and economic repercussions will be negative is bending over backwards mental gymnastics of Elite Olympics level.

OK. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan. Japan, by the way, was already a developed nation pre-war, and since it largely retained it's knowledge base that have it inherent advantages to recover their position by the 60s, and as the pioneer of the East Asian export development model, they faced much less export competition in the crucial years Kickstart ING their miracle. South Korea and Taiwan are both tiny nations that are strong US allies and are thus privileged with market access and tech transfers. Singapore and Hong Kong do not count since both are wealthy trading entrepots. China also hasn't fully achieved advanced developed status yet with this model (though they seem to have enough escape velocity to escape the middle income trap) 

Now, there's plenty of examples of countries that only developed halfway before stagnating in the late 90s.

- Phillipines 
- Thailand
- Indonesia (though they've started to recover some growth prospects on recent years) 
- Malaysia

Burma and Pakistan are obviously basket cases, which leaves Vietnam, India and Bangladesh. If you notice, Vietnam is not growing anywhere near as fast as China or South Korea were growing at the same level, and Vietnam is also priveleged with a land border with the world's largest supply chin.

This statement is absurd at a meta level. Every low income country has the problems of being a low income country - that's what makes it desirable to transition into a high-income country in the first place.

Instead of using nonsensical crystal balls to predict the future, you could just read up literally any global macroeconomic report to find that India has been growing at 7% for the last 20-25 years. China did better because they grew at 11-12% for a decade or so. Sophisticated math alert but 7% is not as big as 12%, but it is not as small as 4%.

As things stand, India is projected to grow at a steady, albeit not a particularly brisk clip.

kfkyyxr,t1_kfkoao0,2023-12-30 18:00:48,Economics,"I broadly agree. Caste system is extremely complicated thing - in some parts of India (North and Northwest),it is    tied to your ethnicity/ancestry with studies showing that people of different castes have different haplogroups, whereas in other parts, it is purely a social construct. Another reason why caste system is difficult to dismantle is because there is a hierarchy of 100s of castes - not just 3-4 castes as some people think. Each caste feels superior to the caste just below it even though both of these castes may be considered ""backward"".

While caste system is primarily associated with Hinduism, Indian Muslims, Christians, Sikhs - all practice it.

Intercaste marriage is extremely rare in India - similar to the rate of Interracial marriage in the US 50 yrs ago.

I don't think the comparison with East Asia is appropriate for a variety of reasons. Each East Asian country is way more homogeneous than India. Religion has never been an important part of East Asian culture - this has nothing to with communism in China. Countries like Taiwan, SK and Japan have significant irreligious population. Lastly one of the good things about maoism is that they got rid of several misogynist practices in China and championed women's rights.

So, in conclusion, to create a socio-economic order similar to EA in India, there has to be a brutal communist uprising (10 times more brutal than Maoist China) that wil force every Indian to marry outside their caste and even religion. Even then, there would be lots of other fault lines (like ethnolinguist identities) that might lead to Balkanization of India.

A more pragmatic thing is to ban medieval practices like untouchability (banned in 1950, but still happens a lot in some parts) and give proportional representation to all the castes in jobs and education (happens , but is riddled with corruption).",aishikpanja,t2_flqqli24u,1,0,reddit4

The reason why access money works in China but not other places is that China is centralized and fewer people have to be paid off. The counter balance to that is that these folks who take bribes are measured by their performance in order to move forward in their scope and power within the government. So if they take a bribe that ended up not being in the interests of the party they are quickly weeded out and often jailed. This causes a dynamic for them to take bribes but only in areas that can be perceived as benefitting the party and it’s socialist agenda and hence things move forward.

In India or US, they are decentralized so it’s much more people to bribe, and the officials have no counter balance so if these deals do not benefit the people or even at all deliver they continue to be in office and nothing changes.",ekw88,t2_aldhe,13,0,reddit4

Let's say you want to discover a new material, you'd need to measure it's electrical, magnetic properties, you might need to first look at the atomic structure, grain boundaries and design in situ experiments under a Microscope. And then optimise, theorise and figure out new ways of achieving more suitable properties by using more sophisticated synthesis methods..  Any big discovery has a barrage of failed experiments which provides the insights to make it successful. Money and support is key to sustain it, and having high tech equipments allow researcher to apply more potential solutions.
Now, a lab in USA which has a high resolution in situ TEM with direct detectors. Vs a lab in India which doesn't have access to or cannot afford the latest detector set up. The chances and opportunities to explore and stumble upon the next big thing is higher in the US lab.

Yes, Southeast Asian countries I listed are in fact wealthier than India, but they are still middle income countries which saw stagnating growth as soon as they achieved that development level. Phillipines in particular has struggled with this, but Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have also experienced this.

I never said India couldn't make it to middle income status, quite the opposite, I think there's an extremely high likelihood that they can develop that far. But getting stuck in the middle income trap is not ideal, because your country still had a substantial plurality of impoverished citizens.

Again, China leads in many industries party because it got lucky in developing in the right environment. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered without their industrial policy, but industrial policy alone is cannot enough to supercharge a country to becoming an advanced economy. They benefited immensely from a confluence of factors beyond their control, such as fast growing western consumer demand and lack of substantial export competition, during their core development era.

The answer is that they DO. They are not working as much in Government jobs or Private registered corporation (though that is increasing). 

There is a massive service and manufacturing sector in India that are unreported due to the lack of registration and exemption of taxes. Women in India are not sitting at home idly watching TVs (well exept the rich ones). Many of them work in their own household businesses, agriculture and enabling their family. They also work in their own household caring for their own and relative's children, teahcing them when they are young, prepare food for their family.

Imagine how large the contribution of food & hospitality industry, child care & day care industry etc. contribute to a developed economy and all of them exist in a different form in India. People almost always eat at home, and there's almost no culture of sending children to daycare - partly due to culture and partly due to cost. Many women particpate in minimum wage job equivalent but they are unregulated and unreported. 

I would advise taking a trip to India for significant time (its vast and diverse, it is called a subcontinent) and explore if you don't believe me. Of course the economy & culture is very different than the Western world so it might seem weird to you. 

The important thing I wanted to point out overall that there is very little stopping a woman to achieve her dreams if she is so inclined in pursuing higher skilled research / jobs (yes exceptions do exist in remote areas but it is a massive country with massive population) - especially in 2023. This does not mean that there aren't people with outdated perceptions of how a woman should live but they are a minority.

Gender equality is not 50%-50% distribution in every aspect of the economy, rather discrimination of people's access to employment/economy based on gender.

Border settlement is insanely hard from Indian political dynamic but it is not impossible, it just needs a greater Political Capital Spend (by the leader, party in power and so on).

China has no other option. It can't force a short-timeframe/immediate Ratification (this very problem itself arose because of such a dynamic, i.e. British and then Independent India forcing an Illegal 1914 agreement onto China as being Ratified when it never was. Hence China can't do that to India anyway).

This is why in large parts PRC retreated back in 1962 at end of War because EVEN IF it had held the territories they still would not have gotten a Ratification since India would still have gone, ""We still claim it"". The end result being same, i.e. Disputed, Unresolved Border.

China wants Border resolution (their Land border track record is objective proof of it & offering India multiple status quo deals also adds to this). It has been frustrated by India despite it knowing why India is doing what it is doing (domestic politics).

But China has small operating room, it was begrudgingly fine till 2000s with long timeline for resolution (just like India, which wouldn't have minded it it was resolved 50-60-80 years from now). But post Pivot to Asia and all what happened in 2010s China's own internal timeline shifted, it had to do something because Not doing anything was a Net-Negative.

It is trying to budge India from that 50-60-80+ years internal timeline to shorter decades. That is all China can do. It can not force an agreement and the territory is too useless and small to grab (plus as mentioned would still be subject to Unresolved dynamic anyway).",iVarun,t2_5tvbt,1,0,reddit4

Russia was the last holdout of serfdom in Europe by something like 100 years. And the serfs weren’t just a small % of the population but the overwhelming majority. They lacked true middle class and as a result of stagnant societal structure they lacked educational and economically far behind powers such as America, Britain, and Germany. They were heavily agrarian until the end of the first revolution at which point all parties that tried to fill the power vacuums stressed the importance of the industrialization. The communist speed ran industrialization hardcore and took them from a “wet behind the ears” industrialized country pre WW1 to an industrial super power in the 50s-60s

US was agrarian but even by WW1 we were ahead of Britain and France in terms of raw output and we were not recovering from
The civil war which was over 50 years ago. We may not have gotten over the civil war socially/culturally but economically we hadn’t just recovered but expanded into a economic superpower. By WW2 we outproduced every single country involved in the conflict, and I believe outproduced all major powers combined. 

Even with all this strength in production the USSR became a threat in a matter of decades despite numerous bloody conflicts during that same
Period which is truly remarkable.

This isn’t new. Beef consumption bans have been in place in different parts of India for over 2000 years. And much more since the vegetarian influence of Jainism and Buddhism grew to influence Hinduism.

Even under certain Mughal rulers beef consumption was banned as to not stoke civil unrest amongst the majority hindu population by the Muslim rulers.

So it’s nothing new introduced recently.

It is a sacred animal. Some people will get upset if you mess with that.

Secularism in india is about pluralism. It does not mean anti-religion (like it does in the west). Mainly because there are so many religions in india and much of it is not organized or centralized religion so it is much more flexible in what is believed and accepted at any time in order to try to accommodate everyone. Hinduism for example is practiced very differently from family to family and community to community.

There are some Hindus that are fine eating beef also and have done so for centuries. Usually these people are from tribal areas whose leaders were fine with it.

Preferences and practices of what is acceptable differ from region to region, province to province and town to town in india. So it’s very tough to generalize anything about india.

He said he doesn't know what's going to happen after the summer and if he even wants to return to engineering. I think there's a lot of COVID burnout when it comes to work in general right now, but I think the disruption of the past year really provided people with an opportunity to evaluate their life and how they want to spend it.

As much as the past year living under a pandemic has sucked, I do think there can be a benefit in the disruption. It's super easy to get into a groove with life where maybe you aren't necessarily unhappy, but you aren't happy and you're just kind of content to go along with things. I certainly hope we can gain something positive living through this experience and reevaluate a lot of the things we had been doing just because that's how they were done.",MercyMedical,t2_6iy9m,42,0,reddit1

Yes an extra few hundred or any number of dollars will mathematically impact the level of incentive to return to work. And we can argue all day on the moral points of minimum wage labor and exploitation. 

However the fact remains industries like bars and restaurants have massive average turn over normally. So you add average turn over + accute covid turn over + no net employee add, and without even factoring in how negatively new potential employees may view the industry post covid, you have a massive unprecedented level of labor squeeze in the industry.

As State differ in their unemployment benefit rollback we will see. But I would not be surprised to find out that the labor shortage breaking point for some of these distinct industries end up being above the unemployment benefit pay rate",tristanjones,t2_4wyoe,34,0,reddit1

Thing is I live in RI, a liberal subsidized state and they kicked me off at year end, said it should take 2 weeks max to file new claim.

4 weeks later they hadn't processed my claim, any number to call, no hold, just hangs up on you saying it's too busy. No response to emails.

So I go get another shittier job that pays way less then I'm making on unemployment have to do 27k steps a day. Now, my old boss at community college is hitting me up, saying I'll get my job back sometime in between now and September.

Thing is, this shortsighted ghosting from UE trying to stimulate the economy (or maybe it's just a contract with real estate corps and banks trying to foreclose houses who knows) is gonna bite the economy in the butt. 

Because my boss at my shitty job is having a really hard time hiring people with the low pay and the crazy hours (I work nights and weekends) so I'm going to just quit this job, as soon as I get my old one back or sooner, seeing as it's also giving me poison ivy that is rapidly spreading everywhere including my face.

So unemployment ghosts people pre maturely, forcing them to take worse jobs, and then when they get their old jobs back, WHICH HASNT HAPPENED YET, many new businesses are going to be CRUSHED by labor shortages from people quitting to return to their old, better jobs!

I'm doing AV, but all the areas are understaffed. The head of security is quitting because he's doing 90 hour weeks only getting paid 40 for salary, the food and janitor people are severely understaffed. And pretty soon all the new hires like me will bounce.

And if you look at the Rhode Island unemployment reviews my experience is not unique. They get one star, everyone's going through the same thing.

People aren't taking the shitty jobs cuz they suck. Every single person that I worked with at my college job have re applied and we are all going to be rehired. I really could just quit this job today but I'm sticking through because I like my boss and I feel bad, but I have enough money to make it until September which is the latest I'll get rehired. Most people wouldn't walk 27k steps nights and weekends getting poison ivy all over there bodies just because they feel bad for their boss. Idk if that makes me a sucker or what.

They are a sort of out-servants of the landlords and farmers. The usual reward which they receive from their master is a house, a small garden for pot-herbs, as much grass as will feed a cow, and, perhaps, an acre or two of bad arable land. When their master has occasion for their labour, he gives them, besides, two pecks of oatmeal a-week, worth about sixteen pence sterling. 

>During a great part of the year, he has little or no occasion for their labour, and the cultivation of their own little possession is not sufficient to occupy the time which is left at their own disposal. When such occupiers were more numerous than they are at present, they are said to have been willing to give their spare time for a very small recompence to any body, and to have wrought for less wages than other labourers.

You can absolutely compensate for inflation without it mucking up the data or being subject to manipulation. One CAN manipulate the data, but mostly only if the listener doesn't know any better, and that is true of all sciences (even ones like Physics that had very little ambiguity in the data).

Your not wrong that time changes economic variables in ways that are hard to track, but that isn't inflation exclusive. Technological change, changes in  values, changes in taste, etc. all interfere the longer the time scale one uses.

The wages data is very hard to interpret currently and its not the case that wages are going up very much at all in most sectors.

If you look at 2020 data, avg hourly earnings growth was very healthy but this doesn't reflect that tonnes of people lost their jobs entirely. That can be seen in the hours worked and income data.

Now incomes are going back up but its almost entirely due to hours worked, not wage increases. In fact the latest y/y earnings number was 0.3% in the same month that inflation was more than 4%.

In a non-securitization market, i'd say that the banks would call whatever loans they can but i don't even know if they care if the assets return negative real yield because if they sold the income to some pension fund.

Most software testing is automation these days. I would recommend learning the test pyramid and some of the different modes of automation (unit/integration/UI) and when they are to be used, and how/when they should run in a CI/CD pipeline. For UI testing, learn Selenium. For integration and unit tests you often use the same frameworks so learn those well. Knowing how to isolate a system properly, fake out a service with something mountebank, and stage test data effectively are all important things to know.

Spend time learning to identify corner cases, anticipate nonfunctional requirement demands like security and performance, learn the static analysis like sonarqube, learn how to read stack traces effectively and quickly, and get in the habit of popping open prod logs every few hours on general principle no matter how much alerting you have set up.

Finally, be willing to have an opinion about the right way to do shit, then be loud and obnoxious and learn how to get gates set up properly. The more stringent your gates, the harder it is to get shit to prod, but the less likely you are to have shitty bugs that put everyone on support calls for three days.

Remember - when you build a software system, you don't build JUST the software. You also build the means for it to verify itself, and the means to deliver it. In the 80's this meant hundreds of testers testing away, writing cases, and a packaging department designing logos and boxes and figuring out the plan for shipping.

Thing is, you can't do that without protections.

Your build/deploy ideally (in my mind) works like this:

1. You make your change, push your branch, and make a pull request.
2. The PR is reviewed by other devs on your team and SME's if you made pipeline or sql changes.
3. While that happens, your changes build and run unit tests, then it's deployed to a isolation environment where integration and UI tests are run. If any tests fail, you can't merge.
4. Your code then is run through static analysis that measures code coverage, code smells, duplications, security risks, and so on. If any of these things fail, you cannot merge.
5. Once the PR is complete and merged, a new release is made, it gets deployed out to a live environment, smoke tests run, integration and UI tests run, and if any of those fail it stops there and doesn't get deployed further (and raises some alarms).

6. Any manual testing occurs.

Once everything works in that live test environment, one of two things can happen:

7A. It goes to a ""dark"" prod server, that is accessible but not in rotation behind your load balancer. Then it gets smoke tested and the quality folks can take a final look.

7B. It goes to a further staging environment designed for performance and load testing. (where it gets smoke tested, then the performance engineers get a crack at it). Then it goes to that dark prod server for a final run of smoke tests and manual checking.

8. The new servers can now be brought into rotation, feature flags turned on, and so on when users are ready.

Steps 1-5 are mostly automated except the code review by the team, and should happen on the scale of hours. Final testing might take another hour or two at most, then you can start looking at prod. If the team focuses on just one story at a time and tries to get everything done in two or three days everyone knows what's going on and one change goes in at a time into prod.

So where does the Quality team come in? Well, we usually are involved in writing the integration and UI tests, setting up the gates, collaborating on testability so that fast turnarounds are possible, helping you deal with issues that come up on your static analysis, and so on. I also coach developers on system isolation and unit testing since we have a legacy app that has some special considerations that make unit testing particularly difficult.",elebrin,t2_4etv6,1,0,reddit1

It really doesn't matter. The income ratio between low-wage and high-wage workers (income distribution) is not endogenously determined by the value these workers provide, it is exogenous. It is determined by social forces. Changes to this distribution can come from minimum wages, social mores, taxation policy, etc.

>I'm not sure we know enough about the incidence of low-income wage increases in order to assume that they will be paid mostly by high earners.

I didn't say ""mostly"". But it's just common sense that, if your wages don't increase but prices do, then your real-wages have decreased. Assuming the economy maintains its productivity, this loss of income must go somewhere. It's likely going to those low-wage earners who were responsible for the price increases in the first place.",coke_and_coffee,t2_1upwac8n,2,0,reddit1
