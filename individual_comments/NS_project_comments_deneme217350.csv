dr4b90l,t3_7j7fzt,2017-12-12 03:36:44,MensRights,"No, this is not how you do it, this is how you get fired. 

Gentlemen, do not place your jobs on the line just to make a point. If you feel the need to take extra precautions around female coworkers, do just that—but do *not* announce it, at least not in such a brazen manner. That's just going to make it easy for feminists to target these strategies and cry sexism. 

No, this needs to be subtle and covert. It needs to come across as something men have to do in secret, because the deck is stacked so heavily against us. It needs to be something hard to nail down, so that awareness of it ebbs into the societal consciousness slowly. We don't want to appear aggressive here, this needs to be viewed as what it is: a defensive posture we're being forced to take. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to do this, and I don't encourage men to do it if they don't legitimately feel threatened. Maybe that's a mistake on my part, but if so, I'm sure I'll learn the hard way. I just think doing this as a form of protest is likely to backfire on us. It needs to come across as a genuine adaptation to a workplace that has become unsafe for men interacting with women. ",,,438,0,reddit2
dr4hcto,t3_7j7fzt,2017-12-12 05:48:11,MensRights,"You're not supposed to announce your practice of the Billy Graham rule because, let's be real, it is indeed sexist. Just like women fearing all men as a potential rapist. But the reason the rule exists is for practical, safety-based reasons. The word of a woman is far heavier to the ears of people than the word of a man. Especially these days. Weighed against each other, people will sympathize with a woman over a man. A woman claims a man did something wrong to her, then he must have.

I experienced a false accusation and practice the rule to some extent. It is just smart after what I'd been through in a previous workplace. Everyone knew better than to believe her, but the company had to cover itself. She was fired for losing her temper constantly and damaging company property as well as arguing with customers. She was rehired when she claimed I groped her and two other coworkers berated her, causing her constant stress. HR moved my shift and gave hers back. I moved to a different company location instead, she got fired again and bizarrely claimed I was still harassing her at work but HR was fed up, I hadn't been on that particular location's security cameras since I moved employment. She stayed fired and will likely have a hard time working anywhere again. My boss from the other location gave me an apology afterwards, she was distraught that this kind of thing could threaten someone so much and how close I apparently was to being permanently black-balled or worse all for a lie even HR knew about. She was directly told by an HR representative that they knew this was all BS and they just wanted this all to blow over neatly and quickly.

Bottom line; sexual harassment is an easy way to get an entity that values its image to do things for you and against a man, whether you actually hate him or he is just an unfortunate pawn. Even a lame accusation like the one leveled against me is enough to make things happen. I keep to myself less, as it makes me a better target to have no social backing. Just a tip. I like people a little less for my experience, but I appreciate their occasional sense for judgement.

Practice the rule privately. Understand that if you have a false accusation against you, you still probably shouldn't talk about it. People don't care what you have to say, a woman said you did something wrong to her. Just be safe and be quiet, you don't have the privilege of being a victim whether something happened to you or not. Women? Women are victims by default.",GreyTortoise,t2_12kbki,65,0,reddit2

Could already be happening for all we know (and indeed is, in the case of eg feminist opposition to shared parenting, fair domestic violence policies etc.)   I mean it's not like any of these alleged acts of ""sexual misconduct"" have been proven in a court of law, and in some cases at least they seem to amount to ""this guy I find unattractive flirted with me at work.""  

A labor politician in the UK has already committed suicide over an unproven allegation.   The Orwellian term ""sexual misconduct"" is so broad it can mean practically anything.   

I'm starting to think the end result of this (ever escalating) feminist hysteria (whistling at a girl is now a ""hate crime"" in the UK) is going to be the return of sex segregation.   Already some men in the workplace are refusing to be alone with women; Japanese men are demanding their own train cars so they won't be falsely accused of groping; and the whole ""MGTOW"" thing seems to be growing like wildfire.   

I'm also starting to wonder whether female complaints about unwanted male attention are the whole reason ""patriarchy"" was established in the first place -- or at least certain elements of it.   What feminists are demanding -- eg that ""unwanted speech"" be classified as a crime in France -- is really an expansion of traditional gender roles, not a repudiation of them.   It's just that feminists want the entire state to act as a gigantic chaperone (and enforcer, and provider) rather than individual men.   Jordan Peterson has even argued that we are entering a new era of female totalitarianism.   

One of the problems with a potential matriarchy (are we already [living](http://www.realsexism.com/) in one?) is that women have in group bias, whereas men do not.   There appears to be a very large empathy gap that may be instinctual in nature.   This is dangerous stuff, because whereas females have all sorts of privileges under patriarchy (women and children first etc.) there is no reason to suspect that males will be granted a counter-balancing set of privileges under matriarchy.   

Indeed Karen Straughan has argued that under patriarchy it is ""women and children first"" off the lifeboats; under a matriarchy it will be ""women, children and the women's luggage first.""  ",audiotraxx,t2_nwu262y,30,0,reddit2

And yes, I do think this man is being an idiot. He's deliberately provoking women on a very serious issue for them in a way that suggests he's not taking it seriously at all. 

That the response to the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment of women by men is a gross overreaction does not negate the fact that many women have suffered this crap for a long time. Our response needs to be commensurate with that overreaction, not an overreaction itself. To the extent that men do feel unsafe around female employees, they absolutely should take precautions, and if that affects women's career prospects...well, that's their problem. But boisterously shunning women like this just makes men look like fragile snowflakes, more concerned with their ego than their actual safety. 

I'm saying let this be what it is: a reasonably defensive response to a misandrist political climate.

It's a toxic and dangerous movement, it conditions people to hate and identity certain individuals as ""the enemy"". This is something called **milieu control**:

[milieu control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_control)

>Milieu control involves the control of communication within a group environment, that also may (or may not) result in a significant degree of isolation from surrounding society. When non-group members, or outsiders, are considered or potentially labeled as less valuable without basis for stated group-supported and group-reinforced prejudice, group members may have a tendency to then consider themselves as intellectually superior, which can limit alternate points of view, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy in which group members automatically begin to devalue others and the intellect of others that are separate from their group, without logical rationale for doing so. Additionally, Milieu control ""includes other techniques to restrict members' contact with the outside world and to be able to make critical, rational, judgments about information.

White men are conditioned to be seen as the ""enemy."" However in your co-workers case, I think she is a psychopath and I absolutely think she did it on purpose.

You cannot give these people an inch or tolerate it for a second, you have to call it out directly and immediately when you can sense it happening. Ignoring what make it go away, you just make it easier for them, and letting them get away it so easily only encourages it more.

This also another example of why having money set a side is a good idea. An employer doesnt own you.

If you break the deal they fire you. If they break the deal you fire them. Too many people treat working like it's a welfare program so employers have you by the balls. Of course it's easier said than done. But start by paying off any debts you have and get money saved. Give yourself leverage to walk away when a company doesnt adhere to your business or ethical standards.

Just a week before I was to start I wanted to go there and sign the papers and everything, but the guy told me there is some trouble I'll have to call next day.

He calls me next day apologizing profoundly, because apparently a colleague of mine had applied shortly before and she was female (I actually know her) 

He said she definitely has less qualifications than me, but she is a woman and he was overruled by HR and they _had_ to chose her.

That actually happened twice, but in this one instance I _know_ from the manager himself that I was taken away that job because there was another applicant that was female.

In looking over your list of ""infractions,"" this is exactly the kind of complete bullshit that I have observed women in female-dominated environments blowing completely out of proportion. There is a tendency in these environments for gossip to spread and one minor uncomfortable interaction to take the form of ""harassment"" after enough rumor and embellishment have taken hold. Once they think you're the ""sexist"" one, they'll just keep looking for more ""evidence"" until they've cooked up some crazy narrative that has little connection to reality. Which, clearly, was the case here.

Female-dominated environments are going to be a pain in the butt for almost any guy and if you have even the slightest interest in speaking your mind without literally being the company president/owner, you're not going to be perceived well. 

Like I say, I'd strongly suggest getting out of a field like this. You're going to run into versions of this problem repeatedly. Male-dominated environments generally don't give a fuck what you think on your own time, as long as you deliver results. ",kellykebab,t2_55xlf,1,0,reddit3

I wasn't supposed to participate in class, but this particular instructor insisted on making the class one big family and so involved me in activities as well. I probably should have had a talk with my supervisor at this point.

One class, we were talking about discrimination. For sex-based societal discrimination, the instructor asked me what I thought, and I said ""legal discrimination, for divorces and custody battles"" and she nodded and smiled and started writing it down and I continued ""it's much harder for men to get custody and they're more likely to have to pay alimony"" and the instructor looked outraged and said ""No! That's not true!"" and then explained that maybe it had been the case at some point but it was now the opposite.

This shut me down for a while, but then she asked about discrimination in prison, starting by saying that PoC get charged more for the same crime (which is true) and asking what other population was more likely to be imprisoned. None of the students were answering, so she turned to me again and I said ""Men?"" and the instructor, again, looked extremely disappointed (and possibly even disgusted). She said something like ""yes, but I mean, unfairly"", shrugging it off as men obviously being in prison more because they commit the crimes and women don't.

After that I shut up for good and figured next time she asked me to participate I'd remind her I'm not supposed to.

The next day, I was informed that I wasn't a good fit anymore and I was let go.

I have copped so much BS over the last 10 years and it's getting worse. I just don't say any opinions anymore and just do my job. But clients have said all sorts of shit to me over the years. I once lost a major client because the entire office except their boss (in her 50s)  went nuts. It's hard to explain without sounding sexist, but they were out of character for a few days, and I suspect they were all in sync with that time of the month. They'd snap at me, change their mind about decisions they'd made, they even sent an email with me CC'd, saying how bad I was at my job. I wasn't. I moved mountains for them and was always responsive, undercharging to keep them happy etc. Because they had an emotional moment, they cost me a large slab of my income and I nearly went out of business. 

As I'm into my 30s, still struggling with keeping my head above water, I've noticed a trend behind the instability and stress... women. The best clients I have had were men, but they made up only about 5 or 10% of them. I can't verbalize this without sounding like a misogynist but I crave a diverse client base for my sanity. I've lost many clients over the years due to maternity leave; my main contact will go on leave or quit to pursue family life, but they won't hand me over to their replacements because they don't reveal they're not coming back until their leave is up etc. Or they quit (and can afford to because they're married to someone making good money), only to be replaced by another person who also moves on soon after. But it is always my time and energy in getting them up to speed. 

I always thought so highly of women, I thought the best of people and gave them a shot. I'm not suicidal, but I do wonder whether the injustice towards men these days, will spark a movement which turns everything on its head.

Add in the fact that it is seen as perfectly OK to discriminate against white males and it’s an uphill battle. Think about a jury. Even if it’s only 50% women you’ll be hard pressed to find 100% agreement unless you can discover iron proof evidence. 

If your in an “At Will” state and not covered by a collective bargaining agreement (Union shop), you can be let go for any reason, or no reason.  As long as they cover their tracks and you are under 40, you can’t claim discrimination. 

The environment sounds toxic. So while it sucks to be getting the boot, it may turn into a big favor to you.  It’s only a matter of time until this woman starts turning on the others now that the obvious (male) target has been removed.  $20.00 says the manager will be the victim of a list soon enough. 

Is this place the only one in your area that can use your skills?  Maybe look into a niche area of the same field.  If you’ve been there a while your experience will speak for itself. Just try to minimize the conflict part of the separation. Perhaps frame your leaving due to a change in management that made you uncomfortable. Or if you felt something could be improved maybe point to that as the catalyst. 

Don’t volunteer that you were retaliated against. Or that there was a personality conflict in the office.  Hiring managers ears will perk up, and your prospects will be down the toilet. Nobody wants to hire a troublemaker. ",creepyfart4u,t2_t44fr3m,1,0,reddit3

My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter;

Life pro tip: In literally any context, this juvenile response will get you ignored by your manager and any reasonable person will immediately take the side of the other person.

A reasonable response is a defense of yourself-- you didn't say those things, those things were said in a context that affects their meaning, and to a lesser degree she never came to me with this and I would have been more careful if I'd realized how she was taking them. You briefly mentioned you said this, but very quickly moved past it to the rest of your ""defense.""

But as soon as you say ""well she said this and that and I could have been offended and wasn't"" or ""well you've commented on my appearance and I think that could have been sexual harassment to"" you sound exactly like a 6 year old saying ""BUT HE STARTED IT!!!"" 

The above is true without further explanation.

But in case you want additional context/information, here's just one of the many reasons the above will never work:

Context, as you noted yourself, does matter, and your manager currently does not know the context of the comments or the specific wording. She wasn't there when these things happened, and she is in the position of you said- vs your coworker said. She has to decide who to believe and how to respond. From her point of view, 3 things are possible: 1, you are guilty of sexist or insensitive statements and your young co-worker is not, because the context and phrasing of your statements were sexist, and the context and phrasing of hers were not. 2, you are both guilty. 3, she is guilty and you are not.

Given that you never complained about your co-worker and were never offended, there's no reason for her to assume 2 or 3. Why would she think your co-worker is guilty of sexual assault/insensitive comments if you only brought it up as a defense when you were accused of the same? Why wouldn't she just assume that you are a dick and don't realize when you're creating a problem, or that you willfully misunderstand context?

Additional note: you accused your direct supervisor of sexual harassment, but again, you never spoke with her before. How do you expect that to go down? We can basically consider 2 possibilities: one, she breaks down, realizes the error of her ways, and radically changes the way she speaks to you and looks at you. Two, she has had plenty of training and from her perspective does not feel she's ever said anything inappropriate, and she will then assume that you're either ignorant of context and phrasing (and therefore in dire need of sensitivity training) or that you're just making up shit to get out of trouble, in which case she will immediately assume that the same is true of all your other complaints. 

You said ""commenting on your appearance is sexual harassment"" which is nonsense. If that's what you think sexual harassment is, you need sensitivity training. It's unfortunate but true that many men really don't understand the difference between ""that's a really nice pair of earrings, I like them!"" or ""is that a new haircut? It look sgood!"""" which is fine and not sexual harassment, and the many creepy things you could say that would be sexual harassment, like ""You look really hot in that shirt,"" ""wow you look really attractive today,"" or ""you're the most beautiful person in the office."" 

So your approach here, regardless of any of your views on the terrible societal harm that men face and your desire to correct those wrongs, is juvenile and would never be attempted by a competent person in a professional workspace.

I'll go ahead and read the rest of your comment now, but I feel like it's important that you know this going forward with your life.

Edit: By the way, I dont' really care when you expand on the context. I get that you have a defense of everything you said, and honestly believe you never said anything wrong. That's irrelevant to what I said above, which is about how your response is likely to impact her perception. 

And edit 2: The fact that you came to a misogynistic echo-chamber to complain pretty much confirms that you were in the wrong here. Don't get me wrong, I see a very small place for a Men's Rights movement that is also respectful of feminism and its goals and works within the various movements towards greater social equality and fairness. But to me the fact that you were aware of this subreddit and your response was to come here and vent tells me you are very likely not the fair and balanced non-sexist person you claim to be. There are other subreddits for workplace-related complaints, venting, etc. But you have already assumed that any site that isn't dedicated to correcting injustic towards men will be unsympathetic to your views. You have a sort of vibe of ""the world is out to get me with their feminist liberal nonsense and the only way I can get a fair hearing is to come to the home of the good ol' boys and complain to them, because they too see the injustice of the world.""""",realvmouse,t2_104k08,-7,0,reddit3

eie1m0v,t1_eidujvf,2019-03-12 23:10:56,MensRights,"I'd like to say I believe you, and judging by your post history you are who you say you are. Despite that it's hard to believe there isnt more to this story. I find that when people use the ""black friend"" argument they tend to also minimize their own behavior. That being said, you genuinely appear to be a therapist who knows what they're talking about. My question to you is what models do you use? CBT? Anything else you draw from a lot? 

My expectation (which could very well be wrong) is that you aren't a big fan of postmodern constructivist approaches like Narrative. If it is not, I wouldn't be surprised by your flippant use of such an argument. If you are, I'd point out the power of your decision in such a situation - having female friends who validate your list as not being problematic takes the onus off of you to actually understand if anything you said could genuinely be offensive and places it on your accuser who, judging by the context you've provided, could be expected to respond the way she has. I dont know your situation. What I do know is things do not seem to be adding up here.

I mean this genuinely - if you have an understanding of why much of your behavior could be interpreted as problematic and also believe that the problematic actions have not warranted this level of action, then I am sorry for patronizing you and I wish you all the luck I can. When people take what we say and manipulate it in a cruel, uncaring way that is truly despicable. If you cannot genuinely say that you understand why and how what you said **could** be interpreted as problematic, then i suggest you really question how it could be taken that way (especially if you fight back when its pointed out).

If neither seems appropriate I am back to my original idea: you are not telling us everything or are misrepresenting what has happened. ",BobbyMcFrayson,t2_axqey,0,0,reddit3

Average and below men who aren't red pilled and are getting drug though the dirt I have very little sympathy for though after it happens a couple of times and they don't change their ways.  I was blue pilled at one point also but things have changed a lot since then, and being blue now just means you're deluding yourself.  Society wasn't in full meltdown mode when I was still not getting things.

I knew something was wrong with society and women the moment everyone from my hometown went off to college.  All of my high school girlfriends who went became absolute whores, and many of them had 180 degree personality shifts.

I really believe this young lady made up her mind about me the moment she met me, and everything I said and did went through a filter she had. And my manager as well had very strong opinions about men so when this list was presented to her, I don't think she handled it fairly.

I want to make a few things clear, though. I am not suggesting someone *shouldn't* be offended by the things I've said. So when I say other female friends didn't find these things offensive, I don't mean to imply ""see! They're not offensive!"" different people are going to find different things offensive. That's not my point or my concern. This is my point and my concern: I think there is a difference between someone finding something offensive and problematic behaviour. What I mean by that is what people are offended by is very subjective. I think there are things most of us would agree are offensive (eg racial slurs, etc) and so most of us would probably agree someone saying those things is problematic. But then there are things that most people would agree aren't offensive to most people, but some people will still find them offensive. And these are things you don't necessarily know will offend someone until after you've already said it. Furthermore, if this is just a difference of opinion, at what point are you not allowed to express your opinion on the off chance it might offend someone? Another concern I have is that *intention* is completely disregarded when you offend someone. NONE of my comments were intended to be offensive, malicious, mean-spirited, or anything like that. Most people would agree they weren't, some will agree they were. But my intentions don't matter; all that matter is how they are perceived. And this is frightening. I brought an extreme example up at our team anti-oppression training. I said what happens if we're talking in a team meeting and I make a comment about how I want to lose weight. Could that not be interpreted as me suggesting there is a correct body weight and therefore I am now body shaming? Intention needs to hold weight. Because anyone can be offended by anything and we can't just go running around trying to destroy anyone who offends us.

My other concern is how it was handled. Think about it from my perspective; me and this young woman disagreed on things from time to time, as humans do. But she took some of these disagreements and added them to a list, either taking me out of context or completely misquoting me. And before I even had a chance to tell my side, my manager had made up her mind to send me to this training. THAT concerns me as well. There wasn't even a conversation. ",Jzurb,t2_vip53,2,0,reddit3

Just before that I was commenting on how a CPS case in the northwest seemed off the rails and the family had the right not to coooeprate. In short there, the family was being subjected to a MASSIVE and COSTLY investigation by CPS and the OCFS because the OTHER household had the mother OD on heroin and speedballs or something almost died, AND the KIDS were THERE!!

My suggestion was to the family (that wasn't OD'ing on speedballs innfront of the kids) was to decide whether or NOT they wanted to cooperate with the CPS and OCFS. Something that is in their right to do. Then someone piped up about WHY they (OCFS-CPS) would want to RUN such a HUGE investigation on both families when one family was clearly NOT fit. 

My comment was an offend (but sometimes accurate) postulation that the ""could"" want to inflate the budget.

BAM. Lifetime BAN. 

Just before that there was a woman stalked and detained, which might have been kidnapping, by a random ass dude that insinuated he was some sort of ""security"".

You know, start a dialog? It's hard to do that if you've already rejected them right when they were in an emotional, not a logical, state. It makes them far more likely to reject you too - and that gets us nowhere.",jaesharp,t2_50p12,1,0,reddit3

>it's a thing in Canada. 

If by ""It"" you're referring to non-continuation of contract employment, then *no fucking shit it's a thing in Canada*. It's a thing literally everywhere. That's the entire fucking *purpose* of contract employment, there's no commitment from any party aside from the terms of the contract. 

And additionally, non-continuation of contract employment *is not discrimination*. It's not discrimination when it happens to men or women, black or white, gay or straight. It just exists. And implying otherwise is fucking pants on head retarded ""my man"".

>It definitely applies to the conversation and the whole idea of people hating on white men.

No, ""it"" doesn't. Because the ""it"" you're referring to is a completely different area of employment law that is, by definition, not discriminatory. You would not call non-continuation of a contract held by a gay person to be sexual orientation discrimination. It's just non-continuation of a contract.

I disagree. Women don't like it when men use their power to get sexuality in the workplace. They don't mind it when men they are attracted to use their sexuality to get power in the workplace.  The thing is that Most men aren't able to make most women swoon.  

I've been flirty in the workplace many times to get benefits. Whether that was when I was 19 and selling laptops to college girls, or when I was nominated for an internal company award by a Female VP that I would talk to on my smoke breaks. Or the time I was put forward for promotion when my boss was leaving, a few weeks after we went on a ""ski-trip"" that she had organized, that I had thought she was bringing her boyfriend to, but was actually just the two of us in a room with a jacuzzi and a single king size bed.   


And more generally, When I was a teenager, I was flirty with all the teenage cashiers in the local fast food joints, and they would give me their employee discount. (I was a growing teenager, who moved heavy boxes 4 hours a day 4 days per week, I was hungry.)  

Women are just as vulnerable to these tactics as men, The only difference is that average men will get that way about average women. Average women only do it for men that drive them wild.  

Most of the time its a lot less overt than that. I'm charming, and I'm a born flirt, So when a female manager  flirts with me, I play ball, while treading the line of exactly what I say.  Its helped in situations where I've gone into a meeting with a bunch of higherups, And a few of the female ones, aren't listening to a word I say, but are watching me with rapt attention.

  Suddenly my idea has a whole bunch of traction, even though no-body understood a word I said.  (I work in IT.) When I worked at an MSP, when escalations were slow, they would send me to client meetings to meet the female controllers (basically the lead accountant).  After a lunch meeting with me, Where we just basically got to know each other personally,(it always felt like some sort of weird business themed date)  suddenly they weren't as resistant to whatever project work their company needed.",RemCogito,t2_4jukf,2,0,reddit2

There is a trick to avoid cleavage staring or glancing. 

I swear it works. 

When a woman with nice cleavage is looking at you , ONLY focus on one of her eyes. Only one eye. It must be done as the first thing you do when a woman speaks to you and gets your attention. 

Here is why it works.  The female face is like the letter (V), the face is like focal points in an art painting, drawing the eye around the painting. 

A womans face naturally draws the viewer down to the cleavage and all women are acutely aware of the power of their cleavage. 

Try it , I cannot resist looking down at cleavage, it is like a directional sign pointing down. 

But if at the onset I only look at one eye, pick one , does not matter and keep the focus. 

Pull up beautiful woman with cleavage on Google a see for yourself. 

It is not sure proof without practice. But it works .",dibberdott,t2_626jwcau,0,0,reddit2

I’m friendly to everyone at work, but usually carry an air of friendliness to the point where they might wonder if I’m flirting and it’s worked well for me. I think men and women have different strengths and weaknesses, so it makes sense in a way for a woman to use her sexuality (if she’s attractive) and for men to use their stereotypical masculine traits (if they have them) to make waves.

I think the key here is for everyone to realize that workplace dealings, especially the field you mention, are artificial for the most part. Had a boss who was a hard ass, a man, he was what I think society deems an “alpha male.” Made a few men cry, but they respected him and got the job done. Outside of work though, like during happy hours, sweetest man ever. I have had slightly flirty exchanges at work where both parties left with a bit more of a spring in their step, and the key there was recognizing that it was just fun banter…No expectations because it’s work. However, when it came time for reviews and deciding who got raises, my positive exchanges were enough to get my name mentioned in the discussion. 

With that said though, I keep hearing about a sizable group of men who don’t get much attention, so I can see how this sort of workplace politicking could be harmful for them. …I’m not sure there’s a solution to it though because humans will human.

When a woman flirts in that scenario, she’s not actually interested in pursuing the man and won’t harm him or his company if he doesn’t welcome it. Most men, also, welcome it. That’s why it works so well.

When a man (who is the client) flirts, he is actually pursuing the woman herself, not any benefits for himself or the company. There is a real drive there, and it instantly makes a woman uncomfortable because she doesn’t know how he would react if she didn’t return the interest or rejected him. Would he make her lose her job? Would rejecting him lose him as a customer? Hell, he could even stalk her. In worst cases, get violent.

That’s the difference right there. If a man rejects the woman’s advances, 9.9 times out of 10 nothing happens. He just didn’t take the bait. If a woman does.. you don’t know what can happen. That’s what make it feel so high-stake and uncomfortable.",Izzetinefis,t2_96ok23nq,1,0,reddit2

i can only say( with respect) the lack of awareness of what they do is not entirely true

I believe many know what they do is wrong, but they justify it for many reasons( usually enabled by various groups in society).

The article shows a person committing emotional abuse and then calling it emotional labour, along with controlling behaviour.

It doesn't matter if you acknowledge it because you are not going to doing anything about it, or if you do, you would only change your behaviour for a very short period before  slipping back into bad behaviour.

&#x200B;

I'm more concerned about the slippery slope this has led to, especially that 2nd link you provided.

That kind of abuse( and yes it is abuse) leads to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse when they realise that they can't get the kind of fear response they want from you and then psychological abuse. I consider psychological abuse to be far worst because its the one that is hardest to pinpoint and the longest lasting( sometimes leading to indirect death through mental health, depression and suicide).

maybe the worst part of all of this is the double standards that are applied to people based on their gender by letting women off the hook for their behaviour, but somehow men are monsters if they do this( I don't believe it is acceptable for anyone regardless of gender).

This has a very detrimental effect on society, and we only have to look at the legal system to see how my damage it does to men,women and their children.

fathers very often have little choice but to accept all the abuse in its various forms or to risk never seeing their children again( even when they become adults you will lose them)

There are women complaining that their spouses are lazy, and thinking that applies to all men. There are men complaining that their spouses are abusive, and thinking that applies to all women. Can we just acknowledge that a certain percentage of people in general suck, and that this isn't a male or female thing?

The emotional labor argument can be a real thing. Sometimes there are couples where the man expects the woman to do all of the cooking, cleaning, planning, etc. when they're both working full time jobs. Those are reasonable expectations for a stay at home mom, but not for someone who works the same number of hours. Those women are rightfully upset at the men who refuse to do their share.

And sometimes it's the opposite, a man doing his part but a woman who doesn't do her share or endlessly nags her spouse because nothing is ever good enough... and occasionally those women claim to be the ones being wronged because they're doing ""emotional labor"" of being a never satisfied control freak. But that doesn't mean the first scenario never happens.

h41kvai,t3_odi2ma,2021-07-04 17:35:37,MensRights,"I think there’s a disconnect here between what women are saying regarding emotional labor, and how it’s being interpreted here. Emotional labor in general is a pretty broad term, but it encompasses a variety of different soft skills which are easy to overlook.

While it can seem as though nothing is enough, that’s not really true. Think of it this way, a relationship is a house, and each person involved helps to build the house, working together on the foundation, individual rooms, and so on. The things that go into building this house can be just about anything you do as a couple, whether it’s dates, lunch, chores, meeting with friends, watching Netflix, making decisions together, etc. So when the term emotional labor is used, it usually means some kind of imbalance which either wasn’t agreed upon or hasn’t been addressed is going on while constructing this house. For example, a woman planning a Mother’s Day outing for her mother might find the number of tasks between deciding where to go, what to get, what to make for dinner, etc. overwhelming, especially if there isn’t much time do so. This is where her partner could make her life significantly easier, whether it’s in the physical tasks of preparing the day or the emotional/mental labor of planning parts of the day. While it may not necessarily be “your job”, it clearly demonstrates interest and engagement with both your partner, their family, and the relationships that your partner has with their mother.

We can extend this into everyday living with your partner, whether you’re building your house with a date, a dinner, lunch, meeting with friends, all of it requires some amount of planning, most of which can be fairly open ended(“What should I make”, “What should I wear”, “Where should we go”, “What should we watch”, etc.). If you’re in a relationship where your partner is making most of those decisions, then over time it’s going to come off as though your partner is doing most of the labor to build the house, while you’re just enjoying the scenery.

I don’t want to discount the fact that, inevitably, emotionally abusive women exist, in the same vein that emotionally abusive men exist. But by jumping to categorize all women, or most women, as one thing or the other, we lose their perspective and don’t get to appreciate the nuances between people that make each of us who we are. A little empathy can go a long way in understanding where exactly many women are coming from whether they’re frustrated about emotional labor, or another uncomfortable experience they’ve had. 

Hopefully all that makes sense, feel free to message me with any other questions though.",allyeet,t2_42osunau,-4,0,reddit3

Edit: You should probably use those cRiTiCaL tHiNkInG skills everyone always preaches about in these manosphere subreddits to consider The Federalist is a right-wing rag, and that your post is making several fallacious assumptions to paint women with a broadstrokes mentality that will do you more harm than good. You made some very tenous hypothetical scenarios to portray a ""bitchy"" and abusive woman and sloppily applied terms like ""emotional labour"" to this strawman argument that I do not quite understand, other than it sounds very similar to a very hyperbolic and toxic mentality of ""NiceGuy"" or ""NotLikeTheOtherGirl"" types. Perhaps a controlling woman is controlling, but that doesn't make things like ""emotional labour"" an oppressive tool that *every woman uses* in some conspiratorial end to what, erode your sense of self worth and masculinity? This term can also be referred to as emotional intelligence and it isn't necessarily an exact science or measurable trait so much as a practiced quality of individuals' personalities and an area of psychology. To have a high degree of self-awareness or be a high self-monitor might mean lower neuroticism or higher conscientiousness and other big five O.C.E.A.N traits that might describe emotionally competent people.

One bone I have to pick with your post is your framing of that bazaar post in a very dubious light. The sentiment of the article of ""Women Aren't Nags - We're Just Fed Up"" is that an incredulous partner ought to pick up the slack in what today is a more equitable world anyway. It's a very childish mentality to think women in domestic partnerships today asking for a thoughtful gift like a house cleaning service for a day is somehow an indication of being an abusive woman. How about the schlubby husband who's too cheap to want to do that but instead do it himself (maybe poorly) or buy something else to appease a very simple need? How about the front facing roles women are often relegated to in the workforce still today (bUt wHy dOn'T tHeY jUsT gO iNtO STEM?) have to deal with disproprtionately more emotionally draining people in their services, all while being ""nice"" or a ""bitch"" if she shows any dip in emotional job intelligence of her own? And then when she returns home from work and her husband is too incredulous to have that understanding, it sounds like yeah, maybe he *is* a bit of a dud. All of your post oozes some angry frustration that women don't know their place, and if not, I'm all ears given my unfair generalizations must be the only ones in this thread.

.1. ""Emotional labor"" is just a shit test BS term. Ignore it or agree and amplify it into ridiculous levels. 

.2. Why are you doing chores trying to please her? No seriously, why? I can think of 3 reasons.

a. You want her to be happy because then she'll give sex. **Answer**: Doing chores will never impress her in a fashion that makes her want to have sex, full stop, if that is your only reason just stop now.

b. You feel guilty because she is berating you about things you haven't done. **Answer**: Clean up your shit before she has a chance to talk to you about it, own your mess and be an adult. If you are already doing this but she doesn't give you even 5 minutes to clean up after yourself before then she doesn't respect you and this is just a symptom of other relationship problems.

Why are you ""helping"" around YOUR house? This is your house, whatever you do isn't helping her, it's your God damn house. Even if she is on the deed/lease too, that just means it's half hers as well. Change your mindset immediately. You aren't helping her, you're helping yourself.

c. You've been slacking and you feel the need to announce it when you actually do something. **Answer**: See the above. be an adult. Hold her to the same standards you set yourself.

.3. If any of the above is true, fix yo shit. You don't have to listen to her complain, but her complaining is just a symptom of relationship problems that she doesn't know how to fix, and really only you can fix them. 

Men and women aren't equal when it comes to, well nearly everything besides civil rights (really not there either, women currently have more civil rights).


.4. (SITUATIONAL) If she is a stay at home type while you work, why are you doing anything again? Unless she is working from home or raising multiple children of YOURS, you need to be clear with her on her expectations and delegate that to her. Be a leader and tell her what to do if she isn't doing it.


99% of this is fixed just by you being a proactive leader in the relationship instead waiting around for her to complain. Being a proactive leader will have the side benefit of making her panties moist too, so it's a win win for both of you.

And a lot of these guys are in their 50s and 60s and lose their sex drive...so they don't give a shit about women but would rather make male friends and i see guys in their 60s start to make male friends they haven't had in 3 decades.

So I started taking over the management of all these tasks. Until I just ran out of steam for all the remembering.

I was getting phone calls every hour - where is this? How do I do that? I am frustrated at the pets or children, what day is the dentist etc etc. I just needed him to sort it out. I literally did not have the bandwidth to made end of life decisions for my mum snd help him solve the problem by calling the dentist and asking. When he travels for work - which is frequent and for long periods I just have to sort it out and manage life. I go away for four weeks and I still have to help him mange - at his request.

I understand it's a problem to have a nagging controlling partner. I know it can make you feel like some domain of everyday life just isn't your own because they're acting like they own it.

But the man in the story sounds like he doesn't consider household chores his obligation. When he does them, he feels like he's ""helping out."" He feels like he should be told what to do. Should grown adults be told to wash the dishes or do the laundry or are those basic things just expected of everyone? And then he complains he can't read her mind because he wasn't told to do a normal everyday chore that everyone should just do.

Of course, the situation is different if she's not working and he is. Or if they have some agreement on who does what and he does his own fair share, but then she expects more.

But the way it was written makes it sound like the men feel virtuous or helpful for doing basic things they'd be doing anyway if they lived alone.

Again, if they were made to feel that way by a controlling woman who always considers herself a manager of the household, but then gets mad when others start expecting her to be, I get that. But I'm not sure from OP whether that's the case or whether the man didn't do his fair share to begin with.

EDIT: Or even if he did his fair share, did he consider that as a favor to the woman because he thinks of it as her responsibility somehow.

As far as why men are more often told to empathize, while I’m no expert and havent educated myself in women and gender studies, as I understand it boils down to a very large set of historical and cultural trends between 1-3rd wave feminism and the long standing historical status of women who’ve generally had less economic, social, and political power than their male peers. So what’s expressed today is generally a reaction both to those historical developments, and to those individuals in someone’s life who demonstrate a lack of empathy or interest in engaging their partner, with the affirmation of others who’ve experienced similar circumstances of disengagement.

Regarding the “oppression olympics”, that has to do more directly with what I mentioned above with men historically holding the majority of economic, social, and political power, and oppression typically operates from those who have more power against those who have less, but that is not to say anything of someone’s individual circumstances. Individually and interpersonally we’d need to get back into the nuances of someone’s personal life, not necessarily to “out-oppress” someone else, but to understand who they are as a person, because obviously broad generalizations inevitably hit walls when reaching individuals, and that nuance can easily be lost when talking about historical and systemic trends.

The house if fine being it whatever condition it finds itself in, it is the people in the house who have the problem.

If there is such a thing as ""emotional labor"" to begin with, in a partnership the degree to which it is shared must be agreed upon...just like every other shared resource or liability in the relationship.

People have different standards and tolerances for the conditions in a household. I have no problem letting the pre-rinsed dishes stack up in the drying rack until there is enough to run a load, but my wife insists the ""correct"" place for them is in the dishwasher.  Am I an immature partner because I don't do it her way?

My wife likes to let (clean) laundry pile up around her part of the bedroom rather than put it in away. I like to put my stuff directly into the closet and dresser. Is my wife immature because she refuses to put her laundry ""away"" like I do?

Problems like this occur when people have different expectations about a shared experience, and do not effectively communicate it with one another. 

To me, a better definition of ""emotional labor"" is the work required to overcome the differences that present themselves in the daily lives of people committed to live with one another.",TheSpookyCat,t2_azxi1,9,0,reddit3

I will not agree or disagree about the situation being hyper specific, but this is a common enough occurrence to talk about.

The point I'm trying to make is that there I massive differences between ""emotional labor "" and poor communication. And I think you get that, but I think it's important the the misuse of a concept by people does not invalidate the concept as a whole.

What I'm trying to get at here is the focusing on why the term exist, when feminist we talking about the idea of the ""second shift"" and emotional labor, it come from a place where we as a society view the work that men and women do as inherently equal.

This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side. I think it is a sign of a healthy relationship where you know what your partner wants, and I think it's natural to want a partner who understands you. It almost seems like your saying ""women are expecting a level of intimacy on to a relationship that is just not present"" which is fair but is def a case by case issue.

>This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable

Yes, in a relationship you do not talk AT your partner, you talk to them and with them to problem solve together. Nagging is after decades of being together and still being able to focus in what's important to maintaining the relationship. Women should not be nagging men because in a general sense men are working a lot of hours and so may not be 100% when getting home or even on a day off. And this comes to the next pint of your quote,

>. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side.

This should never be a full on expectation. I expect my partner to do basic tasks and handle responsibilities, the ""mind reading"" aspect is something that only happens after long-term commitment and truly being able to work through issues. Relationships can be fun but they are work and a lot of people (mainly women) seem to not understand this, and if they do they want to have it as easy as possible.

Some of the issues we're seeing here in regards to emotional labor is its invisible and outright dismissal. Take for example OP post, the idea that ""planning stuff"" is framed as not really work. When it most certainly is, we literally have whole occupations for this, secretaries. So when these issues are brought up and discussed it is important to realize, it's not just about the work being unequal, it that the work is unequal, and we don't even realize how unequal it is.

That is not to say men don't ever do anything that women don't recognize, but I think it is important not to dismiss trying to be more open about the rolls people play. Often times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

Like imagine we we at a job together, and I was venting to you about how hard I work, and how I get no help from other staff members, and your response was, well I work hard too, sometimes harder! It just comes off as tone deaf and not really solving the problem. 

I do think we should be more open about the work and effort men put into a relationship, talking about things that are taken for granted. like men being forced into leadership roles in the relationship. If mens rights issues are to be taken seriously>!!< that's what should be done. But, it can't come at the cost of attacking women's issues, issues that historically and even currently in some areas, have been silenced.

Many fathers come home and don't outsource their duties unless they have to whether because of time, parts etc. And most guys are willing to split the load even if they are tired from work, even if they just finished with cars, sports, lawn work this that and the other It's not accurate and these women don't even mention what their husband's do for work in these posts. I'm not throwing a pity party but understand that men don't just leave the house to fool around and then come home.

> times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

I understand but part of the reason is that a lot of women today hold high standards and expectations of men to do a lot for a job. Then on top of that they need help with house work. Men have to do a lot because of womens standards of men today.

I do believe we need to be more open about these issues but there won't be true equality because we will always have to pull weight more in some areas vs others. Does this mean men should be slobs and careless no. I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age.

Let me put it another way, I don't care to get a laundry list of what each person does and compare the two. I think it's honestly reductive and ultimately unhelpful in the grand scheme of things. What I do care about is talking about the things that one or the other don't know is happening, or how much work it actually is. 

I already know the wife does the cleaning, and the husband mows the lawn. Why should we talk about things we already know? Why not focus on the thinks that are not very apparent, like how stressful it can be constantly have to keep track of everything in the house, how hard it can be to maintain a calendar, or the checkbook. Most people take for granted the idea that these things happen and are easy, but they're not and can be a burden. Where as mowing the lawn, I know hard and time consuming that is.

> I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age. I would like to hear your thoughts on this.

You talk alot about cars and mowing the lawn, but you realize these are things that happen once a week at best. Realistically Most care stuff is once every 3 months at best. And that's assuming that a man is doing that. Depending on your income bracket it's not all that strange to take your car in for an oil chang instead of doing it yourself ect. Where as dishes and cooking are done every day, cleaning is an ongoing process, and keeping track of appointments and what you have is constant.

Like again I really don't want to compare and contrast here, but when we are talking about emotional labor, saying men do thing once every so often vs the constant burden of maintaining a household it will come off as shallow. To use an analogy women are put in to role of manager and work, while men just get to be worker. When talking emotional labor, women want men to take some of that Manger role.

Like we live in a world where men and women almost work jobs almost just as much. Especially if there are no children it's pretty rare for a couple where 1 is full time and one is stay at home. Why should we hold to a standards of a time where that was the case?",xlem1,t2_hxwv6,1,0,reddit3

This is the office that sets the agenda for which issues of sexism get addressed, and controls the dynamic our government sets as standard in terms of gender power relations.
In terms of who is responsible for what, it's far more reasonable to suggest we're a matriarchy than a patriarchy.
It's also worth noting that this office, 2/3rds women (who are paid more than their male counterparts, and that this trend is escalating), is the same office that refuses to countenance mens issues being on the agenda, and routinely pushes a doctrine that erases mens issues.

Notably, they also tend to push for more women in areas in order to achieve equality, but not more men in several professions, including their own office. Their pay gap also suggests that the culture of this particular office is slanted in womens favor, and I remind you, this is ultimately the office that sets the stage for how gender power dynamics are addressed and refined. Crucially, they also tend to push the idea misandry doesn't exist. No shit they think that, barely any of them experience it.

My suggestion would be to balance the numbers by explicitly hiring enough mens advocates to bring the ratio to 50/50, which would still leave then underrepresented, but more represented.

To call us a matriarchy seems more apt than calling us a patriarchy using the kind of feminist logic that would bee similar to calling a government environmentalist, when every single position in the environment agency was given to and held by climate change deniers who set policy according to that belief.

Mens issues not getting a fair hearing is almost certainly due in part to this institutions bias and lack of diversity, causing them to set an agenda that ignores mens experiences and issues.

Since this institution is the one that sets the agenda for gender relations, I'd call it matriarchal.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,6,0,reddit4

Men can't really approach that problem any other way then ignoring women silently. Its a damned if you do and damned if you don't kind of thing. 

While im very aware that feminism is about women's issues, the thing is just that when we are talking 'about equality between the sexes' then *that* is somehow the thing that feminism stands for. Feminism doesn't champion equality between the sexes, it wants every by them perceived 'privilege' enjoyed by men in society while at the same time refusing to let go or even look at their own privileged position within society.

The problem that is described isn't so much that men are ignoring women in the workplace, the problem is that men in the workplace don't feel safe enough to engage with these women. There just is no upside for men to engage women in their workplace, most of the time they'll just get called in to do the shitty jobs that the women refuse to do. Whenever this female colleague decides that something the male colleague said was offensive to her, he'll get scorned at the very least and could be out of a job at worst.

Of course we should continue to spread awareness though whenever possible, despite the attacks.  

The only effective response I can come up with is simply non-compliance.  Don't help women, don't talk to women, don't hire women, do not be friends with women.  Foster strong male relationships.  Spend time with your father, with your brothers.  Create male bonds.  Start male groups for hiking/camping/fishing/hunting.

They will only respond when male absence is strongly felt.   When no one shows up to help them change that tire, lift that sofa into the house, fix that broken door etc.  They don't care one bit for our statistics of male suicide, our cogent explanations of why the family court devastates men etc.  They just don't care.

But their reaction sadly proved my point. Denial of problem and anger towards men...

So what can men do?

1. If you are falsely accused - don't apologize. Trying to be nice, calm and appease is the biggest mistake. They have not much proof, until you acknowledge any wrongdoing. Even if you think you didn't do anything really bad, your words will be perverted and used against you. Now you seem guilty and people who could sympathize you won't help you.

2. If you are aware of a colleague being accused without proof and have at least some reasons to believe him, side with him. This may damage you, but silence is worse. You might be next.

3. Don't alienate all women. Cutting off social contacts with women is not giving you much security, but makes you look bad and in the same time powerless - connections are power. There are plenty decent women. Make friends with them. If you are in danger, they might protect you. Still, you should be very careful, sociopathic and sexist women are dangerous and it is important to understand who is who.

galw6b4,t3_jkut2w,2020-10-30 15:24:44,MensRights,"Yes, this fear is real and it sucks. We should listen to men and hear out concerns.

It seems to me this is similar to (albeit a bit aged) concerns of men falling into infidelity at the work place. Some men would use guidelines/rules to prevent it. Think of Mike Pence-he gets slammed in the media for his rules round what he can and can’t do and where he can and can’t be with women. He doesn’t eat alone with women, for example. 

He gets slammed for this in part because it is assumed that he does eat alone with other men-and that’s how this “hurts women.” It’s not necessarily that there are restrictions - it’s that the restrictions apply specifically to women and not to men. I don’t think Mike Pence’s rule in itself is bad. Marriage is hard. The troubling part it it’s only limiting for women.

I think there are lots of gender neutral ways to address this, some of which we’ve already seen, such as clear glass panels/windows into offices so there is privacy of conversation but both parties can be seen. Encouraging work lunches rather than happy hours/dinner, so there is a return to work after the meeting. Setting up a mentor program with guidelines. Only meeting up after work hours in groups. Paper trail showing consensus on when and where and how long to meet...etc.

A workplace is supposed to have the workers feel safe or make it easier for them to live with that fear there.

gao2kz6,t3_jkut2w,2020-10-31 03:28:00,MensRights,"There are several ways to mitigate this problem:

 -  Character.  How you behave over time gives others an impression of who you are, and how you are likely to act.  If you constantly push the envelope, or get involved in controversy, people will be less likely to vouch for you when someone points the finger at you.  Same goes for keeping your nose clean.  I have written character references for people who I've known for years, and trust, and others did the same, and it saved them.  On the contrary, I refused to do so for someone who had many problems over the years, and would always antagonize while never quite crossing the line, but one day, it finally got the best of him.  Your reputation speaks volumes.

 - Mitigate time periods where you are alone with someone without a witness.  This is especially true for those you don't know, those who act/dress provocatively, or have questionable work ethic.  

   - Get a feel for those you don't know to build their character.  For the actions/clothing, if a woman is being overly flirtatious, or dressing/make-up like she's going on a date/social gathering more than she's dressing for work (how do I put it... making ""heads turn""), it could be to bait people into bad situations to be able to push a harassment button.  As for the poor work ethic, when they know the walls are closing in and their job may be in jeopardy, they may be looking for a way to save it by making harassment accusations.  Don't be the one that gets caught up in that.

 - Lastly, the most difficult is dealing with those who have a rap sheet of filing sexual harassment complaints.  Like the one who overhears an off-color joke or comment, and she made a bee-line up the chain of command to HR to snitch instead of handling it ""at that level"".  Someone set something down next to her, and accidentally bumped her butt; stuff like that.  We all know the difference between snitching, and not.  Someone who has done this (snitched) is more likely to do it again, and they are also likely to play the ""being blackballed, ostracized, etc."" card, when people are wary of this person for these reasons.  It can be difficult to maintain professionalism around these types, and you should avoid being alone with them or doing certain tasks that require physical contact that could be in compromising positions.  If it is unavoidable, bring this up with a supervisor alone, and if that doesn't work, address it in public.   ""Hey, I don't feel comfortable working just 1-on-1 with (name) due to pass misunderstandings.  I require a more open setting, or need more people assist with this task?"".

Lastly, it shouldn't be some political battle or an ""us vs. them""/ male vs. female sort of thing.  People who have got caught up in bad situations view it more cynically, and rightfully so.  Most of the time people are good to each other, and in the instances they aren't, we need to be vigilant and protect ourselves.",XiJinpingPoohPooh,t2_8ljiqqjk,1,0,reddit1

Be careful... right there with just that one sentence and nothing that followed, you already showed sexism in the minds of many.  Even this sentence shows sexism to many: 'My job at work isn't to make people feel better.'  By discounting feelings as anything less than crucially important to your job, many feminists will argue that you are being male-centric, and insensitive since it is a ""male characteristic"" to value facts and raw performance over feelings.  Sadly, I have to deal with this attitude all the time in my work.  

I work in academe, but the infection of this sort of thinking is spreading outside of academe.  Our basic hope at this point is that it will suffer a sort of negative natural selection halting the spread before it reaches too many of the societies more vital functions.  Normally this would happen naturally since since such thinking intrinsically embraces attitudes and approaches that don't work.   But I'm increasingly not optimistic for the patient's survival.  The parasites who embody this sort of thinking seem to be able to evade normal immune responses that organizations mount against people working against the organization.  The mechanism for this immune evasion seems to be linked to a complex system of virtue signalling that allows parasites to pretend to be normal employees until their numbers are high enough to effect a local take-over of some sub-tissue or department of the organization.  At that point the infection is able to change policies and practices to match their habitat preferences and also to more overtly pressure out non-parasite employees to consolidate control.",Lucretius,t2_4341,30,0,reddit1

Oddly enough, men ignoring advances of women is a biggest motive of false allegations. Women can't take No for an answer and retaliate with lies. This thread has lots of examples.

So, of course if you cut all the contacts with the rest of society and never leave your room, you are safe. But it is hardly a solution. If you develop your self, live - there will be women around you. If you are single and really investing your time into developing yourself, making career - you'll be attractive. If you ignore women, trying to pursue you - this puts you at risk, because women may be offended by rejection.

gao3rfy,t1_gam8sj2,2020-10-31 03:41:53,MensRights,"Men should not be forced to interact with people who have the levels of in-group bias women have.

It is entitlement to say men should mentor women simply because if men don't, womens careers will suffer. Maybe if that is the case, women should become more appealing mentorees instead.

On treating them the same, that's largely the point. Womens in group bias and warped perspective makes that impossible and they often refuse to come to terms with this. There's studies out there showing women perceive a lack of favoritism for women as hostility to women. They are literally not capable of understanding what equality looks like.

(As an example, if you gave both a man and a woman 5 dollars, the woman would see this as misogyny. Rarely would they in such a blatant example because the cognitive dissonance would be too great even for them. But that gives you the idea. Instead, the woman would expect 7 dollars to the mans 3, and she genuinely believes this is equal treatment. This attitude pervades all their interactions with men because it has not been confronted and because women are willfully ignorant of it by clinging to feminism).

So if you want ""Men and women treated the same""? That's what is happening. Men would not want to associate with or mentor men who behave the way women do.

Insisting men mentor women anyway and ignore all this is yet another example of women demanding they face no consequences for their behavior.

Suppose we forced women to mentor men who were just openly misogynistic all the time and threatened to fire the woman if she didn't. That would be what we call a ""Hostile work environment"" now wouldn't it, and it would be something they could sue the company over.

It is unreasonable to expect men to tolerate a hostile work environment merely because women need them to tolerate it or they'll be worse off. If women are capable of changing, they should change and become better people so that men will associate with them again. If women aren't capable of changing, that's a big can of worms to open.

But we won't know until we start punishing women for behaving this way, and one way of doing that is to harm their careers.

The level of normalized misandry and gynocentrism in women makes associating with them a toxic environment for men. We should not be forced to do it in the workplace, and that is why men are opting out of doing so.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,2,0,reddit1

> If you look at appalling behaviors committed by members of each sex, men aren't very appealing either now, are they? At least a woman isn't going to come shoot up the workplace if she gets fired.

This is a typical expression of gynocentrism that deflects criticism away from women, as usual, and thus ensures they never improve. 
You're also taking an outlier and applying it to men, whereas I am discussing a fault with women as a group where the fault is the norm, and the positive exception is the outlier.

It's you acting like ""This jar contains pure alcohol and one drop of water, and is thus equivalent to the jar that contains pure water and a drop of alcohol."".

Finally it ignores that one major reason for mens violence is the lack of societal and institutitonal support for them, whereas the reason for womens in-group bias and entitled attitudes is decades of supremacist propoganda.

> And, the research on women's in group bias that I've seen is old and hasn't been replicated that I know of. I've looked for it.

It's been replicated dozens of times, but I was referring also to the study by Amy Yeung.

> If the work environment mentors people, then the people that work there need to be mentored. End of. How do you mentor the men and not mentor any of the women?

Quite simply. By recognizing you do not have to subject yourself to a toxic workplace environment.

> But it should be able to be done in a way that leaves all employees feeling safe. That's not impossible.

Let me know when women are being instructed on how to be better MRAs and taking it on board instead of lashing out about it.

> There are going to be men who don't think a vagina makes a person duplicitous. They can mentor.

I wouldn't exactly call it duplicity, that would require conscious intent, but i'll address your overall thrust;
More fool them. It's precisely the treatment of these kind of men that leads others to abandon this position over time and the isolating of women in the workplace to be normalized. It does not take long for men to figure out that women telling men ""Treat me like an equal"" is not what women actually want, but that they want special treatment and concessions, and not only that, but are vitriolically hostile to it being noted and pointed out. As such, women will be mentored only by men willing to adhere to those demands and subject themselves to a toxic workplace environment, as well as men who mistakenly believe women want to be treated equally and who then face hostility and possible litigious behavior from women convinced they are being discriminated against when that man actually does treat them like an equal. (Again, see the Yeung study).

> It would be an excellent reason to promote more women, so there will be female mentors available.

What makes you think men would be keen on having more women as bosses if they're toxic enough that even having them as employees is a burden?

Because it would be good for women? Why should men care? ""White supremacists don't have enough of the economy under their control, we need to be nicer to them and help them out more."". Um... No? This is the entitled attitude i'm talking about. You seem unwilling to consider that perhaps women simply don't deserve the thing you're asking because of how women think and behave. You are not owed solidarity when you offer none in return.

> But if the company discriminates, I support the women that work there taking them to the cleaners.

You're failing to deal with the point that women outright expect discrimination in their favor and are not capable of understanding that equal treatment is not discrimination against them. We've studied it. As I said, you're being treated equally. If men behaved the way women do, men would not mentor men either. That's not discrimination. It would be discrimination to say ""Well because it's a woman doing it, I should ignore it."".

> And, please, you don't seem to like or respect women very much. So, kindly keep yourself safe by not ever mentoring or supervising any woman.

This is an example of what i'm talking about. You are not capable of understanding that not receiving preferential treatment in your favor is not the same as treating you unfairly. You should read the Yeung study, it might make you question why you assumed I don't like or respect women, because that's exactly what the study lays out, that when women receive the same treatment as men, they think that means the person doesn't respect them and hates them.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,2,0,reddit1

They have this twisted, distorted world view is due to one of two possible ways of growing up. One being with not a-lot of hard-ship and being told fairy tales about how the world should be through movies, cartoons, etc. The second one being the opposite, growing up in minor to moderate hardship (example being growing up with only one parent, possibly with a couple other siblings and never turning to crime and struggling occasionally with things that life throws at you, which makes the person believe that they should 'get a break' when it comes to work, also mostly due to the media that's been popularized thanks to ""The American Dream"". Granted both of these childhood varients might not give a person this twisted world view, but there's a chance of it. This lack of hardship that might break  a weaker person creates the world view that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter because either A) ""THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE! THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN ALL MY LIFE!"" or B) ""I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING ALL MY LIFE, NEVERMIND THE PERSON STARVING ON THE STREET, THE PERSON WITH HEALTH ISSUES THAT MAKE HAVING A NORMAL LIFE MUCH HARDER, I'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH!

""In Study 1, I manipulated the target’s gender and responses on a
subscale of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (high HS, low HS, high BS, or low BS). The low BS male
target (compared to high BS male target) was judged to be higher on HS, less supportive of female
professionals, less good of father and husband, and more likely to perpetrate domestic violence. Ratings
of the low BS male target were as equally negative as those of the high HS male target.  ""

I.E, if you go around saying women are outright inferior and stupid, but give them preferential treatment on the basis of them being ""Useless"" and ""Needing"" it, women will think you are equally sexist to someone who actually treats women like equals. Because what women *think* equality is, is receiving a bunch of privileges and special treatment while being praised for it instead of denigrated.

(See principle-agent games to understand why. The distance between equal treatment and what women want (privilege) is equal to the distance between what women want (privilege) and hostile patriarchal attitudes. From their standpoint of wanting 0, there is a difference of 1 in both directions, so they cannot perceive a difference. Women, acting as principle, judge both egalitarian and traditionalist men as equally bad for their desired goal, which is retaining sexism against men and female privilege while removing any of the downsides.).

Womens brains have been completely fried by decades of gynocentric propoganda on the topic and their perspective is completely broken.

So for some combination of these reasons, you are going to treat women radically differently than you treat men in the work place. You are saying this is equality, because if men were acting similarly badly you would respond to men the exact same way. In addition, women are going to respond to discrimination as though it’s discrimination but they will be wrong. Because it’s actually their being treated as equals for once. Do I have this right?  

Having in group bias is not the same as having out group hostility.  

And I think you show bias yourself. Women are all equally fried. But men don’t all share some of the characteristics that lead men to overwhelmingly commit violence. Each man is a unique individual who has reasons for his acting out. Whereas for women it’s their nature. 

And, this reminds me of an essay I recently read. Where in certain areas, men are seen as bumbling their way into unfortunate circumstances while women scheme and plot. Headlines of a recent case in the UK. He didn’t mean to strangle her, it just happened while he was trying to pull her out of a car. Whereas the headlines noted, she was going to inform his wife about their affair. This “provocation” reduced the charge to manslaughter. 

So he fumbles his way into murdering someone, she was scheming to get him in trouble. Which on some level justified his response. What happened wasn’t a “kerfuffle”. 

So we all have to be aware of biases and tropes that influence our thinking. 

As for the rest, of you are the boss or work in a place that doesn’t care, treat women however the hell you want. I doubt many leaders are going to be dumb enough to allow easily proven blatant discrimination in the workplace. So I’m not worried about the venting that’s going on.

That's good. I'm fairly skeptical you'd have handled it well, but it's a step in the right direction from the sounds of it. 

> I’d like men and women to trust and care about each other. 

That would be nice, but it's not within men's power to force women to care about them, and it's not in womens interests to do so because they are a privileged class and beginning to do so would undermine that privilege. The solution is to make womens attempts to retain privilege harm them more than it benefits them, and that's necessarily a hostile stance that involves things like economic boycotts, social derision, isolation in the workplace, not supporting things like Roe V Wade unless LPS is packaged with it, and so on. There has been no liberation movement that didn't adopt that stance prior to succeeding, and recognizing it means recognizing that ""Yes, we are here to hurt women and make their lives worse until they give up their privileges. Once they do, we can begin to forgive them."" is a necessary component of the movement. That is not an atmosphere trust can arise from. The opportunity for women to be decent people has been there for decades and they have refused it at every opportunity, and the manner in which men achieve their liberation is not for women to decide on the basis of what they would prefer.

The civil rights movement, anti-colonial movements and so on were similar. Because womens interactions with men are based on exploitation of men, men should seek to turn those interactions into net losses for women until women capitulate. When the cost of attempting to secure their privilege is higher than the benefits of it, they'll change, and not before hand. It's not a matter of ""We can both have it all"". It's a matter of ""If you insist on stationing troops in our country to force us to extract resources for you, we're going to sabotage the shipments, and those troops still need paying. You'll also need to pay more of them to keep order soon"". That's how Empires fall.

Your cooperative attitude is not one that has ever worked and won't work here because our interests are fundamentally at odds. Women will not benefit from equality, they will substantially lose out. So they have convinced themselves of a bunch of nonsense to try and avoid feeling like awful people for upholding the status quo and entrenching it. Again, the solution is to make retaining their privileges even more costly to them than equality would be, and again, that necessitates hostile actions aimed at worsening their wellbeing, status, and material incomes. 

They call this ""Anti-woman"". In some sense they're right, but that's a separate matter from it being unjust or unequal, they have merely fried themselves with decades of nonsense into not understanding the difference, and because they feel that hostility to women means a thing cannot possibly be good for society or produce good outcomes, as they are largely self-absorbed and gynocentric. ""If it's not good for us, it can't be good for society"" and so on. This is why your cooperative attitude fails. You want us to find a solution that is good for both women and men. There is no such solution. The only trajectory for women is down. That's the consequence of building your livelihoods on exploitation of others and privilege. So attempting to find a ""Solution that works for both of us"" isn't going to work. There is no ""I know we've stolen half of your money, but let's figure out a way for us to both benefit from this situation."".

There's only ""No, you give it back to me, or I shoot you and take all of it."". Women aren't prepared to handle that both because it squarely places the moral blame for their own behavior on their shoulders and they are psychologically incapable of it after having their whole identities based on victimhood, and because it makes them worse off materially (As as I said, they've convinced themselves that these facts alone are enough to say something is evil, because they are selfish) And yet, it is the only way mens liberation can be achieved.

This is seperate from some women accepting this and helping men achieve that goal, however. Some do because they place more value in being a good person than having material and social benefits. That will always be a minority of any privileged class however. The compulsion they have to ""find some way for us both to benefit from this me mugging you situation"" is too strong. It produces farcical self-serving delusions like the white mans burden for colonialism, and feminism for women, lies the exploiting class tell themselves about how their abuses and injustices are for their victims benefit.

I also put it to you that even if a cooperative approach *could* work, men are under no obligation to utilize it (see the Imperial Federation for a colonial example), but women *are* under an obligation to acquiesce to whatever approach men do decide to take. If it is the case that men are now just sick of women and don't like them very much, it's your job to cope with that and nonetheless end the injustices you're doing to men rather than continuing to do them while you try and convince men that if they liked you more the injustices would stop.

If it turns out that the world post liberation is a lot colder and there's less good feelings between the sexes, but still equality, that's an improvement nonetheless and still a victory for mens liberation. We're not required to be your partners if we want a divorce, and if men decide to hate you, you have to cope with that rather than locking them in the basement. You are not entitled to our approval or friendship. We *are* entitled to justice. That can be difficult to come to terms with, i'm aware, but it's still the truth. Ignoring it is just another in the long line of examples of women wanting to avoid responsibility for their own behavior and avoid any negative consequences that arise from it boiled down to a facile example of it; ""Just because i've been an asshole for 50 years, doesn't mean you should dislike me and want a divorce. You're not allowed to dislike me, it makes you a bad person."".

You did concede that men have a right to be angry and it's good, so I should think this would be something you can understand. I'd point out though that i'm not angry, i've moved passed anger into indifference.

This is largely because the values society has have shifted considerably. The attempt at equity (rather than equality) traditionalism provided fulfilled the needs and desires of both sexes for most of human history until the values people held shifted. It's not a matter of women resisting and suffering under the yoke for thousands of years like feminists would have you believe. Once the values changed, it didn't take long for women to demand change and for it to be provided. Meanwhile, men have been demanding change and been ignored. 

You're imagining men lack womens resilience because you're imagining a history that doesn't exist, where women put up with unfair treatment for a thousand years before finally having enough of it, but men can't handle even a few decades of it. The former part of that is based on assuming women in history were basically similar to women today as opposed to having fundamentally different values, chiefly wanting security, stability and so on, and with less use for freedom, equality, self-sufficiency, etc. They weren't suffering under traditionalism, they were supporting it and helping to define how it should look. There are still women with that value set working to try and enforce it. Feminists delude themselves that such women are agents of men or brainwashed as opposed to independent persons with their own preferences and agenda, because to recognize the latter means recognizing there was no ""Oppression"" of women.

Compare/Contrast the one-sided behavior of feminists and the dirth of male support for their agenda.

Using the vote as an example, the reason women didn't have it is that they didn't want it. Not because men were keeping it from them. When women demanded it, they got it, because traditionalism relied on support for an equitable partnership. This reliance on equity has been exploited by feminists to push their demands further and further to the point that mens support has collapsed, and as such I am contending we need to behave more like feminists in order to adjust to the new dynamic rather than continue to hold an equitable view.

You claim you want men and women to work together to come to some form of agreement. What you fail to understand is, that's what traditionalism was. A new agreement based on equality rather than equity would look considerably different to be sure, but that goal has been largely made impossible by the behavior of feminists and the aforementioned ""Nowhere to go for women but down"" issue. 

By turning gender into a conflict, women have placed men into a position where they have no real choice in the matter if they want to be treated fairly but to fight back. You have managed to ""play us like a fiddle"" because many men don't want gender to be a conflict, but it is one anyway. I think this is also revealing of a repugnant mentality of yours that i'd draw comparisons to the appeasement era to. You seem to think that attempts to appease an aggressor make the aggressor strong and the appeaser weak, and that can be a valid view, but it's not a matter of ""Playing them like a fiddle"" more so than one side being drunk on belligerence and the other wishing to avoid conflict. Eventually though, that mentality gets you to a Danzig situation.

> Meanwhile, women are playing society like a fiddle, and you all just can't pull it together.

Well it's good of you to admit it. And as I said, the way to pull it together is to stop trying to appeal to womens reason, understand their interests are fundamentally at odds with ours, that we should stop appeasing their demands and instead accept we are in conflict with them, and so on.

> So, suddenly biology is unfair? Tell me why I should break female solidarity to to stump for LPS instead of laughing my ass off.

I mean, it's good of you to admit you don't care about men or equality.

> I don't think you have any weight to throw around, quite frankly, and have nothing to threaten women with.

And yet you're whining about measures like the OP. What you're not understanding is that your refusal to help us is the status quo, it's not a net loss for us. But if we decide to refuse to help and cooperate with you in return, that causes a considerable loss for you. I'd also note that you claiming we ""have no weight to throw around"" is an admission by you that we lack power under the current dynamic that women have. You also seem to be assuming that mens rights will (or should) be the only civil rights movement in history without a violent contingent, and women should be the only oppressor class in history against whom violent action doesn't occur. Which is folly.

Regardless of mens situation, we still have our bodies to throw around. Even Slaves had something to threaten masters with, and men have more than that. An inevitable consequence of growing consciousness of mens situation and womens complicity and exploitation of it is that some men will decide to use violent means to rectify it, especially if women begin replying in the fashion you have here to the dynamic being noted plainly and honestly. Nothing quite like ""We know we're exploiting you, we're not going to listen to reason, and there's nothing you can do about it"" to convince someone to pick up a pitchfork.

In addition, currently men earn more money than women, but women spend 80% of all money. This causes corporations to skew heavily into pandering to womens mentalities and perspectives, which as we mentioned are misandrist, gynocentric, and so on. A simple action men can take is to simply not allow women to spend their money and to spend it themselves. Transferring that money back to men would mean corporations would have to immediately backpeddle on their pandering to womens delusions of superiority to try and convince them to buy products. This would impact the media we consume and the advertising we see, the initiatives corporations undergo to win good-guy points, and so on. 

There is *plenty* men can do. They just need to be convinced of the dynamic, and they will draw their own conclusions on how to proceed.

> I've made it pretty clear I mean illegal discrimination.

Here's the thing. Words and discrimination require interpretation. If it becomes the norm for men to see nothing wrong with doing this, then that's how they'll interpret it in union tribunals, as judges, and on juries.

> There's no supporting or not supporting a Supreme Court decision. There's only voting parties in that will or won't appoint pro choice judges to the court. That roe v wade is a wedge issue that's been used for political posturing has been going on for decades. Nothing new under the sun.

There's a reason for protesting in support of it, and a reason a lack of male support for those protests would have an impact on their efficacy. Men are aware this is the case because we have experienced the lack of female support for male liberation and how that renders it almost impossible. In many ways the threat to Roe V Wade is emblamatic of the collapse of support for womens issues among the male populace as a result of men coming to terms with the conflict. Your current status and privilege was built upon our cooperation, and if we rescind it, it comes under threat. We don't need to be hostile to roe v wade, we simply have to no longer care about it, and it becomes considerably more at risk from those who seek to overturn it, because they can offer us one cent more than you offer us to achieve their goals and we'll back them on it. This also has the advantage of a forcing a bidding war for mens support. If you want us to back you, give us more of what we want than the people who are your enemies, pretty simple. You can no longer expect appeals to ""being fair to you"" to work, because you have pissed away any good will you had left by refusing to accept that argument when men made it.

A rollback on womens status has basically already begun as a result of womens alienation of male support and their lack of understanding what a growing number of men realize about the dynamic in place. You seem to think just shouting about how you need abortions to be treated fairly will work, because it has in the past, and don't understand men have concluded (rightly) that you aren't interested in fair treatment as a standard, only maximizing your own interests while ignoring mens (See again those studies.), and so men should understand you waffling about fairness not to be a moral argument we should entertain on the basis of a just society, but a plain statement of your own interests. We do not share those interests. Find a different argument, or pay us in what we want.

This is why there's ""Nowhere to go but down."". You need our support. Until now you have had it for free because you felt entitled to it and conflated justice with receiving it, despite not giving it in return. Less men are buying that. A simple game theory example would be the dictator game.

You have demanded 10 dollars and offered 0 continuously while demanding we accept the offer, and we have been. If men begin to reject that offer (Which in the game, forces both players to have 0 points), you are forced to offer at least 9 and 1. Even though this is not equality, it is a worsening of your circumstances and a bettering of mens. 

Your entire attitude seems reliant on the idea that if men withdraw support, women can do so too. You have fundamentally misunderstood the dynamic. You're already not giving us support. Your enmity is not new to us and the open expression of it will only galvanize opposition to you, as I pointed out. One might even say that;

People solved the ""problem"" of sexual dimorphism and vastly different reproductive roles the best they knew how.  Men and women both participated and supported it.

No, women fought for what they got.  Do you think women asked nicely to be free of harassment at work?  And all the men had a moment of clarity, and decided that it wasn't hilarious to grab a secretaries ass?  No women sued.

And the NCFM got the male only selective service ruled unconstitutional.  Men have been successful in stopping universities from offering female only coding camps and things like that.  When you do things like feminists did them, you get what feminists got.  Which is to have people listen to you so they don't end up in court.

> Feminists delude themselves that such women are agents of men or brainwashed as opposed to independent persons with their own preferences and agenda, because to recognize the latter means recognizing there was no ""Oppression"" of women.

Yes, we know women wanted to go to medical school and couldn't.  We know women wanted to sit for the bar and become lawyers and couldn't.  Women don't only have free agency when they are choosing to follow traditional values.  All women, whether they marry a red pill dude, or become lesbian separatist, are making their choices.  

> When women demanded it, they got it, because traditionalism relied on support for an equitable partnership.

Yes, they just snapped their fingers and it happened.  Leaving aside being force fed in prison and throwing oneself under the king's horse.

An agreement is entered into when everyone has equal power and equal options.  Now, I'm not one to say all family was patriarchal and bad.  That's ridiculous.  When it works, it's from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

Sure, start taking over the chore of going to the grocery store and being responsible for buying for a family.  I mean you could choose to spend it yourself, but women don't do that with the money.  Why the hell do you think it just so happens women spend 80% of a family's income anyway.  And if she works, it's not ""his"" money.

Yes, there's backlash in place but I don't think it's coming from where you think it's coming. It's coming from the far left, who are as misogynist as any on the right.

And, I'm not even sure what your beef is or what you want.  In plain terms. Sorry.

When men hate us they kill us. 

You all need women too.  You have no solidarity or in group caring.  You have empathy for women but not each other.  You kill yourselves and each other. You send each other off to die in stupid pointless wars.  Men send other men down to die in the mines.

Yes Mark Perry is killing it, did over 200 lawsuits and counting, keeps winning... stuff like that is best route for MRA. Marc Angelucci RIP too.

I have wondered if MRA would be better served by sperating MRA from the criqtiquing of feminism as technically they arent even the same thing. This sub isnt pushing mens issues as much anymore and being activist, peititions, lobbies etc. Menslib is so problematic and flawed, but I think it sub members might respond better to campaigns there.

I think the gold standard of how MRA should go about is like this:

And the draft is much less relevant than you make it out to be, because women never served in front-line roles in significant numbers, and they won't start now.

Yeah, if you are hoping that a men's right's movement is going to come from the left, that's a sucky place to be in.  I hate men's lib because they are so condescending to the guys who come there with problems.  It's not a liberation movement's place to educate people about how they are supposed to look at their problems, it's to center the actual problems and center the people who have the problems.

You keep thinking in blank slate ways. The fact is, women have a stronger in-group bias for their own sex, and it's probably biological. Men won't change themselves to be women so that you won't have to tackle hard moral questions.

(Bonus points, feminist theory keeps pushing this blank slate view of human nature that keeps you and other women from even noticing your own biases.)

> We couldn't possibly have just made our case in the courts and before the public and won in the marketplace of ideas. 

You could have, but you didn't. Read about Sokal Squared, for starters. A lot of bell hooks reads like Adolf Hitler, which is not unusual. And a lot of the so-called feminist scholarship is emotionally evocative unrigorous garbage, and it is now fortunately coming out as such. (Your ""trope"" would fit right there.)

> I'll support any org. that's helping men. I'd like more men to being doing things to help each other.

You'll pinch pennies together for men all the while playing a hand in maintaining an unjust system of power that keeps already-available billions away from the most vulnerable of us? You are so generous, lemme go fetch my pedestal. If only people who run soup kitchens didn't have to vote intelligently, or support just laws.

EDIT:

So you will care, but you will also never permit the society to think about issues affecting men systemically on non-feminist terms? No thanks, I'd rather live in a world defined by someone who doesn't care, as long as they aren't quite so blind.

> Why bullshit cuz you think it makes you look better?

**Harassment**
Not going to happen. 'Putting people in alarm or distress' is not going to work because under section two of the Harassment Act 1997 it must be aimed at an individual. Collective harassment requires a closely connected group. Also harassment must involve repeated attempts to contact the members of that group. Just a total non-starter. 

**Hate Speech**
You're going to have a hell of a time arguing that she tried to 'stir up racial hatred' by asking white men to stay away. She didn't insult anyone (as far as I'm aware) and she made no slander against white men. 

**Discrimination** 
'Discrimination' itself isn't a law and, as a charity, they are protected against almost every law designed to to stop discrimination. You'd have another mountain to climb because she didn't explicitly exclude anyone so you'd have to go down some circuitous route of 'she hurt loads of men's feelings so they had felt they couldn't attend' - good luck proving that for a whole group.

I would hesitate to say that any educational advancement is a waste. As Bachelor's degrees become more common, they're becoming the equivalent of high school diplomas for previous generations in terms of hiring pre-requisites. Another school of thought is that the reason for going to University isn't for the education itself, but for the social connections you make there, i.e. ""It's not what you know, it's *who* you know.""

The basic problem with arguing that ""discrimination A"" is justified by thousands of years of ""discrimination B"" is that there are an infinite number of ""historical injustices"" in the historical record. Within the living memory of most of the people on this forum, blacks and gays were discriminated against. In the 1940s, Japanese-Americans were rounded up and put into prison camps. Way back when, Native Americans were systematically destroyed. Even further back, native peoples of Siberia were conquered and marginalized by Russian settlers. Even further back, the Anglo-Saxons systematically wiped out the native Celts of England, and the Romans did the same...on and on, all the way back to prehistory. An infinite number of historical injustices.

So who gets to pick and choose which ones should be corrected? Choose any one of them, and an argument can be made that they should be rectified. It's an arbitrary decision, whichever one you choose.

Regrettably, some people think they've figured this all out for us. They tend to lump every male into the category of ""historical oppressor"" and every female, person of color, differently-abled person, every nonchristian, every gay or bisexual person into the category of ""oppressed"". It helps them to ignore certain inconvenient historical details that could undermine the idea that all men are bad and all women are victims. 

Yes there WAS a Ku Klux Klan women's auxiliary. Yes women nobility in Europe and the Americas DID own slaves. Yes there WERE women camp guards in Nazi Germany. Yes Victorian white women are just as culpable for what was done to Native Americans, Africans and Aboriginal Australians as white men are.

The principle of equal rights and opportunity for all shouldn't be based on the ""historical record"", because the historical record is a dog's breakfast. IMHO, it SHOULD be based on the principle that today, here, right NOW, all human beings are equal, regardless of whatever happened in the past.

When people complain about how women were oppressed you're talking about a man who risks his life and health in a coal mine to pay for a wife who works in her kitchen. The idea is ridiculously narrow minded and shows no grasp of actual history. If you look at the progression of society you see that women chose to work less as quality of life increases. Go back far enough and women are in service, or working in fields. A few decades later they are housewives being paid for.

*All* women have been able to vote since 1928, just 10 years later than *all* men in 1918. Those men got the vote for fighting in the war, the women for working in the factories. For 100 years before that it was related to owning property. The required value of property gradually dropped over time so that 40% of men could vote in 1884. For all of history before this period, nobody voted on anything. The voting thing is a blip in history and yet you never hear about that. Those ten years are treated like they stretch back to people living in caves.

You might bring up that women had few legal rights, thats true because they also had few legal responsibilities. Men were held responsible for women throughout history, if a wife committed fraud, the husband would go to jail.

How is a man in the present responsible for the actions of others from the past? How am I responsible for decisions my great-great grandfather made? I personally refuse to live in guilt for things so far out of my control. If you want to, by all means. 

Let's play for a second that I would feel guilt over the past. I have Native American blood and English blood. So, am I the oppressor or the oppressed?

Now, let's get into a little bit of history. Were you aware that many slave owners taught their slaves to read and write even though it was illegal? Many, if not most slave owners treated their slaves very well. After they gained their freedom, they were free, but for a majority of them life got worse. If you want to look at another group of people that really were mistreated, look at the Irish who drained the swamps in Florida. Or the Chinese who built the railroads.

One last point I would like to present is one that /u/ThePedanticCynic already made but you never responded to. That is the point that affirmative action creates advantages for minorities. The *forced* diversity makes companies hire people that may not be fully qualified, just to keep a number on a spreadsheet within specifications. When you force something like that, everyone loses. I definitely see the value it had 20-25 years ago, but today? It's unnecessary. 

You should look at the demographics for unemployment and college attendance. And one last tidbit for you: [White people won't be the majority for long.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/15/news/economy/minority-majority/)

Regardless, I think the general applicability of freedom of speech assumes some things about the nature of the human race. If people were impossible to trick, then it wouldn't matter. 

It also assumes that people are divided exclusively on ideological boundaries. I think this assumption's effect on what free speech means is subtle. That all tension between peoples can be resolved by *either* party changing their mind. 

You don't have to make this assumption going in, but what I think it means is that protected views are not exclusionary. This would apply to almost all speech, ideologies, religions, etc. What it would *not* protect is ideologies that assert the negation (e.g. I hate you not because of something you believe, but because of something you are).

The fact that what she did was wrong and unbecoming to her position and that it was the literal opposite of her job description has already been established and no one here (with a few exceptions) is arguing that. 

Yeah, people who do bad things should be punished, no doubt. But discussing the validity of some charges and typification of criminal conduct does not constitute an act of bias. It is the basis of justice, being sure that she will be punished for something that she did in a  proper way, no more no less.

In my country at least, although I'm pretty sure UK's legal doctrine follows, a threat must make the victim fell threatened, expect something dangerous to happen to them in the future. 
This didn't happen.

But most important, it is a crime that can only be committed against a specific victim so, I'm sure someone will correct me but, broadly speaking, when a threat is uttered in such way it more closely resembles a hate crime than a simple criminal threat.

So what some of us are offering is that it seems unlikely that she can be successfully sued for threats.

As for the hate crime it's a better possibility but I assure you that both her defense lawyers and the accusation lawyers are going to have a handful in proving their points.

I used to work in a place that did live music, as well as club nights. Women were hired as bartenders straight off the street, regardless of whether or not they had experience, whereas men were only hired as gophers, and had to ""work their way up"" to bartender, which was ridiculous in my opinion since a couple of the girls were straight out of high school. I think that only about two guys got to work as bartenders. The rest of us were fetching boxes of booze, lugging huge plastic bags full of ice around the building cleaning the floor whenever anyone spilt drinks, getting sprayed with garbage juice when we were taking the garbage out. It was before smoking in bars was banned, too, so getting burned by morons dancing with their smokes at arms' length was a common occurrence, too. Oh, and the guys had to climb a big-ass ladder to change the sign that displayed the names of the acts. Potentially risking their safety, for minimum wage.

At the end of each night, when the customers had left, the girls were free to hang about, while the guys had to restock all the fridges for the following day. This building was huge, by the way,  about 8 floors, so all of this was a pain in the ass. I'd leave work at 4am stinking of garbage every night.

The issue here is an unhealthy social norm around women having long hair, there’s no need to criticise this or compare it to men. It’s a relatively unique issue women face (again, specific context and coat around for long hair), ridiculing or undermining the prevalence of social expectations and peer pressure doesn’t seem particularly reasonable given the diverse reality of self-esteem and general body image, and all the unique and separate issues men and women face as a result of toxic beauty standards",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,8,0,reddit3

By who, exactly? One could argue the people ""looking down on"" women are other women. When push cones to shove, guys generally don't really give a shit. Again, anecdotal.

Statistics prove that domestic chores are more equally shared (if not still putting more of the ‘fun / engaging’ ones like playing with their kid on the dad and taking care of the ill for the mum

Statistics prove more women are working part / full time and more men are taking a more active role in the household when compared with the past regarding chores and taking care of children 

Men are now much more easily able to get paternity leave (at least in the UK) and being a stay at home dad is an increasingly tolerated and accepted position for the man in the family 

It’s undeniable that progress has been made

In the last 70 years women have been given the opportunity to be independent within and outside of marriage. This in turn leads to the observable and objective increase in number of women working part / full time, sort of undermining the idea that only men are ever expected to be breadwinners

My school’s reasoning was that girls were supposed to have long hair and wear a specific type of white shirt (I honestly can’t remember what it’s called, but it’s not a regular polo shirt like the boys had) with black, yet see-through stockings in the winter and black socks in the summer, while boys were supposed to have short hair, a black polo shirt, and tan khakis. The boys also couldn’t have a beard or mustache for some reason, which was really weird. Bras were also required for the girls in high school even if they weren’t developed or had medical issues with wearing one. I personally preferred to wear one, but the choice should still be given, especially for medical reasons.

It was all based on sexist stereotypes of how young boys and girls should look. I hated wearing skirts, because my underwear would be visible and I’m just not a skirt type of person (I only wear t-shirts and regular jeans). When I got older, I started wearing shorts underneath, though they technically weren’t allowed. The school said that it was because girls need to look modest, but there’s literally a fetish with school girls in short skirts and stockings, so if anything, regular pants and a t-shirt would have been more modest, in my opinion. Even though I wore my skirt at my knees, the wind from outside or sometimes the shutting or opening of a door would blow it up past my waist, which happened to all of the girls I knew, so many times people could see everything.

I can't emit an option when it comes to bras tho, haven't wear one lol so I will take your word on it.

In my school, skirts should be just a bit below the knee, so pretty long ones (I guess), and girls used to wear shorts underneath them, but they were allowed. Don't get why that wouldn't be, in your case.

What I do thought (and still do) was innapropiate (although being a teen, didn't really complain - because everyone would mock me... And hormones), was the girl's sport uniform. Normally it would be the same shirt than us, and normal pants. However, while we got shorts, they had to use really tight shorts, like leggins, but in shorts.

gv5584i,t1_gv4ywrn,2021-04-19 23:36:24,MensRights,"I’m suggesting that men taking on a more family oriented and domestic role is as an indirect result of the push for women to become more independent 

Since the two don’t commonly co-exist (woman don’t really work full time and doing all the domestic tasks), the growing independence of women encourages equality on both sides, pushing for women to have the option to work and men have the option to do the domestic / child based role 

The overall family dynamic is more personally crafted in a sense, with general feminist ideas trying to deconstruct the traditional ideas of what men and women should do in the family. People are more free to do what they want, and less shamed for doing so, where men and women can personally decide on the main earner and main domestic worker based around income or personal desires rather than having that dictated by traditional ideas about what each gender *should* be doing 

Sure it generally focuses on women and how gender roles limit women’s opportunity, but even if the intentions don’t line up, the end result *in this context* is that feminist criticisms of gender roles in the family have led to more equality for men and women, in the form of wider tolerance of individual freedoms of choice 

It’s not equal yet, tradition still holds power and SAHD will still face criticism from those who think the domestic lifestyle isn’t for men, but that stance is a decreasing minority, and doesn’t undermine how overall the wider tolerance of doing what the family members individually want has been assisted through general feminist notions

Hiring committees now have a diversity and inclusion position which is supposed to help prevent discrimination but often does the opposite.  Some top positions that by the rules should require a job search are simply given to non white men blatantly violating job search protocols.

While some of these positions may go to minority men, even that’s rare and I’ve never seen Asian men considered a minority.   They’re in the same boat as white men.

It’s led to (or comes as a result of) completely normalized sexism (if it’s against men). I had a female colleague say straight to my face in a professional setting that she thinks it’s okay to discriminate against men (The context for this was that someone actually noted how I am the only male in my entire team). It shocked me that she feels safe to say that to my face, especially considering anything the consequences of I said remotely close to that if roles were reversed. 

It was extremely uncomfortable to hear that and, combined with the above mentioned factors, it’s a rather big source of stress in my life knowing my job security and prospects of progressing are severely limited by nothing but my gender.

The part that always bothered me is that we’ve been here as long as any other racial group (SEAs were at Jamestown), we were blown up in train tunnels, prevented from even immigrating to the US for 50 years, went through segregation (in the south, we had to sit in the back of the bus too), put in literal American concentration camps, ridiculed in media, hurt and killed during covid, etc.

This is aside from experiencing Asian family dynamics, which are often built upon gaslighting and physical abuse.

But then, those white liberals who are in charge tell us that we’re “privileged” and “white-adjacent,” and white conservatives tell us that we’re a “model minority” and “good workers” while openly mocking Asian accents on the campaign trail.

How about “all Asians aren’t the same” like you mentioned in talking about socioeconomic disparities in the Asian community? That would be much better than the above platitudes.

Despite the fact that we aren’t all the same, 90% of women of all other races and 40% of **Asian** women reject us Asian guys for the horrific crime of existing as Asian males.

More important, we are notably the only racial group where a leading cause of death in our younger Asian brothers is self-deleting.

They basically succeeded their way into failure.

Asians in American have gone a similar route.  Bluntly put, you'd reached the point of being ""white""- at least for social and economic purposes- and that threatened the hucksters whose meal ticket depended on a massive bulwark of racism dominating the cultural zeitgeist, so things were twisted until being seen as white became a bad thing.

My great-grandparents, who came here from Ireland back before the Irish, too, became white, lasted into my teenage years- and you know those ""no Irish need apply"" signs that so many people nowadays want to pretend didn't exist?  We found *twelve* of them that great-grandpa had stolen in his youth when we went through his stuff after he died.  You can imagine how much fun it is to be denied jobs simply because your ancestors actually struggled to be accepted and lead the damn labor movement that created the weekend- or you COULD, if not for the fact that you don't really have to, do you?

Of course, the Irish- and to a lesser extent the Jews, who did the same thing- can usually pass undetected among white people; Asians generally can't, so you kinda get the worst of both worlds.

The guy turned out to be useless, and the same women spent the best part of a couple of years arranging a constructive dismissal, which the poor bloke was too thick to spot. None of the ladies took responsibility for their own poor choices btw.

This is a comment from 5 fucking years ago, but still 100% relevant today. Here's the most important part:

> The way many women dress today, with half their breasts exposed, is an expression of total disrespect for men. Men are left with three possible responses. To grab the woman, which is illegal; to ogle the woman, which is socially unacceptable; or to affect not to notice the woman at all, which is emasculating. A culture that normalizes such female behavior—i.e. not only not noticing or objecting to it, but prohibiting any objection to it—is extremely sick. 

> Your point that such outrageously provocative dress—which is now all but standard among American women, whether in the office, the gym or anywhere else—is actually disrespectful and demeaning to men, is one that is not made nearly often enough. I think you’ve really hit on it when you say that to pretend not to notice such things is actually emasculating. This touches on the basic fact that men, as men, are ineradicably interested in the sight of semi-denuded women. This is so basic to what men are that to disregard it is an open challenge to his status as a man, forcing him to pretend at being something other than what he is, compelling him to assent by his silence to an obvious lie. It is a companion to the morbidly sick insistence, now spreading in the Netherlands, that men should never urinate in a standing position. Men do not walk around half-naked precisely because it is obscene, and because women are not interested in seeing them dressed that way. For women to pretend there is no sexual component to dressing in ways so revealing that they go far beyond what is even practical or comfortable, is really just a quintessentially feminine, passive-aggressive kind of power play.

Like someone else mentioned, she may have serious weight issues or other problems as well since most women don't really wear muumuus.  Regarding the flip flops, I have an overweight male colleague who wears flip flops and pants with elastic. He also tends to wear shirts that billow and aren't tucked in.

IMHO, that is a question for the feminists. From what I've seen, the feminist movement denies that this situation even exists and undergoes great mental gymnastics to deny that it exists. They look at the outcomes, the discrepancy between male and female, scream sexism and demand equality while ignoring the basic physiological reasons for the situation.

I don't see many (any?) people in the Men's Rights movement saying that a qualified woman should be denied a position in favour of a less-qualified man.

Many of these jobs are dirty, dangerous, if not both. The uncomfortable and/or dangerous working conditions merit the high pay that the people who work them receive.

A huge number of those jobs do have equalized physical requirements due to the state of the technology (i.e. trash collectors, mine workers, slaughterhouses, construction trades, etc...), meaning that there are machines that will do the heavy lifting. You just have to be willing to get into the dirt and do the work.

These are the jobs that women are not going after or will apply for and then quit when they find out how dirty they really are. Or better yet, they will complain about the working conditions that every other man on the job put up with because it is a part of the job and then end up working out of the office, only to complain again about not getting paid as well as the guys who are doing the dirty work.

One of the many problems with feminism is that it doesn't recognize female forms of power, or only recognizes female power in particular contexts.

Both. However, I really detest wide-sweeping general statements like ""the world sees them as"". I see this pop up quite often in political discussions but how can one determine that? I'm sure that *some* people do but I'm also sure that some people don't. Do you tally up opinions on both sides and let the majority rule? Doesn't that discount the opinions of the minority?

Our only complaint is that compromising those requirements will only result in more people being harmed.

The issue that we are having is that there are plenty of high-risk/high-pay jobs out there that do not have a physical requirement. Women are not going for those jobs. It almost seems as if there is a focused interest only in those male-dominated jobs with a physical strength requirement in order to push the feminist physical equality ideology.

The whole thing just weakens the very valid arguments that the Men's Rights movement does have.

Off topic, but another example I've seen multiple times in this sub is that feminism is causing men to ""go against their stoic instincts"" ^(I wish I could remember which thread I read that in), and ""[Stop telling men to show their emotions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5g99iv/stop_telling_men_to_show_their_emotions/)"". However, there is a strong advocacy for more mental health funding for men and to see men as abuse victims etc ^(which I full heartedly agree with) but those things inherently go against this the outcry of ""don't womanize me!"" because they involve showing emotions and being seen as weak/vulnerable ^(which is literally something being rallied against in the above mentioned 300 upvoted thread).

There are so many things that *most* people would say ""well obviously men should be able to xyz"" but it get clouded by a very ""us vs them"" sentiment in this sub - and feminist groups are just as bad, but do you really want to be the people who point and say ""they started it!""

Be effective, not petty.

Great.  How 'bout feminists make them?  Like make the actual signs rather than relying on men and/or third-world sweatshop workers or prisoners (mostly men) to do it for them.  

Also, how 'bout we have an international effort to create parity in the workplace death gap?   It's MUCH larger than the pay gap, which results in part by men working longer hours in more dangerous jobs.  

That's not going to happen and you know exactly why: men are stronger and willing to take more risks to support their families (or are compelled to subsidize their families even when they are denied meaningful contact with their kids).  

I don't think you realize just how incredibly obnoxious it is for these women (and their male ""allies"") sitting in air-conditioned offices to be lecturing working class men about their working habits.

Two entirely different responses will tell you a lot about what sort of employee you are dealing with.

I think the educational system is also getting worse in this respect.

I recall during my early educational experiences, that there used to be exams, where a certain number of questions would require students to go a little above and beyond what they had been taught in class to demonstrate some level of understanding that goes beyond having memorized something. Something that required having to figure out something on your own that you weren't explicitly taught how to do.

As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught. I start hearing complaints about teachers being ""sub-standard"" when exams contain questions that require reasoning not explicitly taught, but that arises from understanding basic principles.  The premise being that a question was asked of the student, but that the instructor was ""sub-standard"" because he or she did not give the student explicit instruction on how to solve a problem that appeared on the exam.  Never mind that being able to reason about things not explicitly taught, was the entire point of the exam question in the first place. Nope. ""Not fair"" ""bad teacher"" they will exclaim.

My coworker is actually a third type. She goes this route, but then still puzzles me anyway.

> As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught.

Exactly. This is perfectly on point. Insecurity is one thing, but unwillingness to learn is something entirely different. My coworker won't make a decision unless someone else justifies *her* choice. She write an email, she passes it on to a coworker to read and correct. She does a task, she pass it on to a coworker to check if ""she did a good job"". She wants to do something, she asks a coworker what they think before saying anything to others...

And when the only person (me) capable of doing a task she can't handle and won't learn how to, refuses to help her, then it's either bashing or drowning. Just an observation: she was willing to bring the issue to the ""nice-boss"" table, not to the other boss who expects her to perform.

True, it is largely the parents and the culture.

But there is some culpability from within the educational community too, because today's parents and culture are yesterday's students.

 It's hard to be certain, but I believe that a large part of the problem arises from uncritical peddling of [""blank slate hypothesis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science) which leads many to argue, falsely, that there can be no innate differences, and that all differences in capability can be traced back to social circumstances or to education.

Consequently, many of the largest voices within the educational system, over decades, have pushed to create expectations that biggest failures in outcomes can only be due to failures in instruction. That is, when a student fails, it must be because at some step along the way, the student wasn't taught in a fashion that was tailored to the student's learning needs. Which may or may not be true. Consequently, if a child cannot solve a problem, and they were not explicitly taught how to solve the problem, that is by necessity a failure of teaching. So the instruction becomes more and more spoon-fed, continually trying to deflect concerns that instruction is insufficient. Extrapolative thinking and analogy are removed from exercises, and education is reduced to a boring, mundane, and less-than-generalizable exercise in rote memorization and rudimentary aping.

Of course, teachers are intimately familiar with the ground truth on these matters, so the majority probably have some concept of what is really going on, and many do not view it as a positive development.

So bottom line, you are correct, it is students and parents who are largely responsible in the immediate sense. But today's parents are yesterday's students, and it is the educational community and academia that is largely responsible for creating the class of parents who are so aligned with uncritical and PC peddling of [""blank slate thinking""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science).

So while teachers may be more aware of the ground truth, the general social climate that creates these expectations in parents and students, is largely traceable to education.

Note, that I'm not saying that all learning is based on innate capability. I do think it is possible to improve people's capability to think on their own through teaching. But, importantly, teaching people how to think one their own must incorporate some aspect of the trial-by-fire approach, where students learn over years and years through their attempts -- and critically failures -- in thinking on their own. Teaching to think cannot be accomplished in the idealized centrally organized one or two day program where every child is spoon fed every aspect of what they will be expected to do, because doing that removes the entire process of a student's thinking on their own from the education entirely.",MagicTampon,t2_10wa5e,9,0,reddit3

Also very important, as soon as people start throwing shit around, the first thing that is lost is the truth. So keep your head and do not get draw into mud slinging, keep everything on the subject at hand. Do not feed their disorder, keep your interactions bland and brief. 

I have dealt with some pretty awful people, they exist in all organisations. People with personality disorders however  are in a different league. Most people have not knowingly dealt with them and cannot believe what you are saying; you become branded as the unreasonable one. And yes, they can be very charming, they have been practicing their craft all their lives. Sadly they will always have someone who will side with them regardless; confirmation bias is a terrible thing.

These people as not to be confused with very unpleasant and rude people; they are far more insidious and socially damaging.

I have dealt with 3 such people.  A narcissist-borderline mix, a sociopath and a malignant narcissist. The sociopath got shipped back to where he came from, ie jail. For the other two all we managed was to fence them off and limit their power, which is probably all you will be able to do here. All 3 took time to uncover and caused shocking social damage, damage that is outside most peoples experience and comprehension.

Sadly I work in a profession that attracts such people. Best of luck.

**EDIT**: I thought I was a fairly worldly wise person till I had the encounter with the sociopath. When he was brought to my attention I difficulty in believing what was been reported. He was the most pleasant and helpful guy who would always go that extra mile for people. People adored him. Fortunately we had a very experienced psychologist on staff who filled me in on all of this. When the full extent of his activities were exposed I was speechless, it would take a book to list the things that he had been doing, but included theft over $5000, extortion, blackmail and sexual assault.

He probably meant this exchange, which is kind of cold if you think that SHE is actually a good person putting in some effort.

The problem is, SHE wasn't. SHE had wasted tons of hours doing nothing and waiting for others to ""do the job for her or tell her exactly what to do"". Because her usual support-coworker wasn't capable of helping her with this, she once more turned to me.

She played it nice because she needed to be able to say ""I asked Demian nicely so he *has* to help me"". But it's fake nice, and I knew she didn't have any right to push the issue.

The funny thing is, this exchange was a private conversation between me and her. We had another group convo going on at the same time with me, her and her support-coworker. In that convo she had dropped any sign of niceness and was openly telling the other guy, in front of me, that ""I didn't want to help her... he's doing nothing and I'm stuck with this and he won't help...""

So fake nice doesn't cut it lol. She can screw herself for all I care and learn to be professional. And I flat out refused to help her for that.",demian78,t2_ax22xax,8,0,reddit3

The comments in the original post are insane.
“If you’ve been working 18 days straight, then so has she” is ridiculously insulting. Even if he was some kind of meditation guru or not doing physical labor, he is still working and providing for the family.
When did society begin to believe that staying home and playing in the yard with the kids and eating donuts is an equal contribution to actually making money? People often say that being a SAHM is a full-time job. If that's the case, than maybe they should ‘work’ a little harder. Making sure people are fed is among the most important duty a SAHM has. Imagine if OP continually failed to do the bare minimum at work. He would be fired! You can't say it's a job and then not act like it.
I have so many problems with the mother’s actions. Firstly, OP says that she's a “fantastic mom,” however I'm not sure that allowing 2 kids to eat 10 droughts (it's also possible that they ate all 12 and she just drank the coffee) at 3:30 is going to win her mother of the year.
Secondly, OP is the one who PAID for the droughts and paid for all the food in the house that should've been used for dinner. She bought food with his money and then proceeded not to leave him any. I find this to be insulting in itself. 12 donuts and you can't save one for dad? 
Third, she left trash on the table. That alone isn't acceptable. Is he supposed to come home after a long and demanding shift AND THEN clean up after her? 
Many commenters apparently can’t read and insist that he packs a lunch even though he says that he wouldn't even have time to eat it. Even if OP did have time to eat lunch, he shouldn't be the one making it. The person who goes to the grocery store is the one who needs to make lunch, otherwise, neither partner has any idea what food is in the kitchen.  
Commenters are also saying that if he wants to have dinner ready when he comes home, he should pay for daycare. It's clear to me that his wife still wouldn't have food ready for him, but that's not the main problem with this idea. OP would be paying for daycare so that his wife would do NOTHING all day. If his wife began working 50 hours/week then daycare would be great. You can't be a SAHM if your kids are in daycare... That's called being a burden. 
It's also worth pointing out that OP is hourly, if he was salaried he wouldn't work 18 days straight and not have any breaks. I'm not sure what his benefits package is, but I would imagine it isn't exceptional. Full retirement matching, high-quality health insurance, etc. are all things that OP likely doesn't have. OP won't be able to do this job until his retirement. When he becomes physically unable to do intensive labor, will his wife begin to work too? I bet she will take half, tell the kids not to talk to him anymore, and get the court to award her some of his social security benefits.  That she walked out of the house with the kids is evidence enough.",FedUM,t2_9gdebv7sw,3,0,reddit4

That's the whole thing. That's what the other users were losing their minds over. The guy sounds like he's in severe need of some sort of assertiveness training, judging from his fawning description of his obviously emotionally abusive wife, but even so, that post of his not only got removed from AITA, but it got him removed from Reddit. He has already been suspended, and as an examination of the cache of his Reddit profile will reveal, this was his only discussion on Reddit. In the cache, one could see links to the initial comment, and to a few of his replies in the discussion that followed.

He has to have been suspended based on this discussion, because there's nothing else, there. Are you folks sure that Reddit is a good choice of platform for you?

Yes, we are. When I went to where his profile (u/Negative\_Benefit1756) would have been, one is greeted with the words

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>""This account has been suspended .""

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative\_Benefit1756](https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative_Benefit1756)

Just to be safe, I'm archiving that suspension announcement in both [the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703132152/https://www.reddit.com/user/Negative_Benefit1756) and [Archive Today](https://archive.is/kIKVO), so if that Reddit reverses itself, later, and somebody should try to pretend that the suspension never took place, I'll be able to prove otherwise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>""Okay, well that is just insane and unhinged if he was penalized in any way.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was (and remains) , as you say, ""insane and unhinged,"" but there's no ""if"" about it. The word ""suspended"" is right there. If the mods will allow, I can show you archived copies of the Google cache of his profile. As you will be able to see for yourself, he encountered his first act of censorship when his account was less than an hour old, and said account was suspended less than a day before he set it up.

Not a lot of mysteries with this case. The man's account didn't survive long enough for there to be any, really.

&#x200B;

**Note to the mods:** I read your rules, and I know that you're worried about brigading, but in this case, there is no danger of that. The mods of AITA have locked the only discussion that the now suspended user in question took part in. A user from this sub, on arrival there, couldn't take part in it, even if he wanted to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Why on earth would he be removed for that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Because the admins are insane and unhinged? People aren't always reasonable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Is swearing against the rules?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No, not the rules of the sub (archived [here](https://archive.is/j899E) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703124827/https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/)), nor [the content policy for Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), which I've also archived in both of the major archives ( [1](https://archive.is/eP7fA) |[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230703124744/https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) ).

BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company and Chevron are among the largest 21 polluters responsible for $5.4tn (£4.3tn) in drought, wildfires, sea level rise, and melting glaciers among other climate catastrophes expected between 2025 and 2050, according to groundbreaking analysis published in the journal One Earth.

It is the first time researchers have quantified the economic burden caused by individual companies that have extracted – and continue to extract – wealth from planetheating fossil fuels.

Amid growing debate about who should bear the economic cost of the climate crisis, the paper, titled Time to Pay the Piper, presents a moral case for the carbon corporations most responsible for the climate breakdown to use some of their “tainted wealth” to compensate victims.

Fossil fuel use has been a known problem for 100 years. The evidence necessary to start addressing the problem through government regulations has been available for 50 years.

It was always going to take a long time to transition to carbon neutral economies, and will only take longer as the world delays further. Corrupt and incompetent governments still aren't doing their job. But it still has to happen.

The best way to help would be to donate all profits to the government and/or nationalise them, which would reduce the burden on the tax payer.

Frankly, the doom and gloom about climate change is just that. It's overblown and evidence suggests that while there will be deaths, it won't be nearly apocalyptic, and there's a decent argument that without burning fossil fuels there would've been more deaths as we didn't have an energy alternative for a good long time, and we're honestly still working on it. The cost won't be in human lives really, it will be in dollars. It will be in giving aid. And it will be entirely on the tax payer, too.

The trouble, as I see it, is these big fossil fuel companies made bank off raping the earth for natural resources and selling it. Those fossil fuels and any natural resources in a country, to my mind, should belong to the country, not whichever private citizen can afford to mine it, because you and I would never be able to benefit from it that way, unless you happen to be filthy rich.

Their consistent recommendation was to do more research, not to radically shift away from fossil fuels. We know much of what they said was wrong, today, but the scientists had no way of knowing that at the time. They were being cautious with their interpretations, as scientists are trained to do.

Many things to disagree here with. It is expensive because of previously mentioned maintenance and ressource costs, and nuclear plants are constipated to be base load suppliers. They can't stop and go, e.g. In summer when the sun is generating cupious amounts of solar energy.

Additionally, they are way unsafer than many people think. [esp. in Western Europe, nuclear accidents are expected to happen once every 10-20 years](https://www.mpg.de/forschung/kernenergie-nuklearer-gau) according to the Max-Plack-Institute in Mainz, Germany.

In the heat wave of 2022, half of the French nuclear plants were off the grid because the rivers were too hot, causing a major cooling problem for the reactors.

Society is built around working for a wage, so as a result, it’s understandable that there’s a lot of people who are checked out from their jobs and only punch a clock. There’s also a lot of people who ended up replacing someone who was like this and find out painfully quick that they can do the entire job in 15 hours a week or less, but still have to work 40. Society isn’t ready for the level of automation that we have available today, mainly because society would be invariably damaged if automation started to actually replace people’s jobs at the level it’s capable of. I don’t see a future in which there’s both capitalism AND upward social class mobility as a result, but the saving grace for society rn is that most business owners are not automation experts.

That said, I’m confident that most companies could axe 30-40% of their workforce and still perform at the same level if not better, but I’d rather see a world in which automation and improvements in technology actually help all humans by allowing us to reclaim more of our time and lives. Basically, if the new guy can do the same job in 15 hours, let him, and make sure he gets paid the same salary as he would working 40.

But in the short term it might not be cuz society may need time to adjust. Currently most people work and get paid for their work directly. Those who don't work, suffer. This is entirely different to how people would get paid in a mostly automated society. Such a society unlike any other in human history would not be doing most of its own work. Meaning if they benefit from this work they would do so for doing nothing to contribute to it. The same people who did not work and suffered for it, would now be the norm and have to benefit for doing nothing to contribute to their benefits. That's a massive shift.

hbjye2p,t3_php1sv,2021-09-04 10:27:02,science,"Postponing retirement is protective against cognitive decline. The beneficial effect is related to a slowed rate of cognitive decline rather than a boost in cognitive function. That is what a recent study by MPIDR researcher Angelo Lorenti and colleagues found by analyzing data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.

Participating in the labor market until the age of 67 slows cognitive decline and is protective against cognitive impairment, such as that caused by Alzheimer’s. This protective effect appears to hold regardless of gender and educational or occupational attainment. These findings were recently published in the journal SSM Population Health.

The team of researchers with Jo Mhairi Hale, Maarten J. Bijlsma, and Angelo Lorenti, all affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, used data from the Health and Retirement Study on more than 20,000 US-Americans ages 55 to 75 who participated in the labor market at some point between 1996 and 2014.

There are modifiable life-course predictors of cognitive function
With population aging there is a growing concern about increasing prevalence in Alzheimer’s disease. As there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, it is important to understand the influences on cognitive function over one’s life span, paying particular attention to modifiable risk factors.

“In this study, we approach retirement and cognitive function from the perspective that they both come near the end of a long path of life”, says Angelo Lorenti. ""It begins with one's social origins in ethnicity, gender, and early-life social and economic status, goes on with educational and occupational attainment and health behaviors, and goes all the way up to more proximate factors such as partnership status and mental and physical health. All these kinds of factors accumulate and interact over a lifetime to affect both cognitive function and age at retirement.""

What are the health consequences of postponing retirement?
“We investigated how demographic change interacts with social and labor market dynamics”, says Angelo Lorenti. In many countries governments have enacted policies to increase the statutory retirement age. That is why it is relevant to understand if retiring at older ages may have health consequences, particularly on cognitive function. “Our study suggests that there may be a fortuitous unintended consequence of postponed retirement”, so Lorenti.

hbkfnoa,t3_php1sv,2021-09-04 13:39:59,science,"Correlation ≠ causation.

Almost no one actually ""retires"" in our society. Maybe 5% of people actually do have the choice to stop working and live with dignity, due to pensions and savings and house-price appreciation and a general sense of completeness with regard to their careers. That's not what happens to the other 95%; the cost of living is so high that almost no one would go without an income if there were other options.

What really happens is: people face worsening ageism and diminishing opportunities. The idiotic optimism that causes people to believe in the system fades; so, too, does the aggressive and almost malignant energy one requires to succeed in high-frequency workplace politics. People get knocked down (demoted, humiliated, fired). Sometimes they get back up; sometimes they don't. Each time, it gets a little bit harder.

When they're down for a ten count-- when they get knocked down, and take so long to recover that the ""job gap"" itself gets into the 12-18+ month range from which it's impossible to surmount-- our society uses the euphemism of ""retirement"" to allow these people to save some face... while also presenting our society as more orderly and compassionate than it actually is.

So, it's far more likely to me that what happens is that people suffering pre-dementia are just impaired enough that they can't keep up with the backstabbing and blame-shifting and all the other stuff that it requires to hold a private-sector job (especially at the bottom of our society, where the workplace politics is most high-frequency) although the more obvious, clinical symptoms have yet to appear.",michaelochurch,t2_4ocdf,-3,0,reddit3

2. The alternative you suggest&mdash;that any activity might have a similar effect&mdash;does not actually deny the causal relationship between delayed retirement and cognitive protection.

h279vzf,t3_o2ntec,2021-06-18 12:20:57,science,"**Overview:** When employees depend more on tips and are required to act friendly, customers experience more power and subsequently engage in more sexual harassment.  


**Highlights:**  

* In a field survey, employees who are more dependent on tips (a larger percentage of their income comes from tips) and work in jobs with stronger requirements to be friendly and happy with customers (emotional labor requirements) report higher perceptions of customer power and experiencing more sexual harassment.  

* In a lab experiment, customer intentions to sexually harass were highest when customers saw a smiling (vs. neutral) employee and learned that the employee was financially dependent on tips.  

* Customers' sense of power, and not attraction towards the employee, explained the effects of financial dependence and emotional labor requirements on sexual harassment.  

  

> Abstract: Sexual harassment from customers is prevalent and costly to service employees and organizations, yet little is known about when and why customers harass. Based on a theoretical model of power in organizations, we propose that sexual harassment is a function of employees’ financial dependence on customers (i.e., tips) and deference to customers with emotional labor (“service with a smile”) jointly activating customer power. With a field survey study of tipped employees who vary in financial dependence and emotional display requirements (Study 1), and an online experiment that manipulates financial dependence and emotional displays from the customer’s perspective (Study 2), our results confirm that these contextual factors jointly increase customer power and thus sexual harassment. Our research has important practical implications, suggesting that organizations can reduce customer sexual harassment by changing compensation models or emotional labor expectations in service contexts.

h29hjkl,t1_h290753,2021-06-18 22:45:03,science,"That's an interesting data point. From all the cases of restaurants going tipless I've heard about, the reasons for failure was sticker shock (which can be fixed by having an fixed service fee rate that isn't in the menu prices), and difficulty with server retention. The big elephant in the room is the **despite all the harassment that servers suffer due to tipping, they largely benefit immensely from it financially and want it to stay**. Tipped servers can make way more money that they could if they were paid anywhere close to what the rest of restaurant staff are paid. One of the big motivations of the tip-free movement was having more equal pay for back of house and front of house workers. But doing that without increasing the final cost to consumers would mean reducing server wages. This then causes retention issues and things start to fall apart.  


EDIT: it seems that adding mandatory service fees is illegal in some places. Consequently, tip-free restaurants have had more success in places where it is legal (SF bay  area) than in places where it isn't (NYC).",chrismorin,t2_3zgnd,26,0,reddit4

This is a typical example, a restaurant implements no tipping and quickly reverts as they are no longer able to retain wait staff. While some staff was happy, wait staff were decidedly unhappy to the point of leaving at an alarming rate.

> On what made him decide to switch back to tipping

> Attrition. We were losing staff, servers mostly. Kitchen was of course happy and turnover was nonexistent. And senior staff in the front of the house were happy. We were continuing to hire young, new people, train them, and then they'd get the set of skills necessary, and they would generally give notice and move to other restaurants in our community who were still on a traditional tip economy.

https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/15/478096516/why-restaurants-are-ditching-the-switch-to-no-tipping

> On how the staff has reacted to the switch back to tipping

> Oh, they were delighted. Most of all, my management was very relieved. It had been a tremendous amount of work, and we all remain very much in favor of it, ideologically, and I, like many, think it may be the way things are going. We just started to feel like an ideologue, insisting on this way of doing it when others in our community that had said they would switch were not switching.

And if other restaurants are doing what he is saying, prices at these restaurants are higher than otherwise would be with even generous tipping.

> There was one primary mistake, which was thinking that somehow I wanted the prices to be basically what people were paying previously, including tip. So we knew our tip percentage was around 21 percent, so we increased all of our prices by that and charged accordingly, and then we gave the kitchen raises. So there was a bit less for the front of the house, so that was really my mistake. I know that others that are making the switch now are raising their prices by more like 40 percent to be sure that that doesn't happen.

h27xege,t1_h279vzf,2021-06-18 15:32:37,science,"Thank you for summarizing and initiating discussion. In other words the researchers strike at the heart of the matter. When you largely work for tips, you have two employers, the clients and the ceo. But unlike power balances between entrepreneurs who are largely paid by clients and have no CEO to obstruct their ability to terminate a relationship with an exploitive and discriminatory client, when you work in the service industry your ceo can't sexually harass you and dock your pay for not flirting back, but the client can dock your pay, and yet you don't have the power to fire an entitled client and there's no way to hold your employer liable for coercing continued interaction. We lack protections for service industry folks and allow pimplike CEOs to exploit this loophole and financially profit from sexual harassment of their staff. Leaving vulnerable populations like working mothers, women, and literally anyone stuck with service industry as their only viable option of living paycheck to paycheck while they try to secure skills to attain a more stable income. In other industries you could take a client to court for failure to pay for services received, but in this industry a waiter in a ski resort has no right to pursue full payment because his payment is conditional on the nebulous pleasures and whims of the alcoholic who pitched a fit when he wasn't allowed another drink, or who was ticked by the ceos pricing of the menu and retaliates on staff. Men in the industry experience discriminatory baseless docking of their pay by customers despite labor performed as well. As do older workers who are tipped less if they're not fast enough or attractive enough for the customer's liking. As do younger workers who are tipped less if they're not informed enough, or viewed as ""young"" and therefore deserving of lower pay until they've earned status in society. It allows for discrimination practices in pay because it obscures the motivations for docking pay, (so knowing this, I'd love to see a study on discriminatory hiring practices in the service industry). Absolved of accountability, the ceo shifts blame to employees and customers, having only partial responsibility to the staff who's labor they profit from. Pathetic attempts to compromise by including a service charge. Studies like this are important because they produce the data that exposes a concern left unaddressed in the debate over industry reforms.",BustingCognitiveBias,t2_3qeig6ih,27,0,reddit4

db5a91s,t3_5i3e9l,2016-12-13 16:44:01,science,"I have long had this question regarding forensic investigations. I am by no means educated in forensics, and any knowledge I have comes from watching all of those Forensic Files type shows..
 
Forensics is considered the end all evidence in most cases. Aside from a video and a confession, forensics seems to be the main form of evidence used to convict people or convince Jurries to vote a certain way. It seems to me, that this type of evidence could be easily manipulated and even misinterpreted in any case. So I will attempt to form my question:
 
Is there a group, or a class, or a training program that purposefully tries to fake or confuse the forensics in order to teach investigators and scientists? There's a few times during the shows that it seems to me that the evidence could have been easily transferred during the investigation by any number of other police officers, Witnesses or even forensic investigators. I also think it would be one of the easiest things to lie about in a courtroom. As a prosecutor tells the jury hey we have forensic evidence that this guy's hair was found on the dead body, everybody's just has to believe that. So whether if the hair was planted, lied about, I ended up on this body in any strange way it just seems to be hundred percent guilty verdict if something like that happens. 
 
I am not damning forensics or thinking that it is not correct, I'm just wondering if there is training programs that purposely fake these things to see how the investigators react.",thethreadkiller,t2_5vgiu,1,0,reddit1

Has there been any improvement over the past 10 years or so in terms of being able to do preparation in the field of samples in dirty matrices (e.g. dirty water)? I think the question is the same whether we're talking chemical or biological samples. I saw a number of really promising detection technologies but putting samples into some usable form always seemed like 60% of the work in developing any sort of system for the field.

db6wn1p,t3_5i3e9l,2016-12-14 17:27:33,science,"How prepared do you think the CDC is for bioterrorism? 

In my opinion I'd rate our country, healthcare system, and local government, as well as the CDC as capable but poorly prepared.  We have the facilities and people, but we have no set plans nor do we have dispersal of information to the local level.   I'd give us 2/5 if we had to do a 5 star scale - we have some stockpiles, we have some idea how to treat certain biological threats, but we don't have the information dispersed or any gameplan when it comes down to it (or if we do, nobody knows the gameplan at the ground floor).

When I did months of research on the topic (5) years ago, I found that 11/11 hospitals and their associated cities had no direct plan with the CDC in regards to a bioterrorism attack.  If such an attack happened, one thing the CDC would need to do is send drugs from their stockpile (experimental or not) in many cases, yet nobody is prepared to kick off this process.  It's basically, ""the local government needs to contact us"". The hospital would have nothing kicking off until the local government was contacted and got plans in motion with the CDC.  And I know how it works inside hospitals, so it'd be a while before they got the plans back and actually into action after that.  I'd like to hear your take on this.  

I think they need to do a much better job at (1) making information easier to access (2) having a plan in place for this potential event (3) dispersing this plan to hospitals and other healthcare facilities that seem to all have their own standards for handling this situation (and most had no idea the CDC even has a drug stockpile, never mind a plan in place for their pharmacy to receive and disperse the drug) (4) keeping their science up to date on numerous disease states, including bioterrorism related diseases (our government/many thought leaders in medicine are commonly years behind on the facts, which needs to be fixed because it trickles down through our medical system, and governing practices in this regard)

Again, I'd love your take on this.  I'm not sure the CDC is the only body who would be involved directly, but either way at a local government and hospital level (where you'd send people to quarantine and treat for the associated disease to an attack) there is almost 0 preparedness minus a typical emergency protocol which essentially gives wide range antimicrobial therapies and designates part of the hospital for quarantining patients.

db5a7fb,t1_db53lzo,2016-12-13 16:43:11,science,"Modern day cases don't just entail malevolent groups or individuals ""cooking up a superbug"", though this is of concern with more sophisticated and better resourced adversaries. Nature and available open source knowledge provides those interested in developing and using bioweapons plenty of straightforward opportunities, even through isolating common or endemic pathogens or via biotoxins. Over the past 20 years, there have been many known situations which fit into the latter category, e.g. someone making crude ricin (potent toxin from castor bean) or isolating C. botulinum or B. anthracis from soil/animal carcasses and attempting to grow it up and weaponize them in crude fashion. A number of years back, Al Qaeda was reported in the open press to have set up crude laboratories in caves in Afghanistan to develop bioweapons. It has been well known for over 20 years that many options for small scale illicit production exist and that if a perpetrator wanted to pursue such, it could be difficult to detect or prevent. It is likely that there are many cases that are never mentioned in the press; law enforcement and intelligence just go about their business, and unless a prosecution is undertaken and judicial process is engaged, the public wouldn't hear about it. Law enforcement and intelligence have a number of methods, tactics and procedures they use to gather information, verify information, and work against adversaries at various stages in their ""business cycles"" with the goal of prevention or intervention as early as possible the highest priority. don't forget about hoaxes either. These are crimes and must be fully investigated. Law enforcement and intelligence seek to prevent or intervene early with these as well.",AmerChemSocietyAMA,t2_ollxg,77,0,reddit1

Forensic odontology (bitemarks) seems to be the one that receives the most negative attention but additionally arson investigation (the aspect that relies on qualitative judgments on burn patters etc) also has received considerable negative attention.

I was involved in the early days of these discussions as a member of the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity when this surfaced. I believe that a balanced approach is appropriate. In my view, and many colleague I have worked with from various walks of science, we agree that preventing all illicit activity is likely impossible, but reducing risks is possible and requires a multipath and multilayered approach. While I do recognize the need and value for advancing science for public health, I also am well aware of the risks, as you refer to. After much debate on the NSABB and later the issuance of a national policy by the U.S. Government, at least there is a common framework to use to manage dual use biological research so as to strike the right balance between the two perspectives. Leading journals are very well aware of concerns and monitor publications from the biosecurity perspective. There has been significant engagement by U.S. Government agencies (and perhaps through similar mechanisms in other countries) with various communities (academic, Do It Yourself) to educate, discuss and advance responsible science. These are all positive measures in my view. These all contribute to a safer world, but do not and cannot prevent malicious and nefarious use of science.

During the course of the investigation, much new science had to be developed and validated, which took time. I refer you to the National Research Council report which reviewed the science used int the anthrax cases. Investigations of this sort have many twist, turns and uncertainties---and it's a dynamic not static process. i know this first hand.

Given the vast history of BW, it's foolish to brush it off as something only used in the past. 
It's been suggested by literature that the distribution aspect of BT is the most complicated part, and while yes a gram of toxin (if you are still talking about C bot), is enough to kill off thousands of people, the distribution of the bacteria, spores, or toxin would be difficult if not impossible. On top of that, according to the SNS, the US has enough BAT and ventilators to combat an attack using botulinum along with a well established monitoring program.
