That's happening every day all over the US at every doctors office with a meaningful volume of patients who could be potential consumers of the Rep's bag. 

Drug reps often have to buy breakfast and/or lunch for the entire office to get access, and there is immense downward pressure on the reps to spend their lunch money.

edvt29c,t3_aezza2,2019-01-12 10:16:15,science,"I believe I read a slatestarcodex article about this.  Apparently it's a bit more complicated.

Imagine you're a doctor. Your day is filled with grueling, stressful paperwork, stressed out people, tight deadlines, and even more paperwork.  You'd love to read the latest journal articles to get a better idea of how to help your patients. But you can't. You might have the time to look at a few your colleagues have forwarded to you, but other than that, who really has time to pore through journals, evaluate studies on their merits, and translate that into practice?  It's hard enough for grad students whose job it is to do so, and very hard for people with actual jobs to do.

So here comes the drug sales rep.  They seem to be well informed on what they're pitching, and can give you lots of information on when you should and shouldn't use it, in a clear, synthesized, easily digestible form.  Sure, they might be biased, but you think you can handle it and see through their bull.  They may sometimes even recommend a competitor over their own!  They seem like reasonable people. 

And besides, it's damn tough to actually get your patients to do things that would actually solve their health problems, like, say, lifestyle changes.  Throwing pills at the problem is generally easier, it's not THAT bad, and gets your more hopeless patients out the door quicker so you can spend more time with the ones you like and think might benefit more from your time.  Pills are, for a lot of patients and doctors, much easier to swallow (pardon the pun) than treating fundamental problems.

I'm pretty sure I'm mangling what he wrote pretty badly here cause I'm going off of memory, but that seemed to me the gist, and it was rather believable.  We simply don't have a good institution for educating practicing doctors on the newest and best practices other than salesmen. ",Way-a-throwKonto,t2_128fly,2,0,reddit2

For anyone else who might have been confused by this, what semsr is saying is that doctors may not be aware of all of the treatment options... *so pharma companies ""educate"" the (potential) patient on the treatment options, and the patient then takes the info to the doctor.* That 2nd part was implied and maybe was (supposed to be?) obvious, but it's important to the argument.

In that context, yah, it kinda makes sense. If the intent is just to *spur* doctors into looking into a drug they might not know about, there's really not a problem with that. The patient doesn't actually have the ability to prescribe the drug themselves and (ideally) the opportunity for the doctor to do due diligence on vetting the drug is still there.

With that said I still see a big risk with DTC, and that is if it is coupled with a list of doctors who could prescribe the drug (like mentioned in the article). DTC makes sense if it results in the patient presenting new options to their doctor, who *presumably can evaluate the option objectively*. If the DTC also gives the customer an option to get the drug from a biased source, that is a major problem. That's when DTC becomes a snake oil sales tactic.",cheidiotou,t2_wq2l1,2,0,reddit2

What other efficient way do you know of?

FDA does release newsletters every week regarding new or old drugs. Who reads them every week?
Who is going to distill the information and give it to doctors?
Someone has to sift through that research. Good drug reps do that. Why do you think marketing takes up money? Most drug reps have good degrees, have experience in research, they help sift through the research and help the physicians understand the material. Their job is to keep a good relationship with the physician, not lie to the medics to get through a one time sales spot. They also provide continuing device or drug support, which means multiple trips. This all costs money.

I work with devices and drugs. We often call the reps for devices if we need device support etc. There are so many new devices in the market, physicians cant go take up training for each and every new device.

The other issue with this is that providers already have an excessive amount of work on their plate thanks to the insurance companies(the real problem in healthcare). The answer isn’t to compound the amount of work they have to do. The only way to solve this is to put it in their hands to hire someone with an advanced degree to offload this extra work and increase the cost of healthcare to the patient even more.

Lastly, the reason why there are so many new drugs being released is because competition amongst these companies is insane and that’s the reason reps are an efficient way to handle it. This is one of those cases where capitalism is doing great things. We would not see this same level of innovation in pharma if it became overly regulated and people would die.

I mean one could write a huge document on this, so a reddit comment may leave the reader to go and do some reading if they want to validate my claim.

Completely false. There are exceptions. But this is not the norm. Drug companies dont have enough money to do multiple studies to cherry pick 'good' studies.

If you don't do research in this field, please dont state opinions. Just facts.
Drug trials are extremely heavily regulated.

And no- we get funding regardless of the results. You dont get funding if your management or your trial design was poor enough to not produce results.

The reason why post approval studies show more side effects or so because it is data collected over a much wider population and over 10 years. Initial drug studies are not 10 years, they only study toxicity, efficacy and safety for a set duration, per the precedent set by similar drugs and FDA.

Here is the most frustrating example I have: I have a patient right now who constantly asks their doctor to prescribe whatever they see on TV.  They don't want to try anything that's older (really, they're looking for a magical side-effect-free drug that doesn't exist. All drugs have side effects.) The doctor prescribes them because it's easier than arguing with them, and does the insurance paperwork to get the $3000/month med approved.

The patient takes the med for maybe 3 days, decides they don't like it, and moves on to the next one. They're not even giving the expensive brand name drugs a chance, so the advertised drugs will never benefit the patient. Also, they happen to be on Medicaid, so they're not paying anything out of pocket to do this - there's no disincentive to the patient, as Medicaid covers 100% of the cost. So they're not getting any benefit, and it's literally thousands of dollars of wasted meds directly due to DTC advertising (and a doctor who will let the patient dictate their prescribing 100%, but I think the doctor keeps hoping they'll give one of the meds a fair shake, and it's easier than talking to this patient for 3 hours about other meds that would be better options only to have them insist on the next fancy brand name.)",norathar,t2_10igho,0,0,reddit2

It mentions hospitals being made exempt from antitrust laws over time which are a form of regulation. 

It lists a number of Nixon, Reagan and Bush era regulation repeals as forms of regulation too. 

The most notable being the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act. 

This act intentionally hamstrung the governments ability to negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical companies as well as preventing the government from creating a formulary (a list of accepted medications and their side effects) while allowing private HMO’s to do so.  

All of this leads to the creation of medicare part D which is a partial privatization of medicare. 

This is the single biggest overhaul of medicare and is strictly a form of deregulation 

The article also talks about monopolies being formed within the healthcare and pharmaceutical  industries which are literally only caused by a lack of regulation and can only be broken up by government regulation.

Yes, publicly funded research discovers most druggable targets, and perhaps even leads, but there is not one drug produced by them to medical standards. Moreover patents to these leads are sold before the most expensive part of the process, clinical trials. Publicly funded studies simply do not have enough money to run these. These clinical trials fail 86% of the time [https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524).

Pharmaceutical companies need to get their investment for the failed patents back, otherwise they could never be profitable. This is what makes drugs expensive. So yes, publicly funded research discovers most new medicine, but the most expensive step, testing them, is done by pharmaceutical companies.

For example, I used to take Olmesartan for high blood pressure. It's almost universally recognized as a superior drug of the -sartan, or ARB type. But it's expensive and my insurance company stopped paying for it, so my doctor switched me to an older, generic ARB, Valsartan.

And for those diseases or pharm choices too complex, they consult a resident pharmacologist hired by their clinic/hospital (perhaps this is what you meant by 'brought to their attention'). There are ways to manufacture databases and libraries of information that are more efficiently digested than browsing papers every day, and many clinics employ these strategies to educate their physicians without the use of external pharmacy advertising.

This, coming from the guy whose arguing that single-payer healthcare system leads to shortages of hospitals, as if Australia, or Japan, or Germany, or Norway, or Iceland have all suffered from a chronic shortage of hospitals because of the structure of their healthcare system. It reminds me of people who argue that paid maternity leave will lead to businesses going bankrupt all over the place, while every European country has paid maternity leave (and more) and yet, they still have profitable businesses. It's almost like these critiques are more fear-mongering than legitimate criticism. 

Anyway, government programs like Medicaid have more leverage than individual insurance companies, and can argue for lower prices. That's why we see the difference in cost.

Also, your laundry list of variables are really not as disruptive as you might think, because single payer systems work in multiple modern countries where all of those variables are different. For example, Australia has low population density, like the US, when compared to a country like Norway, but the Australians still make it work (also, its not impossible to set up state-wide or regional single payer systems, which would line up these variables quite nicely with our European counterparts). France and Germany still have a working healthcare system, despite France's citizens smoking more but being less obese, on average, than German citizens. The UK and Spain both have different economic indicators, and pretty different economies, but both have functional healthcare systems. ",,,2,0,reddit2

Ever seen those bottled ""water"" drinks that are actually juice, without the food coloring? If they were just water and sucralose I might be OK with it, but they're not. They contain a number of preservatives, including [sodium benzoate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_benzoate#Safety_and_health) which may decompose into benzene (a carcinogen) over time.

Also, I'm interested in knowing how cane sugar could ever not be ""natural""? It's cane sugar - it comes from a plant. It's *always* natural. Cyanide is also natural, so ""natural"" is not a good way to indicate that something is healthy. Even something as seemingly innocent as a potato, when cooked, often contains [acrylamide, which is under review as a possible toxin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide). But you can't win, because uncooked potatoes can be toxic too. Harmful chemicals are everywhere, and a short ingredients list lacking any scary words is no guarantee of safety.

That way we'd avoid having to pay off the sugar industry at their inflated prices for land we made available to them at our own expense in the first place.  

I just read that other crops *are* rotated in with sugarcane in the region, so it's possible that they could overcome the limitations imposed by the the region's climate and continue to farm profitably without sugar, but I just don't know *how* profitable it would be and if it would be enough to maintain land prices in the area.  As I understand it right now, we don't have the money for the program in the first place, and since the sugar subsidies are an economic absurdity anyways, it'd probably be worth the wait to see if eliminating them furthers our plans to restore the region.

First, I agree that it is scientifically impossible for sugar to be carbon free. Second, it is entirely possible for sugar to be ""*Carbonƒree®*\*"".

The former is nature, the latter is language.

I think I see the problem. You found this image elsewhere on the web and reposted it for the dopamine rush that is karma points and the accompanying fifteen seconds of fame. Since you have apparently ignored my quotation let me clarify further.

As can be seen in the image there is fine print, as denoted by an asterisk, that directs one to ""See back panel for details."" The entire upper portion of the bag of sugar, which currently sits next to my laptop, reads as follows:

---

\* Florida Crystals® is the first American sugar certified Carbon*free*® by Carbonfund.org.

Florida Crystals® products earned certification because our products' carbon emissions are offset by our production of renewable energy. Our power plant generates clean energy and produces enough electricity to power our sugar mill and refining operations as well as tens of thousands of homes. This helps reduce our use of fossil fuels, a major contributor to the increase of carbon emissions into the Earth's atmosphere.

And remember, Florida Crystals® is made from pure sun-sweetened sugar cane, but it's ""less refined"" than traditional sugar, so it delivers a flavor that's unique and absolutely delicious.

To learn more about our Carbon*free*® certification and our earth-friendly practices, visit us at www.floridacrystals.com.

Carbon*free*® is a registered trademark of the Carbonfund.org Foundation, Inc. and is used under license by Florida Crystals.

From carbonfund.org: ""Reduce What You Can, Offset What You Can't™""

You can see Florida Crystals' logo on this page: http://carbonfund.org/site/pages/businesses/business_carbon_offsets

No one is claiming, *anywhere*, that sugar does not contain carbon. You are simply misinterpreting the word ""Carbonfree"" and to add insult to injury you have brought the stupidity of the masses, as demonstrated [here](http://twitter.com/#search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2F5jxA3.png), to a forum originally designed to incite quality discussion just to receive unjustified social cred and further propagate ignorance for said blatant misinterpretation.

> I also didn't see anything wtf about this.

I understand. That is a problem to which I am proposing you reflect upon.

> All it is is some company trying to profit from dumb people that want to reduce their carbon footprint.

Well now we're on to something. I can be a cynic too!! ;0 I occasionally dip a spoon into this bag to delight in one of modern society's most dangerous drugs. I too have noticed this marketing and have stored it in the back of my brain. I'm quietly keeping track of the increase of such marketing and correlating it to sociopolitical behaviors of those close and far. Example being a friend who totes a bumper sticker of ""Carbon Neutral"". He uses this to justify driving here, there, and everywhere. Bicycle? Nah.. I don't believe this is the answer and I am interested in discussing the misinformation behind such ""public relations"".

***but***

> The company is clearly stupid because they gave no thought to the fact that carbon free sugar is scientifically impossible.

For those who don't know, most sugar cane is set alight to burn off the leaves and some of the waxy coating of the cane. It makes harvesting, and more importantly processing a lot easier. Hardly a carbon free process. There are lots of video and pictures of cane fires on the net, but a quick search on youtube for a Florida specific cane fire only yielded the following low quality video; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCaxwVea-Fw

I searched google images for ""Florida cane fires"" and got a lot of images related to a restaurant called Cane Fire Grill. Anyway, enough of the usual worthless trivia that distracts me  whenever I search for something.

I imagine they consider this sugar carbon neutral due to the Bagasse (organic material in sugar cane that is not sugar).  This Bagasse is usually combusted as a fuel.  So the sugar company could say that this Bagasse (a renewable fuel) combustion offset's coal (nonrenewable) combustion.

Rhodanese ""[is an ubiquitous enzyme with activity in all living organisms, from bacteria to man](http://www.springerlink.com/content/8w3065722r64l322/)"", and in detoxifying cyanide in the body it works in concert with another enzyme called [mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10506943?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&linkpos=5&log$=relatedreviews&logdbfrom=pubmed) (MST). 

While poisonous cyanide is certainly good for the media to scare people with, it's not uncommon in nature: ""it is synthesized, excreted *and metabolized* by hundreds of organisms, including bacteria, algae, fungi, plants, and insects, as a means to avoid predation or competition"" (PMID: [18685272](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685272?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&linkpos=4&log$=relatedreviews&logdbfrom=pubmed).) Vitamin B12, sold over-the-counter and recognised as essential to human health, contains (shock! horror!) cyanide. The [B-12 Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12) states: ""A common synthetic form of the vitamin, *cyano*cobalamin, does not occur in nature, but is used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, due to its stability and lower cost. In the body it is converted to the physiological forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal concentration."" It would appear that the body's enzymes rhodanese and MST are quite capable of dealing with this minimal concentration.

It would also appear that the normal cells of the body are also quite capable of dealing with the small quantities of cyanide found in the B17/amygdalin content of many seeds, even rich-source ones like apricot seed kernels. If they couldn't, I and many others would have been pushing up daisies long ago.

Science is about investigation and enquiry, and fortunately there is [some still going on](http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpb/29/8/1597/_pdf) in the world, even if it's not aware that the term Vitamin B17 is not ""politically correct"" in some quarters!",sharpsight2,t2_p6lb,1,0,reddit3

Many people are unconcerned about a few beers, just as others like myself are unconcerned about chewing and swallowing the seeds with the apple. It's a matter of degree - how much of each substance the body can safely deal with before the quantity becomes harmful. 

Your dismissing B12 is misdirection itself. The fact it contains cyanide and the fact that it is essential to human health is highly relevant to the dicussion. If the cyanide in B12 is left behind after the rest of the B12 molecule is used (as noted by the Wikipedia article), then why are you not concerned? You are ever so concerned about the cyanide in B17. Why the double standard? Why do you wish to direct attention away from B12 and focus fear on B17?

What difference does it make that your body can survive small amounts of cyanide from amygdalin, when there is no benefit from consuming it?  At least with alcohol you get drunk.  You get no benefits from amygdalin.  Vitamin B12 is also different in that it has health benefits and you can suffer from its deficiency.  

You misunderstand my point regarding B12, but then again, it is not surprising you willfully misunderstand anything contrary to your view.  My point is that B12 is proven to be useful.  Amygdalin, which is *not* a vitamin no matter how many times you call it one, has no benefit and produces cyanide.  Why would you willingly eat it?

The problem with the study is it says nothing useful.  If you can ever produce a study that shows eating apple seeds actually prevents or slows cancer, then I will happily start eating them myself.  Until then, you are doing nothing but trying to confuse the issue.

The worst part about this conversation is I don't even care.  You're not going to convince me to eat apple seeds like this, no one else is watching any more, and this whole pointless conversation started when I accurately pointed out that organic precursors to cyanide exist in nature.  Unless you can produce a study showing it prevents cancer in humans, you are simply producing useless and annoying noise.  So you fully understand that you have started and lost a pointless argument, let me end with a quote from the Wiki page you care about so much:

> A 2006 Cochrane review of the evidence concluded ""The claim that Laetrile has beneficial effects for cancer patients is not supported by data from controlled clinical trials. This systematic review has clearly identified the need for randomised or controlled clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of Laetrile or amygdalin for cancer treatment."" It has not been approved for this use by the United States' Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health evaluated the evidence, including case reports and a clinical trial, and concluded that they showed little effect. A 1982 trial of 178 patients found that tumor size had increased in all patients.

BTW you did not make a ""point"" about B12: you didn't previously make any point on B12 at all, you simply dismissed it as a waste of time. There was thus nothing to misunderstand. You then proceed to say ""My point is.."" The fact that you introduce it only *after* accusing me of misunderstanding it leads me to wonder if you are being malicious or whether you are just confused, thinking you wrote something that you had only been thinking of. Your point that B12 has been proved useful completely neglects to address the substance it contains, cyanide, about which you have so much concern. But enough, you seem firmly in the camp of practitioners of [heroic medicine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_medicine), whereas I am more interested in seeking solutions that are more effective than those which do nothing to prevent the ever-rising incidence of cancer, and which subject patients to discomfort, speeded-deterioration. and death. The useless and annoying noise that is apparent is in fact you, since you prefer to not only be closed-minded about modern scientific equiry, but stifle even a mention of it.

Denigration and ad hominem are not valid arguments. Claiming I have somehow ""lost"" an argument when I have not conceded and you have not only repeatedly avoided addressing issues raised and repeatedly responded with cheap shots is fatuous and petty. 

I have recently returned from a journey to visit two more people of my acquaintaince with cancer. I have watched other friends and relatives die of cancer, including one whose liver was so fucked up by chemotherapy he died within two months of being pronounced ""cured"". If cancer comes your way and at that time you are happy shut your eyes to alternative possibilities (like one of the people I just visited) and to volunteer for the tender mercies of orthodox medibusiness, then I sincerely hope you have the money and resolve to endure it with success and the very best of luck to you on that path. For my part, I am more interested in prevention and cure, rather than heroic treatment.

Just remember, 200 and more years ago, orthodox medicine long scoffed and censured ship captains who fed their crews citrus fruits and fresh vegetables whenever possible. There was no scientific proof that fresh food could cure scurvy, vitamin C was an unknown concept, and most doctors wouldn't tolerate their opinions being crossed by mere medically-unqualified sailormen and a minority of their medical colleagues, whom they opposed.

In your professional opinion, based on the rapid growth of several different varieties of superbugs in recent years, and the low selection and availability of the stronger antibiotics used to treat those specific superbugs, how long is it going to be before we're at the end of the veritable rope? Basically, when we create, either by accident or on purpose, a bug that for all intents and purposes can't be killed?

Also, do you believe that due to the chemical and genetic changes an organism goes through when becoming resistant to antibiotics, for example Staphylococcus Aureus becoming MRSA, that those superbugs have essentially evolved into a separate and improved organism? Could you say we've seen evolution happen before our very eyes, albeit on a very small scale

The search for new compounds seems to depend on the premise that if we look hard enough, we'll definitely find something, but I don't know if we check that premise as often as we should.

I recently discussed [this paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7535/abs/nature14098.html) that described the discovery of a new antibiotic called teixobactin for my journal club.



Question: Do you think the soil is a potential 'treasure trove' of novel antibiotic compounds and how long do you think it would take for pathogens to develop resistance against this particular compound, provided that we use this carefully?



**TL;DR** for those interested: the paper describes a way of cultivating bacteria from the soil in a chip with a semi-permeable membrane. This allowed them to grow bacteria *in situ* that cannot be grown in the lab, and select the ones with antimicrobial properties. They identified one such compound, called teixobactin, which has a similar function to vancomycin. The advantage is, however, that teixobactin affects more metabolic pathways, which - in theory - should make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance against.",Emptycoffeemug,t2_osdmw,1,0,reddit4

As someone completely unrelated to the field, I would really appreciate a broad overview of the current situation. You would best what such a description would include, but here are some questions I find interesting and which I guess could be important:

* How many different antibiotics are there available?
* How many ""superbugs"" are there?
* How harmful / dangerous are the current ""superbugs""?
* In how much time do you expect us to start seeing bacterial diseases which are immune / resistant to all available antibiotics?
* What are the world's healthcare systems doing to improve the situation? Are there actions that they should be taking, but aren't?
* What are the world's research centers (academic and otherwise) doing to improve the situation? Are there actions that they should be taking, but aren't?

On a more personal, proactive note, considering that I live in a developed country with a good healthcare system:

* What can I do to protect my elderly grandfather from ""superbugs"", considering he has no choice but to visit the hospital several times a year, and is sometimes kept there for several days next to other elderly folks with various illnesses?
* Is there anything I should do to protect my soon-to-be-born children from ""superbugs"", especially in their first months and years?

Unlike stairs or computer programs, though, you don't want pathogens to easily adapt. Related questions: Does this cause what one might call a ""learning process"" of evolution in superbugs? If a new antibiotic is not sufficiently novel or effective, should it be postponed or used extremely rarely, in order to prevent easily-bypassed evolution?

Computer simulations work when you have a known isolated target to start from - but most antibiotics have been discovered from what are called phenotypic screens, when you treat the whole organism (bacteria) and see if it lives or dies.  The molecular targets of most antibiotics have since been identified, but there are still some antibiotics (such as the polymyxins) where their exact mode of action remains poorly defined, despite being in use for over 50 years.  The target based approach has not been very successful for discovering new antibiotics - GSK wrote a paper on this in 2007 (Nature Rev Drug Disc 2007 p29)  Mark B

Just to add to my answer - part of the CO-ADD initiative is to establish a database of compounds correlated with antimicrobial activity under standardised conditions. The hope is that this would allow researchers to examine what types of physicochemical properties help produce antimicrobial activity, potentially allowing for more selective screening/synthesis of compounds in a similar fashion to rules focused on producing orally available compounds.

Existing antibiotics target most of the obvious ones, such as the peptidoglycan layer surrounding bacteria.  It has been very difficult to find new ones that actually work, and part of the problem is that bacteria are very efficient at getting rid of anything that tries to get inside them - they have efflux pumps that quickly expel drugs, and, especially for Gram-negative bacteria (like E. coli), have membranes that make it difficult for drugs to enter in the first place.  Bacteria are also very efficient at mutating targets so that drugs quickly become ineffective - especially protein targets. That is one of the reasons that the recent discovery of teixobactin received so much attention - it targets a non-protein cell wall component, so was proposed to potentially be resistance-proof.  Unfortunately, that is highly unlikely, as other antibiotics already target membrane components (i.e. colistin and polymyxin B target Lipid A), and these too have mutated to create resistance.

2) We do not use the iChip or do other forms of natural product screening - we feel that there are plenty of other researchers taking this approach, including companies and academics that are trying to grow bacteria/fungi in unusual conditions to force the generation of new natural products, or looking at genomic sequences for possible non-expressed unusual natural products. Our approach is to mine the synthetic chemistry world for unusual chemical diversity, from chemists who make weird and wonderful molecules for a range of reasons (method development, natural product synthesis) but never consider testing them for antimicrobial activity.

I see no clear signs that QS disruption will ever lead to a drug.  Yes, some bacteria upregulate virulence at high density, but basically, the signaling interactome *seems to be* way to complex to modify easily.  There are countless bacteria trying to talk to each other, and it seems like there's pretty god evidence your body is already producing a lot of QS ""noise"".  Disrupting this balance will *probably* just confuse all of the bacteria in your body.  Not necessarily a good thing.  So, maybe it will happen someday, but even in the basic research of QS, there's nothing even close to leading to a drug now.  At least not in those two bacteria.

I would compare the dream of QS agonism/antagonism therapy to the idea of using immunomodulation in the sick.  Is it possible? Yes.  Can we do it?  Sometimes.  Is it a common practice? No, because the immune system is so complex that it's difficult to know exactly what the response to a desired signal will be.  If anything, we've had some luck just dialing the immune system down so that our bodies don't kill us by rejecting organs or with fevers, but we have the tools to modify all kinds of cytokine levels, and virtually none of those tools are therapeutic.

One problem is most 'new' antibiotics are improved versions of existing antibiotics, so often the resistance mechanism remains in place.

cuufrd6,t1_cuucnsl,2015-09-08 14:35:49,science,"Maybe I can answer this for you. Different classes of antibiotics have different mechanisms of action. Penicillin and other β-lactams block the formation of the bacterial cell wall, erythromycin somehow blocks protein synthesis, etc etc. There are a couple of different ways that bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics. Some bacteria produce β-lactamase enzymes that destroy the penicillin before it can do its job. Others have a mutation in the protein that penicillin binds to, preventing the penicillin from binding and blocking the protein's action. For erythromycin, a mutation in the ribosome renders it ineffective. All of these forms of resistance carry with it some sort of cost. Proteins, like β-lactamase, are expensive to make. Mutations in the penicillin binding protein slow down bacterial cell wall construction, slowing down growth. Mutations in the ribosome slows down synthesis of proteins. All of these trade-offs mean that bacteria cannot compete as well in environments where their specific mutation does not help them. One of the hopes with new antibiotic discovery is that we will be able to find antibiotics that use a new mechanism to kill bacteria so that the counters that bacteria have evolved won't help them, and will even be a burden for them to keep around. This will, hopefully, eventually allow us to use our old antibiotics in conjunction with our new ones. That way if during treatment the bacteria develops a resistance to one type of antibiotic, it is *incredibly* unlikely that it will also evolve a resistance the the second type, and so will be taken out before it has a chance to spread to anywhere else.

Edit: I feel that I should add that it won't be as simple as just adding two antibiotics together and coming out on top.

Resistance is also a concern- the arms-race between bacteria and phages is well-documented in the scientific literature.

Another obstacle to rolling out phages is the ability to manufacture them cleanly.

- Yes, it is possible that rotating antibiotics would work.  In many cases, antibacterial resistance comes at a cost, and in the absence of the right selective pressures, that could mean the resistant bugs would be at a disadvantage.

- No one has directly studied this, as it is basically impossible in the lab (it would require a vast amount of time and space to determine if this phenomenon would occur, and how long it would take to happen).  It's possible that the time taken to lose resistance could be inferred from what we know about the mutation rates in certain species, the selective pressures applied by antibiotics, etc.

- You would have to mobilize basically all of humanity to give up access to drugs that may not work all of the time, but do work some of the time, for a potential future advantage.  This seems... difficult.

cuuea4l,t1_cuuclnx,2015-09-08 13:47:13,science,"Obviously not Mr. Blaskovich, but speaking as a clinical pharmacist, there are a handful of reasons the length of the course of therapy varies.  For starters, the drugs themselves can be grouped on how effective they are at killing or impairing the microbe with a relationship of required concentration and length of time required at said concentration.  This distinction comes down to the mechanism through which the drug attacks the microbe.

Time-dependent activity is maximized when the dosing regimen produces a level of drug consistently above the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration, or, the concentration of drug required to stop visible growth), i.e. there is minimal additional effect from increasing the dose once concentration is >MIC. [ex. include penicillins & cephalosporins] 

Concentration-dependent activity is a direct, positive relationship where an increase in drug concentration is associated with greater speed & extent of kill rates.  [ex. include ciprofloxacin & metronidazole (Flagyl)] 

Now we face the issue of the distribution of the drug in your body, your body eliminating/excreting the drug, & varying degrees of tissue penetration --> just because a given drug is effective at treating the responsible microbe does not mean it can be used.

So for instance some urinary tract infections, the drug is readily excreted in the urine so you are going to achieve very high concentrations right at the site of infection which enables (on average) relatively short courses of therapy.  Other drugs (I'm looking at you ""Z-paks""/azithromycin) have a long half-life in your body so they are present at substantial concentrations for a long period of time, thus allowing for the common 5-day blister-pack treatment (the appropriateness of those is a different discussion).

Also, often a small distinction of 10 vs 14 days is a matter of clinical judgement based off of the specific patient & the severity of infection.

>say you only take 6 days of a 10 day course? How is that bad, meaning why is it supposedly bad not to finsh a prescribed course of drugs?

I feel like I've already talked a lot & I have no idea how much you actually care to read so I'll make this concise.  

Don't picture an infection as a singular, defined event with antibiotics as the counter.  Think of a given infection in terms of warfare = there are a given number of bacteria/enemies hidden throughout a forest & the antibiotics are supporting artillery.  Each round of firing (= dose or pill) kills a flat % which varies depending on the selection of ammunition.  If you stop early, there is still enough of the enemy force to regroup and continue on with the attack or worse they now know about the inner-workings of your artillery and will be protected/immune in the next fight.

A simplified version is that, depending on the type of infection, where it is located, and what type of antibiotic is prescribed, antibiotic treatments can act more or less effectively.
The second part of your question is really important - TAKING 6 DAYS OF A 10 DAY COURSE HELPS DEVELOP ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE!!  The reason is, after 6 days you may still have a small population of surviving bacteria. If you don't take the last 4 days, which hopefully kills them all off, you now have a population of bacteria that have been exposed to an antibiotic and survived, meaning it is quite likely they have started to develop resistance.

Narrow spectrum compounds are certainly another approach, but in general I think this will be difficult with small molecules - other than selectivity between Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, the number of compounds that we see with selective activity for only one strain is very limited.

For example, lactam antibiotics (like penicillin) disrupt a key building block of the bacterial cell wall, peptidoglycan, which mammalian cells don't have.
Yes, the first test for selectivity once an active compound is found is to counterscreen for toxicity against a mammalian cell. If it kills the mammalian cell at the same concentration as the bacterial cell, there's not much point in following on with it.

As demonstrated by countries where OTC antibiotics are available, we need to rely on prescriptions to defend against overuse, promoting resistance. A lot of antibiotic are generic, so prescriptions often are not that expensive, especially when you consider they might be saving your life.
The only OTC antibiotics should be things like topical creams to prevent infections in cuts and scrapes - anything systemic (pill) must have a prescription to prevent people taking them when they don't really have an infection.

Several research groups are conducting clinical trials different cocktails - the main problem with phage therapy is the bacteriophages are quite strain specific, which is good in avoiding collateral damage, but bad if you don't know what you are infected with, or have a strain that varies from what the phages can kill.

Specifically, I think the first two outcomes are much more likely than the third.  I understand that there are some papers about this, and I have only read a review or two, but here's my take:

- Collateral resistance is fairly likely to occur, and it occurs all of the time.  For example, a single mutation confers narrow resistance to a single class of drugs (beta lactamase) or too diverse drugs (efflux pump mutations).  There's plenty of evidence of this happening.

- Also, the second case (limited effect) is fairly common.  Most antibiotic resistances don't have an effect on other antibiotic resistances.  We know this because we can make MDR bugs in the lab (we do it all of the time for cloning purposes) and we get what we select for, virtually all of the time.

- The third case, collateral sensitivity, is certainly possible, but seems the least likely to arise, because it generally relies on specific interactions, where as most such interactions are fairly general (again, efflux pumps, or when a single mutation confers resistance to a class of drugs and not just one drug).  So far, collateral resistance studies are relatively few and they generally aren't reproducible even within different strains of the same bacteria (which, to my knowledge, is usually E. coli).  Even if this all worked out perfectly, all you'd really be able to do is decrease the selective pressure of multi-drug resistant pathogens, and in high-antibiotic environments, there's no proof that MDR drugs aren't fit enough to still become CAI or HAI.

Furthermore, many infections are due to multiple pathogens, and it remains unclear how you would cycle drugs in such instances.

And then there's the main problem: who is going to tell everyone what drugs to use, and when?  Yes, there is tantalizing evidence on both sides of the argument, but it won't matter if there's no governmental body that can execute a plan on the global scale.

cuuh44n,t1_cuugk7j,2015-09-08 15:17:07,science,"Well, there's a few things that come into play from what I've seen while I was on clinical rotations at the hospital.  First, you've got to think about where the infection is at (Tissue, lungs, blood, brain/central nervous system, etc...).  Some drugs don't work very well in the lung tissues (the surfactant can cause problems), some drugs don't penetrate into tissue (so they remain almost entirely in the blood) so they may be good for bugs that stay in the blood, others goes into the tissue extensively so they wouldn't work good for a blood-bug.

Then, there's a whole slew of what we call ""Empiric treatment"".  This basically means that over times we've seen that bugs X, Y, and Z are typical in skin/soft tissue infections.  Since we know that these bugs are likely to be causing the problem, we can choose drug A and B to give us empiric coverage until we get the lab tests back.  A common antibiotic combination would be giving Vancomycin (which covers our gram-positive bugs), and Piperacillin/tazobactam (which covers our gram-positive and gram-negative bugs).  We double-up on the gram-positive coverage typically because of MRSA and the fact that some other bugs in the gram-positive spectrum can mutate to cause susceptibility problems.  [Here's a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/34qjnp/spectrum_coverage_of_antibiotics_as_a_chart/) from /r/medicalschool that gives you an idea of what drugs cover which group of bacteria.  [The first comment](http://wellingtonicu.com/Data/Antibiotic%20Overview.pdf) gives a similar chart that breaks down bacteria groups a little bit more.

The MD's and DO's may have some other methods that they used for susceptibility that I may not be aware of, but this is how I approached antibiotic selection as a pharmacist.  

Another tool I can use as a reference is an [antibiogram](http://errolozdalga.com/medicine/assets/images/website/StanfordAntibiogram.GNR.900width.gif).  Every year, each hospital makes a graph of different bacteria, drugs that were used, and the number/percent of cases where the bacteria was susceptible to a drug.  This helps us see resistance-patterns from year-to-year.",WhitestKidYouKnow,t2_4754a,2,0,reddit4
cuvgeyc,t1_cuugk7j,2015-09-09 10:51:52,science,"An excellent question, and good detailed response below.
It highlights one of the key issues that needs to be addressed - a rapid diagnostic that can quickly identify whether a bacterial infection exists, what type of bacteria it is, and what the resistance profile is. This would allow rapid treatment with the correct antibiotic the first time, rather then the hit and miss method currently used. Proper diagnosis still takes >24h as a culture step is required. This is one advance we could make in the next 5 years that would have a real impact. There's a significant prize - The Longitude Prize, trying to encourage this research.

cuv65so,t1_cuutbng,2015-09-09 02:28:02,science,"When it comes to bacteria, they already have certain genes in them (or they could potentially mutate in the future of their existence) which may cause them to become resistant to drugs.  It's not always over-dosing or over-exposure.  Sometimes the little bastards get a random mutation which allows them to be one step closer to being immune (or it's a giant leap toward becoming immune all-together; ie: a modified pump that removes our antibiotics from the bacterial cell).

Overconsumption/overprescribing becomes a problem when we are pelting these bacteria with a drug that may or may not be effective against them.  While they replicate, they're also mutating.  With each replication, there's a chance that the new bacterial cell had a mutation which leads to antibiotic resistance.

Let's say a doctor prescribes a drug for a respiratory illness (pneumonia).  It may be VIRAL or BACTERIAL.  Let's say in this case it's viral.  The doctor prescribes Azithromycin (a common anti-BIOTIC for respiratory illnesses), it doesn't work against viruses.  Even if the bacteria present may not be causing the illness, it still becomes exposed to the drug...

Eventually, the illness goes away (on day 3 or 4 the patient feels better and doesn't take the last day(s) of treatment).  Perhaps the illness went away before the full course of the antibiotics (typical azithromycin treatment is 5 days).  The bacteria in the lungs that has been exposed to a drug (azithromycin), may not have been main culprit for causing the illness in the first place.  The bacteria has now been exposed to the drug, and it also has the potential for developing the genes necessary to become resistant to our initial drug (azithromycin).

two weeks down the road, the patient falls ill with another respiratory illness.  Doctor has a few options: (1) give azithromycin again, in hopes that we can kill the bacteria that is probably causing the infection, OR, (2) give a different drug (Levofloxacin, Levaquin (R)). 

At this point, we can hopefully kill off the bug with the old drug (though, it COULD potentially gain resistance), or we use a different class entirely in hopes that we can kill it off with one of our 'big guns' of antibiotics.

Overconsumption poses a problem because we're giving bacteria a little taste (exposure) to the drugs.  Their job is similar to ours: Survival of the fittest.  

If we give them little obstacles (doses) to overcome it, even if it may not be an appropriate choice, they learn to get past the obstacles.  Giving too many antibiotics can lead to strains of bacteria to become easily resistant to the drugs.

Where it gets tricky is that some people can have a antibiotic drug in their body, but their immune system fights it off.  So then we've got different bacteria (both the same susceptibility, in theory), but one person has been exposed to a multitude of drugs.  If this bacteria infects another person, we've got to then step up our game and start using our 'big guns' to treat them.

Overconsumption also is a problem when patients go to the doctor and expect to walk out with a prescription.  Not all illnesses require a drug.  I know that in America, many people expect a drug to be prescribed for each visit to the doctor.  Some illnesses are viral (influenza), and are not cured by antibiotics, but the doctors almost feel forced to prescribe an antibiotic to cover their asses (it's common, but I understand the mentality).

cuul20b,t1_cuuj5fg,2015-09-08 17:01:53,science,"This is a bit misleading. Computational modeling in drug design/discovery generally starts with a crystalline structure of your desired target. For example, lets say you're targeting a protein kinase responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in bacteria. You first screen your library of compounds (most big pharma companies have a million+ compounds in their libraries). When you find a compound that effectively inhibits your target's activity, you can crystallize the protein with the compound (called an inhibitor). Literally thousands of protein targets have been crystallized with bound inhibitors and the resulting structures have been deposited in the protein data bank for everyone to utilize(PDB http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). 

Once you have a crystalline structure with a bound inhibitor, you have a huge amount of information regarding the structure of the protein in its inhibited state. This is where the computational modeling comes into play; you remove the bound inhibitor (using specific programs: Autodock or dockblaster are free software, Sybyl is a paid software with much wider applications) and replace it with other compounds you think may fit into the now empty space. The computer programs take into account many factors (namely sterics and electrostatic interactions) to determine which of your compounds best fit into the binding pocket. The computer then scores your molecules based upon which ones fit the best. It is then up to the user to decide if the computational output is reasonable or complete garbage. The chemist then synthesizes these compounds and screens them against the protein target to see if the computational output matches actual solution-phase experiments. 

While this sounds great, there are limitations, namely the fact that you're basing all of the output on a crystalline structure of your target protein. Think of it as a picture of a moving object. Although the picture displays the object and it's actual structure for some point in time, the object can move and change shape. What the computer determines is a good fit for your crystalline structure may not be a good fit for the enzyme in motion. Thus, sometimes computational output provides garbage data and this is why we are not yet at the point that we can use a computer to generate a molecule that is a ""best fit"" for a target protein pocket.",bassx901,t2_d45jz,18,0,reddit4

cuuly5g,t1_cuul8ta,2015-09-08 17:25:05,science,"Essentially yes. At this point in time, most computational modeling is based upon inhibited protein crystalline structures. Although this is a static picture of the protein, it is a static picture in which the free energy of the protein is at a minimum with a bound inhibitor. This provides a very informative static picture. 

Many factors are in play regarding the conformational changes of a protein (solution environment, temperature, free energy, etc.). It is not possible to simulate all of these factor simultaneously. Therefore, the best model we currently have for an inhibited enzyme is the crystalline structure with bound inhibitors. 

Regarding off target binding, there are generally two binding mechanisms for small molecules binding to proteins (specifically enzymes in this case): 1. at the active site 2. at an allosteric site. Depending upon your modeling program, you can allow the computer to attempt to dock your compounds at both of these sites simultaneously. The computer will tell you which site works best for that compound and provides a score (basically an arbitrary number that is only useful to differentiate two or more compounds). 

Finally, you've hit the nail on the head regarding nonspecific binding. If you read the label for any drug available today, you'll read about the numerous side-effects these drugs have. This is due to nonspecific binding or the binding of your drug to a site it wasn't intended to bind to. Many times, this is due to metals being included in many enzymes. Some drugs bind very strongly to metals and therefore bind to many enzymes within your body. This causes adverse effects that big pharma is required to disclose. If the side-effects are tolerable (and this is disease dependent, i.e. chemotherapy drugs have terrible side-effects but are tolerable because the alternative is patient death), you can bring a drug to market.

Hopefully, some compounds of your chemical series will be more specific binders than others.

When you contribute to a pension that money doesn't get ear marked for you and by the time you retire every single dollar you've contributed has been spent. This means all of your pension payments must come from the contributions of those who are currently employed. But work force participation among young men is taking a nose dive and people are having significantly less children. All this adds up to a pension system that cannot survive unless the retirement age is drastically increased to the point where most people will not retire or young workers will need to be crushed with 25-35% of their gross pay going to pensions schemes. Neither are good solutions tho.,NEWSmodsareTwats,t2_6z8qzgc2,3,0,reddit1

hw9ocgu,t1_hw8c997,2022-02-09 20:01:19,science,"> Retirement figures even today are largely based on the assumption of home ownership/no mortgage or rent

The problem with ""no mortgage/rent"" is that its a misleading idea that its free to live in your home after its paid off.  I owe money on my mortgage still and my monthly nut on the property tax escrow is roughly half of my prinicipal+interest portion combined.  So even if I pay off my mortgage, I'm still looking at a monthly expense a third of what I'm paying now, plus utilities, to keep living here.

And none of this includes the costs of updates to the house to keep it up.  We're currently remodeling a kitchen that had actually been remodeled in the early 1990s.  We've done one bathroom down to the studs, a big remodeling in 2003, HVAC 20 years ago (now its on borrowed time), most all of the windows, the roof...  It just never ends, some of the stuff we did in 2003 (a deck on a new garage) needs to be replaced.

I'm in my mid-50s and my wife is emotionally attached to staying in our house, but I keep telling her we're going to want to move elsewhere based on property taxes alone, but cost of ownership and upkeep are also serious considerations.",OperationMobocracy,t2_124wre,11,0,reddit1

That seems like a solid middle-class income especially when you add in social security. But if that's per adult, a couple would need 3-4 million or 120-160k per year before social security or a pension if you're lucky enough to have one. Obviously it depends on your cost of living, but that seems way higher than what most would need.

Generally speaking, people tend to spend less in retirement, so I don't think the typical couple would need more than the typical (or median) household income. The typical household income in the U.S. at least is about $70k per year so that does seem to align with the 1.5-2 million retirement target.

If you have a house paid off and have a $12k/mo lifestyle, you're doing something very wrong. 750k-1M per person is very adequate if you're being mindful of expenses and don't need to live in some wealthy neighborhood in the middle of a capital city for no good reason. 

That amount of money is far from an impossibility to raise over the course of a career. Requires investing $750-1000/mo (average) per person for 30 years. Two average jobs with matching 401k can swing that in low-medium cost of living areas if you're careful. That's $12-15/day + employer match, I guarantee you half of this sub wastes money like that on disposable expenses. You can't base your retirement amount on averages, that includes numbers for areas like NYC, LA, San Fran that anyone without a six figure job should immediately move from if they want a future.

It requires a decent job, frugality, and a lot of patience. It shouldn't have to be as difficult as it is to retire, but it is, so we have to deal with the hand we've been dealt, unfortunately. Mainly because retirement isn't really optional, eventually health is going to force your hand.

Since we're focusing just on men... The original math you quoted counted on over 46% of the male population dying before being able to collect a penny.  Of the nearly 54% who survived, over half would be dead in 13 years, and the mortality rate would then increase substantially after that (meaning it wasn't a bell curve, it was left skewed, and most would die within about 5 years of age 78).  So 75% of people were expected to be dead before they could collect anywhere near what they paid in, and most of the last 25% would only see about a 3-5 year net benefit.  

Now that the average male life expectancy is over 75, and not ""75% of people who paid in will be dead by then and 90%+ within 5 years after that"", the costs are understandably unsustainable.

hw9rtxy,t1_hw9agfn,2022-02-09 20:22:47,science,"Right, but it also comes down to the way in which social security is marketed to the public.  Because most people are selfish, and wouldn't support a program for old/disabled people that they don't personally know and won't ever meet in their lifetime.  

So, because it is marketed that way, ""some people"" die could reasonably be assumed to be less than 46%+ of the people who paid into the system while seeing no benefit whatsoever, and 80%+ dying before being paid back just their principle, which was the expectation when the system was originally implemented. 

I think Rick Perry is a moron as much most others on this site, but describing Social Security as a ""government sanctioned Ponzi Scheme"" was one of the most accurate statements he ever made. 

All of that said, I support Social Security, at least in principle, if not the specific current format (things like the earnings cap, the fact that if I work to 70, I'll be paying in for 54 years, but only seeing 35 of benefits, etc. etc.).

Now, assuming retirement at 65 and having worked at least 30 years (SS), one would get about 1563 (likely would have more since it's California but we will use average all the same).  So about 18.5k is taken care of by SS.

We have a need of 72-18.5, or $53.5k a year.  That comes out to $1,037,900 needed to be saved for retirement to be able to live on an income of 72k a year for 19.4 years in retirement. 

So a small bit over 1 mil. 

Now, quick looks show SS for someone making 75k a year would be closer to 2300 a month but we can just assume SS will not be paying same so we won't dig deeper into that.

1 mil can be gotten with investing 3k per year from the 18 (and never any more assuming average returns of 7%).  

Since the person is retiring on 72k a year, we can presume that they at least were making minimum that amount for half their life working.  So very reasonable to be able to put 4% of your pay into retirement then.",hawklost,t2_in8z1,4,0,reddit1

It does not require a doubling of participants every time a payment is made to a current beneficiary or a geometric increase in the number of participants.  In its essence, Social Security is a contract between generations""

It's no more a ""ponzi scheme"" than a mortgage is; in both cases, it's someone (worker/lender) paying now in exchange for the promise that they'll get paid later (by next-gen worker/borrower).",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit1

BPA is only harmful at exposure levels radically above those regular folks are exposed to, and is rapidly cleared from the body (it does not accumulate from low, regular exposure).

By the way I think this is actually an important point: it's actually a good idea to think about this when planning! Plan for what your *needs* are; how can you set yourself up to not be able to afford anything like traveling or the latest consumer goods, but you can afford to idly sit in a chair and stare at the clouds if you want. That frees you from the cycle of working to live to work. Now all work becomes for a purpose: you earn money because you *want* something, and once you have that thing, you can quit working again.

Here's their conclusion:

-----------

Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 2 minutes **AND** **MOVE**. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and move for a couple of minutes.  Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is **FREE**! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).

At work I have one of those cubes with two desk surfaces on two sides, so one side is raised up and the other at normal sitting height. I stand on an antifatigue mat in my socks (I wear slip on shoes so it's easy to get in and out). I stand for most of the day while taking sitting breaks for lunch and meetings and whatnot. I am not someone with a lot of aches and pains, this was more just preventative medicine and sitting down so much made me feel gross. I feel more alert and awake and my body feels great, no complaints. A few things:

 
* Going from one extreme to the other will probably not help, you need to take breaks from standing occasionally and you HAVE to shift and move regularly, regardless if you are sitting or standing.

 
* If you are someone who does little exercise or is overweight you should probably work on those things before trying standing or you could end up making things worse or hurting yourself, same thing if you have foot/leg problems

 
* Unless you have the most comfortable shoes in the universe (or special prescription shoes), don't wear them while standing on a mat. I did this with shoes that I LIKED and I got tired much faster. With just my socks on the mat it takes many hours before I feel like I need a sit/walk break. I have pretty healthy feet so this works for me.

 
* Again, regardless of sitting or standing you have to MOVE. Not moving is what makes your back hurt while sitting and your legs hurt while standing. If you don't move then don't be surprised when problems occur. And you don't necessarily need some treadmill desk to move regularly, shake/shift/move your legs and take walking breaks regularly and your legs won't be sore unless you're doing something else wrong.

 
I also have a sit/stand setup with an Ikea desk at home which works just as well. Incorporating standing into my computer time has worked excellently for me and I intend on continuing to do it.

Before I could spend hours apathetic on my desk chair, browsing websites without finding the motivation to work. This problem is now gone. Sleepiness problems after a meal, gone as well. My back is much stronger too. EDIT: it is more tiring and it's a good thing. I now have much less trouble sleeping in a 24h schedule.

There are drawbacks however, my mistake was that I went from 100% sitting, no external physical activity to standing 10 hours a day. After a few weeks I noticed that my feet have started to swell (pitting edema). I read about it and learned that the heart alone is not enough to move the blood from the lower legs, the veins here have little valves that are activated by muscle movement and the pulsing pressure at the soles of the feet when walking. When standing, this doesn't happen and blood circulation is not good. I'm relatively tall (190cm) so it's probably not helping. As a programmer it's very hard for me to interrupt my work every 20 minutes to go for a walk, but I'm looking for solutions.

It is also very important to have a good posture, so as not to put tension on the spine, and to avoid leaning on the desk. I have an arched back so I must actively correct it while standing, but I think it is improving.

Overall the advantages far surpass the disadvantages for me so I'll continue to work standing. I recommend anyone to at least try it for a few weeks and make an opinion.",urquan,t2_3n9pa,2,0,reddit2

No, you should also have a tall chair that allows you to sit and work at your higher work surface and you should take one break every hour to walk around for 5 minutes (I set an alarm for this). Standing will engage major muscle groups and will fatigue you the first several weeks. This is where sitting down a bit is important. Flexibility is another important issue to keep in mind. Tight hamstrings are a major contributor to lower back problems. Standing all day will give you tight hamstrings so a daily exercise and stretching regimen is also necessary. 

Standing at my keyboard jockey job has made a major difference for me and allowed me to continue to work. It is important to note that standing alone is not a magic bullet, but simply one component to a number of things that lead to better health. ",architimmy,t2_35jhj,1,0,reddit2

Then I took my treadmill and took off the entire top part so only the treadmill was left.  Then i set in front of the treadmill my top part of the treadmill so i can access it with my feet or bending over easily.

The first month using it was pretty intense.  I did it bare foot and had a speed of around a 90 minute mile.  After a few weeks my feet had strong enough muscles.  I now do it on an easy 60 minute mile.  Which seems small but doing this for a few hours a day is burning an extra 1000 calories a day.

It has also helped my posture a ton.

Indeed it would... but so does sitting all day. That's the whole point of this: Breaking the strained constant posture whatever it is. Moving and being on your feet, not being in the same static position all day, keeping your joints and muscles flexible -- these things are good. Currently we live in a society where most people are immobile due to sitting all day. Thus, people introduce an office setup where they can stand and work still to counter the current reason for being stuck in the certain posture, which is sitting.

No one's saying you gotta choose to work either sitting or standing all day. 

>more manufacturers are offering desks that *let* workers stand, or even walk, while toiling at the keyboard

There's no forced standing going on. Tbh, you ought to go back and forth.

c7a0jc2,t1_c79zxmj,2012-12-02 14:02:07,science,"I'm going over their section ""Why standing up is bad for you"". The dangers they list for standing are:

* **""it is more tiring"":** ...Okay, as long as I don't exhaust myself doing it, I don't see the problem.

* **""for men with ischemic heart disease it increases the progression of carotid atherosclerosis because of the additional load on the circulatory system"":** Pretty sure I haven't got ischemic heart disease, so I'm all good.

* **""increases the risks of varicose veins"":** While not exactly a serious condition, sure, I would not want varicose veins. That said, I'd very much like to know what that increased risk actually is; I suspect again this is something that would happen to people aged 50+ or something, not something I need to worry about for years.

* **""accounts for more than one fifth of all cases of working age"":** ""working age""? This makes zero sense to me.

* **""The performance of many fine motor skills also is less good when people stand rather than sit"":** I'm not performing surgery, so I think I'm good to go.

* **""Standing puts greater strain on the circulatory system and on the legs and feet"":** Again, my lungs, legs and feet are fucking strong enough to handle *standing*. It's so wrong to use this as an overall danger of standing. If your lungs, legs or feet can't handle fucking standing, then you have a condition or are old enough that it is obvious you should not be standing for hours.

So of all their arguments against standing, only one has me moderately concerned. This makes standing desks look pretty damn good to me.

c7a3i74,t1_c79zxmj,2012-12-02 18:18:26,science,"That reference is pretty useless and outdated. First, it's based on ergonomics and not on medical reasons. The simple way to counter all of what it says is by knowing that standing significantly increases your risk of death, period. Everything on the ergonomics list is minor compared to that. 

One could go into the details of the individual times, as many of them are baseless (the fine motor thing makes absolutely no sense, and standing using more energy is probably a good thing for most office workers), but I don't think any of them are as relevant as death.

That said, there are some nuggets of truth. Being in any position for too long is bad for you, so whether you're sitting or standing you should be taking regular breaks to be in other positions. I think standing makes this more obvious because it's more active, so you will actually become sore and stiff if you don't. Anecdotally when I started standing I didn't take stretch breaks and then wound up with all sorts of back and leg tightness issues as a result, so now I do stretching several times daily to counter that. Also, their points about desk position are critical, as that's easy to get wrong when standing.

c7a581w,t1_c7a1fiq,2012-12-02 20:09:53,science,"I contemplated the adjustable shelf brackets actually. I was worried about weight, since I have a lot of computers. I was going to use [these shelving brackets](http://www.busybeetools.com/products/SHELVING-WALL-STRAP-2PCS-24IN..html) that I use in my garage for lumber storage.

I ended up using [this shelf](http://whalenstorage.com/category/Garage-Industrial/group/Racks/48%20inch%205%20Shelf%20Storage%20Rack) that I got for dirt cheap at Costco. The middle shelf can only be in one position, however, and I wanted to use that on as the base for the keyboard/mouse surface, so I placed the whole thing on a simple platform I made with 2x4's and casters. I also attached a 4' power strip on the back, connected to a UPS on the bottom shelf. I can actually move my entire work network to another room without powering anything down.

The setup has been pretty successful, but I realised that I probably need more horizontal space so I am planning on grabbing one of [these](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/industrial-strength-welded-storage-rack-with-wire-deck/925733) which has the advantage of allowing the shelves to be placed anywhere, and you can buy individual components to expand it if you want more shelves, or a section on the side. (You can get narrower versions of the shelves) Also, since the parts are so substantial, it's a lot easier to attach things to the beams by drilling through them without worrying about weakening them.

I'm still in the process of fixing my sadle back via stretching, but ive stopped having back pain by doing full rom heavy squats. It took me less than 6 weeks to stop the daily pain.

Your mileage will vary but some parts might be helpful:

1) get a chair with a seat plate that can tilt   **forwards** giving some pelvic tilt. I got [this one]( http://www.costco.ca/Pro-Line%E2%84%A2-II--Deluxe-Air-Grid-Back----Ergonomic-Office-Chair.product.10345999.html) from costco.   It's not clear from the write up but it DOES tilt forward - and very popular, check the comments.

2) with this chair at maximum forward tilt I use a non-stick pad between my bum and the chair to stop my bum from sliding forward all day.  this is simple, cheap and effective.

3) [use this](http://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/wireless-trackball-m570?crid=8) logitech thumball instead of a normal mouse.  If you have any kind of mouse arm/wrist pain you owe it to yourself to at least try this thing.  Takes about three hours to get comfortable. (Even switch back and forth between this and a mouse.)  The beauty of this is that just your hand moves, rather than your whole arm.

4) Adjust the chair to make sure it is high enough.  Even now I tend to adjust a new chair to much too low of a position at first for keyboard work.

5) get up and walk around when your back starts to feel uncomfortable.

6) if any of this works for you, you owe me a beer.  I need to recoup 20 years of R&D  :)",bare_in_mind,t2_9657g,2,0,reddit2

c7a140m,t1_c7a0jc2,2012-12-02 15:10:09,science," I think I can explain what working age is through my own experience with what I believe it is. As a person who was a hairstylist for 9 years, I can tell you standing has a lot more downsides than what you posted.

My average work day involved standing up for 8 hours with my arms elevated at a position that would roughly mimic using a keyboard and mouse, I am 27 now. I wore orthopaedic shoes and followed the stretches and exercises outlined by the work health and safety board. I did everything I was supposed to do, but sadly I can no longer do my job and have to go back to school because standing for 9 years has caused me to have : 

lower back pain, Upper back pain, Sciatica, Arthritis in my knees and ankles, my hip may have to be replaced because you will at some point with out even realizing it, lock your hip to one side or the other to release weight pressure from your legs when they get tired, oh and seized muscles in both of my shoulders and elbows, and the back of my heels.

 Moving is very hard to do for me, and if it's cold out? I can hardly get out of bed. I have been in physiotherapy for 2 years now and I am only just brushing the surface of fixing the things that are wrong with me. 

I still can't walk for more than 2 hours without being useless for the rest of the night. My legs do this thing now, where, if I sit down for more than 15 minutes at a time all my muscles tighten up so much that I actually have to stretch for 5 minutes to be able to walk upright again. 

 it is very painful, and frustrating because I am an active person, I can't go for hikes or long bike rides any more, which were two activities I loved. I can't even style my own hair any more let alone anyone elses, and sometimes I need help taking my own shirt off. 

Obviously, I am an extreme case and I have no idea why, since there is no history of arthritis or muscle disease in my family. this apparently just happened to me from standing all day, there is no underlying disease, my body just gave up on me. 

Standing may be good for you.. but not for 8 hours, it is killer. I think that there will be a rise in work related injuries because of this, simply because no one will be able to hold proper standing posture for 8 hours straight it is almost impossible. again I am 27...these things should not be happening to me.  That in a nutshell is working age...it's when your work ages you, or at least that's what it should mean, if it doesn't already.
Ask anyone with a stand up job...they probably have some or all of the ailments I do. Offices just need to stop griping so much about productivity and give people more breaks if they are so worried about worker health. Making it so they have to stand is, in my opinion, a terrible idea.",tankgirl85,t2_5vgyh,114,0,reddit2

1.

In fact changing your study spaces demonstrably improves recall [source](http://lifehacker.com/5631680/change-up-your-study-spaces-for-better-recall).  

2. We need to take a really hard look at what and how we teach our kids if its ""boring subject matters.""  First most of these can be *made interesting* but only superficial and or well intentioned but misguided effort is made to make them interesting.

Then it comes to going to the GP and demanding that SOMETHING is wrong; I was waking up every day with back pain, headaches, stomach pain, persistent muscle aches. I would wake up every day feeling like I was dying at first. 

Then I started seeing a therapist, and it turned out I had some negative emotions I had buried in me for years that instead came out physically, and I know that sounds stupid, but psychosomatic disorders are commonly misdiagnosed as pain from ""standing at work too much"", ""fibromyalgia"" etc.. They can especially be exacerbated by stress. 

Through two types of therapy, drug and talk, things began to get better. You might remember things in your past, but the emotions tied to them can be so strong and you realize you have never let them out healthily. Anti-depressant Cymbalta (it was literally magic) helped with my daily pain. I wasn't a believer in a psych drugs but it's very very helpful in the kind of pain you are talking about (arthritis etc). However, it was after talk therapy that the emotions we are talking about began to appear out of nowhere. I was blindsided by how intensely upset I was about my past, when I had always shrugged it off. I started to get better and better.

You can just float psychosomatic symptoms at your next doctors visit. The brain and body are extremely intertwined (as my doctors would repeat over and over to me while I thought I still had something else wrong until I started to get it), with cases as extreme as a man who saw his wife die and so the next day he was paralyzed for life, but no one knew why. The mind and body can be strange.

I'm not saying this is you, but hearing you talk, I am 24 and I have been in pain since I was 19 and it all sounds so familiar so I just want to throw it out there. It took a long time for me to come to realize that I had internalized a lot of grief, pain, anger, resentment that became physical daily pain. I'm still nowhere near top of my game, but I started down a road that for once ( talk therapy after 4 months and I am ten times better than 2 years of physical therapy ) has me feeling like THIS ISN'T GOING TO LAST FOREVER! Primary doctors aren't going to jump on somatic disorders very quickly, and will say many other things unless they are a therapist. So you need to bring it up if you think it applies to you.

It can have some stigma attached to it such as, I'm not depressed, I haven't experienced any trauma, I'm not an anxious perso etc. but I got past that and learned stuff about myself that is almost scary I didn't know before. Maybe this will help somebody, It's given me hope.

What sort of stretches/exercises were these? How often were you doing them? How often and much you do them is most significant. Also, most of those are extremely generalized and more than likely not as effective as they could be. =/

Did you exercise regularly during your 8 years? Strength training AT LEAST twice a week, aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week.  I studied Exercise Science in school and we read a study that talked about Strength training and its affects on Rheumatoid arthritis. It presented significantly positive results. (This was a year or so ago and I do not have the exact paper study, but I can email my professor if he still has the link if you would want it). RA is reversible to a point. The problems you have are more than likely reversible, EVEN THOUGH, they are extreme. You may not have RA, which would be even better.

I know you are an extreme case, and you could have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but proper, well structured exercise can be extremely effective against occupational imbalances. I am sure you have noticed this from your physical therapy. PT is very site specific.

A suggestion, look for a REALLY good Personal Trainer. Who has experience/knowledge with arthritic patients. It might be cheaper than a Physical Therapist. I suggest to do so after you have developed a solid base from the PT.",globi227,t2_70ime,1,0,reddit2

As for your second point about learning...

Whether you agree with it or not, our system is in place for one main reason, to assist our children to becoming functional adults. It is not for *learning*.

Point 1. Our system is not designed to produce geniuses. Nor is it equipped to deal with full-fledged physical teaching formats. It is limited to a small room (so that one teacher may supervise many children with low risk and low space requirements), and limited to *all* students learning styles. Some students learn better physically, some visually, some auditory. Some have affinity for nature, some for tech, some for art, etc.. It is not a system for learning, it is a system to get *all* students through *all* hoops (standardized tests and curriculum).

Point 2. The current curriculum already requires *massive* (ask any teacher how many hours they put in) amounts of manpower to produce.

Try sitting on a chair and looking straight down at an object 2 feet in front of you and that is at hip hight. Is your face mere inches from the object? Stand and do the same. From which posture would you rather be at when working on the 98.6-102 degree bowels of an animal/human. The reasons you stated are also very important too. Posture is a big problem in surgery.

I am good at keeping my emotions out in the open, I'm not one to hold things in. I have had a hard life and a lot of bad things have happened, but I know them and have delt with them and feel pretty good about coming out on the other side.

 I am also weary of therapy and anti depressants, almost everyone 
I know is on an anti depressant and I find most of their life conversation revolves around their appointments, their medications and what the doctor told them. I don't want to turn into that kind of person because those people bother me. 

I get that they need help but and maybe at some point i will need help too, but I don't want my life to become all about me. I feel this is a dangerous path to walk down. As for past traumas? If there is one in my past that is so bad to cause the physical distress I am in, I'm not so sure I want to remember it. 

I feel like dealing with what is wrong now and moving on is better than trying to figure out if something bad has happened to me. My sister went down that path and ended up in a psych ward for a year and was all kinds of messed up before she was able to figure herself out. At least physical pain can be managed and removed from my life in time. If I suddenly remember something bad happening? that may change my life forever, and there may be no coming back from it. So I won't go down that road.

In this case though, I really think it is the standing all day that screwed me up because these types of injuries are common in people in my profession, due to standing, and repetitive motions. we get a pamphlet in hair school about all the different things that can happen and the best ways to prevent things like carpal tunnel and degenerative disk. Plus my doc and physiotherapist agree on what's wrong with me.

I've taken Cymbalta for a long time, but for emotional pain/fatigue rather than physical.

It saddens me to think of how many people may suffer needlessly due to lack of knowledge or societal pressures that keep them from accepting medical help.

The last thing I want to say before I step down from my soapbox is this: any form of therapy (drug or otherwise) should be viewed for what it is; a way to enhance the lives of a person who is suffering enough that they are at an equal level of their ""healthy"" counterparts.

c7a29yl,t1_c7a0ozz,2012-12-02 16:51:56,science,"Actually, you're not applying those things the same way urmomnom did. Within the context of this discussion (ergonomics in the workplace), urmomnon clearly meant that regularly sitting or standing still for prolonged periods for years on ened is not good for you because we evolved to do a fair amount of physical activity.

Making toast 1/3 of your caloric intake *is* bad for you because you will likely become overweight as a result of the way we evolved to process carbohydrates.  Likewise with taking medicine all the time instead of only when you're sick. Most medications are not good for you when taken every day for years on end.

Taken in context, urmomnom is actually positing a theory that can be tested. He/she suggests that because we evolved in a situation where we were moderately active much of the time that we may see better health benefits from spending more time being moderately active and that we should see health detriments from deviation from ""moderate."" We see from some of the studies linked elsewhere in the comments that moderate is better for your health and too little is detrimental (I haven't seen to much on excessive exercise).",Pinyaka,t2_6s0y5,1,0,reddit2

In every way possible. Their skeletel/muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, everything. Even their mental health would be better.  We use to walk 12-15 miles a day.

Urmomnom's argument doesn't mean nothing. It is logically looking at human nature. For thousands of years we have hunted/walked/run.

That said, that is not how school's are run. We go to ridiculous lengths to provide for the needs of minorities. Even when they are a minority of one. For example, I attended a meeting last week with no less than 10 district employees, all of whom provide support either directly or indirectly for a student with a number of issues including autism and emotional disturbance due to neglect. This meeting alone lasted 2 hours. If we assume that the average wage of each adult was $40/hr then the meeting alone cost $800.

In the case of my classroom, I would certainly retain at least one sitting table and chairs to accomodate students with conditions either temporary (ex: sprained ankle, on crutches) or permanent (wheelchair bound, vertigo, terminally high arches).

What claim? That walking is healthy? That's well documented. A simple Google search will confirm it many times over.

>Our great great ancestors had lifespans of 30 years... why would they be our role models for healthy lifestyles?

This isn't really true. Like at all. The average life expectancy may have been 30 years (give or take), but that's mainly due to high child mortality rates. Adults weren't dying at 30 to a poor lifestyle. The diseases to prevent here are the diseases of affluence. Obesity, cancer, diabetes, myriad mental illnesses. Those are new, and those are what are hurting us most.

I'm in agreement with the statement ""show me the science"", but what I'm saying (I assume others are as well) is that while science is great, we don't have the data yet, and we still have to make lifestyle choices. From that perspective, the closer you adhere to what we know humans used to do (and what existing humans in primitive cultures still do) the more likely to represent a healthy option than one chosen at random (or chosen by convenience, which may as well be random) you are.

I'm an RN and it's common knowledge amongst healthcare workers since we spend so much time on our feet.  Standing for too long can be a risk factor for varicose veins, can contribute to fluid pooling in your lower extremities, and can contribute to venous insufficiency later in life.  It's not good for your feet either, so make sure you invest in good shoes if you're going to be standing for long periods.  They also make special socks/stockings that you can use as a preventative measure against venous issues from too much standing.  [This wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_stockings) has a ton of information on the topic.  The worst thing that can happen from venous stasis is a deep vein thrombosis which is a clot that forms usually in the leg veins and travels into your lungs and shit goes awry.  Highly unlikely, but it is a risk of sitting or standing for long periods, especially if you're older.  

As for the strain on your knees, I would say walking is better for them.  Normal, healthy knees have lubricating fluid called [synovial fluid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid) that protects the cartilage with movement.  However, standing for too long [compresses the joint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_complications_of_standing#Joint_compression) and squishes out the lubricating fluid which can contribute to breakdown of the joint.

And salt? Well, bacon is packed in salt -- literally packed, such that the salt comes in contact with the entire piece of meat -- so there's not really any way for commercial bacon to have significantly different sodium content from local bacon, except if the cure time differs dramatically (and this is unlikely, as the amount of time bacon cures is pretty tightly controlled, too).

Have you ever cured your own meats? I do. Regularly. Your local bacon is going to be better -- and better for you -- than commercial bacon, most likely, but this is not a result of sodium or nitrites or anything along those lines.

And shelf life? The *point* of cured meat is to have a long shelf life. You don't have to add extra preservatives for that -- kosher salt and pink salt are the standards, and they're used in roughly equivalent quantities regardless of who produces the bacon. If you use celery powder or celery juice instead of pink salt, you're just adding the same thing in a different form, but with a roughly equivalent quantity. And even if you weren't -- the worry with pink salt (and its nitrites) is that it may be carcinogenic... except that studies have *consistently* shown that it's not carcinogenic at the quantities contained in cured meats, especially not since commercial producers are *very* strict about the levels of nitrites they introduce to cured meats, and follow well-established protocols.

The reason you should buy local bacon? Well, there are a few. You're supporting your local economy, for one. You're probably supporting local farmers, if the bacon is produced from locally-sourced animals. If the pork belly is from local farms, you're probably supporting *sustainable* agriculture. Locally-produced bacon will probably be superior in cut, which means less fat and more meat. The local hogs it comes from may taste better, if they're fed a more varied diet than the commercial producers use -- but that's actually not especially likely, as even local farms often keep their hogs on concrete and feed them a strictly grain-based diet, with no forage at all, and little in the way of non-grain food (the standard is about a 70/30 split of corn/soy).

Increases in venous pressure can come from sedentary lifestyle, weight gain, and pregnancy is a good example.  Many pregnant women struggle with varicose veins because the extra weight they put on from being pregnant and the location and weight of the uterus/fetus puts pressure on the lower extremities and causes venous pooling.

Is this subject suddenly so important that the budget needed to renovate our school systems would be best spent on something with miniscule effects? Why not focus on ensuring all schools have proper P.E. (some of which have none), or after-school activities (many of which are lacking).

2. You're correct that the school system has changed greatly over the centuries. Furthermore, we don't have data on said students times long past so it was a poor analogy. I offer this instead to hopefully broaden your view outside your own bubble. Japan has an equivalent if not more tedious school curriculum. Simply put, **Japan has more sitting than the USA**. But for all that sitting, they lack the negative health effects that are in these studies. Should your theory hold true (that children ought not to be sitting in school), surely there would be an epidemic in Japan as well, would there not? Are they some genetic mutants that have been granted the boon of being able to sit?

3. Tame? You don't study Physiology for 8 years and think a **""tame""** assumption like adult's bodies and children's bodies are anywhere near similar. Nor do you think a **""tame""** assumption that children are subject to the same ailments as adults. Look, it's obvious that you don't know much about this subject if you are still buzzing on about *metabolic processes*. Metabolic processes are a *tiny* portion of disease progression. As a whole, children are not so vulnerable to disease. To spell it out for you: Children grow more, burn more, regenerate more, adapt more and do nearly everything better than adults body-wise. Simply put, a kid is not at risk of having a heart attack, nor are they suddenly going to gain a ton of weight, simply by being sedentary for a *portion* of the day.

 Why am I saying it's not a good idea? The same reason I'm saying that we don't need to give kids daily massages either. Yeah it'll help, but it's not making a difference nor is it appropriately feasible.

Johnny is an idiot who can't differentiate between *a teacher* yelling at a class, and *a student* yelling because they please. (I'm not condoning yelling at a class, but the point stands)

Last time my parent fought at the dinner table, I recall never wanting to do that or ever feel that way towards my future wife.

Mac is correct that non-basic math is not useful for most individuals, he should be able to infer that his parents are not everyone and some jobs require heavy mathematics. Furthermore, it is a skill he can relearn should he need it.

A teacher blindly follows an article about how adults are sitting down too much so he creates a class in which students may stand up. The students are still more affected by external factors and become healthy or unhealthy as societal/natural; in the end they learned that that one teacher they had was weird in that he/she let them stand up.

> TIL Kids are dumb as shit and have no cognitive abilities.

FTFY

Seriously, you have no respect for a child's ability to think. In all your examples kids are only able to mimic. No creative ability, no abstract thought, they are only able to mirror what they have seen or heard, unable to process information and learn from it.

Good management styles produce workers that go the extra mile, have pride in their company, and know their worth because they are acknowledged on a regular basis. And when bad performance does happen by a worker, they are given the tools they need to better themselves.

I work with electric vehicles, and after a couple years a company I'm working for has accumulated a substantial set of bulging, failed cells which we'd like to recycle. With lead batteries this would be simple -- a number of places will take them, paying about 17 to 20 cents per pound last time I checked.

With lithium cells though, there's only one place I've found in my city that will take them at all, and they don't offer any value for them, which is a bad sign if you're thinking about the market for recycling the materials. I have no serious reason to be certain the cells wouldn't end up in a Chinese landfill somewhere.

And while you might not care to get anything back for your handful of blown 18650s, these are 200Ah cells that cost about $250 each when new.

The project is now four years old and I've been with them for close to three.  I've heard stories from the older colleagues that did this same project in Iraq of a very large lithium battery fire after a few guys pulled the tabs to discharge them and threw them back into the containment.  I've personally amassed tens of thousands lithium batteries for shipment, separation and consolidation, and then shipment by air to Germany for recycling.  The only fire that I've had to respond to was a small pallet sized fire that started the same way the 'hundred thousand lithium battery fire of Iraq' started (The fire department let it burn itself out).  I have a few drums of lithium batteries currently in my hazardous waste yard with a Class-D fire extinguisher on-site.  There were probably a few million of these batteries out here used by the Army before our year-long consolidation, shipment, and recycling effort finished last year.  (They're in such supply because they're 30% lighter and last up to ten times longer than their Ni-Cd / NiMH counterparts).

1) Lithium battery cycle life can be greatly improved by reducing the maximum charge voltage and increasing minimum discharge voltage. Is here an optimum window within which battery life impact is negligible? 
2) Cycle degradation and calendar fade are the two main causes of battery performance decrease, with both strongly affected by temperature. Do they aggregate (I.e. cd+cf = performance fade) or is it just whichever one is more apparent that limits the performance? (I.e. max(cd, cf))
3) NMC and NCA seem to be the main Go-To chemistries right now. What's next on the horizon??

Recently the use of vaporizers has come under some heat so to speak, due to the units bursting into flames. Almost all documeted cases of this were a result of knock off batteries that are mis-labeled, and poorly assembled, causing venting and sometimes full on combustion.

Over the same time frame, there really hasn't been much improvement in the capacity of 26650-sized cells.  At first glance, a 26650 has roughly twice the internal volume of an 18650 so one might expect a typical 26650 to offer double the capacity of a similar 18650.  In reality, the highest capacity 26650 cells seem to only offer 50% greater capacity than the best 18650 cells.  Can you perhaps shed some light as to why?

I think in 2013, there was a case of Li-Ion accumulators (did OP use the word battery intentionally?) that caught fire on an airplane. I think it was a Boeing Dreamliner. Edit: Guess there were several cases since there is even an [wikipedia article about it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner_battery_problems)

In some countries (at least here in europe), you are now permitted to take them with you as cabin luggage on airplanes.  Edit: [This order even comes from the ICAO](http://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/ICAO-Council-Prohibits-Lithium-Ion-Cargo-Shipments-on-Passenger-Aircraft.aspx)

My questions:

What caused the accumulators to heat up and start burning?

And how serious is that problem? Could it happen in other areas aswell, in cars or mobile phones for example?

And are there any ""fixes"" to prevent this from happening?

I can answer this! Lithium ion batteries work best between 30% and 90%. For the most number of charge-discharge cycles you want to keep it between these figures. 

However, that's not very practical for everyday stuff like phones and laptops, so in that case it's best just to charge them as often as possible; the worst thing you can do to a lithium battery is run it all the way down.

Leaving a new smartphone to charge all day (as recommended in many manuals still) is pointless, as the phone stops charging when the battery is full. After that it will just sit, fully charged, doing nothing. It's a holdover from the days of ni-mh and ni-cad batteries.",,,94,0,reddit4

If the voltage is above 2.8, the temperature is below the safety cutoff, then the FET is on and conducts battery current. The FET also has an on state resistance which is used to measure current - if the current exceeds a certain value, then the FETs are latched off while the load is too high.

Most devices have battery management systems that set the voltage limits to ensure the device hits the specified cycle life.  A battery in a hybrid electric vehicle operates over a very shallow state of charge range - to yield hundreds of thousands of cycles.  A plug-in hybrid operates over a wider state of charge, with a target cycle life of a few thousand.   A full EV battery will need to use as  wide a state of charge as possible and balance energy density (driving range) with the target cycle life.  2) Great question - with batteries, the answer is often ""it depends.""   It depends on the source of the degradation.  Think of it in terms of performance.  You need a certain capacity out of the battery and you need a certain power from the battery across a range of states of charge.  People are most familiar with capacity fade due to loss of lithium - when your 6 hour laptop battery now only lasts 2.

d0t3qvx,t1_d0sihqm,2016-03-09 06:20:30,science,"I'm not OP, but I have done a lot of research and have some personal experience in the matter. The common consensus is that the common reasons for catastrophic battery failure (venting, leaking, exploding, etc) are because of the following reasons but are not limited to what you mentioned:

- Mislabeling or defective batteries - As you said. Mislabeling and improper quality control of batteries allows them to be utilized for applications or discharge levels that the battery cell cannot handle.

- Hard shorts - The positive and negative connections of the atomizer both come in contact with the positive pole of the battery. Usually due to a short 510 positive pen on the atomizer, combined with a hybrid-style mod (where the atomizer makes direct contact with the battery). Can be prevented by only using compatible devices with protruding pins to prevent the positive/negative making simultaneous contact.

- Unintended contact - Damaged or removed battery wraps. Pocket change, keys, etc. Make sure the battery itself is protected from making contact when it's not meant to.

My question for Dee - with the growth of vaping drawing additional attention to battery failure being a potentially dangerous problem, how would you make policy to ensure that people get batteries true to their advertised specifications? And how would you go about educating the public about proper handling and usage of batteries? I see a lot of media picking up this issue, but blaming ""e-cigarettes"" or ""vapes"" as the issue, not the mishandling of batteries which is the true cause. I don't see how the information is currently handled as educational or useful - just a warning towards the wrong issue.",craznazn247,t2_8uf0x,1,0,reddit4
d0s1sj7,t1_d0rz859,2016-03-08 14:32:08,science,"While failures can occur here are some tips for minimizing your risk while you're using them.  
-Check your battery for dents, gouges, scratches - if you see anything like that, recycle the battery and get a new one  
-Check the plastic wrap around the battery, if you see bare metal poking through the wrap, replace the wrap    
-Make sure you know the amp limits of your battery. Pulse ratings are not to be used, look for continuous discharge limits and stay below that. This is mostly for Mechanical mod users.  
-If they make a tv, they make a good battery - LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic are all reputable and trusted manufacturers. Do not buy rewrapped batts ""designed"" for vaping, at best you're paying more for a battery I mentioned above, at worst you're getting some no name brand with a low amp limit that's just waiting to fail.    
-Don't buy batteries with the word fire in their name.  
-If you use a mod that requires more then 1 Battery, you need to ""marry"" the batts so they will only be used together and then alternate their position in your mod after every charge/discharge cycle. The reason for this is that one batt usually suffers more draw then the other when paired. To make sure one batt is not over loaded more then the other, we alternate their position.  
-NEVER CHARGE BATTERIES WHILE YOU SLEEP  
-ALWAYS STORE LOOSE BATTERIES IN A CASE

Takes time to remember everything, but if you practice good battery maintenance, they will last longer and you won't have to constantly worry about fires and exploding things.",yaypudding,t2_coyve,5,0,reddit4
d0s0svh,t1_d0rz859,2016-03-08 13:59:29,science,"I can answer that, i personally use lithium ion batteries in my experiments and devices, i create electrical doodads for costumes, this goes from LEDS to soundchips and recently i've made a smoke vaporizer that uses a 50/50 water/glycol style evaporation this requires heat, and what better way to mimic smoke generation than using the same technology e-cigs use to vaporize their scented nicotin stuff.

They use a nichrome or kanthal wire in a coil to heat up a patch of cotton soaked with the goods, Now nichrome and kanthal both are actually very fancy names for something called resistance wire, which basically has a much higher Ohm value than normal copper / tin wire. Higher Ohm means that it will inhibit the amperage draw and turn it into heat. If you keep it short enough for amperage draw to still be significantly high, the wire heats up significantly in return.

Obviously the longer this wire the better off you are in terms of safety, but the wire will get less hot and take more time. which is not very ideal for vaping.

Through my testing a Li-ion battery at max capacity can put out about 16/12 amperage in full short mode. Now this causes it to heat and blow up fairly quickly, Safely i'd say it should only be outputting 2/3 MAYBE 4 at max on a full-time active basis. But since you're only vaping for maybe 5/8 seconds holding the button you can safely draw 8/9 without the battery heating up.
The more you increase the Ohm of the resistance wire the lower this amperage is because V=I*R (Ohms law) which can be used as I=V/R We know our battery is nominally 3.7V, An average nichrome wire (depending on gauge) around the wick in an e-cig is 2 revolutions. which comes down to about 4/6 Ohms. so it becomes 3.7/6 = 0.61 Amps 3.7/4 = 0.93 Amps.

So in conclusion absolutely safe, even if you held the button full-time.

What i'm doing however is not very safe because i'm using 8 of these wire configurations in parallel. but in turn i've been adding more batteries in parallel which balances the individual battery draw to about 2 amps.

If you have some time for a few more questions, I  was wondering about these methods for stabilization. I can see how dopants and/or defect chemistry can be used but how do coatings work in stabilizing the crystal structure in this case? On a related note, I did recently read about certain coatings that allow improved surface diffusion for the lithium ions so that they can diffuse in the bulk material along the preferred crystal planes, can that be an example of coatings stabilizing the structure or is this an unrelated phenomenon?

Also consider that an ecig user that would be pushing these amp limits is rarely completing the circuit for more than 5 seconds. It's interesting to look at alot of the independent testing done by third parties that are merely interested in the true ratings of these batteries. Many of people are weary of the marked ratings because its very common to rewrap other companies 18650 as your own and, often, these are the worst offenders.

Typically I would never go below .2 ohms on an unregulated mod because 4.2v/.2= 21 amps. 

That being said, we now have some amazing regulated mods with several batteries and chips that make the likelihood of any battery damage, let alone explosions, extremely low.

d0scv9r,t1_d0s07xf,2016-03-08 19:03:20,science,"Almost every story of an ecig battery exploding comes from one of two situations, and they're both user error. I'm not sure if you vape, so I'll explain everything assuming you don't. Sorry if you already know what I'm talking about

Situation 1: the person keeps a loose battery in their pocket and it shorts on keys or loose change or the metal button in the pocket seam. The small piece of metal on the top of a battery (positive side) is the positive connection, obviously, but everything else is the negative connection, even the part still on the top of the battery. That's what the wrap is for, but wraps get damaged over time. This can make it very easy for one piece of metal like a quarter to touch the positive and negative of the battery at the same time, cause a ""hard short"" where electricity flows almost completely unimpeded at an insane amperage and sends the battery into thermal runaway, which is where disasters strike. 

Situation 2: The person uses a hybrid connection with an incompatible atomizer. The part of an ecig the connects the power device to the part that actually vaporizes the liquid (or atomizer) is called the 510 connection. There's a positive pin between the positive end of the battery and another positive pin that runs to one end of the coil wire. The negative connection is the actual threads of the 510, which surround the 510 positive pin and are separated by an insulator. 

On a hybrid 510, there's no pin between the bottom of the atomizer and the battery, so the atomizer pin directly touches the positive connection of the battery and the circuit gets completed on the negative end of the battery. A lot of atomizers don't have pins that are long enough, or they have floating pins, and the 510 threads (again, the negative connection) can also touch the positive end of the battery. This also leads to a hard short. These connections are used in some mechanical mods, meaning there isn't a chip to regulate the flow of electricity, it's just a circuit completed by a switch, so there's nothing stopping the battery from discharging very very quickly and entering thermal runaway. 

Less commonly, people using mechanical mods may also build coils with too low of a resistance and draw too many amps from their batteries. I only say less commonly because it's unlikely for a battery to enter full thermal runaway this way, but it can likely vent (the positive cap will be damaged and battery fumes will be expelled.) This can be dangerous but often does not lead to an explosion unless those fumes are ignited. 

In the community we always encourage users to put battery safety first. Nowadays Situation 1 is by far the most likely due the cheapness and performance of regulated devices, not as many people use mechanical mods anymore. The only danger then is that people are using batteries that don't have amp ratings high enough (largely due to unscrupulous companies rewrapping batteries with higher amp ratings printed on the wrap than is actually the case) or that the battery shorts out while not in the device.

Essentially, instead of that fuel truck pulling up to the local gas station, it'll be pulling up to the local power plant.

If you don't stop charging a lithium battery, it explodes. All chargers stop when the battery is full.

Sort of. Overnight is too long though - the phone knows that 4.2v is fully charged, it doesn't need calibrating. You're right that it should be run down all the way for calibration, but that generally happens during normal use.

What an opportunity for the chemistry community!  Conversion materials (e.g., Li-S, metal fluorides) can offer high energy densities - but have considerable challenges.  Solutions are more than five years out.  At this point, I would consider the development of a electrolyte with a much wider voltage stability window as a major breakthrough - this could enable higher energy density cathodes that operate at higher voltage and also enable Si anodes.  Today's electrolytes are reduced on graphite and Si anodes - forming an SEI.  However, the SEI is not mechanically robust enough to survive the volumetric changes that Si undergoes on charge/discharge.

You can't go over a certain thermal/energy consumption limit when running full bore.  The guys developing processors care deeply about this.  They usually set a line and then design the hardware to work at that line.

The guys designing the phone's hardware depend on the design specs of the individual components.  Usually it is pretty much only the processor and display that they care about (and usually someone else is providing those to them).  They simply pick the parts that meet the requirements they are trying to hit.

After that it is the software.  Sure, software can make or break battery life, but primarily it is the OS that ultimately holds all the knobs to make that better.  It depends on the manufacture, but more Raw OSes (think, nexus/cyanogenmod) don't have very much overhead at all.  It is the user installed software that can really suck down the battery.

Cost certainly comes into play in the hardware world, but honestly, most hardware is dirt cheap.  Hardware engineers don't generally have the same freedom as software engineers do when it comes to things like ""This language is nicer but eats more power"".  They are pretty much at the point of ""You can choose Verilog or VHDL... good luck"".  Which is like having the choice between C and pascal (only worse).

Now in the software world, many developers don't care at all about application power consumption or performance.  They may care a bit about responsiveness.  So you are right in saying that they can choose slower languages for convenience.  However, for simple data displaying apps, even slow languages can run and finish really quickly.  Even if they consume slightly more power.  Often you will see bigger power savings by dimming the screen instead of the programmer using a lower level language.",cogman10,t2_4ztyu,3,0,reddit4

>We study the political consequences of lifting restrictions on the funding of groups engaging in outside spending (e.g., independent political advertising) in elections. Theoretically, we assume that outside spending changes the salience of candidate-specific attributes relative to their party labels. Empirically, we employ a difference-in-differences design that exploits the removal of state-level restrictions on the funding of outside spending mandated by the federal-level rulings in both Citizens United and SpeechNow.org v. FEC. We find strong evidence that these regulatory changes increase the electoral success of Republican candidates, thereby leading to more ideologically conservative legislatures. We find no effect on polarization. Consistent with our theory, the size of our estimated effects depends on the power of labor unions and the alignment of business interests with the Republican party.

This is about if you should be able to purchase a platform given the fact that others simply already have them or have access to them for free.

We're never going to be ""equal"" on the reach of our speech. Certain people and their platforms simply have a larger voice. Eliminating spending won't help that fact and may very likely hurt it.

Do you think the *legal justification* for your access to using the services of another to promote your speech should be if they charge money for it? That those in control of the product can use if freely to promote as much speech as they want (as they aren't spending money), but if they offer you a chance to ""rent"" a space to speak them that should be prohibited? And only if they charge money for it? That's how you allow only certain speakers that can come in for free where revenue is made up elsewhere.",kwantsu-dudes,t2_c556r,26,0,reddit1

I don't think so. We all have the same right to express our speech, but we have to recognize that people are not exactly they same. For example, you may have a literally louder voice than I. Does that prohibit equal freedom? What if you merely have a better writing skill than me?

Rights don't need to happen in equal amounts, they just need to equally granted. I might be able to afford more guns, or a bigger house, or more things, but we should both be equally granted the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc amemdment protections. You can argue ""we should all have the same money"", but what if we even did? Theres no guarantee we'd spend it on the same things. I guess you could argue that to protect equality, how much we could exercise each right should be limited, but unless the government is also providing the things the right grants freedom to up to the limit and prohibit more, there's no guarantee we'd all have the exact same amount. Additionally it kind of flies in the face of the ideal protecting a right to explicitly limit that right just for sake of equality of outcome. I think as an American ideal, equality of unrestricted opportunity has been the goal, rather than equality of outcome or even equality of starting situation. You can argue that it is not a good ideal, but I think that's where you would just have to sway public opinion, as that's what the ideal has historically seemed to be.",ArgetlamThorson,t2_g3h0x,15,0,reddit1

But that's not our reality. It could be our future reality.... But it isn't right now and that's important. We should focus on the things that actually are instead of making up imaginary scenarios. This isn't theoretical models it's academic research of empirical evidence.

There's a specific reason it benefits Republicans. They are the ones that strongly embrace privatization and industrialization that prioritizes economic output over environmental concerns. It is quite literally the party of deregulation.

Because of their political ideologies they will naturally be lobbied/targeted harder and more often successfully. It's not that this doesn't happen with Democrats it's that it happens much less with Democrats. Democrats tend to prioritize pro-social policy over privatization when compared to Republicans.

> In addition, HHS has effectively exempted certain religious nonprofit organizations, described under HHS regulations as “eligible organizations,” from the contraceptive mandate. See 45 CFR §147.131(b); 78 Fed. Reg. 39874 (2013). An “eligible organization” means a nonprofit organization that “holds itself out as a religious organi-zation” and “opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services required to be covered . . . on account of religious objections.” 45 CFR §147.131(b). To qualify for this accommodation, an employer must certify that it is such an organization.  §147.131(b)(4). When a group-health-insurance issuer receives notice that one of its clients has invoked this provision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive services for plan participants without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. §147.131(c).[8] Al-though this procedure requires the issuer to bear the cost of these services, HHS has determined that this obligation will not impose any net expense on issuers because its cost will be less than or equal to the cost savings resulting from the services. 78 Fed. Reg. 39877.[9]

>Though these two businesses have expanded over the years, they remain closely held, and David, Barbara, and their children retain exclusive control of both companies. Ibid. David serves as the CEO of Hobby Lobby, and his three children serve as the president, vice president, and vice CEO. See Brief for Respondents in No. 13–354, p. 8.[15]

>Hobby Lobby’s statement of purpose commits the Greens to “[h]onoring the Lord in all [they] do by operating the company in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.” App. in No. 13–354, pp. 134–135 (complaint). Each family member has signed a pledge to run the businesses in accordance with the family’s religious beliefs and to use the family assets to support Christian ministries. 723 F. 3d, at 1122. In accordance with those commitments, Hobby Lobby and Mardel stores close on Sundays, even though the Greens calculate that they lose millions in sales annually by doing so. Id., at 1122; App. in No. 13–354, at 136–137. The businesses refuse to engage in profitable transactions that facilitate or promote alcohol use; they contribute profits to Christian missionaries and ministries; and they buy hundreds of full-page newspaper ads inviting people to “know Jesus as Lord and Savior.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

>Like the Hahns, the Greens believe that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. 723 F. 3d, at 1122. They specifically object to the same four contraceptive methods as the Hahns and, like the Hahns, they have no objection to the other 16 FDA-approved methods of birth control. Id., at 1125. Although their group-health-insurance plan predates the enactment of ACA, it is not a grandfathered plan because Hobby Lobby elected not to retain grandfathered status before the contraceptive mandate was proposed. Id., at 1124.

...

>In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means test. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections. See supra, at 9–10, and nn. 8–9. Under that accommodation, the organization can self-certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services. See 45 CFR §§147.131(b)(4), (c)(1); 26 CFR §§54.9815–2713A(a)(4), (b). If the organization makes such a certification, the organization’s insurance issuer or third-party administrator must “[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan” and “[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered” without imposing “any cost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.” 45 CFR §147.131(c)(2); 26 CFR §54.9815–2713A(c)(2).[38]",,,2,0,reddit1

I genuinely have no idea what you're trying to say. If the executives of a corporation want to promote speech, they have the absolute collective right to do so.

It doesn't matter. They work for a corporation whose executives get to make decisions on how it is run and what actions to take.

That's how organizations work.

So they shouldn't run ads opposing a candidate who, for example, wants to shut them down? That isn't in their best interest as a corporation?

As someone trying to enter the medical research field I was quite quickly given two choices by the people I have interned under. Either I go the government/university funded route and study what I want however always have the chance of the grants getting yanked out when I don't show fast enough results. The other choice is to go with a commercial drug company and not have to worry about the money, however be limited in what I can research. 

Either way someone has to but that equipment and it will still take several years to get a result and possibly millions of dollars. Its not right to just say its one side or the others fault. We should shame scientist who are only in it for the money and produce falsified results, and we shouldn't burn the companies that spend several million dollars to develop a drug and then sell it with low relative margins( they just spent several years and millions of dollars to make it).

Fortunately, the evidence against cigarettes was glaringly obvious. The downside to this whole scientific bias problem is that pharmaceuticals are not consumer goods in the same way an energy drunk or a type of nutritional supplement is. These are high-tech, complex substances that are used for disease.  So there are benefits but one has to figure out if the good outweighs the bad. 

It's tragic because illness and disease are things that affect our decisions much more than pleasure. People will spend a lot more money on something to cure a debilitating disease than something just for pleasure. Look
at diabetics. They HAVE to buy insulin or they die. It's not really a choice. Pharm companies know this so advertising is a high cost. People won't take a drug unless they know it exists. Your doctor has to be told by the pharma companies about the new and exciting options for people with whatever disease. 

So now you see how it all works.  The pharm companies pay researchers to make sure that those bad effects are downplayed or hidden to make sure that the consumer is convinced this is the best choice.

Others want the drug companies to sell their medicines on the strengths of their product, not the abilities of their advertising teams. Let's face it. Advertising works. And weary doctors who have worked their asses off dealing with sick people all day often have no problem administering pharmaceuticals that people request by name (after seeing commercials for years) if they THINK that medicine will help. But if they dug into it, they could probably find that in some cases, one medicine is just as good as another, only the one that isn't getting the marketing push isn't as expensive. Or maybe it's genuinely better. People have no idea, and generally don't investigate so much as they go by advertising and word of mouth.

Advertising works. That's why advertising is so well funded. Here, let me snag numbers from two names that spring to mind. Number in billions.

I think the point people who may seem ""anti-corporation"" are trying to say is, they're not convinced these companies are doing the best science they can, as opposed to ""some science, but some great advertising"". In both, the cost of advertising and administration (advertising fees, and advertising/corporate pay) is almost twice as much as the money invested in research. The concern is that if those companies cut back on advertising, and put more money into the science, they would yield superior products that would help more people, in more serious ways.

And some, wrongly or rightly, argue that government's efficiency (for instance, a lack of needing that level of advertising, or administration costs that high,) could lead to more money being put into research. Not to mention the obvious lack of need for profit. Now, if we want to argue the efficiency of government versus the free market, that's a great debate to have, from a variety of angles. (I like the argument of freedom.) But just looking at numbers? I consider the worry of pharmaceutical companies shunning science in favor of advertising a legitimate one.",Jeffool,t2_52xcm,0,0,reddit2

A few years back my girlfriend was on a certain contraceptive implant device which was causing her to have some really nasty side effects, her friends had all had the same side effects on it and so had hundreds of women in forums relating to the drug. 

On explaining this to the doctor and asking for the implant out he refused and said that the problems weren't from the implant because the clinical studies didn't show it as a side effect. He told her to wait and come back in a month, he did this 6 times, in total she spent around a year with quite debilitating side effects. 

A friends gf had the same problems and after 6 months had demanded it out or she would cut it out herself. On having it removed the problems were relieved but she then found out a few months later that she was now virtually infertile and would need IVF if she wanted children. This wasn't in her family and she had always been fine but of course she too was told it couldn't have been from the implant because the clinical trials didn't list it as a side effect.

My gf went and demanded it out several times to be brushed off and told no in various ways and excuses, she honestly felt she had no say in her own body, she was initially strongly coerced into using that contraception and has since had several doctors try to get her to have another stating ""you have to be on some form of contraception and this is the most effective with the least side effects"".

In late 2011, the patent expired, and other companies started offering generic versions of the drug. These companies were offering the off-brand version for about $10 for a month of pills.

Before the patent expired, Pfizer was selling the same drug for $100-150 per month. After the patent expired, they dropped their prices to $4 a month for many patients. Something to remember: Lipitor was approved in 1996. This means that they had 15 years of selling this drug at 2000% profit. Before the expiration, Lipitor alone provided Pfizer with over 1/6th of it's annual profit.

Similar things have happened with many other drugs that have had their patents expire over the past few years, and it's expected to happen a lot more in the coming years. On the plus side, this means that the cost of various tried and true drugs will be going down soon. On the down side, all these pharmaceutical companies are working to develop and patent new drugs that they can sell at outrageous profit margins for years to come.",ksheep,t2_8h99x,-3,0,reddit2

The only way to circumvent it, is to set up walls between drug companies and researchers outside the drug industry, and support independent research through public means. That would ensure the research is done to benefit the public, and that results better reflect the actual health risk/benefit.

But this isn't even about funding researchers with findings that help your company.  I won't say I'm completely comfortable with such selective funding, but ideally it shouldn't matter.  The authors should disclose their source of funding (as a possible conflict on interest), and the methods peer-reviewed.  Others who are unsure of the results can attempt to replicate them.  So, in theory, even such selective funding shouldn't cause any harm.  If it turned into an issue of blacklisting anybody that ever published anything negative, that could be cause for concern - but at least the published material should still be scientifically sound.

If a product is difficult to assess by it's client base, free market principles go funny. The Darwinistic behavior of customers choosing the ""best"" value product offering amongst competitors is bupkis when customers do not have the capacity to directly examine a product. Customers become the prey of marketing efforts. 

The failings of a customer base to rationally assess a product can be multifarious. 

They can stem from ignorance: like a bloke trying to make heads or tails out of a private health insurance plan. The insurer has massive data collection and an army of actuaries but a typical customer does not. This puts the customer at a terrible disadvantage in selecting between alternatives. 

They can stem from an impractically long time frame. We're great at picking out a flavor of caffeine that gives us a perk, or realizing that a particular brand of condom is actually really comfy, but we're shit at gauging long term benefits if they take a decade to realize.

They can stem from prejudice. In the case of beer, the major national brands of beer in the US are pretty similar, yet many of their client base would vehemently assert that competitor product tastes like pee even thought they cannot discern them in a blind taste test. As a meta example, many would shout out loud how free market principles are unfailing principles yet they cannot come to a clear description of how they rationally chose their health care insurance plan. 

We exist in an era where some of the most important products offered to us are so far beyond our ability to assess that it may be impossible to properly choose between them. In the case of pharmaceuticals, highly intelligent doctors, such as general practitioners and oncologists, are being duped by corrupted well respected researchers.

Just that is enough to eliminate all fake journals from consideration. 

unlike website aggregation, google doesnt have to value the input from low tier sources. Academia isnt democracy of the masses. A thousand  blogs on a topic means *something* for web search even if they are all low quality (since web aggregation is trying to learn what the masses have to say abt a topic), a thousand papers on a topic means absolutely nothing in academia if none of the papers meet the basic requirements (requirements based on guild lines by ).

Not entirely sure where you are getting this. More than 80% of MD/PhDs are working in some kind of academic setting (Skip Brass' study). The most commonly cited statistic is how MDs and MD/PhDs secure their first R01 at the same age. This is saying a lot given that MD/PhDs take the extra 3-6 years to complete a PhD and don't have the burden of paying off medical school student loans.

>I say get the MD, then do the research afterwards. You could do a research intensive residency or even supplement a residency with a 1-2 year research fellowship or clinical research residency.

Right. Good luck pursuing a research-intensive career after 80+ hour work weeks in residency, balancing a family and personal obligations and paying off student loans. It's possible but academic medicine just isn't that attractive when all your friends are headed to private practice to make six-figure salaries from day one. The biggest selling point of formal MD/PhD programs is the waived medical school tuition and stipend. This goes an incredibly long way in encouraging their students to pursue academic careers. 

Also, practicing MD/PhDs don't ever do ""wet lab research"". They manage research groups, write grants, and see patients. Hospitals don't pay MD/PhDs to do research. Research doesn't bring in clinical revenue. The purpose of doing a PhD early on exposes you to the realities of academic world and makes you a much more effective scientist (in my opinion). The research training most MD-only medical students get is absolutely laughable (with the exception of HHMI and Doris Duke fellows).",,,10,0,reddit2

Impossible? You are probably young and naive. So since it is ""impossible"" all I have to do is show **ONE** example of falsehood in a journal with ""top experts"" to disprove your claim. 

Before I go into medical examples - let me just give you one of the clearest examples of fake data that made it into peer-reviewed respected journals and the fraud wasn't discovered until after death. 

Millikan Oil Drop Experiment. Published many in respected journals, used as a reference, faked his data. Would have never been caught except for the fact that his original journal was read after his death by historians. His lies threw off the actual charge of the electron used as a reference for decades. People re-did the experiments and got different results, but because his results where ""so good"" they opened their error bars to include his value - throwing off physics. Only after his fraud was discovered did we see the value of the charge of the electron suddenly jump to its current correct value. Tragically, there was another ethical scientist at the time who did not fake his data and published honestly, did not get a clean line to the value of e^- and was then criticized as an ""inferior"" scientist and ultimately committed suicide. 

I use this as the opening one to show you that when a person fakes his data and presents it as legitimate it is very difficult if not impossible to detect and it happens even in the most reproducible and hard sciences. Now lets take an even more difficult case to detect which is human studies or medicine where you often do not have a ""closed system."" 

In all of the below cases the fraud was detected, and when you read more carefully it was detected either because the author was really really bad at lying, did so repeatedly, or confessed. An author who would be as careful as Millikan was would not be detected quickly, if ever.

Over several years, he and a team of volunteers cataloged the locations of a large percentage of ground-based weather stations across the US (82.5% of all stations evaluated currently) and checked them against [official NOAA guidelines](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/documentation/program/X030FullDocumentD0.pdf) for the placement of such stations. What they found was that a large percentage of these were not compliant, and yet the data obtained by these stations are used to push the climate change agenda.

After collecting this, they then assessed each station, again based on NOAA standards (Page 5 of above document) to determine approximate temperature error, and found that over 70% of the stations examined had would show a temperature error of 2º C or more, and more than 90% showing more than 1º C error. He and his team spent some time attempting to publish their findings, but most journals wouldn't touch it because the findings were contrary to popular opinion, and even after he did successfully publish it, he was attacked by the IPCC, despite the fact that all of his work is clearly shown and cited (unlike a number of papers published by the IPCC) and that the experiment is easily repeatable.

Last I heard, NOAA has stated that they will be looking into the matter themselves, re-evaluating many weather stations and seeing if the purported error is indeed there, but as of now this research is being completely ignored due to it goes contrary to what a number of groups want it to say.

One should not blindly believe everything that is told you, but one should instead look at all available data and see if it fits, and if not, try to figure out a better explanation.

I too agree that funding should be open. However, the way things are set up now, there is a slight issue with that, especially when dealing with grants (whereby the party funding the project is expecting something back in return). Normally, this isn't much of a problem, but I've seen a number of times where the grant givers (typically corporations) basically said ""Tell us this view is correct, or we'll cut off all further funding"" (occasionally going as far as having the researchers sign NDAs before starting work, discouraging them from publishing any contrary findings). This can introduce bias into research which in turn skews results, and in some cases even results in downright falsification of data (depending on which branch of science this is occurring in). Granted, I have no idea how widespread this is, it may only be a few isolated cases, but the fact that the current system allows for it at all is outrageous.",ksheep,t2_8h99x,1,0,reddit2

Scientists investigating whether this happens in teams which combine work by robots and humans found that humans carrying out quality assurance tasks spotted fewer errors when they had been told that robots had already checked a piece, suggesting they relied on the robots and paid less attention to the work.

> The scientists tested their hypothesis using a simulated industrial defect-inspection task: looking at circuit boards for errors. The scientists provided images of circuit boards to 42 participants. The circuit boards were blurred, and the sharpened images could only be viewed by holding a mouse tool over them. This allowed the scientists to track participants’ inspection of the board

> Half of the participants were told that they were working on circuit boards that had been inspected by a robot called Panda. Although these participants did not work directly with Panda, they had seen the robot and could hear it while they worked. After examining the boards for errors and marking them, all participants were asked to rate their own effort, how responsible for the task they felt, and how they performed

> **when the scientists looked more closely at participants’ error rates, they realized that the participants working with Panda were catching fewer defects later in the task, when they’d already seen that Panda had successfully flagged many errors. This could reflect a ‘looking but not seeing’ effect, where people get used to relying on something and engage with it less mentally. Although the participants thought they were paying an equivalent amount of attention, subconsciously they assumed that Panda hadn’t missed any defects**

This ""looking but not seeing"" effect poses concerns, especially in safety-related environments, as prolonged shifts could exacerbate the loss of motivation and impact work outcomes.

**Positive Aspects of Human-Robot Teamwork:**
1. **Efficiency Boost:** Collaborative efforts between humans and robots have the potential to enhance overall task efficiency, especially in repetitive or labor-intensive processes.

2. **Skill Complementarity:** Robots can complement human skills, bringing specialized capabilities to the team and enabling a more comprehensive approach to complex tasks.

3. **Workload Distribution:** In certain scenarios, robots can assist in distributing the workload, preventing human burnout and improving overall team productivity.

4. **Enhanced Safety:** Robots can handle tasks that pose risks to human safety, reducing the likelihood of accidents or injuries in hazardous environments.

5. **24/7 Operations:** With the assistance of robots, teams can extend operational hours, ensuring continuous workflow and responsiveness, particularly in industries with critical time constraints.

If the tools are reliable and the process simple, then it makes a lot of sense to rely on the bots. And if something goes wrong it's pretty straightforward to troubleshoot: where is the data bad or what exception do we need to bake into the program. This isn't harmful at all and is textbook why we use tools.

Problems occur when the data going in has all kinds of holes and irregularities, human error, or is just outright incorrect or when the process is some incompressible black box where the outcome is just expected as gospel.

Bot says x so we do x. Formula says y so we do y. This is the kind of non-critical thinking which leads to poor decisions as the people using the outputs don't know or don't care about the limitations or cons to how those outputs were created and where they're applying the results may be a poor fit.

Neolithic man worked nearly continuously.  Much of it or most of it was probably enjoyable because it was a shared experience or a shared hardship that shaped and formed their entire lives. And it was good for them because they drew their entire purpose and meaning and spirituality from this work.

If you were a 15 year old young man doing a very hard repetitive physical task with your 32 year old father you viewed this as “spending important time with family”.  Not work primarily.

Now we have completely divorced “work” from any sort of meaning and simply reduced it to a transactional enterprise.  Most of us hate “work” because it has no meaning or purpose other than gaining us the abstract concept of money.

AI is pretending to be a person, by outputing its data in a way in which it believes simulates a person, and taking in the same sort of data a human would take in.

But AI, like chat-gpt, isn't the only form of 'computer automation' to do work. ChatGPT is pretending to be like a person and guessing what a person would say next given its instruction. Its very very good at that, but it doesn't mean that that is what they're using in a Lawyers office to categorize documents as relevant or irellevant to a case at hand.

The difference between the AI you experience, and the AI/ML a business uses for a specific case is like the difference between a knife in your kitchen, and a scalpel. When something, including computer programs, are designed to complete a very specific, narrow, task: they can be very good at it.

This type of study is great to lay foundation to deeper studies, but not great at directly driving change, much less if the amount of people ‘saved’ would be 1 out of 100.

Someone pointed out I used wrong numbers and I did. It’s actually 20,000 parolees, which is still a small sample to study, but not as small as I’d made it out to be. As for the other numbers I used, they are proportions and stay the same. Even with my mistake, it’s still just a change of 1 in 100.

I think rehabilitation works for about 85% of criminals, most criminals mess up once or get caught up in bad habits and need direction.

I have worked alongside criminals like that who just messed up or had a habit of messing up because they were impulsive or lacked direction. Almost all of them changed their ways after prison and rehabilitation.

But I have known of people with more than 100 convictions in my country go on to stomp a random person until they got brain damage. They then get a light sentence because they came from a broken home or had drug problems.

I have personally known people who were born evil, who would bite people, who would beat people for fun, who raped and terrorised people, people who abused animals.

Those type of people can never be rehabilitated.

About how you feel when you show up to work and your supervisor or a teammate are in a bad mood, maybe disregard you or talk down to you. Think about how it impacts your attitude and willingness to do a good job. Then think about how a probationer or parolee feels coming in to an appointment with a PO who defines them by their worst moments, and treats them as unworthy of their time, dignity and respect.    

Basic empathy is a huge component of social work, and at the end of the day, that’s what probation and parole is meant to be.

I want to note this isn't because I am heartless. Anyone who can benefit from rehabilitation should be given every opportunity to do so and have support on all sides of their journey.

More serious: If an individual decides to reform their life after a stay in prison you require stability and support.

Even minor offenses such as showing up late/missing some dates can land you in trouble. Combine that with a person who has had his life rigidly planned by an external entity for an extended period of time with little/no control over their own schedule/habits.

It seems reasonable to assume that this will create difficulties in readjustment to life in society which creates a scenario where the cards are literally stacked against you.

Suddenly the idea that a trained parole officer who can at least provide some semblance of the support which is usually offered by family & social ties (which might be less than reliable in some of these cases) leads to significant improvement in rehabilitation and reintegration seems far more understandable.

Then the parolee must undergo his own--*far more significant*--internal change in response. That change must likewise be long-term and continuous, so as to not accidentally slip back into a state of offense. 

* In the second option, the PO just decides to chill a little bit. That's literally it. No additional communication, no additional perception, no new trust, no additional worldview changes required.

I took a long time completing my Crim degree.  (I took unnecessary courses and allowed my extracurricular activities to interfere.)   

We'd watch the people being hired by a local PD, and how they changed and fairly quickly ghosted all the people they used to hang with.    
There are reasons why cops find it easier to socialise with other cops and people in adjacent careers, but their worlds become narrowly focused.  At a certain point, I don't even know if they know how to connect with normal people.

During my long period of studies, I worked in security, often in jobs adjacent to the CJS.   
I don't think I met anyone within 10 years of retirement age who didn't look worn down.  Even the most positive and professional people.     

I never encountered probation/parole officers professionally.  So I can't say much.  
But the people worst impacted (i.e. damaged) by their jobs were the corrections officers.  I knew quite a few who'd left that job too.  

We're always warned not to generalise and stereotype, but that job really seems to shape the people who do it.  If you met anywhere between 5-10 of them, you'd see enough of certain traits and attitudes, so strongly entrenched, that you would automatically expect them from any new CO in the future.  And it seems to take an extra long time for them to relax those attitudes after leaving the job.

The difficulty with training on “systemic racism” is that it’s essentially an undisprovable theory with no discernible end-point, making it impossible to solve (and many officers are very pragmatic problem solvers, not philosophers, by nature).  

“Systemic racism” also presupposes a racial motive at the outset simply because of disproportionate impact.  It’s a gross over-simplification of a multi-faceted societal problem with no easy solutions.  Going into a law enforcement training with a focus on fixing the problem of “systemic racism” is suggesting, at the outset, that all officers are racist, or share some collective racist guilt for an inherently racist system.  Besides being of dubious accuracy, it is not a productive starting point.  

Strictly and *entirely* hypothetically, one wouldn’t go into a discussion with members of a racial group presupposing that a higher incidence of criminal offenses among that group means that group is criminally-minded, or that their community was to blame for the actions of a few, before proceeding to moralize about necessary change.  That logic would be abhorrent.  It would completely discount all individual motives and histories of the people involved.  

Moreover, “systemic racism” also discounts the individual facts of each case, and the personal history of each offender, that led to convictions and punishments.  The job of each law enforcement officer, and each case, necessarily involves an individualized case history that is poorly served by an over-broad focus.

I don't think that's quite accurate. There is evidence of systemic racism that can be measured. 

> Going into a law enforcement training with a focus on fixing the problem of “systemic racism” is suggesting, at the outset, that all officers are racist, or share some collective racist guilt for an inherently racist system.

No one does this. But systemic racism is going to be brought up when you're talking about racism individually. However, it's pretty undeniable that racism exists within policing and the legal system. 

> Moreover, “systemic racism” also discounts the individual facts of each case, and the personal history of each offender, that led to convictions and punishments.  

No, it doesn't. I don't think we're using the same definition of systemic racism at all.

You are right that criminals are stigmatized by society, but certainly not to any greater extent than in the US. In Norway, we have no reporting requirements for past criminal convictions when applying for jobs (with the exception of some very few professions), or when finding a place to rent. All rights are restored after a sentence has been served. Basically, with the right attitude, society opens up for convicts to lead a better life. The same can not be said for the US, where any job can do a criminal background check, every tenant can do a criminal background check, several pages available to the masses where you can look up past offenses (maybe especially the sexual ones).

In the US, your past is doomed to haunt you to a much greater extent than in Norway. And the path back to a normal law-obiding life is much rougher.",,,1,0,reddit4

I hear a lot are arrested again on stupid parole violations and the likes, which might push the numbers.

I’m lucky to have been a medic and had many civilian options when I was done, but unfortunately that’s not then norm.

Can you imagine being 18, just leaving your parents house- and then being part of an organization that clothes you, feeds you, gives you a place to stay, pays you, and gives you a person who is responsible for keeping you safe and out of trouble- and your job is to basically wait around for something you hope never happens? Then years later, at say age 25/26 setting out on your own never having learned how to do any of this for yourself, and being told “ok, you’re an adult now, get a job and act like an adult!”  Some don’t know how to cope and just go to what feels the most like what they just left. Veterans need more resources, not to feel like they have to take any job that will take them. Sorry I went on a rant, but just so many people don’t understand the predicament that former military are in.",stickers-motivate-me,t2_iecre,5,0,reddit4
gsrqnh7,t1_gsrilja,2021-03-30 05:02:09,science,"I didn’t say there weren’t any incidents of racism in the criminal justice system.  Racism, where and when it occurs, is unacceptable.  

I outlined that many officers are concerned that “systemic racism” is undisprovable.  There is no meaningful metric by which it could ever be challenged and the problem declared formally-ended.  Such a nebulous concept is a centerpiece of many training seminars despite being innately distrusted by problem-solvers in the force.  

Yes, people, even trainers, do often suggest that officers are racist en-masse.  Trainers impliedly do it when they enter meetings pre-supposing that there’s a systemic racism problem that needs fixing in the jurisdiction they’re addressing, and start from the standpoint that differential racial outcomes equal racist intent without a meaningful link to the data of the jurisdiction being addressed.  

I surmise I would need your definition of “systemic racism” to address any difference in our definitions.  Wikipedia defines it thusly:  

> Institutional racism, also known as systemic racism, is a form of racism that is embedded as normal practice within society or an organization.

That presupposed concept, in the unhelpful or insulting training seminars I’ve alluded to, certainly did discount outcomes as a product of individual choices and circumstances, and added a veneer of collectivist culpability without solid evidence to conclude that the specific jurisdiction being addressed actually was somehow systemically-racist.  As you might imagine, that really turned some officers off.  

Additionally, one need look no further than the media coverage over the past year to see what law enforcement are grappling with as they are vilified and demonized as a whole for the actions of a few, and how complex socio-economic problems have been laid at their feet as their fault.  Communicating with law enforcement requires a trainer to show that they aren’t approaching law enforcement with that presupposed bias.  

Finally, I’m providing this feedback so you know some of the dynamics in play that law enforcement are grappling with when faced with the prospect of a training seminar purporting to educate them.  You can feel free to disregard it.  Just know that it’s provided to give a differing perspective than the one you may have of law enforcement as merely obstinate or backwards.",CarelessCogitation,t2_8qkij,-1,0,reddit4

gsqxrxq,t1_gsqqzv3,2021-03-30 00:17:48,science,"To answer your question, I'm a former dispatcher that could help explain. First of all, yes the reason that cops are dispatched is because there are more of them than firefighters and they are each in their own vehicles, dispersed throughout the city, so it's highly likely that a cop is closer to the fire than the fire engine or engines that get dispatched.

Sidenote: the way that police are usually dispatched to any call for service is on a rotational basis whereby each cop is on a list in some order and each service call received goes to the next cop down the list. Most calls are a ""one cop call,"" but calls involving large parties, domestic disputes, robberies in progress, or any other call that is more likely to be dangerous to the officer will result in two officers being dispatched. You might think to yourself, ""why have there been times when I've seen ten cops respond to a fight?"" That's because any available officer can always respond to any call that they hear come over the radio. 

I explained all of that above to explain how this method of dispatching corrects for the inaccuracy of randomly dispatching officers according to which number on the list they are.  So, because a call like a house fire is a highly time-sensitive call, it is unlikely that the dispatcher is going to look at their list, dispatch the next officer on the rotation, and then have that officer be the closest one in the area of the fire. Thus, dispatch will dispatch the next two officers on the list, both of whom just went back in service after making an arrest and stopping at the jail on the other end of town, and are ten minutes away at closest. Another officer that just got done eating two bear claws at the local donut shop a few blocks from the active fire hears the call go out and informs dispatch that he'll be responding, either in addition to, or instead of, the two assigned officers. I'm not sure if the departments with gps tracking on their police vehicles have a better method for determining the closest available units to a given call now, but this is how it has worked in most departments until now. 

So, what can cops do? Firstly, they can help, just like you or anyone else could. If it's an apartment fire, there are probably lots of people willing to help, so maybe they can help provide crowd control, or  otherwise help prepare the scene for the fire department.

Other than being another able bodied adult that can help like any adult, police have the ability to provide intel to the fire department prior to their arrival. As you're probably aware if you've ever listened to a recording of a panicked 911 call, people can be difficult to understand, or panicked beyond being able to communicate effectively over the phone-- especially in situations where people's lives are in the process of being lost-- like in the case of an entrapped person burning to death. In those cases, the caller might've only been able to say ""THERE'S A FIRE, GET HERE QUICK THEY'RE DYING AGT TO F GUY JKO BE F DR E!!? HURRY!"" In those situations, having information from someone trained to provide information on the fire is essential. I'm not sure what the requirements are for dispatching more than one fire engine at a time, but I'm pretty sure that, unless it's been confirmed by a reputable source, a single engine is initially the only engine dispatched. A police officer can provide information about the kind of fire, the size, the number of people entrapped, if the fire is fully involved (burning the entire structure), etc. 

So that's why cops are dispatched to fires. They also have fire extinguishers in their cars, on the off chance that that would be helpful.",unknownmichael,t2_4k3hd,34,0,reddit4

gstn4lr,t1_gssjlof,2021-03-30 17:37:36,science,">What's something that's illegal to sell that isn't commonly used to do something to someone against their will (either to their body or their property)?

There are lots of reasons to ban the sale of something. Saying they're used ""to do something to someone against their will"" is a little vague but I'll assume for the moment you mean actively intending to do someone harm (like knives and guns, which are perfectly legal to sell with some restrictions). Things are banned because they're harmful to animals (ivory, beluga caviar, several kinds of meat) or, (perhaps more relevant to the ""potentially harmful to people by doing it"" argument) some foods are banned because they could potentially but not necessarily harm people who consume them (pufferfish, non-refrigerated eggs, haggis, Kinder eggs, alcoholic energy drinks, raw milk), chemicals of all kinds are highly restricted for various reasons but several because consuming them, even knowing and accepting the risks, has been deemed too dangerous, some things are banned via trade embargo because of politics rather than safety reasons, some things are banned from being sold in a confusing way (cheese vs ""cheese product"", turkey ham, etc), some are illegal to sell to protect certain industries (this is the entire purpose of intellectual property law), I could probably go on but that's good enough for now I think.

>What if it could be proven that people were using it to climb mountains, though?

Climbing mountains isn't illegal but if it were, it's entire possible that they may be banned. There are forms of climbing that aren't mountain climbing which still use them, however, so you'd probably have a tough time banning them completely. If a seller was intentionally selling them at that point with the knowledge that it was going to be used for mountain climbing, that would likely be illegal. Just like selling a gun is (mostly) legal but if the buyer told the seller they were planning to murder someone with it, it would probably make the sale illegal (though I'm not a lawyer so I can't say that for certain). All that said, there is no use for most of these drugs besides consumption which is inherently dangerous. Many drugs are addictive or lethal with as little as one use but certainly with little use overall. Drug dealers know this and use it to their advantage, giving out samples or encouraging customers to bring in other customers. Once someone is addicted, they need help, not punishment, whereas dealers are knowingly preying on people and their addictions.",haldr,t2_fw7yq,1,0,reddit4

Even if I am not forcing people to swallow the pills against their will!

Oh and like with the drug use, under most circumstances if you are a gambler and you and your friend gamble with one another in the privacy of your home you're unlikely to face criminal charges.

gssvrhh,t1_gssqvco,2021-03-30 14:10:58,science,"There's a reason that using drugs in this fashion is called ""recreational drug use"". 

State-sanctioned drug distribution of controlled drugs which require prescriptions are generally only approved in order to treat specific conditions, **not** for recreational purposes.

There are drugs that do not require prescriptions and also are not controlled substances and these can be purchased freely and legally however you want to do so.

For example, alcohol is not a controlled substance (for users over the age of 21 in the United States) and I can go and purchase literally as much alcohol and beer as I want and consume it how I want so long as I do not drive or perform any actions which require me to be sober.

Similarly I can buy as many cigarettes or cigars that I want.

In states where marijuana is legal, I can purchase it from a sanctioned distributor as I like.

I really don't understand what your argument is. In your earlier comment it sounded like you were arguing that people who use drugs are somehow more culpable because no one is compelling them to use drugs.

My argument is that if you live in a society that believes the widespread use of controlled substances for recreational purposes may be a bad thing, you should prosecute those responsible for distributing the drugs and creating a commercial demand that enables suppliers and manufacturers of the drug. You should not prosecute the individual consumers of the drug.

That's partially because prosecuting individual consumers is not going to have a huge effect on demand in the way that arresting distributors would.

But also because it's way more likely that this prosecution is going to be unfair — poor people and people of color are way more likely than white or affluent people to be detained and searched for drug contraband, so they are way more likely to face criminal charges for possession even though there's evidence that drug use is more widespread than arrest numbers would suggest. Like I don't know the exact numbers but let's imagine than a poor person is 3x as likely to use drugs as someone who makes $100k/year. That poor person is probably 10-20x more likely to be charged with possession, just because their chances of having *any* kind off interaction with police is extremely small.",youlleatitandlikeit,t2_93gv9,0,0,reddit4

The company I worked for had a partnership with FLIR, that camera you had been referencing had been developed well over 10 years ago but it needed to go through quite a rigorous testing procedure to have the certification related to quantification of leak events, using the camera, it was quite obvious when a leak occurred, we even developed ML programs to attach alarming to it; however, the sticking point was determining if it was a leak that you could be potentially fined for or of material value to justify repair.   


Like I'm sure you remember, It gets back to the ""detection is the easy part"", many aspects of the wellsite run off of gas pneumatics, which will periodically off-gas to perform their function, these would be the most common pings on the cameras, to the point of technicians completely writing off the camera system off because of the ""false positives"". The issue is the leaks that people are thinking about were still detected, but were often of smaller volumes than just normal operation off-gassing. This really begs the question of are we focused in the right area, or is all of this off-gassing an issue and it needs to be addressed on a large scale.

The plant is run as long as they can make profit, bar legal action. Nothing else will stop a mill.


The workers are kicked out abruptly (it caused a 20-22 year protest outside the mill but no one ever listened. The last 5-6 members[very old people] that have been on that protest place daily for as long as i can remember dwindled out in Covid. Now that spot is barren.)




The mill will either be maintained by a skeleton crew(in one case, there was a big manual clock tower on the mill, so its taken care of kinda.....no cleaning or stuff afaik), demolished, be repurposed(but not renovated) if theres structure that can still be used, or left barren as an eyesore.

hzavzx1,t3_t6gaz4,2022-03-04 10:46:59,science,"Following a major study of the effects of personality on job performance, researchers zoomed in on one personality trait – agreeableness – and found that it has a desirable effect on hundreds of physical, psychological and occupational metrics that impact not only job performance but general life success.

Michael Wilmot, assistant professor of management at the University of Arkansas, and Deniz Ones, professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, examined a wide range of variables, from psychological and physical health to interpersonal relationships, and from leadership effectiveness to performance in academic and organizational settings.

the researchers summarized results from 142 meta-analyses reporting effects for 275 variables. In all, the results comprised more than 1.9 million participants from roughly 3,900 studies. Meta-analysis is a process used to systematically merge multiple independent findings using statistical methods to calculate an overall effect.

Wilmot and Ones found that agreeableness had a desirable effect on 93% of variables and outcomes.

“We wanted to do a quantitative summary and synthesis of what we have learned about relations between agreeableness, one of the so-called Big 5 personality traits, and its consequences,” Wilmot said. “We know this is important – perhaps now more than ever – because agreeableness is the personality trait primarily concerned with helping people and building positive relationships, which is not lost on organizational leaders.”

During our conversation we also talked about another colleague who I thought was a much smarter, and certainly a harder working engineer than me, but could be rather abrasive. The manager indicated that he wouldn't really want him back as it wasn't a good fit. 

Like I said I thought the other engineer was smarter and would DEFINITELY put in more hours... but I think his personality may have rubbed others the wrong way.

One is that women are paid less for the same job as men, which varies on the industry, but is often quoted around 4% less pay. But a recent study found at least 50% of women were paid less than male counterparts for the same job, compared to 19% of male counterparts who were paid less for the same job. It should be said this varies wildly based on industry, and women in “traditional” roles such as teacher and nurses do not see as large of a gap or no gap versus manufacturing or other industries. 

This gap has decreased drastically in recent years, partially as women are demanding more fair and equitable pay and raises. This is what you’re referencing that being less agreeable and more assertive may help fix. 

The other and more problematic societal gap which is “the women make 76-82% of what men make” side refers to total income across all industries. Women are less likely to seek out higher paying jobs in industries that were traditionally male. They are also less likely to pursue high levels in those industries or to be given promotions to higher positions. The reasons why are numerous and there are 1000’s of papers going into them. 

As a side note, while inequality for women is already a problem, white women out earn Hispanic and black men, who in turn out earn Hispanic and black women. All of these are problems that have to be addressed on a societal and even global scale.",DasFunke,t2_5ruok,3,0,reddit2

Albeit my mom as well as probably many others have moms that can be manipulative yet not sociopathic(when she’s not drinking) haha.

One that I use it for is when I have to write a paper or article or report, I can jot down some major and minor bullet points and throw it into ChatGPT to write up a draft.

I would say this saves me about 20% of the time to write something up compared if I were to do it on my own.  Maybe saves closer 15% of my time if I'm using something like Grammerly instead.

Depends on the model.  Generally they are a lump of stats and linear algebra thrown at data, but machine-learning itself is poorly defined.  One could call linear-regression a ""machine-learning"" algorithm.  If you are talking about neural networks specifically they are finite implementations of universal function approximators.

csgntkl,t1_csgebnj,2015-06-24 02:51:32,science,"This is very cool actually! The biggest problem preterm babies have when they are born is with breathing. This is because their lungs don't produce a substance called surfactant. Surfactant acts to decrease the surface tension in the airways leading to deep inside the lungs. This is important because the muscles of breathing (primarily the diaphragm) can only generate so much negative pressure, without the decreased surface tension, the alveoli will not be ventilated. This is why when premature babies are born, we shoot surfactant into their lungs to help them breathe. Unfortunately, this method is only so good, any many babies go into what is called ""neonatal respiratory distress syndrome"" and some die. When a baby is born before the lungs are developed enough, they will not be viable. If I remember correctly (I'm on mobile so maybe someone else can double check me) this process is usually done around week 26. For these reasons, it makes sense, and previous research has showed, that the lungs send signals that are relayed to the mother about its development.

Steroids don't promote antenatal lung growth *per se*; rather, they stimulate type II pneumocytes to produce surfactant, reducing the chance of infant respiratory distress syndrome. The lungs themselves function in the sense that the diaphragm works, and air goes in and out just fine, but until a significant amount of surfactant is produced, actual gas exchange at the alveolar level is severely impaired. While tocolytics can temporarily delay labor (generally by ~48 hours), they can't stave it off forever; in the meantime, providing steroids allows enough surfactant production to make gas exchange somewhat effective.",thebellmaster1x,t2_37km7,29,0,reddit4

They might even think it's irresponsible of the government to force people to wear them.

Induction is the same. Induction may not be the perfect solution in an ideal scenario but the longer someone is pregnant the more chance of the baby being stillborn. So the doctors weigh up the negatives of both and go with what they think is the safest option. There was research done that decided 40weeks was a sensible cutoff where the risks of problems is minimal. There is some concern about doctors doing the same thing at 37weeks but that is a different story.

There will still be stillbirths before 40weeks and there will be people that have perfectly healthy babies at 45weeks because medicine isn't all or nothing, it's about weighing the odds of things happening. ",Winterplatypus,t2_cx8qi,2,0,reddit4

csgxder,t1_csgre78,2015-06-24 10:58:28,science,"Keep in mind, these aren't started until labor has actually been initiated prematurely. So I would think that there is something else other than SP-A that is able to begin labor, since the reason infant RDS occurs is due to a lack of surfactant production that early on. At the same time, surfactant production is generally sufficient by 34 weeks of gestation, and we don't administer steroids after that point (in the US; the UK has slightly different recommendations); however, there's still 4-6 weeks of gestation left. Perhaps surfactant production continues in excess of what I'd necessary for gas exchange, and that level triggers labor. 

If the effects are due to uterine inflammation as they say, I guess you could speculate that betamethasone or dexamethasone might reduce that inflammation and possibly delay labor a little bit, but in practice the steroids are given alongside a true tocolytic like albuterol or nifedipine.

>You can't use it to drill down into genetic differences, though, because of the ridiculously large number of ethnicities held just within the ""African"" race, for example.

Sure you can, to some extent at least. If your operational definition of race is based on appearance, or even perceived appearance, then genetics can play a role. Genetics can certainly dictate things like skin tone, facial structure, and hair texture, which are common factors that many people use to define race. Ethnicities generally aren't all that important when defining a race, as race is more broad and generalized, whereas ethnicity is much more specific to a nation/community.

It **necessarily** does.  You are literally trying to argue that there is some genetic difference that would cause black police officers to be more likely to misbehave than white police officers.  And it has to be genetic in nature, because black Americans have almost zero knowledge of their African cultural roots.  As a group they are as thoroughly American as possible, because their African roots were intentionally stripped away.

Genetics can certainly dictate things like skin tone, facial structure, and hair texture, which are common factors that many people use to define race.

I guess you've never noticed the incredible breadth of skin tones, facial structures, and hair textures just among African Americans, much less those of eastern Africa, western Africa, and southern Africa.  Even northern Africa, excluding the Berbers and other Arabic ethnicities.

>Ethnicities generally aren't all that important when defining a race, as race is more broad and generalized, whereas ethnicity is much more specific to a nation/community.

And what I am telling you is that there are multiple individual ethnicities in Africa, each with more genetic diversity than the entirety of the ethnicities we think of as European.  There is more genetic diversity in people of African descent than in all other ethnic groups **combined**.  Hell, there is more genetic diversity in people of Middle Eastern descent than the **remaining** ethnic groups combined.

Do you understand yet?

>Race and ethnicity are certainly a tangled mess to deal with, and maybe it's not even worth trying to sort out in such a globalized world.

It really isn't.  The only field it would be truly useful for are genetics and medicine.  This study is more about perceived race.",xdre,t2_5uv8y,0,0,reddit1

Good god, Canada has a huge problem just trying to recruit new nurses, people are looking at the shambles of provincial healthcare where multiple provinces are slowly trying to privatize everything and saying they'd rather work in almost any other job where they won't be pushed to the breaking point so some corporate executive can buy another mansion. 


In Ontario, hospitals have to rely more and more on private, for-profit nurse staffing agencies because the province can't reatain nurses directly. They are giving up provincial benefits to go to a job that pays slightly better, has slightly better scheduling practices. 
That company in turn charges the province over four times more than it cost to employ the nurses directly. 

One prominent owner of these temp agencies is a former provincial premiere who laid the groundwork for his future career of milking taxpayer money. He and his wife own at least two nurse staffing agencies, and he's the chairman of the board of the biggest private long term care corporation in the province, which is also hugely profitable thanks to rules he implemented when he was premiere.

Let hospitals be built if people think there's enough demand for another one to make it work. End local Healthcare monopolies.


2. Stop regulating the number of students allowed to enroll in medical school. Look, I know the high demand for doctors keep their income very high and medical school very expensive because the demand for both greatly exceeds the forcefully limited supply, but we past the point of diminishing returns 20 years ago.


3. Get rid of the excessive regulations that make it so doctors frequently spend more time on paperwork than on patients. Sometimes the doctor themselves isn't doing the paperwork other than signing it, but then they have to work longer to afford to pay the staff and that also leads to burnout.

Let hospitals be built if people think there's enough demand for another one to make it work. End local Healthcare monopolies.""

Where do you see authorities preventing the construction of new hospitals? It certainly isn't occurring in Texas. The problems we face are staffing the hospitals (and other heathcare facilities) we have and providing enough funding to keep rural hospitals open.


""2. Stop regulating the number of students allowed to enroll in medical school. Look, I know the high demand for doctors keep their income very high and medical school very expensive because the demand for both greatly exceeds the forcefully limited supply, but we past the point of diminishing returns 20 years ago.""

The primary ""regulation"" for the number of nursing and physician students is the availability of clinical training slots, and the greatest clamp on those slots is the lack of qualified supervisors. Schools aren't turning away students for whom they have the capacity to train.


""3. Get rid of the excessive regulations that make it so doctors frequently spend more time on paperwork than on patients. Sometimes the doctor themselves isn't doing the paperwork other than signing it, but then they have to work longer to afford to pay the staff and that also leads to burnout.

""Do that, and you solve 75% of the problems with the U.S. Healthcare System.""

The greatest source of ""regulatory paperwork"" that physicians and other healthcare professionals face is the maze created by our bizarre grafting of a risk-insurance model of funding onto health care. So, yes, getting rid of that and moving to a system primarily funded through a single-payer model providing basic healthcare coverage for every US resident would go a long way toward solving that problem.",UnionTed,t2_1tga1w4l,8,0,reddit2

jrml33e,t1_jrmhzda,2023-07-12 03:55:59,science,"I know that's what you're told, however, insurance companies used to be very simple risk models, basing prices on the risk being asked for the company to assume, and weren't all so onerous to work with. Know what changed that? The actions of that single payer, that's what! Instead of just risk models, now they were forced to take high risks, and were forced not to be able to charge the required amount for that risk by government regulations. For example, insurance companies used to have cheap policies specifically for children as the health risk a child represents is very small and if you get the policy early, then more often than not, by the time anything major happened, the parents had already paid more in premiums than the cost of paying out for whatever was needed, and it worked. Then the government felt it was wrong to not insure older children whose parents did not pay into the policy, driving the rate so far up that the policies were then cancelled and children were enrolled under the same policies as the adults, so where there used to be a very cost effective way to insure a child, now there wasn't. That's one example of dozens. If you think the government won't mess up healthcare once it has complete control over it, think again.

A friend of mine lives in Canada with such a system. His son got a splinter embedded deep into his thumb, too deep to safely dig out, so his parents took him to the hospital in Canada. They said they could see him in 6 weeks. The next morning his son's thumb was so infected they were afraid that he might loose it, or that it might spread further. They went back to the hospital, they said they could put him on a waiting list if they wanted to wait close by in case something opened up sooner but if not, he could be seen in 2 weeks, by which time the infection would probably have spread past the point of saving. So, they came to stay with me for a week and took their son to the hospital here, they made him wait 10 hours, which is still absurd, but at the end, he had antibiotics and a gameplan on how to treat his thumb. A week later, he was totally healed up.

A free market healthcare system isn't perfect, and the government's done nothing but make it increasingly difficult to do anything, but if you think giving that same government complete control is the answer, well, there are several other countries that do that, move there and enjoy! Here, we need to get the government almost completely out of healthcare like it used to be. My doctor knows better than a bureaucrat that lives 3,000 miles from me ever will.

Lasik eye surgery is largely unregulated by the government and also not covered by most insurance companies. Over the past 20 years, the price has dropped precipitously and the results have gotten better and better. What used to cost $40,000 now costs $2,000 or less and has even better results and very little waiting. That's what a free-market system can do. Plus, in a free-market system, if my kid gets very very sick where his life is in danger, I can pay for whatever treatment might help, and try again, and again, until I can't afford anymore. In a single-payer system, a guy in a chair with a gavel decides how much my son's life is worth and when I have to stop, and with no other nations having a free-market healthcare system, I won't have anywhere else to go like many residents of the U.K. and Canada that come here for help can.",Daramore,t2_x08vj,0,0,reddit2

Maximizing profits? Or minimizing losses
 They're exactly the same thing. Every single emergency department in the entire country loses money like crazy and needs the rest of the hospital to make up for it. 

That's not something they want to or can afford to lose even more money doing.

Good, then you should know the answer to this question. Which healthcare system has come up with more life saving medical treatments, technologies, and innovations? Market driven systems, or single payer systems?

I'm sure you know the answer, but the real question is how much. The answer is that in the last century, over 98% of modern medicine originated in market based healthcare systems. This enabled us to take life expectancy and significantly increase it! Most of that innovation came from the U.S. and still does today.

You also know with your vast experience that healthcare in this nation has been declining in various ways over the past 40 years, thus why you want to move to a single payer system, and in fact the most complaints about our healthcare system have taken place in the last 10 years. Know what changed? There was a huge package of government regulations that rolled out, and more and more since. That isn't the only change of course, but it is the largest by far. Not only that, but these regulations killed a lot of the competition when it comes to insurance companies so that there are really only 3 that compete on any significant level now where there used to be hundreds. Also, good luck starting another one and complying with all the regulations. The insurance giants don't mind the pressure too much because it leaves them uncontested, and thus all the things you have against insurance companies.

I just don't see how the solution to all these issues that are a direct result of government seizing more and more control over the market is to give that same government total control of it.

Do you really think politicians and bureaucrats can really make better decisions for you and your health than your doctor and you? Are there any politicians you would trust your child's life to? There are about 3 I like, but there are none I would entrust my child's life to when it matters.

> most don't actually meet a reasonable definition of that term.

I agree completely. However, there's no denying that the more market driven the service is, the better it is overall results. That's my point. Maybe there is a point of that where there's diminishing returns and a true free-market system wouldn't ultimately work long-term, but I say let's move things in that direction until we find that point, because there's a whole lot of good things that have been proven to come out of that direction (and a few bad things too, just to be honest, but the bad things are typically short lived).

>universal access model in Canada, France, and elsewhere provides good distribution of the social good of healthcare while controlling costs reasonably well.

There have been more people who die in both of those systems than their counterparts in the U.S. Do you remember the controversy about the woman used to advertise for assisted suicide in Canada? She said in an interview that she actually wanted to live, but the Canadian healthcare system decided not to make the treatment she needed available to her until long after she would suffer and die, and so she chose to have a doctor end her life early, while she was still able to be mostly normal. She isn't alone either, hundreds of people have also chosen the same when faced with the healthcare systems you want to implement here. France is looking (or may have already adopted) the same government sanctioned suicide as Canada. Had that woman been in the United States, she could have gotten the treatment in time, but by the time she was fed up with Canada's system, it was already too late even if she did come here. I can provide many more examples of similar stories if you want, but I think I've made my point. Flawed as it is, and sad as this is for me to say, the U.S. has the closest to a free-market healthcare system of any major nation in the world. If people want a single payer system, they can vote with their feet and go to places that have it. Instead of making the U.S. just another nation with the exactly the same system as everyone else, let's try an experiment and go the other way, and if it doesn't work, at least there will still be other options.

I assume that by that you mean that healthcare is so expensive that your kid might die because you can't afford treatment, yes? Well, a giant reason why healthcare is so expensive is because it's monopolized and overly regulated like I mentioned earlier. Go back and look at healthcare costs vs new regulations and you'll see that there's a very strong correlation between new regulations being added and costs rising significantly. Again, lasik which has much less regulation has done the opposite, it's gotten cheaper and better over time in spite of it being a type of healthcare as well.

You even mentioned that markets are a good way of regulating scarce resources. You don't think about it, but one of those scarce resources is the time of medical providers. There are people who go see a doctor for almost every little every sniffle they get because they have an insurance policy that covers that and clog the system, and COVID-19 didn't help at all because you could have it and not even know it, so people were just walking in to get a test because they heard someone sneeze 1 aisle over in the grocery store.

Before I make my next point, I realized I forgot to address one of your earlier points. Do you know what a Certificate of Need is regarding the construction of new healthcare facilities and how those get issued out? Do you remember how you were saying there aren't enough supervising medical professionals? Do you think these two things might be related in some way?

How did you come to that conclusion? I honestly would love to hear your explanation. It sounds like you're saying that if we make abortions illegal across the nation, there will just be a black market for it. Here's the the thing though, while that's true, it means that we go from killing over 900,000 children a year to less than 10,000 on the black market, then we've saved 890,000 lives per year, most of them minorities! I don't see how that's not a major win.

>This is not why orphan diseases aren't pursued. They are not pursued because they aren't profitable. It is c-suites who refuse to research them, and bureaucrats who provide COMMUNIST public funding to research some of them.

Do you have any clue how absurd this statement is? Do you know how many cures for rare diseases communists have come up with verses capitalists? For every disease cure that emerged from a communist nation, there's over 90 from capitalist nations.

Secondly, free-market does not always mean super profit, it means that you are free to pursue whatever you want if you can figure out the means to procure the materials needed to do the research. Do you have any idea how many rare diseases were cured because someone was suffering from it and a friend or family member pursued a treatment for it? They didn't have to convince the establishment why materials needed for the research should be moved from other projects over to theirs, they rolled up their sleeves and found the materials wherever they could and got the research done. I admit that nowadays the healthcare system is closer to a communist system than ever so there is some of that going on, but even today, that research unfettered from the establishment still happens!

Under communism, you almost never get that kind of freedom unless someone powerful suffers from the rare condition by coincidence (or in a tiny handful of cases, because they were secretly made to suffer).

Sorry, I know I write walls of text, but that's because I run into so many people who have been failed in their education, told only about the vices of a free-market economy and none of the virtues, while told only about the never-before-seen virtues of socialist economic systems that we will get this time if we just switch to it, and are almost completely ignorant of the astounding number of dead bodies they have left behind and why that happened, just told that it'll be different the next time, like everyone has been told every time before. So I have a tendency to over-explain, to try and cram down years of economic knowledge in a few paragraphs. I'll try to cut it down a little bit further.

TLDR: The only systems in history that have constantly and predictably increased life expectancies and human wellbeing are those closest to a Free-Market economic system. Every other system has done the exact opposite, socialism, fascism, cronyism (what the U.S. has now), and communism. Free-market economic principles brought over 4 billion people out of abject poverty and privation in the last century alone. Those same principles can and would fix our flagging healthcare system.",Daramore,t2_x08vj,0,0,reddit2

If you say yes, I would like to hear how you came to that conclusion.

Here's the difference, in Capitalism, when it moves towards Cronyism or even becomes Cronyism, the leftover dregs of Capitalisms can be used to revert Cronyism back to a more Free-Market system because it still requires people to make choices, and that is happening now. Angel Studios just broke Hollywood's stranglehold on the Theaters with Sound of Freedom for example. I can name many more.

Under more socialist governments, when it does inevitably become corrupted (which it does every time and leaves large numbers of bodies in or on the ground when it happens), what recourse do the people have? Violently overthrow one corrupt regime to install the next corrupt regime over and over bringing about massive bloodshed and instability on a frequent basis?

When power is concentrated as it inevitably must be for socialism to function, then a bad person can cause untold amounts of damage. When power is dispersed far and wide, then we can whether many bad people because they don't have the power to affect the lives of so many.

The comparison with total compensation isn’t clear on whether they adjust for the difference between pensions and 401k style retirement plans - since pension costs for an employee are backloaded vs 401k costs for an employee are realized for that employee in the same year he receives salary.

Do you think the entire field of pyschometrics has concluded that IQ tests are good at measuring intelligence? So if you want to appeal to authority you should look into the authority more. 

IQ tests are good at measuring ""intelligence"" defined in such a way that doing well on an IQ test means you have high intelligence. It's a very narrow definition of intelligence. Note the following from this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927908/#ref53) 

""Related evidence suggests that IQ scores are inconsistent at predicting variation in performance (including the extremities) on activities such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making (Stanovich, 2009; Fletcher et al., 2018)."" 

""However, their real-world interpretations inflate them to represent overall mental functioning across wide-ranging domains, from education achievement to job performance and interpersonal relationships (Sternberg et al., 2001). This inflation is evident from the contradictions observed in the evidence on the predictive value of the IQ tests. Related research suggests a weak to moderate correlation between performance on IQ tests and outcomes on education, job performance, income levels, and overall individual well-being (Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Strenze, 2007). Other factors, such as parent’s socio-economic status (Strenze, 2007), have been shown to moderate these correlations actively. Overall, the evidence points to an interpretive gap between what the IQ tests are believed to measure and what they do.""

""However, a recent meta-analytic review of motivational influences on cognitive performance suggests that dispositional traits account for less considerable variation when compared to shifts in motivational states (Van Iddekinge et al., 2018). In a seminal study, Duckworth et al. (2011) present evidence on how state changes in test taker’s motivations significantly predict performance on the IQ tests. The research also suggests that the predictive validity of the IQ scores for various life outcomes substantially diminishes with the shifts in motivational levels of the test taker.

""Growing evidence suggests that motivations energize and guide the cognitive performance of a typical test taker (Duckworth et al., 2011). Relatedly, the dispositional theory of intelligence (Perkins et al., 1993) predicts that trait motivations drive much of the variation in performance on the IQ tests. Likewise, research suggests that traits such as growth mindset, openness to experience, and need for cognition modulate the willingness to search and process information that, in turn, influences an individual’s performance on an IQ test (Dweck, 2006; Woods et al., 2019).

Feedback on performance and subsequent affective states influence the cognitive functioning of the test taker. Mainly, the negative affective states like task anxiety have been found to lower the performance on the IQ tests substantially (von der Embse et al., 2018). To sum up, sparse but significant evidence on motivational and affective processes suggests that they account for substantial variation in performance on the IQ tests.""

People with lower income might perform worse on IQ tests because of these factors and not because people born into low-income are somehow born less intelligent.

This other [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950413/) discusses how you can improve your score, but it doesn't actually mean you improved your intelligence.

Similarly, there have been many studies about how SAT scores are skewed for income, but you didn't know that either and are trying to say it measures intelligence too, just because SAT and IQ scores happen to be correlated. You are mixing up correlation between two tests that can both be improved upon by simply spending money.

Why is the skill rarer? Maybe because complex jobs require a level of intelligence that is rare in society? I mean, it's almost like the rarity of those skills are directly correlated to the high end of the IQ distribution in society...

These and other data are summarized to illustrate how the advantages of higher g, even when they are small, cumulate to affect the overall life chances of individuals at different ranges of the IQ bell curve. The article concludes by suggesting ways to reduce the risks for low-IQ individuals of being left behind by an increasingly complex postindustrial economy.

 Oooh, I know, maybe you can try to get the tech oligarchs to censor this as ""misinformation""? It doesn't fit your ideology so it MUST be misinformation right?

> Don't worry about it, man. I was 21 once, too.

Well, I'm way older than that, but I wonder what you'll say when you learn that some measures of fluid intelligence peak at age 20 and then decline? Who am I kidding, you don't even know what fluid vs crystallized intelligence means. 

> The researchers gathered data from nearly 50,000 subjects and found a very clear picture showing that each cognitive skill they were testing peaked at a different age. **For example, raw speed in processing information appears to peak around age 18 or 19, then immediately starts to decline.**

https://news.mit.edu/2015/brain-peaks-at-different-ages-0306

But I guess they used IQ tests for this data so it doesn't count. Of course crystalized intelligence or so called ""emotional intelligence"" doesn't peak until much later in life, but again, they use IQ tests to gather this data and IQ tests are like, republican or something.

For your typical silicon panels this voltage jump is at a location where you can only get around 29% return from normal sunlight, based on the photons that will do nothing and the photons that will have extra energy wasted.

However you can layer multiple different photo-voltaic materials together. The idea is that the higher energy photons can hit the higher voltage jump materials, so that (some of) their extra energy can actually be used. The photons that are too low energy for the first material pass through to hit the second material, and so on and so forth.

Edit: I should state that these solar panels aren't used in terrestrial applications (at least widespread) because they are typically a lot more expensive to manufacture.

I feel like I missed this day in science class. 

Also was the matter earth is made of from the sun or from a previous star? I would have assumed a previous star. I could be way off but if I understand correctly (which I probably don't) geothermal is a very roundabout way of harnessing the energy of gravity. Mind you I know very little about accretion and what role our sun might have played in it.

Also with nuclear fission, is our sun really involved at all? Assuming again that the matter that makes up our earth is the result of a previous star wouldn't that be energy independent of our sun?

I know there's work being done on tidal energy generation and wouldn't that again essentially be a way of harnessing the energy of gravity?

I'm sorry if I'm coming off as an ass, I'm not trying to prove you wrong; I'm actually genuinely curious as to the sun's role in these types of energy. It doesn't seem to me like the sun is involved but then again everything we are seems to have some connection to our sun. Oh and of course if you include other stars under the term ""solar power"" then it would at least satisfy the case of fission being a form of solar power. Should we call this ""solar power"" nuclear fusion within our own sun or should we just leave it at nuclear fusion in a general sense?

dfbbfyp,t1_dfaykcn,2017-03-23 17:23:46,science,"That's not how layers work. A semiconductor junction, or where two SC materials meet, has ""energy bandgap"" that is determined by the composition. For example, silicon cells have a different bandgap than Gallium Arsenide. Energy bandgaps are related to quantum mechanics so I won't really go into it but the practical application is that a solar cell can absorb photons to make energy as long as the energy in that photon is greater than the bandgap.

That's an important point so let me reiterate it. For a silicon cell to produce electricity when it gets hit by photons those photons need to have a higher energy than silicone energy bandgap. When a photon hits the silicon it excites an electron. If the electron gets excited higher​ than the bandgap it is ""freed"" and produces voltage AKA electricity.

A *multijunction* solar cell is where you have many different SCs, each with a different band gap. We stack them on top of each other so we can maximize how many photons we can absorb. All photons are not born equal. The energy in a photon is determined by it's wavelength. Our sun puts out some wavelengths more than others. On earth we have much more green light than other kinds of light so panels that target that range will make more electricity (well, they will have more photons. It's also about efficiency, energy per photon, etc.). We build the multijunction cells to try and maximize how much of this spectrum we can absorb.

Really cool tangent: because the sun puts out some wavelengths more than others there is a maximum efficiency you can have a lightbulb while still making it look like a white light. If you see an LED bulb with an efficiency above 760 Watts they are probably putting extra green in the light! Green is more efficient than some of the other colors​ (due to wavelength) and our eyes respond to green light more than others because it's the most common so a manufacturer can put extra green in and make a brighter bulb for less power, but it will be green.

TLDR Panels are like ogres. Their layers stack to improve efficiency but it's because of reasons you wouldn't immediately think. Also don't let LED manufacturers fuck you over.",,,2,0,reddit4

Yes, that's technically true. However, tens of thousands will die living in a shelter somewhere because their family farms, lands, and homes are now in a quarantine zone that will last for decades, and in some cases, forever because there just isn't a way to clean some things up. Also, most of Japan is recovered or recovering from the tsunami, but their economy is going to suffer from this one facility's poor engineering decisions for a century or more.

Just because it's a good idea in the perfect world of paper doesn't mean it's a good idea in real life, where real life things tend to go wrong.

The decision to not build the Daichii facility immune from a R9 earthquake and the resultant tsunami was an economic one, they made a bet they wouldn't experience such a quake and tsunami in the 30-40 year lifetime of the plant and they lost that bet. So did a hundred thousand other people. Large areas contaminated by Fukushima weren't even affected by the tsunami, and only marginally affected by the quake.

Japan has a well-documented history of major earthquakes and tsunamis going back fifteen hundred years:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_tsunamis

The designers of that facility should have designed it to withstand the worst case scenario. Of course, that would have made it uneconomical, but look who's paying for that now: The Japanese taxpayers.

j2agnst,t1_j28aper,2022-12-30 20:37:02,science,"There's kinda three ways of dealing with pain medically.  Make the pain go away, make the person not care about the pain they feel, and make the person feeling the pain forget that it's actually them feeling pain.

Chemically there are the three main types

Painkillers: like NSAIDs so ibuprofen etc. and opioids like morphine or oxycodone

Sedatives: things like Valium, Xanax, and to a lesser extent opioids also fit into this category

Dissociatives: that's a drug that dissociates you from yourself and depending on the drug either from just your body, just your sense of self, or both.  This is things like PCP, some cold medicines when taken at recreational doses, DMT, some other hallucinogens, and nitrous or laughing gas.  Yes PCP and that stuff dentist's give to children are in the same category of drug.

PCP was actually originally developed as a form of general anesthesia, they gave it to people and then did surgery on them, anything from minor surgeries to major internal surgeries, with the person fully awake and aware, and yet they just didn't care.  Because to them it wasn't them feeling that it was some guy, they were just a disembodied consciousness often with little to no sense of self watching it.  They stopped trials because PCP is an incredibly powerful stimulant and they kept having problems with patients getting up and or attacking surgeons during surgery.  If they don't fear consequences because it isn't them doing it, can't be affected by pain, are amped up on drugs and made hyper aggressive it's easy to see the violence that results from it.  PCP also builds up in fat tissue and can be released later leading to the person possibly getting that effect again randomly later without warning.  Though I haven't read the Wikipedia page recently so take this last part with a grain of salt.

I also have read and have personal experience that agrees with that that some stimulants like ADHD meds can increase pain tolerance too, especially for pain from physical exertion or injury.  It doesn't reduce the pain, it doesn't make you not care, and you are fully present within your body.  It just makes you care more about whatever it is you're doing than the pain.  It's affecting the same systems that would be activated by getting attacked by a mountain lion or seeing some crazy person run up behind you and grabbing your kid and running off with them.

You're gonna run really hard discomfort be damned, and strangle that mountain lion with your bare hands after getting clawed up and mauled, then walk ten miles back to safety.
