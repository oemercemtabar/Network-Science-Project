The majortiy population did actually vote to keep the USSR in 1991 with exception to the baltics states and a few regions in the south near Turkey but the following military coup created the Russian Federation. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\_Soviet\_Union\_referendum#/media/File:Soviet\_Union\_referendum,\_1991\_results.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_Union_referendum#/media/File:Soviet_Union_referendum,_1991_results.svg) (Green and dark green is the keep the USSR)

Essentially because of the policies of Gorbachev the USSR started to produce what was most profitable, not most needed. Communist Party hardliners revolting against it and the coup failed with Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev winning, dismantling the Soviet Union and selling off the previously public sectors to their friends at cheap prices.

I'm not a communist nor stauch USSR supporter but I think a lot of their contribution to the world and human history is put to one side. They had a literacy rate of 24% or so in 1900 and after the Libkez and other education reforms the literacy rate was near 100% or just under in the 70s and 80s. They went from having an industrial capacity of Brazil in 1900 to then making humanity a space-faring species.

You can't compare to USSR to the USA for various reasons. The USSR had two wars on its actual soil with buildings, farms and cities decimated. They lost around 17 million of their population during the WW2 because of the German invasion but also pushed the Germans back to Berlin and killed more Axis soldiers than all the allies combined.

Needs to be bookended by an overview of a rather grim existence of an average Soviet citizen even before Gorbachev, and by questioning why sometimes people choose to remain abused. Learned helplessness, fear of the unknown (justified, as history proved), clinging for stability — all the classic stuff.

I cherish both cultural and scientific achievements of the USSR. However, every author, researcher, inventor, every cinematographer or singer — you dig a bit and if not themselves, then they had someone close in the family jailed/executed for political reasons.

 >A referendum on the future of the Soviet Union was held on 17 March 1991 across the Soviet Union. The question put to voters was  Do you consider necessary the preservation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any ethnicity will be fully guaranteed? The referendum was made with the aim of approving the Union of Sovereign States. In Kazakhstan, the wording of the referendum was changed by substituting ""equal sovereign states"" for ""equal sovereign republics"".

j0tw1ik,t1_j0t4h37,2022-12-19 11:24:05,stupidpol,"CPI uses hedonic adjustments and substitutions, which I believe are it's fatal flaw in measuring ""real life"" inflation. It just doesn't capture what real people experience, and doesn't measure the change in QOL that occurs from those shifts. 

Substitution assumes that as prices go up for one good, people shift to cheaper goods (which are cheaper and lead to lower headline inflation). It has a kernel of truth - I might change where I shop if prices go up, but it also means I need to accept lower quality goods. If something inflates less than other stuff in its category, it gets weighted higher.

Hedonic adjustments are a way of discounting quality improvements in goods over time. Stuff like having a remote control for your TV, or electric windows on a car - things you can't even select because they're built in to every product now - are adjustments that are used to reduce the headline inflation rate of goods. The thinking is that it's better than it was 50 years ago, so the increased price is actually explained by options people are deliberately choosing to include in their purchase, so we can hand wave the actually higher price tag as being part of those features. Now go buy a brand new 8k CRT TV because that LED option isn't to your liking.

These are fundamental problems with CPI as reported, and it's intentional. They're purpose-built to decrease headline, because technology will always be improving the quality of goods, and people always want higher quality goods even if there might be cheaper substitutions. 

The Fed ostensibly does surveys and studies to confirm some of these data post-facto but of course there's a lot of pressure to hide the fact that a few decades ago, an entry level worker could get a house, a stay at home spouse, new car, two kids, college, hospital whenever needed, the works. And today people are putting off reproduction - our biological imperative - because of money scarcity. CPI/PCE doesn't explain that, and wage measures have supposedly 'kept up with inflation'.

Honestly people like you are so cucked it’s genuinely painful, I don’t know what compels you to defend this garbage. Like at least demand they become better liars or something, reporting 100x over the real value is just, pathetically lazy lying.

Edit: and the other thing that is cucked about this is that you are seriously defending this shit on the grounds that they’re estimates or whatever, like that matters at all. “Hey we theoretically created a million jobs!” That’s fucking great, I theoretically have a million dollars and a dick made of chocolate and gold, gonna be some real disappointed bitches out there though when I take my pants off 

Biden admin is the definition of end game ruling class political disconnect. Don’t worry about *actually creating jobs*, just worry about the *report*. Not even a second thought about the idea that those jobs are *connected* to something, that if you don’t actually deliver on the job creation *in real life* something bad may happen. You can’t eat a report! Biden could *report* he created a bajillion jobs and they all pay >200k, who fucking cares???? 

Like that’s really what’s so insulting about this, what is even the point of lying about this other than just to shield the finance bros from a bad jobs report?

All you people are doing is creating a situation where when the levee does finally break none of your own people will be ready and things will be even worse than they will already have to be, total abdication of responsibility at the most fundamental level, not even saying “fire!” when they see the smoke. Pathetic and what’s worse is it really only is liberals themselves that are falling for it, everybody else on the fucking planet knows things are going down and are closing the airlocks.

[Here is the relevant release](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/surveys-and-data/benchmark-revisions/early-benchmark-2022-q2-report.pdf). There are links to the methodology and interpretations within the second paragraph. 

Yes, the estimates were more than a million jobs over. 

Note the first graph. What they're *actually* estimating is the total number of jobs there are in each state (not the change or growth). They added those estimates together to get an estimate of the total number of jobs in the country... They got ~150 million jobs and were about a million off. 

Yes, this is a big miss, but it's not ten thousand percent wrong or whatever. It's less than 1%. 

The high churn rate (volume and speed at which people have been switching jobs, aka ""the great resignation"") is a big reason they ended up getting over-counted.

Each state-level estimate has uncertainty around it. Usually you expect some to be over and some to be under, and when you add them all together, you expect them to mostly cancel out.

And I am fully over the, ""Discovery is the only ship that can save the galaxy/universe and Michael Burnham is the Savior"" which I feel has been way too heavily pushed. It's one thing to have it as a core element I'm season 1 since it was central to an interstellar war she caused. That honestly I am okay with if done well.

I thought the character development of Saru as well as the relationship between Saru and Michael was really well done. It was great to see them progress from adversarial and combative to loving and brotherly/sisterly from seasons one to two.

I thought the introduction of the Enterprise, while obviously a cheap way to bring in nostalgic characters, ended up being a great addition that brought in some nice interactions with existing characters and further developed them, especially Number One (the first officer from the Enterprise before Spock assumed the role).

Whether or not you like the fact that they made Michael, Spock's sister (I don't like that, I think she should have been an independent, unrelated character), I do think everything they explored, with how it impacted Michael's lack of singular self-identity, the fact that she was always split between what she felt was logical versus what her more human elements drove her too, was also well done.

The animation has generally been very good and while others may disagree, I thought the design of the Crossfield-class was fabulous from the get go. To me, it really gives the dignified, understated power one would expect of a leading federation starship and the new things brought in the 31st century (programmable matter, variable geometry warp drive...) add some necessary technobabble that was lacking in earlier seasons. My only problem was that they unnecessarily upscaled the size of all starships in the 23rd century.

I thought season 2's premise involving the Red Angel, then Section 31 and Control was great. The execution I think did falter, especially in that I think it would have been better as a multi-season arc, but the idea of a rogue AI that could kill all life with the more knowledge it acquires and combining this with allusions to potential government conspiracy was a great starting point.",NCC-35S_Su-1031-A,t2_877pd2rk,4,0,reddit3

I didn't go into a list of what I find wrong with Discovery because this post is literally about Stacey Abrams and her political aspirations, not about the show.

Though these are a few problems that come to the top of my mind:

Over-focus on lead actress with lack of development for some of the other cast, especially bridge crew.
Every season is about one universe-ending catastrophe after another and not larger scale arcs.
Lack of deep political analysis (which DS9 was so good at) and more cookie-cutter good versus bad framing in some situations.
The fact that every starship is like 3X bigger and they openly said they are scaling up the universe and thus disregarding canon about the size of Starships which was well quite well established beforehand.

elu529a,t3_bhhx54,2019-04-26 15:14:34,stupidpol,"I saw a bio of Joe Biden's career yesterday and it seems that he is the perfect example of where Democrats went so wrong. 

On economic and justice issues, Biden has quietly sided with corporations, the police force and the prison system over and over again. 

However on minority issues, and cultural issues, he has tended to conspicuously support the liberal side of the argument.

This combination has characterised the Democratic Party for decades. The choice in parties has been between the moderate corporatists who are socially liberal and the rabid corporatists who are socially conservative. There has been no economically left-of-center option at all for a while now.

I think the way that the Democrats have tried to demonstrate their left-of-center credentials in the era of Obama and Hillary has been to double and triple down on idpol as a substitute for left-of-center economic policy. I don't think they left you as such - I think the fact that they had already left you became more obvious, if you see what I mean.

But it looks to me like this has actually changed recently. Bernie came out of nowhere in 2016 because people realised ""hey, why can't we have someone who is left-of-center on social/cultural AND economic issues?"" and Bernie said ""no reason!"".

So in 2018, the mid-terms were full of Democrats candidates who actually are economically left-of-center for a change. Things like decent minimum wages, workers rights, taxing the obscenely wealthy much more and healthcare-as-a-right regardless of income are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. Finally. 

This is why Biden must lose the Primary and lose fast. He is dragging back the agenda of the Democratic Party to just the kind of corporatist, idpol-laden mush that the donors love (because it avoids challenging their ridiculously coddled position) but is terrible for the people and terrible for democracy generally.

Bernie and his supporters/imitators are actually in the process of reestablishing a true economically left-of-center alternative. They are focused on solutions to the real issues that have so badly affected workers across the country for years and that have allowed the rich to gobble up an ever more unjust and disproportionate part of the countries wealth.",michaelrch,t2_1e70p28l,30,0,reddit4

I literally thought that if you work hard and were good at your job that it would be recognized and you would rise through the ranks. Little did I know that that is exactly the kind of footstool that some back stabber needs to stand on to get ahead.

 I’ve read enough history books and been around the sun enough times to understand implicitly how socialism is an engine for corruption because interfering in a market produces opportunities for exploitation. Heirarchies are inevitable, and any attempt to organize based on equality produces not only a worse hierarchy but also horrible atrocities. But I don’t come here to debate socialism, I feel like you got to give the people a little bit or else they’ll demand a lot. I’m not so worried about the genocides of the past because Technology is creating a wonderful decentralization of power.

 Check out the world poverty clock. Everyone of those little guys running away is someone who has been freed from grinding poverty by the decentralization of power. When you’re one of the global 1%  it’s important to remember that for 1 billion people in the last 50 and especially the last 10 years have been an amazing transformation, the greatest achievement of human history. 

 I know that’s a little consolation when you’re stuck in traffic and your dispatcher thinks that you have rockets on your truck. But most of the political issues that people freak out about these days are completely insignificant. Trump is just Obama without a social media manager. They are both pro Wall Street and pro war. But the dark forces have lost their monopolies on both information and currency. They don’t even realize that they’ve already lost the game. In 20 years we will all be sipping moon juice with president Jonathan Taylor Thomas on the hyper loop and wondering if we’re talking to a person or a nano swarm. It’s  Just a rough patch. Technology has advanced beyond our ability to adapt to it and it’s only going to get worse. You got to get off of that shit sometimes because it is literally bad for your mental health.

I am curious when exactly this trend started. So on the right I know for years the evangelical community was trying to find something to rally the republican voter base around (late 60s and 70s) such as gay marriage, women's place in society, etc just a bunch of social issues to distract from the general plan of the republican party and also to enforce segregation in private Christian schools (which evangelical leaders were making a ton of money off of after desegregation, although the person who wrote this research dismissed that fact as unimportant because they are an idpol hack; the research was good, the conclusion awful). Regardless, the thing that really stuck was abortion. Gay marriage and other issues caught some people for sure but not as widely as abortion after Roe V. Wade. That was a hit and a huge boon to the evangelical voter block that some very nasty actors were trying to develop. The point is though there was a very deliberate attempt on the right to frame politics around cultural and social issues while ignoring economic policy and reality. My question is, did this develop in tandem with the democratic party's reframing of liberal values along social and cultural lines, or was the left's emphasis on these issues a reaction to a shift happening in popular politics at the time? Because Social issues have proven a major motivator of voting block, so it wasn't necessarily a terrible strategy (depending on context) but it in reality it was when the left abandoned all substance to continue to get elected and sell out.",,,2,0,reddit4

eluqlef,t1_elubd0d,2019-04-26 18:39:55,stupidpol,"I think the changes probably started in 80s. That was when Reagan started to undermine norms about taxation and labor rights. 

The thing is that for the political class, even in the Democratic Party, it generally became very tempting to go along with these ""pro-business/pro-growth"" policies. The line was sold that helping business was helping everyone. This was the core idea behind trickle-down economics.

The seed of that idea is not insane, and it's also not new. It was just repackaged into a form where the corporatists managed to sell the warped idea that there was *no limit* to how much you should help business and the rich because they are ""the wealth creators"". Obviously this is a grotesque misrepresentation of the truth, but it gave the right the opportunity to argue that there was no need to balance the interests of business and labor. In this warped view, helping business was actually the best way to help labor - obviously a lie.

So in this period, the Overton window on economic policy shifted rightward. And this opened the door for a flurry of pro-business Democrats. And this was a winner electorally because they could eat the GOP's lunch on economics without being tied to some of the more regressive social attitudes on the right. Enter the corporate Democrats. 

Now with both parties shilling for business, the donor class won whoever was elected, and the Democrats became as addicted to corporate money as the GOP. So the status quo became entrenched - corporate Democrats avoided any policy that fundamentally challenged their donors and so they had to flee to social issues to create a divide between them and the GOP.

Then the GOP realised that two could play at that game. They doubled down on conservative Christian social ideology. This was fantastically successful because most people's brains are tuned to respond very strongly to fear and disgust, and those are the basis for most conservative social ideology. They are very potent emotions that you can constantly exploit with moralising faux-Christian outrage at every advance of liberal social norms coming from the left.

Then, in the 90s, the final hammer blow came from the right. Everyone was chasing the donor money and so the donors where becoming more and more audacious in their demands. The GOP, under Newt Gingrich, finally blew out the last vestiges of bipartisanship and deliberately made politics about selling power to donors explicitly. This made perfect sense because the Democrats has lost most of their connection with the Labor movement and so they were just as dependent on donors as the GOP. 

So Newt turned his back on any pretence of governing in the interest of voters and explicitly changed the strategy to auction off power to donors. They made the offer that the GOP would turn money directly into policy, to the point that they brought lobbyists into drafting legislation and rejected any form of collaboration with the Democrats. Instead they turned the whole political process into a bloodsport where defeating the opposition at any cost was the only objective, because in this new paradigm money was completely coupled to political power. The opportunities for getting rich(er), whether you were in government or a donor, became unlimited. As a politician, the personal financial stakes for winning went through the roof and this both attracted a certain type of corrupt (or at least compliant) politician and drove a form of politics driven primarily by money, on both sides.

So circling back, that is why the Democrats went more left on social issues, because they have gone so far right on economic ones. They had to keep a veneer of being left-of-center.

As for the right, well they have been screwing everyone outside the 1% so hard that they have to crank up the fear-and-disgust narrative to 11 to hide the fact that they are full-blown kleptocrats from the sector of their voters that *aren't* in the top 10%. That's what Fox News is for. And of course, the Democrats also use the backfire from that on their voters to again reinforce their opposition to the right-wing narrative... disgust at the disgust if you like. All highly exhausting. 

So these days, 90% of politics is just these distraction tactics on both sides, while the rich go up the middle and make a fortune, tax free.

This is why Bernie et al are on such fertile ground. Everyone is finally waking up and saying ""yeah, WFT?! How is some guy worth $150,000,000,000 and I can't even afford a fucking prescription for my medication?!"". Or ""How come these corporations paid nothing in taxes when they made $20,000,000,000 in profits last year and I can't afford my rent working 3 jobs!?"".

The answer to these questions is years of subtle Democratic cooperation in an increasingly corrupt system that stopped caring about the lives of people other than to the extent that they had to to attract enough voters to beat the other guy. In a two party system, if both parties give in to the money then there is no longer an escape hatch. You're locked into oligarchy until inequality and resentment become so fierce that a new class of politicians and voters start overcoming even the most powerful party apparatchiks. 

That's exactly what AOC did. Thats what Bernie is doing. That's why they scare the establishment so much and that's why there is hope now :)",michaelrch,t2_1e70p28l,8,0,reddit4

Evangelical pastors were motivated by money, money they were receiving by offering white families places to put their children in for school, evangelical schools, that were de facto segregated if not officially so.  Jimmy Carter did actually try to crack down on this in the late 1970s (it's why many major evangelical pastors switched from supporting abortion to condemning it, because this is the issue that stuck with the larger voter base, they tried using other issues such as homosexuality, it did not have as broad of an appeal). In regards to the church appealing towards the working class and creating a religious right, this definitely started before Reagan. From the central issue of abortion other causes were tacked on, but I do know for certain abortion was the first that was able to actually motivate people in modern times. The republicans definitely did capitalize on it to distract from a corporatist agenda, now taking what you said then I'd say it seems political divisions over things like abortion then were a gift to the Democratic party, who at the same time were inching closer and closer to the GOP in economic policy, as now the Democrats had something to distance themselves from the GOP.",,,1,0,reddit4

Sure there's a significant and very vocal segment of the college elite ""leftists"" and they have a pretty big media presence, but pretty much every leftist I know both online and irl has things like pronouns (or other general language policing) pretty damn low on the priority list. They might say a reminder if you misgender someone or whatever, but very few are investing their labor in such surface level issues (and I agree that those are problematic). 

The biggest obstacles to large scale striking are massive misinformation, terrible public education, the atomization of our social lives, internal business anti-union practices, the farce that is the democratic neoliberal party, militarized police, etc. Compared to these problems we face, are a relatively small group of spoiled rich kids spending all their time shaming other people to feel better about their own complicity in oppression really that huge of an obstacle??

The bad news for us however is that the proles are largely not here -- they're in China and India and Bangladesh and Nigeria and other places. I'm getting on this Maoist Third-Worldist shit. 

The other real problem is that capitalism never really recovered from 2007-2008. All that bad debt was never written off, it was bailed out and the cost was passed over to the public sector, hence austerity. That's why productive capital investment never resumed and the core economies inflated another bubble. Private sector debt (including consumer debt), asset prices such as housing, etc. have all returned back to where they were. That is going to blow the fuck up and it's going to be even worse because there aren't the available remedies this time and capitalism *must* clear all that bad debt out -- it'll be a total catastrophe and it's approaching. But the... uh... good news is that once that's over with and the working class recovers, things will start getting ripe for some real class conflict. It'll take the working class growing confident again. Right now it's not. But it'll be a long process.

The nationalist right has easy answers because they can blame immigrants, screw around with trade to cause a little inflation to ease up the working class debt burden by a pittance (winning votes here), while keeping the steady flow of corporate profits intact.

You’re right that a wealthy kid working for a think tank making $30k is probably not a proletarian in the Marxian sense, but it isn’t because s/he has any special relation to the means of production *through work*. S/he isn’t proletarian because the family unit itself has a different relationship to the means of production. This is evident.

You’re essentially arguing that the mode of work should define the proletariat, and that those with NGO/government jobs are, by definition, no longer working class and have wealthy families. This is absurd. An immiserated class has never made an actually successful transition of economic modes of production, and it won’t happen now.

Meanwhile, the going rate for AK-47 ammo is less than $0.30 USD, can be administered at any age, and actually breaks the cycle.

The prosecutor Biden railroaded was one of Poroshenko's guys, and Poroshenko was our guy, aka the guy western intelligence agencies helped install in 2014 after Yanukovych was removed in a coup for refusing the EU's membership ultimatum in favor of greater economic ties with Russia (he was advised against this by one of his top henchmen, Paul Manafort). 

So once the new regime was installed, they started ""investigating"" ""corruption,"" which is always a euphemism for fucking over political rivals and replacing their enemies' scams with their own scams. So in that spirit, they began going after their rivals, including Mykola Zlochevsky, founder of Burisma, who was energy minister under Yanukovych and generally viewed as an enemy by the administration in power.

So Burisma does what any smart business would do, and upon learning that Biden will be spearheading the administration's dealings in Ukraine, hires his dunce son for protection. the investigation continues, Biden gets agitated, lets Poroshenko's people know that the investigation into Burisma has to stop, that doesn't work, so he orchestrates a firing with the help of the Brits.

I don't find this persuasive. Trump and the GOP *already* claimed ""total exoneration,"" and pointed to the *lack* of an impeachment attempt as evidence that Dems, for all their noise, didn't actually believe Trump had done anything impeachable. Republicans gonna Republican, they will claim they won no matter what.

This argument is intuitively persuasive to low information swing/undecided voters. How can you believe a party truly believes a POTUS has committed serious crimes, when that party has the House and yet didn't attempt an impeachment? It comes off as noncommittal posturing and disingenuous whining.

People hate *fakeness*. The Democrats cowardice often makes them come off as fake. Actually following through on impeachment makes them seem less full of shit.

Strategically, a successful impeachment in the House followed by an acquittal in the Senate is probably a better outcome for the Dems than failure to pursue impeachment. They demonstrate some baseline level of conviction, and they get to rhetorically associate Trump and the GOP with criminality and cover-ups.

This worked for the GOP with Clinton. Clinton obviously was not convicted, but the associations between the Democratic Party and sleaziness, cover-ups, perjury, ""sexual relations with that woman"", blue dress, etc are all the top things that people associate with Bill Clinton even decades later. It became culturally iconic, and it washed out a lot of Clinton's more positive legacy... things like GDP increase and deficit reduction and all the other crap Republicans usually love. You can safely assume this has paid of in spades over the decades down-ballot for the GOP, never mind the battle of the day.

Sanders and Warren are the only candidates talking about policy. Perhaps Yang to a lesser extent. If one of them doesn't make it to the general, there's no chance of an issues-oriented election.

If it ends up as Biden, it was always going to come down to a simple Trump/culture war referendum, which is not all that different than the impeachment.

When the whistleblower leaked the story to the media the media greedily reported on it immediately bc ""orange man bad"" but they didn't realize that Biden did the same shit and we have it on video!  

So now that Trump was accused of this thing that Biden literally bragged about doing the Democrats and the Media needed a HUGE distraction to avoid talking about Biden and destroying his campaign.  If Biden gets taken out this early then Sanders will become unstoppable and cruise to the nomination easily.  

Therefore they needed a BIG story and impeachment is it.  Now they can non-stop cover Trump + the Impeachment and go full dark on Joe Biden/Hunter Biden except of course to briefly scoff at Trumps accusations against Biden for being wrong and stupid before returning to demonizing Trump as the cause of all that is wrong with America.

We have no reason to believe that there’s a meaningful audience out there who *require* impeachment in order to be engaged, and who will go elsewhere (I mean, to whom, the GOP?) if they don’t get it. This is just red meat for the Mueller crowd, who were always going to cast their anti-Trump votes in 2020 anyway.

All this adds up to is more media hysteria around Trump, just when the old hysteria (Russiagate) was finally dying down. It’s meant billions upon billions of dollars in free exposure for Trump. Oh, and people hate the media more than they ever have, and think the Dems are wildly ineffectual.

I can’t paint a better picture of how manufactured the “clamoring” for impeachment is than an MSNBC broadcast I happened to see the other day. They gave two examples of the supposed rapid shift in polling on the issue. Real polls from reputable agencies and collaborations were showing support in the high 30s like a week ago, or whatever. And new polls now show it nearing 50. The rub? One of the latter polls was an “online poll from Politico,” and the other was a “one-day poll” conveniently with no info given about its origin. I’m sitting there watching this shit and thinking, “Yep, this is how BS gets manufactured on TV.” They really are just trying to shove a “Oh, people were lukewarm until THE TRANSCRIPT dropped, and now it’s a fresh wave of genuine concern” narrative down our throats.

Listen, if the Dems are doing this because, behind closed doors, they have arranged enough GOP support to pull off a conviction, then great. That’s boffo strategizing, and they will deserve massive credit for that. It’s always been my position that impeachment is a fantastic idea if it can actually lead to Trump’s direct removal after a conviction. But if this is just for show, it adds up to far greater benefit for him than it does for them, and so on a strategic basis, it’s just not worth it.

f1p63t2,t1_f1oy9zi,2019-09-28 12:19:45,stupidpol,"I think this analysis leans too heavily on binary partisan sides that people might take. Obviously there are a lot of firmly partisan voters, but there are even more voters that are not firmly partisan, or who skew independent. And a large share of the population is low-engagement, mostly uninterested and sporadic voters.

Impeachments command national attention, and will engage some of the non-typically-engaged.

Independents, of course, tend to fall into two very different groups:

* People with strong opinions not represented by the mainstream parties.
* People without strong opinions, and lacking any particular party loyalty.

I would guess that this particular subreddit is a pretty good example of that first group. Members here skew leftist, and are more likely to vote Democrat, without actually ""siding"" with Democrats. They may or may not care about impeachment, but if they do it's not because the Democrats are the ones proposing it.

Obviously there are similar situations for right-wing groups, libertarian groups, etc. They may tend to vote GOP, but that doesn't mean they will go with the party-line objections to impeachment. They could potentially vote third party, abstain, or even flip if the GOP's defenses are too strained.

The authenticity/""how full of shit are they"" quality can work wonders with the huge bloc of independent voters, sporadic voters, low info voters, and genuinely swing voters.

In short, I think it's impossible for Democrats to not seem full of shit if they don't follow through with impeachment. Years of investigations and talk of tyranny without at least a failed attempt at impeachment is the worst possible look.

Low info voters look at this and interpret it as lies and ""witch hunts,"" or ""fishing expeditions."" There's a reason why Trump and GOP talking heads repeat these terms so much. It's non sequitur to rave about tyranny and crimes without impeaching. Low info voters better understand that the Senate has a GOP majority than they understand the details about any particular scandal.

&#x200B;

>We have no reason to believe that there’s a meaningful audience out there who *require* impeachment in order to be engaged

Obviously anecdotal, but I know a lot of people that fall into this group. I'm not among them.

Of the people I know, there is a varied political mix.

* Hillary-voting liberals outraged that Trump got away with stealing the 2016 election, seeing parallels with this scandal cast on the 2020 election. Failure to impeach constitutes re-living 2016 all over again, and shows the party refusing to use the tools it has to try and get accountability to avenge 2016 and prevent it from happening again.
* Varied socialist-leaning DSA folks and radlibs that demand impeachment, more over ICE camps/child separation policies.
* Miscellaneous disenchanted leftists that rarely but sometimes vote, but consider voting if Dems impeach Trump, since ""they actually did something beyond sternly worded letters.""
* Socdems and demsocs that believe that votes are earned rather than owed, and view an impeachment attempt as one of several steps required to demonstrate that Democrats aren't entirely useless and deserve a vote.

I share some opinions with that last group. I certainly believe votes are earned, not owed. I wouldn't consider impeachment a hard requirement for my vote, but a failure to impeach really would piss me off. I don't expect a conviction in the Senate, but I expect an earnest attempt.

There's nothing wrong with doing something that's doomed to fail. Sometimes you have do something because it's right. Or even just doing something as raw meat for your base (think the 60-some attempts by the GOP to repeal the ACA. Hopeless, but their base loved it).

I don't know why *this* is the scandal Dems have chosen to go all-in on, while so many others were not. But I don't care. It'll do.",dreamedifice,t2_a7yk01,4,0,reddit1

We may even agree that it was he who seduced the adult; but we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, in every case, of being damaged and traumatized by the fact that he or she has had sexual dealings with an adult. Consequently, the child must be 'protected from his own desires', even when his desires turn him towards an adult. The psychiatrist is the one who will be able to say: I can predict that a trauma of this importance will occured as a result of this or that type of sexual relation. It is therefore within the new legislative framework - basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power - that a conception of sexuality and above all of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based; and it is one that is extremely questionable

Social democracy has pretty much nothing to do with socialism in this day and age. I'm very worried if you're not aware of that as a European. 

The social democrats did win the latest election in Finland, but before that our last six Prime Ministers were from centre or centre-right parties - that doesn't mean we weren't a social democracy at those times. You need to understand that right and left, in the context of a political spectrum, aren't fixed concepts. Our centre-right would be moderate left in the US, for example. I can't claim knowledge of Belgian politics but based on all relevant economic metrics I looked at, the situation seems to be broadly similar there. The fact that you, like most West European countries, also have a multi-party system (unlike the US) also plays into that. 

As for wealth distribution, Belgium actually seems to have a gini coefficient very similar to that of Scandinavian (or Nordic, which is the proper term for the countries you probably meant) countries. 

If you look at one of the main talking points in US politics, Medicare for all i.e. universal healthcare, Belgian system seems to resemble the Nordic system more than the American one. As do most Western systems. Neoliberals are by and large very much against universal healthcare. The difference there is decidedly NOT a ""Scandinavian anomaly"". 


>The other countries can be counted on one hand, but why talk about Cuba when we're discussing modern influential countries

I think the issue here might be that you're not perfectly aware of what neoliberalism means, especially in American context. Regardless of a few arguments to the contrary, China (unless you don't consider them influential?) isn't neoliberal either. Just as an example, there are many others, too.

I did. 

>I said ""Scandinavian countries are an anomaly in the world."", meaning that in those countries the people and the government are more supportive of a strong social support net in those countries (Sweden, Denmark, ...), compared to other Western nations.

>You then sent graphs showing the disparity in wealth concentration over the years and the cucking of the working class in America compared to Europe.

>My new answer to your reply (with the graphs) would be: how's your comment relevant against mine?

First of all, your reply (""Scandinavia is an anomaly"") is hard to be understood in any other way than ""neoliberalism is the dominant force and ideology in the rest of it (or that the rest of the world is at the very least closer to the US than the Nordics)"", especially given the post I originally replied to. That's not true.

The claim that ""in those countries the people and the government are more supportive of a strong social support net in those countries (Sweden, Denmark, ...), compared to other Western nations"", might strike true, but, like I said above, West European countries are definitely closer to Nordics than the US in their social and economic policies for the most part.

You are correct in asking how the graphs were relevant, they weren't very.

The first one was meant to point out that the wealth disparity in _Western_ Europe is nowhere near America, and that disparity is often argued to be a result of neoliberalism. Rest of the graphs were just highlighting the problem in America and not really meant to refer to the overall discussion. 

But if it makes it simpler, we can just pretend that my answer to ""Scandinavia is an anomaly"" was simply ""not true"", as it isn't.",Triplapukki,t2_4lf0p6ln,1,0,reddit1

Of course. Perhaps anomaly is a strong word but I believe many more people support a strong social net in Scandinavia than those in France, Germany and Benelux.

Oh no, I didn't mean that, I may have chosen my words poorly. Social security safety nets are as extensive here as in Scandinavia. 

I meant that the fact a _social democratic party_ (i.e. one that's outright called social democrats or something like that) isn't a leading one at a certain point in time doesn't mean that we stop being a _social democrat country_ in practice. Even the (economic) ""right wingers"" here are in support of social security, probably moreso than the average U.S Democrat.

As for the rest of your post: okay, you may have meant something milder than anomaly. But in that case I don't really see your point. Yes, Nordics are _more_ ""socialist"" than Belgium for example, but Belgium is still further away from neoliberal US politics than average Finnish politics.

One could even say that the prominence of the protests is a strong argument for neoliberalism _not_ being the ""dominant ideology"" in France. 

You see the exact same ""eat the rich"" rhetoric even in our Nordic ""socialist"" states, that doesn't make us neoliberal. The French government's response also has nothing to do with neoliberalism. You can call it anti-democratic or even quasi-fascist (if you want to be provocative). But neoliberal? That makes literally no sense at all.

Today the vast majority is batteries, and the EV market is still a small fraction of the global car industry.

Comparing adjusted ebitda from one entity to another (vs standard) is nonsensical because there is no way to compare what the two orgs would put below the line for the add-in, making comparison dubious. Adjustments in EBITDA are typically applied with notation to indicate what was below the line during an M&A process. You'll see normalized listed on financial statements, but its usually a way to puff up a number by dumping exec salary from the calc. In a conversation like this there is no way you'd want to deviate from standard EBITDA/EBIT.

Additionally why would you put a slash between net debt (cashflow/balance) and EBITDA (p&l) like they're in sync or intrinsically relative? You can have massive net debt and a fantastic looking EBITDA, or have functionally zero debt while posting negative profitability. 

A COGS of 45% vs 19% just means the latter is sinking expenditures into sg&a which would almost certainly translate to c-suite/exec payments. Which would indicate that Codelco is actually far more efficient because...

They have the better EBITDA! Making your entire word dump all the more nonsensical. Clearly you're a bit ignorant when it comes to finance, but I assure you that 7.4b is > 6.8b.

It allows for the mining of minerals such as lithium and copper via brine extraction + evaporation rather than ore. Chile and it’s neighbors have the world’s largest lithium reserves, and climate change action will drive a 10x or more increase in lithium demand in the coming decades. If climate policy succeeds, then overall global mining will decrease, but a subset of countries, including developing countries that didn’t cause the climate crisis, will face disproportionate environmental impacts from mining the minerals we *do* need.

Chile’s rapid economic development occurred under controversial reforms under the Pinochet dictatorship and the Chicago Boys, which included the privatization of water (including brine) rights. While these reforms helped the nation grow, the vast majority of profits from “extractivism” (look it up, it’s interesting) were reaped by multinationals. Meanwhile, the industry has led to environmental destruction and has caused the wealth gap to grow. As of now, 2 companies have exclusive extraction rights in a country that supplies about 30% of global lithium, and much of the value of that extraction leaves the country. While Chile isn’t cancelling these contracts (as with Mexico when they flirted with multinational energy companies and then reneged), Chile will be able to assure stronger labor and environmental protections and accountability, which is a must given that their lithium industry will essentially help to bail out industrialized nations that caused the climate crisis.

I don’t personally think that nationalizing the industry is the best move (compared to a nuanced public-private partnership - I can explain my stance if you want), but it’s better than the status quo and reflective of the will of Chileans.",NAcademicThrowaway,t2_8vj5qx7l,30,0,reddit2

jh7mv1m,t1_jh6w2pr,2023-04-22 00:05:33,stupidpol,"Good question, and I don’t have a perfect answer (especially since I think tax/regulation has advantages). I have a few thoughts. 

Accountability: Chile has proven incapable of enforcing its regulations. It has been long suspected that SQM and Albemarle (the 2 companies) have been fabricating environmental reports.

Terms: The global mining industry is extremely squeamish when it comes to heavy regulation. Being “uninvestable” is surprisingly easy. It’s already a strike against Chile that their workers earn 30x the average Congolese.

Technology: Chile may be on the verge of developing its own Direct Lithium Extraction technology (or at least by 2030, SQMs contract end), which would significantly reduce land use needs and environmental impacts. They may also be cooperating with US researchers to this end, as the US government (at the moment) is trying to compete with China over critical material supply chains.

Downstream supply chains: almost all mined lithium gets processed and transformed in China. This is a pain point, as it limits the value that a nation receives from its resources. Any nation would prefer to have its own manufacturing capability or to at least have other options. If they have figured out a strategy for making this happen, then they can ensure that more value is extracted within its borders or by allies with a compelling trade agreement (like the US potentially, under Biden’s critical mineral stance)

Gradually dismantling neoliberal reforms: workers are profoundly unhappy with extractivism.

Because they can: Neighboring Bolivia tried for 10 years (2007-2017) to push for strict resource nationalism. That is, they wanted to do the majority of work to develop mining and processing capacity within the nation. Ultimately, they lacked the wealth and expertise to do so and had to loosen their terms (I can expand on this if you want). Even under these terms, the only corporations that could provide a competitive contract were in China (at the likely expense of environmental accountability). Chile has the wealth, trained workforce, and thriving engineering/academic community to make huge things happen despite not having the same extent of populist/anti-neoliberal sentiment as Bolivia).",NAcademicThrowaway,t2_8vj5qx7l,8,0,reddit2

Eisenhower just ordered the CIA to go in and overthrow the government, an operation which became a historic and well-known catastrophe that culminated in the [CIA murdering hundreds of civilians in indiscriminate terror bombings.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Indonesia#:~:text=Finally%2C%20in%20a%20desperate%20last,anger%20among%20the%20Indonesian%20populace) Less than a decade later, they went in again and [backed and installed a right-wing dictator who slaughtered almost a million people and ruled from '65 to '98](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/the-indonesia-documents-and-the-us-agenda/543534/) with US support....***and all this because a democratically-elected socialist government was trying to nationalize its assets, and the yanks were terrified that if indonesia did it, japan would likely do it too***...I guess the point is, why invade when you can send your spies in to fuck the country up and put whoever you want in power?

ahahah dude literally the Mexican-American war you absolute ritardando, they also invaded twice in small incursions in 1914 and 1916

&#x200B;

Again, they prefer not to invade and instead just fund coups and sponsor right-wing nutjobs to overthrow the democratically elected governments of sovereign nations like Bolivia, [which they literally just did a few years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/silence-us-backed-coup-evo-morales-bolivia-american-states)

The briefly-ascendant right wing in Bolivia even got nervous that Luis Arce was going to follow in morales' footsteps, take over the party lead, and win again anyways, [so they plotted a second contingency coup immediately on the heels of the first](https://theintercept.com/2021/06/17/bolivia-coup-plot-mercenaries/), planning to deploy hundreds of american mercenaries, but Arce went ahead and won by such a convincing margin that the US security state basically told them they weren't interested and wouldn't support them this time, and so it all fell apart.

With energy storage, a grid can accommodate a far greater share of wind/solar.

Many countries don’t think like the US on climate and environmental issues. In our kindergarten-ass country, we rarely discuss anything other than carbon (despite building the template for every other nation’s environmental policy half a century ago). In nations such as Chile, the fact that slicing up a river hotdog style can be bad for the environment is more widely acknowledged.
Of course it’s a wicked problem when the alternative is coal and the nation also believes in climate change at a greater rate than the US.

It is, not in the sense that this community doesn't have value to Leftist egalitarians (and I do think Leftists should be egalitarian and inclusive), but in the sense that, *right now*, people are ""literally dying"" (materialists actually get to use this phrase) from lack of access to healthcare, unlivable wages, and unaffordable basic necessities such as, you know, **roofs.**

While those kinds of issues are on deck, talking about issues like trans bathrooms is a total waste of **finite political energy** that could be used to work toward class consciousness across the lines of race, gender, and age to enact policies that would **disproportionately benefit minorities anyway**. 

This is so very obviously by design, and it is, in fact, still the oldest trick in the capitalist playbook: divide and conquer by every line they can conjure *except for class.*

Unfortunately, the protest was taking place right in front of the building that I needed to access, so I had to walk all the way alongside it to get to the door. When I got up front, I could hear the speaker. He was angry not about gender but about a recent police killing. The largest signs, up front, contained the names of people who had been shot by cops. This wasn't a gender protest. It was an anti-police violence protest. 

Why, then, were most of the signs about trans stuff? Seriously, no exaggeration, 80-90% of the signs were about gender.

This issue isn’t so black and white (seriously no pun intended) because it takes a lot of nuance. As a psychology major, people with dysphoria truly are trans men or women. The problem is there are a lot of attempts trying to do away with that as a criteria, and now we are saying anyone who wants to define themselves as man, women, or intersex, is allowed to. Which to me is ludicrous and is a symptom of the toxic individualism pushed by neoliberalism and capitalism. 

This doesn’t even take into account real life issues that get suppressed and are said they don’t matter or “aren’t happening” that have to deal with trans women in women’s sports, and other issues like puberty blockers. The stats are true that transitioning reduces suicide, but these stats don’t take into the amount of people that detransition (which is lower end but some think is underreported). With the increasing amount of people considered trans that don’t experience dysphoria the risk of people getting surgery or committing long term harm to themselves by puberty blockers is getting higher by the day. I saw some psychologists say that because they are afraid of being labeled transphobic they will recommend these people to others who might be less critical. That really happens but you won’t hear about it because it’s a hush hush topic. Is the benefit of a lot of people worth it if even one person fucks themsleves up long term because they are a confused kid? I say no, just like how I oppose the death penalty. Some may disagree but that’s my stance and it’s ridiculous to get label as a bigot for feeling that way. 

Even countries super left like Sweden are now a good amount against things like puberty blockers but you don’t hear about that. The issue with liberals is they suppress and railroad every discussion of the issue even if it is in good faith. I do NOT hate or even dislike transgender people, but I think going full steam ahead supporting something that could very well be as a result of social influences and especially the internet is a horrible idea. Every liberal will like to screech about authoritarianism and fascism until it benefits a topic they support. Take a look at the Canadian trucker protest for example, liberals wanted the MILITARY to be involved to stop it.

Why though? Our opposition to religion is clerical in nature. The ""right""ness of the religion does not negate the class aspects of religion, namely that priests are a class that must be struggled against by the proletariot.

It is for this reason that in effect puritans were revolutionary for their time regardless of what present day redditors think about them. Our atheism is so strong that we mustn't even be distracted by displays of religion when doing class analysis, as religion is so false that it doesn't even matter, class does. This does not mean that puritan beliefs are good. For every revolution I am fully capable of telling you why the ""reactionaries"" (in this case Catholics) were completely correct to resist the revolution (in this case reformation) but that is irrelevant because each revolution is additive towards the others and they all flow out from one another.  Each revolution also represents an opportunity for non-primary participants to advance their class struggle that merely support the prior order due to favouring the devil you know vs the worse devil cannot.

The Church of England or Episcopalians or Anglicans or other ""reddit approved churches"" ""seeming""  more secular or accepting of progressive causes than an evangelical Christian should not dissuade you from recognizing that Episcopalian literally means adherent to church hierarchy. One is literally a follower of an Episcopal as an Episcopalian. This notion of divide religions by how ""liberal"" or how ""conservative"" they are is a casualty of the deterioration of education in the true-est sense of the word as it is reliant on arresting thinking as opposed to actually learning what things mean.

We as class strugglers struggle against church hierarchy before we struggle against people believing obvious nonsense. Informing people that nonsense is nonsense can be a useful way of achieving our primary goal of struggling against church hierarchy however. An atheist is not likely to be an adherent to the dictates of their local episcopal, but it isn't strictly necessary to make someone an atheist to achieve that. It is obviously preferable to make people atheists so they don't just wander into another church across the street but until the material conditions that make people seek out religion to either fulfill themselves or to provide hope to their dreary conditions change people will continue to be religious.

Why struggle against church hierarchy? Are we just anarchists who can't bear the sight of any person being above another even if they both agreed to this arrangement? Perhaps, but how we view hierarchy is irrelevant as it is what hierarchy does which primarily concerns us. The church hierarchy is infested with people who can be regarded as ""clergy"" and this clergy represents a distinct class of people with different class interests than workers. What is more is that unlike other classes such as the petit-bourgeoisie who are disorganized yet numerous, the clergy is mostly organized and have built in mechanisms to exert influence, both within themselves to direct each other and to their congregations.

The Christian clergy was so organized that they managed to pull off what was basically a clerical revolution and usurp control over the roman empire. Then the primary class struggle for the middle ages can be described as the clergy vs the aristocracy, with the protestant reformation being a case of the aristocracy strengthening the largely protestant bourgeoise to seize power and wealth with the reformation, this trick worked so well that absolute rulers, catholic or otherwise, used the bourgeoisie to struggle against their own aristocracies, until the bourgeoisie gained enough power that they didn't need the absolute rulers anymore and overthrew them.

Just as how the aristocracy largely created the bourgeoisie as a source of wealth to struggle against the church and stake out an independent rule and power base for themselves that was not reliant on being viewed as pious and favored by god by the churches to the congregations, the bourgeoisie generates a proletariot who will eventually overthrow them due to needing them to work whatever equipment they happen to buy with the coins they collected. That they collected coins is why the aristocracy needed them because those coins could be taxed. The clerical church boosted the aristocracy with divine blessing because they needed someone who would defend them from raiders. The roman empire in class analysis is basically a highly organized group of raiders.

>What exactly makes trans/LGBT activism ""left wing""?

First off, I think that the left-right distinction is implicitly bourgeois, because it came into being with and only ever existed under bourgeois parliamentary politics.

So anyone who identifies more as left than part of the working class (if they even are part of it) is pretty much doomed from the get-go, because leftism in any capitalist country is defined by the left-wing of capital (left-capitalist parties, left-liberal media, etc.) that actually benefits from idpol, i.e. allowing different identities into power but leaving the system in place.

If communism is not a movement of the working class, it is not communism. Class is more important than any concrete ideals, that's why Marx wrote for example:

>The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism. \[...\] The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property.

Or:

>Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things.

In the West, Marxism exists pretty much only as a movement of academics. This development was actually funded by intelligence agencies. Academic Marxism is impotent, because it cancels the proletariat for being too racist, sexist, transphobic, ... It's bourgeois socialism:

>The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best \[...\]  
>  
>Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech. \[...\] It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois — for the benefit of the working class. The Marxist academic is a Marxist academic — for the benefit of the working class.

The unconstrained vision

Sowell argues that the unconstrained vision relies heavily on the belief that human nature is essentially good. Those with an unconstrained vision distrust decentralized processes and are impatient with large institutions and systemic processes that constrain human action. They believe there is an ideal solution to every problem, and that compromise is never acceptable. Collateral damage is merely the price of moving forward on the road to perfection. Sowell often refers to them as ""the self anointed."" Ultimately they believe that man is morally perfectible. Because of this, they believe that there exist some people who are further along the path of moral development, have overcome self-interest and are immune to the influence of power and therefore can act as surrogate decision-makers for the rest of society.

The constrained vision

Sowell argues that the constrained vision relies heavily on the belief that human nature is essentially unchanging and that man is naturally inherently self-interested, regardless of the best intentions. Those with a constrained vision prefer the systematic processes of the rule of law and experience of tradition. Compromise is essential because there are no ideal solutions, only trade-offs. Those with a constrained vision favor empirical evidence and time-tested structures and processes over intervention and personal experience.

Remember that post 1970s American politics stopped being about economics and became about culture. There’s a lot to be said about the role of academia here as there was a shift to get rid of class first leftist ideas and replace them with a more cultural analysis (ideology, power, etc). Thus the left stopped talking class and started talking culture and identity. Eventually reaching a point where the thought leaders of the American left may give a passing wave to class if anything at all, but do not base their critique of society in class. This reached its zenith with the sexual revolution of the 70s. To boil it down there was the idea that economic/class politics had failed, and it was because of culture and ideology. Thus the solution was to rebel in those areas with the idea it would reverberate across all aspects of society eventually even economics and politics. Those who opposed this movement were seen as preserving the status quo. 

Well that didn’t really work out haha. It was just co-opted by Capital and became a way to feign social progress while leaving the economic base of society unaltered.

To quote the Wikipedia article on the book:

Hoffer states that mass movements begin with a widespread ""desire for change"" from discontented people who place their locus of control outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are ""irredeemably spoiled"" and believing there is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual, true believers seek ""self-renunciation"". Thus, such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives in a larger collective.

A variety of what Hoffer terms ""misfits"" are also found in mass movements. Examples include ""chronically bored"", the physically disabled or perpetually ill, the talentless, and criminals or ""sinners"". In all cases, Hoffer argues, these people feel as if their individual lives are meaningless and worthless.

I think this is what I did when I attempted to place ""religious morality"" in a kind of sequence of events that leads up to what we want if you take the extremely long view and that the thing we really oppose is the hierarchies that were created in that process. Therefore opposition to societal morality is not in of itself left-wing in any capacity, particularly because the churches with the most rigid hierarchies are often the quickest to adopt ""current thing"" morality. A pastor accepting of things which were not traditionally accepted within the church is not a good thing because the problem with the pastor is that the pastor exists at all.

If anything early criticism of pastors over them being oppressive towards certain identities was at best strategic attempts to expose those pastors as being bad when merely identifying them as pastors in the first place was not sufficient to discrediting them, however if the church hierarchies accept and integrate that criticism into themselves there is literally no point in continuing to support those identities because opposition to the church was the only point in supporting those identities in the first place. ""Marginalized"" identities were once useful in class struggle against certain classes but they no longer are because they are no longer being ""marginalized"" by those classes. Instead it becomes a weapon by those classes to yield against other classes, for instance a priests calling their congregation (or more likely other congregations if his followers thrive on self-righteousness by comparing themselves with the bad people over there in the other churches) ""transphobic"" to convince them that people require his wisdom to ""heal from that hate"".",jklol1337,t2_95uifp9ow,8,0,reddit3

This is why we are not merely reactionary to everything the bourgeoisie is doing, occasionally just letting some things quietly go on is not the end of the world. When we do ""react"" to things others do it should always be for the purposes of pushing through our own agenda ""opportunistically"".

""Opportunism"" being another unfortunate casualty of language which seems to imply the opposite of what you would think it would, since its most famous usage seems to have been to apply it to the social democrats who supported WW1. Arguably the problem with them is they weren't being opportunistic enough in using the outbreak of the war to create a class based refusal to support the war. Ironically due to the way words got used the failure of this to happem was blamed on ""opportunists"" as that word refered to the socialists who had engrained themselves into the state apparatuses of their respective governments, in sense using socialism as an opportunity for their own advancement in cooperation with the exsiting order instead of using non-cooperation with the order as an opportunity. Opportunists are particular people rather than Opportunism being a strategy. It is a strategy for those people but only those people, they might manage to crank out concessions like welfare or healthcare but they do this within the context of bourgeois politics in the same way anyone else tries to get things for their voters in order to try to get re-elected. It doesn't challenge the system so the bouregoisie will sometimes allow it to happen in the same way we might allow the bouregoisie to do certain things without opposing it. Therefore it is primarily for their own electability that they do things.

In my experience it's mostly the extreme right screaming about bathrooms, and it's a distraction from more basic material issues, but belligerent right-wing assaults on people are also real attacks on people at the same time, it has a dual character, so those who say it's ""just a distraction"" without fighting to stop the attacks on people and stick up for their dignity and humanity often end up failing at navigating practical politics. At the end of the day, these are also attacks on all working people -- people within the working class often fail to understand this -- because it splits them from people who should be their natural allies. The effectiveness of these attacks entirely depend on hesitancy within the working class.

It's a bit like anti-Semitism. That was a way to distract people and have them engage in some monster hunt that said the Jews were messing up society, and to solve the problem meant you had to go slay the dragons hiding in the mountains. But it was a real attack on Jews, they really were going to send them to camps. It wasn't just a distraction. So when people here say ""this is just a distraction, this has nothing to do with us, being against the discrimination of LGBT people doesn't have anything to do with socialism, we're only concerned about fair wages,"" they sound like opportunistic social democrats who were caught flat-footed by the ferocity of reaction in their day.

>The closest we have had recently is some labor organizing.

This is positive. In the U.S., there are some people who want a working-class politics but are dissatisfied with the outcomes of New Left social movements that emerged in the late 60s, and some of that is due to subjective reasons, but wrapped within that is an accurate critique that the left became disconnected from the working class, and more specifically the labor movement. But what's important to keep in mind here is that communists were purged from the labor unions in the 50s, which is why that happened.

One outcome of this that we got some rather toothless labor unions -- as opposed to militant labor unions -- in the U.S. that were not capable of resisting the right-wing assault on them in the 80s. There wasn't radical potential to be found in them, so people interested in keeping a radical tradition alive at all became involved in these new social movements. So the logical course of action in my mind is to rebuild a fighting labor movement while resisting right-wing assaults on people, which includes LGBT people but includes other people as well.",DukeSnookums,t2_vmystyyf,-1,0,reddit3

At this time before Christianity there are seemingly two classes, those who raid and enslave and those who get enslaved and are raided. If you will allow it Nietzschean philosophy identifies Christianity as a kind of slave morality revolt against the raiding master morality of the roman empire, however this slave revolt did not liberate itself from slavery as in Nietzche terms slave morality cannot liberate slaves from slavery, it can only drag everyone else down to being slaves. It did however create a clerical class who needed protection so it re-generated  an aristocracy, which are basically raiders but who must be granted favour by the slave morality of the society. In Nietzsche's view the clerical dominance in the late and post roman empire can be describe as a place where everyone is a slave and no one was the master, including the clergy themselves. This left the society vulnerable to raiding and thus to protect this clerical ""slave"" revolution, the church recreated an aristocracy to defend itself and its wealth from those who still held the master morality of the periphery of those who still raided and took what they wanted.

Nietzsche was attempting to ""out reactionary"" all the other reactionaries because he didn't want to be no poser but that makes him useful. The distinction between Serfdom and Slavery is slight so it is probably the hardest to understand how one goes from the other so adding alternative philosophers makes it easier to explain how they are different and in what ways. The main difference is that a purely slave-master society will not begin the inevitable path forward, and so the only true reactionary position one can take in Nietzsche's mind would be to restore the master morality free from christian slave morality influence, and so the solution is to empower the aristocracy without the church (in effect the second estate is blaming the first estate for letting the third estate take over, but the second estate was second for a reason as it was already several stages deep into the revolutionary cycle at this point and the second estate needed the blessing of the first estate to be accepted by the third). Nietzsche in announcing that ""god is dead and we killed him"" was announcing that this presented a golden opportunity to kill the ""inevitable march of progress"" that everyone else believed in as he regarded everyone as a revolutionary except himself as the second estate no longer needed the first estate and those with aristocratic pretensions should attempt to rule without them.

His screeching against Christianity was basically him saying that they were unnecessary for society to function as society had functioned before Christianity so the future belonged to those who would take it and that aristocrats (or those think of themselves as such as I don't think he particularly cared if any particular person was an aristocrat or not, rather what was important was that one act like an aristocrat. This is why you get weirdass philosophies that make no sense from similar people. Rightoids will sometimes try to read these people under the assumption that they too were rightoids but they aren't what they are looking for because those rightoids aren't actually trying to reestablish a society with the moral virtues of a raiding society. Rather they are usually just people who take one issue with the current crop of ""progressives"" and they end up being lost as the only philosophers available to them with advice on how to resist that ONE THING are a bunch of raving lunatics who think everything was inevitably leading up to this point where that ONE THING was inevitably going to the thing that had to happen) should stop being slaves to a religion that no longer had any power anyway. 

His screeching against Nationalism is because Nationalism was itself a revolutionary left-wing ideology that didn't like aristocracies because they often did things which ran contrary to what can be regarded as ""the national interest"" as aristocrats are often ""disloyal"" to that which can be considered the nation. While a bit nebulous what exactly this dispute was, it is safe to say that in Nietzsche's era nationalism was actually more of a threat to aristocracy than socialism. To him what was important was that there be a bunch of people somewhere running things who saw themselves as slaves to no one and no thing, as that was the only true aristocracy and therefore the only true system that can be said to be run by the best or *aristos*. Anyway elections are also a form of aristocracy as they are basically just a way of choosing who we think are the ""best"" people to rule.

Most ideologies are just different forms of aristocracy fighting over which is the ""true"" aristocracy and all the issue with the aristocracies of the past was because it was ""not real aristocracy"". Nietzsche was claiming to be a proponent of the only ""real aristocracy"" as a real aristocracy was the only aristocracy which would prevent all the other stuff I talked about in the first section from happening in the first place. In contrast we are on the opposite end of that equation and class struggle is most important and that means removing all those ""not real aristocracies"" that people would be sure would work if only they were the correct aristocracy.

My overall point is that  religion in unimportant but I also don't see any reason as to why religion itself needs to be opposed merely because something seems ""more"" religious, as if the level of religiosity involved is the level to which something can be considered ""right-wing"", if you will excuse me flipping out over a commonly used phrasing like ""evangelical right"".",jklol1337,t2_95uifp9ow,6,0,reddit3

If a girl likes short hair, prefers blue over pink and favors fishing and model trains over shopping for dresses, she's obviously a boy in a girl's body and needs to be medicated. 

This is precisely why the gender activists aren't left wing. They are dragging us back to traditional gender roles under the guise of wokeness.",snailman89,t2_82pq8lfi,12,0,reddit3

In the 'radical liberal' version this involves an attribution of existing inequalities between various groups (ethnicities, genders etc.) to enduring oppressive structures, which should be countered with anything from 'awareness raising' to 'affirmative action' to 'resistance' etc.  

In the variants closest to socialism (some would even call it 'liberal socialism') 'equality of opportunity' is seen as requiring a substantial reduction in inequality of income, an extensive welfare state etc. so that parental wealth has a limited effect on a child's earnings, except as mediated by inherited talent.

This is different from 'true socialism' where claims to resources are established on the basis of needs and a motive of ending class based exploitation.

Conversely in the most conservative or neoliberal versions, 'high merit' is just whatever is actually rewarded by the market, perhaps excepting some sorts of illegal behaviour, so it is a sort of tautological justification for almost all extant inequality.",fluffykitten55,t2_1vcp87hd,12,0,reddit3

It was an entire national discussion both sides were obsessed with, so that's just wrong, and furthermore, this was just a provided example. The trans discussion takes place on both sides, covers a range of petty issues, is totally ravenous and, yes, it's a distraction when all of that energy is going there and people are dying from real material issues that we can measure in terms of deaths on daily basis. Why else are capitalists so enthusiastic about covering the issue?  


>being against the discrimination of LGBT people doesn't have anything to do with socialism

This is a blatant mischaracterization of what I wrote as are you failing to grasp the dynamic of discussions around LGBTQ+ issues today but similarly seem to not understand the entire political and social dynamic of the culture war in the U.S., nor what its aims are.

Also, striking comparison between the holocaust and the trans discussion today is in outrageously bad taste and wildly out of touch. There is not a looming threat of labor and death camps for LGBTQ+ people in America. 

>the logical course of action in my mind is to rebuild a fighting labor movement while resisting right-wing assaults on people

You cannot rebuild the labor movement while digging into the culture war by design, it will not work. You have to cut through the discourses created by the corporate media and other capitalist power brokers that focus on identity essentialism. You have to reach across the isle to the right to create class unity. This type of waffling political rhetoric is why there is virtually no Left today and no policy achievements the Left can put to its name in many decades. The Left needs a clear, strong message, and that is class unity (like Fred Hampton was clear as day on) while simultaneously acknowledging the right to safety for minority groups *and* arguing that material gains are the best way to protect and provide for those groups, as is *glaringly evident.*",SpiritualState01,t2_6mw1ejcv,25,0,reddit3

The rightoid does not recognize society as being fundamentally bouregois, rather the rightoid ALREADY views society as being composed of ""the people"". So the rightoid considers that which is subversive to morality being subversive to the people.

The rightoid has a disability where they do not recognize elements within society and can only recognize society as a whole and thus views all attacks to be attacks on society as a whole.

To us we don't consider something truly subversive unless in counters those who control society, but the rightoid does not distinguish between effective subversion and ineffective subversive, as their disability precludes them knowing who something needs to hit for it to actually be subversive.

Sometimes the rightoids can tell who something would need to hit in order to truly be subversive (although they would never call it that) as they can identify individual people who run things but their disability precludes them from connecting the identified people into a larger system. The rightoid instead thinks the people they have identified as ruling over us are actually the ones doing the subverting to us, because they center society as a whole as opposed to identifying distinctions within society, and therefore the ""subversive"" actions of the rulers are subversive towards the entirety of society instead of just being subversive to the subsection of society that includes them, as they do not identify society as actually belonging to the people who the rightoid identifies as subversive.

I don't even see much coverage in the New York Times about it and other outlets aligned with Democrats (either officially or unofficially). From what I've seen, it's mostly the arch-conservative media outlets that are focusing on it, and the Republicans focused on it politically, and they suffered immense pushback because of it. If people en masse are just checking out of the extreme right screaming about bathrooms, then it won't be effective.

The kind of noxious moralizing that was standard in libs died out thanks to Trump dominating the news for four years. Funny enough, the battle against wokeness was already won because liberals had to eat shit for a term. They didn't get their ""stronk wahmen president.""  With Biden, the libs still don't have any victories, but they can't cope with identity anymore so they pick up other fetishes they think will grant them victory: Trump's arrest.

gkcew9q,t1_gk90gr0,2021-01-23 11:00:27,stupidpol,"The thing is, ""slam poetry"" as a distinct classification would have been scarcely coherent to begin with.

A poetry slam originally implied no particular style or genre, other than a poem read aloud. It was a fundamentally democratic endeavour, an attempt to tear poetry from its genteel trappings as a stuffy thing read in coffeehouses, the latest iteration of a boisterous tradition of street-level wordsmiths that includes Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, Ishmael Reed, *et al*.

The idea of a poetry slam was... not strictly for the fellas, but a very macho, aggressive concept: pulling it out of the academy and throwing poets in the octagon to compete for cash and prizes, with the losers' poetry publicly disparaged. The opposite of a supportive, non-judgemental safe space, the logic of slams was stark: the mob would pronounce that some art is good and some *bad*.

Apparently, though, the word ""poetry"" is just too toxic and attracts pretentious douches like moths to a flame.

Also the point im making is that poems have to be amended to make good songs. I guarantee any song that you consider poetic, was most likely even more poetic and complex before being put to music (_if_ the song started out as a poem). Its just the nature of song, different approaches work better for a singing voice than the written word/speaking voice. Different sounds will be preferred.

If you watch any interviews with esteemed songwriters where they talk about their songwriting process, they will talk about sacrifices that need to be made for a good song. Lots of times, meaning is sacrificed for a better (phonetically) sounding word.

Im also talking more about songs that are trying to be catchy or conventionally good music. Not necessarily pop music but it applies _even moreso_ to good pop music.

Obviously you can say fuck structure or worrying about any semblance of catchiness, and just go through-composed and write the music to completely serve the lyrics, but that is def a more niche approach. Nothing wrong with that tho.",,,2,0,reddit4

>When people dis fantasy—mainstream readers and SF readers alike—they are almost always talking about one sub-genre of fantastic literature. They are talking about Tolkien, and Tolkien's innumerable heirs. Call it 'epic', or 'high', or 'genre' fantasy, this is what fantasy has come to mean. Which is misleading as well as unfortunate.

>Tolkien is the wen on the arse of fantasy literature. His oeuvre is massive and contagious—you can't ignore it, so don't even try. The best you can do is consciously try to lance the boil. And there's a lot to dislike—his cod-Wagnerian pomposity, his boys-own-adventure glorying in war, his small-minded and reactionary love for hierarchical status-quos, his belief in absolute morality that blurs moral and political complexity. Tolkien's clichés—elves 'n' dwarfs 'n' magic rings—have spread like viruses. He wrote that the function of fantasy was 'consolation', thereby making it an article of policy that a fantasy writer should mollycoddle the reader.

>That is a revolting idea, and one, thankfully, that plenty of fantasists have ignored. From the Surrealists through the pulps—via Mervyn Peake and Mikhael Bulgakov and Stefan Grabiński and Bruno Schulz and Michael Moorcock and M. John Harrison and I could go on—the best writers have used the fantastic aesthetic precisely to challenge, to alienate, to subvert and undermine expectations.

gk8v1lm,t1_gk8kqze,2021-01-22 21:48:38,stupidpol,"The bromides are what make the poem bad as poetry. It reminds me of something Dwight MacDonald said after quoting a passage in Thornton Wilder's *Our Town*, ""I agree with everything Mr. Wilder says but I will fight to the death against his right to say it in this way.""

Not exactly a popular aesthetic theory at present, but Kant did point out the distinction between ""good"" and ""(aesthetically) pleasing"" (or ""beautiful""):

> In order to find something good, I must always know what sort of thing the object is supposed to be, i.e., I must have a concept of it. I do not need that in order to find beauty in something. Flowers, free designs, lines aimlessly intertwined in each other under the name of foliage, signify nothing, do not depend on any determinate concept, and yet please. The satisfaction in the beautiful must depend upon reflection on an object that leads to some sort of concept (it is indeterminate which), and is thereby also distinguished from the agreeable, which rests entirely on sensation.

> In many cases, to be sure, the agreeable seems to be identical to the good. Thus it is commonly said that all gratification (especially if it is durable) is good in itself, which means roughly that to be durably agreeable is the same as to be good. But one can quickly see that this is merely an erroneous verbal confusion, since the concepts that are properly attached to these expressions can in no way be exchanged for each other. The agreeable, which as such represents the object solely in relation to sense, must first be brought under principles of reason through the concept of an end before it can be called good as an object of the will. But that there is an entirely different relation to satisfaction when I call something that gratifies at the same time good can be seen from the fact that in the case of the good there is always the question whether it is merely mediately good or immediately good (whether it is useful or good in itself), while in contrast this cannot be a question at all in the case of the agreeable, since the word always signifies something that pleases immediately. (This is exactly the same in the case of that which I call beautiful.)

> Even in the most common speech the agreeable is distinguished from the good. Of a dish that stimulates the taste through spices and other flavorings one may say without hesitation that it is agreeable and yet at the same time concede that it is not good; because while it immediately appeals to the senses, considered mediately, i.e., by reason, which looks beyond to the consequences, it displeases. Even in judging health this difference can be noticed. It is immediately agreeable to anyone who possesses it (at least negatively, i.e., as the absence of all bodily pains). But in order to say that it is good it must still be referred by reason to ends, as a state, namely, that makes us fit for all our tasks. In respect to happiness, finally, everyone believes that the greatest sum (in terms of number as well as duration) of the agreeableness of life can be called a true good, indeed even the highest good. But reason also balks at this. Agreeableness is enjoyment. But if this were all that is at stake, then it would be foolish to be scrupulous with regard to the means for providing ourselves with it, that is, whether it is obtained passively, from the generosity of nature, or through self-activity and our own effort. But that the existence of a human being who lives merely for enjoyment (however busy he might be in this respect) should have a value in itself, even if as a means to this he was as helpful as possible to others who were likewise concerned only with enjoyment, because he participated in all gratification through sympathy: of this reason could never be persuaded. Only through that which he does without regard to enjoyment, in full freedom and independently of that which nature could passively provide for him, does he give his being as the existence of a person an absolute value; and happiness, in all the fullness of its agreeableness, is far from being an unconditional good.

> But despite all this difference between the agreeable and the good, the two still agree in this: that they are always combined with an interest in their object, not only the agreeable (§ 3) and the mediately good (the useful), which pleases as a means to some agreeableness or other, but also that which is good absolutely and in all respects, namely the morally good, which carries the highest interest with it. For the good is the object of the will (i.e., of a faculty of desire that is determined by reason). But to will something and to have satisfaction in its existence, i.e., to take an interest in it, are identical.

It should be added that, for Kant, the beautiful object is an object of disinterested satisfaction. From that perspective, the problem would be the ""interest"" at play in the assessment.",RepulsiveNumber,t2_33zqy4fr,15,0,reddit4

My time spent among fellow ""pretend""-writers and poets was nothing but constant disappointment and disillusionment as slam, terrible free-form and bumper-sticker poetry and objectively bad prose were entrenched and supported by professors and art-spaces. Even those who disliked these forms refused to use their authority within the art world and voice criticism, nodding along instead, either because they were high on po-mo and challenged their own authority to no end, or because they had the popular shittake of ""at least they're writing and reading *something*. The university's bar regularly held slam nights and poured money into that form, while those who created non-performative art were left to their own devices: pointlessly submitting to journals hellbent on appeasing a deteroriating market by either publishing easily ingestible vapid shit, or incomprehensible art with no point but to ""like, make you uh, think about whatever, bruh"" that on one hand -as you said in a comment below- rarely engages with ordinary experience, and on the other focuses on being as vague and void of meaning as humanly possible. These non-perfomative, non-hip, ""archaic"" but not elitist-kind-of-vapid artists would then create their own online journals and zines read by 15 people including their friends and extended families, until they finally gave up.

I don't think the Daily Mail is the best or most accurate source of information, but I grew up reading a left-wing newspaper The Guardian, which I felt was committed to reporting truth, but now it seems like everyone is post-truth and everyone is more committed to enforcing their version of reality than honestly reporting what actually happens.

The number of times papers such as The Guardian will print outright lies on stuff like trains and other idpol issues makes them pretty much all similarly BS. Especially that those papers are now willing to report gossipy, unverified shit that furthers their biases, just as much as the Daily Mail was.

I said that remembering when I was growing up going to my grandparents house, and where we had The Guardian daily and Telegraph on Saturdays, seeing the Daily Mail there and thinking 'this is awful reactionary pandering shite'. Now that I haven't bought a printed newspaper in over a decade the sense of worldview that you get from having a Daily Mail in your home seems increasingly irrelevant in that you can go online and look at their website with its high budget for photography and buying stories, and not really have 'The Daily Mail' really be an influence on your thought in the way it was for my (now deceased) grandparents.

and there does seem to be some kind of career there as an e-thot

As a 24-year-old in a job with responsibility for deadly weapons there is clearly a big question over her experience/qualifications for the role.

There is obviously nothing about modelling, begging for money from 'pay pigs', etc. that prepares you for the job she has. If she had spent her college years at gun shows and similar relevant activities then that would be useful/relevant preparation, but there just doesn't seem to be anything in her social media content suggesting a deep interest in weaponry.

ix4hlli,t3_yzw140,2022-11-20 18:12:42,stupidpol,"From fellow mod u/RepulsiveNumber in response to the bog-standard rightoid reaction:

>> Here's another fun tidbit: Black people are roughly 14% of the US population but made up 39% of the actors in this year's Super Bowl commercials. They're not trying to replace you with minorities and if they are it's a good thing and you should shut up and stop complaining about it.

[RN](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/yzw140/comment/ix2w2tp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

> That isn't what these commercials are demonstrating, though. It shouldn't need stating, but commercials can't ""replace"" you, and they can't ""replace"" a population. They're trying to sell ""you"" (the audience the company imagines is watching) a product.

> They're not trying to provide any straightforward representation of ""reality"" either. This is something the OP misses as well. They're trying to present a reality pleasing to their audience, whether narrowly targeted or more general, and pleasing in such a way that ""you"" the viewer will act and buy the product, or at least have it in mind when you consider products of that sort. The specific audience these ""diverse"" ads aim for is (roughly) ""middle class, liberal, young, upwardly mobile.""

> While some who are white would like to see ""more white people in commercials,"" this seems even more useless as a goal than ""more black CEOs."" Anyone who thinks like this will just have their resentments manipulated by right-wing demagogues, like the evangelicals and many of the other ""culture warriors"" that eventually came to rely on the GOP, only to see almost all of their ""worst case scenarios"" become true regardless.

> It sets the political goal at far too low a bar anyway. I don't care about seeing ""myself"" in commercials; I'm more concerned about the intrusion of advertising everywhere, and I would prefer to see zero commercials.

> The goal of commercial advertising is to lead the audience to buy something from the company, but a commercial can be trying to sell ""the brand,"" in the hopes you identify with it and buy or continue to buy their products. This isn't a new tactic. From Thomas Frank's book *The Conquest of Cool*:

>> The best-known feminist campaign of the 1960s was crafted by the all-American firm Leo Burnett (the company responsible for the Marlboro cowboy, the Jolly Green Giant, and the Pillsbury Doughboy) for Virginia Slims cigarettes, a new Philip Morris product that had been specifically invented to appeal to the new attitudes of women. These new cigarettes were longer (“you’ve come a long way”) and narrower than usual, but their real difference, as with all cigarette brands, was an image defined by advertising. This image was concocted of varying quantities of militant feminist rhetoric mixed with some less radical aspects of American femininity (like makeup and fashionable clothes). It incorporated a great many of the aforementioned themes: the oppressive cigarette establishment, nonconformity, self-determination, and the liberating power of the youth counterculture. One of the campaign’s first television spots opens on a woman dressed in an overdetermined, old-fashioned costume standing alone in the middle of an uncluttered set. A male voice addresses the viewer while restrained flute music is played:

>>> It used to be, lady, you had no rights. No right to vote, no right to property, no right to the wage you earned. That was back when you were laced in, hemmed in, and left with not a whole lot to do. That was back when you had to sneak up to the attic if you wanted a cigarette. Smoke in front of a man? Heaven forbid!

>> As it was in so much of the advertising of the 1960s, the past was an unhappy time of repression both sartorial and consuming. But while the announcer is speaking, the woman has produced a pair of scissors and, with a coy look at the camera, begun to free herself from this past by cutting her costume apart. And behold, when stripped of her conformist costume, she is not demure at all, but wears stylish striped stockings. Within seconds, she has transformed the old-time dress into a contemporary poncho-like drape. And then, since liberation is a matter of consuming, she lets her hair down, dons earrings, and applies mascara. Similarly, the flute music is replaced by the brand’s rock ’n’ roll jingle, to which the woman begins to dance: “You’ve come a long way, baby, to get where you’ve got to today.” As the Marlboro cowboy symbolized the promise of individualism, so the stylish female of Virginia Slims, always contrasted in print advertising with her repressed forebears, came to identify the brand with the promise of women’s liberation.

> You could ridicule this approach easily, but it's effective in two different ways: both by targeting the demographic with the product, and tying the targeted identity to the consumption of the product (or to the brand). Sometimes ""identification"" ads can seem entirely pointless when they don't trace the path between the identification and the product as clearly as the ""Virginia Slims"" cigarette ad quoted above; these work more through association (happy people, product/brand, happy people, product/brand, etc.). This tactic has been successful, however, and it's been known since at least the 60s.

This is a Marxist subreddit -- criticism that fails to identify idpol as derivative of class politics is for midwits. Kveching (even from libs) about the relative palatability of the flavors of identitarian slop the ruling class dishes out to keep workers distracted and submissive to a moral economy that justifies their domination is likely in violation of the rules.

The article agrees that there is more representation of minorities in advertising now than ever before. And it points out the disparity between the screen and the real world when it comes to diversity at a management level. 

Yet, the article points out that, despite all of this. “51% of ethnic minorities feel TV advertising does not represent different cultures well enough, with 10% saying there is no representation at all.”

The reason advertisers put visible minorities in ads is not to represent the actual makeup of the USA but to appeal broadly to many demographics. Brown people react well to seeing brown people on the screen. LGBTQ people, too. Apparently, they haven’t gone far enough. 

The interracial couples in the ad you mentioned certainly seem to be pandering. It would be interesting to see whether interracial couples are viewed positively by anyone other than interracial couples. 

The fact that band aids are now available in different skin tones may seem like pandering but to the people with those skin tones it is a huge win. There is a doctor out there preparing a text book of medical images with dark skinned people because rashes and things look different and the exclusively white skinned images that have existed don’t help identify diseases in a huge percentage of the population.

This is all very true and astute, and it would be more powerful if you acknowledged the deranged crypto fascists on the left who really do cheerlead demographics as destiny and really do want to cull the white population, because they see white people as inherently reactionary and a demographic impediment to liberation.

These people are not outliers. This assumption is behind the focus on especially oppressed non white people and begins the de-emphasis on segments of the working class assumed to be white (which so happens to be the most critical heavy industries all other industries rely on, like the oilfield), even if the advocate is ostensibly drawing from the old CPUSA line from decades ago on what nations constitute America and whether they are oppressed or not. The left is all on the Sakaist spectrum now.

We can't dodge this phenomenon by refocusing the attention on how advertizing works, even though, again, everything you said here is true, because by not acknowledging the actual, real racist anti white biases on the left who cheerlead representation in media this way especially because it makes white people mad, we lose credibility with a significant portion of the apolitical and conservative working class, which makes up the vast majority of the working class, including the non white ones who are just as cynical and media aware as their white comrades. Even if you disagree Sakaism makes up a dominant ideology trend on the left, or they aren't really leftists, they are the kinds of leftists upheld to represent the left by both liberal and conservative media, which requires us to have a position that acknowledges the ""lived experiences"" of the majority of workers, and their relationship with the left and mass media.

I'm saying all this as someone who's been doing political outreach to workers in heavy industries in South Louisiana for almost a decade and a half. My advice to people in general is don't hesitate to admit things the right gets right, learn the difference between primary and secondary contradiction, and learn active listening techniques. Trying to be doggedly exactly correct about everything is teacher pet behavior, and there's a lot of ugly truths in the world that the right has been able to capitalizt on as the left has become divorced from reality.

The left not doing that is why the right wing can run circles around us with basic ass memes and capture populist sentiment. They are free to say what's true and inconvenient for the left/liberals without any worry about violating any sense if proprietary or being 100% accurate.

The only way to beat that is by having a bigger dick and to stop caring if you offend the average leftist. They aren't important, the guys who work in ""industrial corridors"" are.",hubert_turnep,t2_q7dsa6gk,34,0,reddit2

That isn't what these commercials are demonstrating, though. It shouldn't need stating, but commercials can't ""replace"" you, and they can't ""replace"" a population. They're trying to sell ""you"" (the audience the company imagines is watching) a product.

They're not trying to provide any straightforward representation of ""reality"" either. This is something the OP misses as well. They're trying to present a reality pleasing to their audience, whether narrowly targeted or more general, and pleasing in such a way that ""you"" the viewer will act and buy the product, or at least have it in mind when you consider products of that sort.

Firstly there is the fact that many on the left do tend to idpol sympathies. My understanding of Marxism is that decolonization was a strictly reactionary and nationalist process that impeded progress to the dictatorship of the proles. But most on the left support it for reasons of 'self determination', while denying this same right to the created or indigenous groups that are white. They'll invent any number of reasons why self determination no longer applies, but the truth is there are deep seated biases of their own.

Secondly you acknowledge and agree with some of the worst 'racist reactionary fascists' and both reddit admins and their own leftist credentials cannot acknowledge that. To ask ""which capitalists hate white (Christian descended) people, and own the media to promote it?"" goes dangerously into yeposting territory. The survival of their little corner of power on the internet depends upon them denying or ignoring that. They might even acknowledge that there are people that hate whites, but they won't acknowledge any such biases guiding the capitalist class, because again, they dislike the conclusions. They only wish to acknowledge a strict class interest motive and ignore that humans all seem to have biases. 

The insistence that there is no significant threat to whites is paramount to them. I think it's because they've drunk the liberal ideological soup that they were raised in, and seek a return to their preferred state. The mods are reactionaries in a way, but specifically in seeking a return to an idealized state they picture (conveniently) the state of affairs around their childhood as. It's a weakness of orthodox Marxism that it thinks that ethnic biases don't significantly impact one's viewpoint.

This isn't a new tactic. From Thomas Frank's book *The Conquest of Cool*:

> The best-known feminist campaign of the 1960s was crafted by the all-American firm Leo Burnett (the company responsible for the Marlboro cowboy, the Jolly Green Giant, and the Pillsbury Doughboy) for Virginia Slims cigarettes, a new Philip Morris product that had been specifically invented to appeal to the new attitudes of women. These new cigarettes were longer (“you’ve come a long way”) and narrower than usual, but their real difference, as with all cigarette brands, was an image defined by advertising. This image was concocted of varying quantities of militant feminist rhetoric mixed with some less radical aspects of American femininity (like makeup and fashionable clothes). It incorporated a great many of the aforementioned themes: the oppressive cigarette establishment, nonconformity, self-determination, and the liberating power of the youth counterculture. One of the campaign’s first television spots opens on a woman dressed in an overdetermined, old-fashioned costume standing alone in the middle of an uncluttered set. A male voice addresses the viewer while restrained flute music is played:

> > It used to be, lady, you had no rights. No right to vote, no right to property, no right to the wage you earned. That was back when you were laced in, hemmed in, and left with not a whole lot to do. That was back when you had to sneak up to the attic if you wanted a cigarette. Smoke in front of a man? Heaven forbid!

> As it was in so much of the advertising of the 1960s, the past was an unhappy time of repression both sartorial and consuming. But while the announcer is speaking, the woman has produced a pair of scissors and, with a coy look at the camera, begun to free herself from this past by cutting her costume apart. And behold, when stripped of her conformist costume, she is not demure at all, but wears stylish striped stockings. Within seconds, she has transformed the old-time dress into a contemporary poncho-like drape. And then, since liberation is a matter of consuming, she lets her hair down, dons earrings, and applies mascara. Similarly, the flute music is replaced by the brand’s rock ’n’ roll jingle, to which the woman begins to dance: “You’ve come a long way, baby, to get where you’ve got to today.” As the Marlboro cowboy symbolized the promise of individualism, so the stylish female of Virginia Slims, always contrasted in print advertising with her repressed forebears, came to identify the brand with the promise of women’s liberation.

You could ridicule this approach easily, but it's effective in two different ways: both by targeting the demographic with the product, and tying the targeted identity to the consumption of the product (or to the brand). Sometimes ""identification"" ads can seem entirely pointless when they don't trace the path between the identification and the product as clearly as the ""Virginia Slims"" cigarette ad quoted above; these work more through association (happy people, product/brand, happy people, product/brand, etc.). This tactic has been successful, however, and it's been known since at least the 60s.",RepulsiveNumber,t2_33zqy4fr,28,0,reddit2

ix4573u,t1_ix34l7d,2022-11-20 16:49:01,stupidpol,"> are you saying the DEI Thanksgiving table OP is describing is trying to evoke an identity of the target market? 

This tactic is less about evoking an identity directly than provoking identification of the targeted audience with the product; evoking the identity directly can be part of this, as in the above-mentioned cigarette commercial, yet it isn't always. In other words, there need not be a one-to-one relation at work between ""identity of target audience"" and ""identity in the commercial""; in this case, I would say there likely is some relation based on the description, although it's ""how the target audience would like to see itself,"" not its actual composition.

> If so, who is that identity? ""Moneyed whites with token non-white associates""? 

More or less, but the ""token non-white associates"" are necessary parts of the fantasy, because the demographic it targets also sees itself as ""diverse"" or else views ""diversity"" as an ideal. Evoking that ideal and associating it with the brand or product (similar to the ""happy people"" example) is what's most important here for identification by the targeted audience, not the explicit evocation of the identity they're targeting. In this case, I'd even say *disavowal* of the explicit identity is more useful.",RepulsiveNumber,t2_33zqy4fr,9,0,reddit2

Capitalism, of course, trends towards the monopolization of capital, wealth, power, all those good things.

US politicians generally love it when the mob doesn't show up to vote. The two parties rely heavily on a relatively small core of loyalists, though depending on the circumstances sometimes real money and effort will be put into trying to mobilize more voters as a temporary measure (this is much more a Democratic thing than a Republican one, since the GOP usually consistently does better the fewer total voters there are).

And not to get bullshit sentimental, but voting rights really are something people fought for. Not always literally, violently, but sometimes that too. We can say liberal parliamentary democracy is limited, even shit, but it's still better than nothing. And since the US doesn't remotely have anything like regional soviets, nothing really is all we have if we refuse to take part in the system. Maybe it will never amount to anything, but if you have an ability to vote you should always do it, even if just to write in a protest candidate. 

You kind of don't get to complain about things sucking if you also think never bothering to try and influence policy is some form of radical protest. Also the more local a measure is, the more often you actually can meaningfully influence it, and the more often it will directly impact your life.

Open your eyes and look around man. If you’re in America, you live in an actual fascist, authoritarian regime.

Not only do the republicans not have anything comparable to superdelegates, but they are not as willing to fall on their swords to stop an insurgent candidate. 

In 2016, Trump managed to win by getting a plurality early on, and the other candidates stayed in and split the vote. By the time they started dropping out it was too late. In contrast, 2020 Sanders was positioned to pull ahead in a similar fashion, but the democrats all dropped out, formed like voltron, and endorsed Biden. Naturally, Warren stayed in since she was the one most likely to have overlap with Sanders' supporters.

 A control economy with a centralized government that, at least in theory, prioritizes the needs of the collective working class over the rich. The government dictates what industries should be prioritized (I.e. space, healthcare, climate change), punishes or kills off companies working on socially degenerative or distracting areas (social media, ad-tech, video games, etc.) and then let’s people compete within these more productive areas.

It's by design in the sense that the intellectual circles that came up with the term are more interested in abstractions (here, sex) than delineating material differences. Neither lens is inherently bad, but they're very different and good for very different things. You can have interesting intellectual discussions when you put the abstraction at the center. But those aren't particularly helpful for discussions about what should be done legally to regulate one type of sex work or another, or what kinds of harms come from specific kinds of sex work. Those are material questions that aren't served well by abstractions. 

Compare, for instance, to homosexuality as an abstraction. It's been a politically useful one, but on the ground, the experiences of lesbians and gay men are pretty different. The reasons for homophobia against each group is different. The causes of homosexuality in the two groups are probably different (""born this way"" has a lot more scientific evidence re: men than women.) From one perspective, they're the same type of thing. From another, they're entirely dissimilar. Which perspective you take depends on what kind of discussion you're trying to have. 

The problem with sex work is that it's gotten so tightly attached to idpol that it's now difficult to have discussions using a different lens, because any lens but the sex work lens is interpreted as bigoted. I don't think the intellectuals who came up with the sex work lens intended that, nor would most of them deny that important distinctions within the category exist.

As a slight aside, ""sex work"" as a term was coined in a milieu with a lot of fluidity between different types of sex work. It's not uncommon for someone to go from stripping to hooking to working a phone sex line, and so on. Lots of porn stars escort on the side too. The real change that breaks the whole thing is the rise of camming as a stand-alone pursuit among middle- and upper-class women. I don't necessarily object to lumping stripping and hooking together, given that both are done more by poor women who have little social or economic mobility and given that many women end up doing both. There are still differences between the two, but there are situations in which lumping them together makes sense.

g2ra4oi,t3_ifsdku,2020-08-25 01:53:34,stupidpol,"A few comments on this: 

A. The term sex worker originated in the 70s before OnlyFans & camming and before modern woke discourse. The purpose was to emphasize labor and material realities instead of criminality (prostitute was a legal term), or pathology (prostitute appeared in ""social hygiene"" literature and was linked to mental illness) or morality (prostitute obviously has negative connotations in that area too). In this way, I actually think it's a good phrase, from the standpoint of making the labor aspect explicit for things like organizing, safety protections, and rights. The problem is when it becomes a (trendy?) identity category instead. But that was not the intention of the term - so no, not by design initially. Current idpol nonsense has warped it.

B. I agree it collapses very different types of labor under the same umbrella, and this is where the phrase is unspecific and flawed. For us as leftists, it obscures the relationship between different types of sex workers and capital. So for example, in descending order of wealth & power:

1. Those in the industry who profit off of the labor of others are capitalists (the owners of brothels, strip clubs, porn studios, massage parlors, commercial dungeons, and online platforms like OF)
2. Next would be the petite bourgeois (PMC in terms of income even though they don't manage anyone but themselves and stigma prevents them from being considered akin to other ""professionals"") - the small handful of independent high earners (may have their own subscription websites) who have a lot of freedom and choice over the conditions of their work, the prices they charge, etc. When they have ""small business owner"" class allegiances (flirting with Libertarianism) I can understand viewing them as class enemies, but this amounts to a small fraction of the industry globally. Unlike group 1, they don't exploit other people.  Maybe the most they are guilty of is pushing the ""empowerment"" narrative. 
3. The people actually working in the brothels, commercial dungeons, strip clubs, massage parlors, and porn sets are wage earners who share a lot with your average laborer (proles) in terms of their relationship to capital - profit is extracted from the service they provide and they take home a percentage just enough to make a working-class living. Probably the vast majority of people who work in the sex industry are in this category. I have nothing but solidarity for them, and I hope other leftists do too. I don't want them incarcerated, and I want them to have robust health and safety protections, as well as the right to unionize and the opportunity to leave the industry (for alternative work that can be just as flexible & with equally low barriers to entry) without a criminal record. Until the revolution/the end of capitalism and poverty, they will exist, and I worry that the disdain for Group 2 (and the prominence of Group 4 in the popular imagination) ends up overshadowing the needs of this group. 
4. Outdoor street workers would be, in Marxist terms, the ""lumpenproletariat,"" those who are struggling to survive, exposed to the most violence, and often homeless. Victims, not in the radfem sense of having no agency against patriarchy, but in the sense that they suffer from the worst fallout of austerity and capitalism. Again, the way to make sure as few people as possible end up in this group is by addressing the root causes, as well as contributing factors like addiction, mental health, etc.

Caveat is that individual workers may move between categories 2,3, and 4 throughout their lives - most Americans, at least, are one medical disaster away from homelessness/financial ruin - so the boundaries aren't 100 percent stable and clear. Lots of workers also have ""straight"" jobs/gigs too, and dip in and out of the sex industry when they need extra income, due to neoliberal precarity.",_indistinctchatter,t2_5phiaejw,1,0,reddit4

If this is a pattern, why has “sex workers” slipped so casually into the lexicon? Is it to increase the sense of comfort we feel toward very young people selling their bodies online? Is it to speed up the obsolescence of monogamy? Is it just a clever marketing scheme implanted by the strip club industry? Who can say. But you’re right to see that discussion around the matter has all but seized up, and I can’t help but detect some amount of artificiality in this having happened.",bullshitonmargin,t2_3qvios5p,1,0,reddit4

It's not as complicated as you make it. Whether they're privileged or poor, all sex workers need protection against violence and exploitation (mostly financial exploitation, like any worker), the freedom to work and ideally the freedom not to work.

many people on the left have no concrete opinion on sex work beyond doing whatever is safest and causes the least harm, whether that be legalization or not. but at least there is some more compassion on this side (and much unspoken pity), so riding off of the liberal free-love movement that re-invents itself every few decades, ""do anything so long as you don't hurt others"" idea that many socially liberal people have, you end up with this. and now the party line to most leftists is that sex work is good and should be legal and if you disagree you're just a tradcath prude who doesn't care if women die b/c there was no regulatory body to protect them when they are bought for sexual consumption. it aligns itself with labor rights rhetoric while ignoring that everyone has to perform labor of some sort, while there is no reason anyone -has- to perform sex work specifically. that there is an intrinsic difference between pouring concrete or working the customer service desk and letting a stranger sexually penetrate your body.

the real meat of the issue is how much of these campaigns to legalize, normalize and promote sex work are being bankrolled by the wealthy and littered from the top down with pimps and traffickers. prime example would be ireland's ""turn off the blue light"" campaign from several years ago, a foundation that is owned by a convicted millionaire pimp and his brothels-owning son. the attention paid to women involved in sex work affiliated w the campaign who spoke out about this to media like the irish times was a microcosm of the international attention and praise given to the campaign itself.",calliopez,t2_13f1wt,7,0,reddit4

They were. Their advent, in 1905, ushered in the golden age of radical unions in the US. At one point they had 150,000 members across the US and Canada. Counting total membership was always tricky because people would join the union during labor disputes then bail when it was over. They were particularly influential in mobilizing unskilled and migrant workers, as well as foreign workers (mainly from Europe).


They were in constant conflict with the moderate, skilled unions who saw them as a bunch of lazy, good for nothing reds (IWW = ""I Want Whiskey""). When the US entered the war in 1917, they were labeled seditionists and hunted down (sometimes killed) by the US Government and private security firms like the Pinkertons. 

They had some major actions in the 1920s like the ['23 San Pedro Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_San_Pedro_maritime_strike), but they began a long decline. A good portion of the leadership fled to the Soviet Union where they lived in exile until their deaths.

Their songs, like Solidarity Forever, are still sung at protests and strikes, but they don't have much influence outside the leftist bubble.

> And Facebook rents office space in various cities, but they don't work for real estate firms.

This is a bad analogy for a few reasons. First of all, I'm completely unfamiliar with OnlyFans' terms of service, but I assume it's like every other tech company's: ""we offer our app as-is with no implied guarantee of anything whatsoever; don't like it? hit the road.""

Facebook, on the other hand, enters into a contract with the real estate company. They have legal recourse if they feel the firm has not met its obligations, and in a worse-case scenario, there are plenty of other real estate firms willing to rent to them. Some locations may be slightly better or worse but fb's model is in no way dependent on which office they rent.

I guess there's other camsites like Chaturbate or whatever, and I'm not quite sure how their business model differs from OF, but it seems like OnlyFans operates an effective near-monopoly in their particular space, and they can unilaterally decide to kick of off their service at a whim. If they do so, you've likely lost contact with some segment of your paying customers. And network effects play a large part in such sites' popularity and utility.

> Chapo Trap House aren't a bunch of workers slaving away for Patreon. Etsy shop runners aren't working for Etsy.

The sole proprietor of that hot dog stand has different class interests than the professional athlete.  That's not a statement about the pleasantness of his life or his moral value as a person.

As for the middle manager, it depends on what their job actually entails.  There is a managerial class, for instance, although it doesn't apply to everyone with the word 'manager' in their job title.  There are plenty of categories other than proletariat and bourgeoisie. ""PMC"" is not one of them.  By conflating well-paid members of the working class with certain members of the bourgeoisie and managerial classes into one lump category, you and everyone who uses the term ""PMC"" are obfuscating the relevant class relations.

By the way, it is precisely the members of the working class that have more power (those with more disposable income, job security, etc.) that have more potential to leverage concessions from the ruling class. Excluding them from the working class and conceptualizing them as having the same interests as the bourgeoisie is a uniquely self-defeating political strategy, and also just factually and analytically incorrect.

Also, all members of the working class serve the interests of capital or they wouldn't have a job.  ""Without direct supervision"" and salary vs. hourly wage are not meaningful distinctions when it comes to relation to the means of production.

There is also a reason that taking a picture of someone without their permission is a much less serious crime than fucking someone without their permission, or taking a picture of a child vs having sex with one

Sure you can, because by your logic there is basically no difference between raping a prostitute and committing theft of services.

They saw how technological advancements drastically improved productivity and living standards. They heavily criticized the harms of capitalism during the time period in which they lived, but they still saw technology as a tool to make everyone’s lives better

I really agree with this outlook. It’s really easy to feel resentment towards technology because it is used for malicious purposes like surveillance nowadays. However, we take a lot of it for granted. Washing machines for clothes have saved many lives over the decades. Drowning while washing clothes in a river was not an uncommon way to die back in the day on top of it being one of the worst and most time consuming chores. Accessibility technology for those with disabilities is also incredible. People even with severe disabilities like total blindness can live more independently than they ever have in history

Technological advancements can result in us doing less manual labor and that can be a good thing. Technology should make our lives better. I guess people who just don’t want to do manual labor period aren’t serious though",Tacky-Terangreal,t2_14c7a5,3,0,reddit1

Trucks won't be completely gone within 5 years but by that time we will be seeing increasingly large numbers of automated trucks on our roads. Within 5 years the largest single industry in the world will in all likelihood no longer be logistics and instead this industry will be shrinking rapidly

  
In 5 years we will see the beginning of the end of that industry   


Mr. Daum, on the other hand, is saying that it might take until 2030 for autonomous trucks to reach 6% of the Class 8 trucks on the road. That means, there will be more Class 8 truck drivers on the road in five years than there are today, because freight shipments are projected to grow at a faster rate than Daimler believes the autonomous truck market will grow.

The first aspect is important, because capital here – quite unintentionally – reduces human labour … to a minimum.

Being ""at the top"" of any kind of political local group means power and, in my experience, offers of employment in adjacent parties. With woke rules, it's simple: 
- say you're nonbinary and pansexual 
- if you've got even a bit of a darker complexion, feel free to make up a racial background, so you can claim racism. I've found ""my dad was a south American communist"" to be the most popular lie.
- be a complete hypocrite: if you're a man, you espouse feminist principles but also absolutely bro down behind closed doors, for example.
- attack others to increase your own status in the group, which IDpol makes extremely easy. 
- have no political analysis, simply criticize the opinions of others. If you don't have any ideas, no one can criticize you for i e it being racist or transphobic. Having ideas is probably the easiest way to make sure you're cancelled within the next few years.
- Play people out against each other on a personal level. People in leftist movements have sex with each other, a lot, but there's also personal friendships with all that entails.

Think about diabetic insulin pumps. A form of technology used to correct a medical defect. In many ways it's a primitive form or transhumanism. But they're absurdly expensive for machines that have the same processing power as a fucking gameboy. Seriously my phone carries out more complex calculations and stores more than one of those things. Yet they carry a 4 digit price tag not including consultations and supplies to keep it going.

I personally think a lot of this is just pure disrespect, channeled and funneled for nefarious purposes by capitalistic political cabals. People deserve dignity, people deserve respect. All of the BLM protests in my city walked down bougie streets in bougie, expensive neighborhoods. The free community kitchen from our “anarchist bookstore” sits on a street in bougie community. They hate poor people and are seriously terrified of them. They can’t comprehend being kind and respectful to people they disagree with or find “distasteful.” 

I think cultural consumption of gang glorifying music and fashion shows this too. Black communities are *devastated* by gang shit. I had boys in my first grade class throw up gang signs in a class photo. Six year olds!! So many kids I teach have parents in jail for stupid gang shit. The upper classes consume Cardi B and all this nasty bullshit while whole communities get materially forced into violent, horrible things through economic and cultural shifts. The sex work is real work bullshit is the same. Real sex work is the little boy in my class who me that his mom sends them out to the park at midnight with their infant sister to wait while her “friends” visit. But if you avoid and dismiss poor people these stories don’t reach you. They’re happy to let others suffer. 


Similarly everyone loves Dolly Parton right now, she’s having a big moment with the left. But would they love hearing her views on feminism and how she does not, in fact, identify herself as feminist? Her feelings of faith as a Christian? 

I just feel like so much of this is this egotistical looking down on others and being obsessed with lining up their categories. It’s like when middle schoolers dismiss people because they don’t like the right music or wear the right shoes. They look at poor people, religious people, conservatives, even other left leaning people who don’t froth about their exact issues as stupid. 

I think if you really think about class the logical conclusion is a type of humanism that values personal responsibility but also believes in fundamental rights to dignity, material safety, and respect.

The rural working class could take over the Democratic Party in any cycle by actually voting in primaries, but the reality is, they don't want to be in an alliance with people they dislike, because in order to get the things this sub claims they want, they may have to concede some room on cultural issues, which it turns out, they don't want to do, just like cultural liberals don't either. 

The actual reality is most rural people in America in 2022, as opposed to the past, are actually reactionary socially and economically. Yes, they may like Social Security, but they'll dislike any new spending that'll help the Other, whether the other is immigrants, urban minorities, feminists, or whomever.",AliveJesseJames,t2_c7zq2,1,0,reddit2

They chalk every short coming of the inner city minorities up to systemic issues, and every shortcoming of the rural working class up to poor personal choices and values.  The cognitive dissonance is legitimately unbelievable.

The PMC ""left"" are always going to be more focused on rhetoric than action simply because to put their money where their mouths are would result in them losing their financial position, and the ones that are downwardly mobile (myself included) have no structure to grasp on to that would give any constructive direction. The labor movement at large is only really concerned with helping the individual unions (because that's all they can really do, legally, thanks to Taft-Hartley), and even though there is an upswing in unionization efforts amongst the service industry, its still kneecapped by the inability to act in solidarity with other unions and industries.

Really the only way I see the labor movement making any change is if the institutionally crucial workforces with unions start making wider-reaching demands, like if the railroad unions demanded Taft-Hartley be repealed with their recent narrowly-avoided strike that had the potential of devastating the American economy, OR if more unions start openly defying the law in concert with each other, and that would lead to a standoff where I wouldn't be surprised if there was bloodshed, especially given the hyper-militarization of local police forces since 2001.",MaltMix,t2_8ecqx,32,0,reddit2

When last I encountered factory workers they were largely quite conservative. They know who to bet on. This is not any of their first rodeo. And had they had any lifestyle markers other than red state ones, they probably would not have been eligible for those jobs in the first place. It's a self-annealing surface.

ipgokfi,t1_ipfvvv6,2022-09-22 13:02:08,stupidpol,"In 1936, some rural farmers in Alabama could support the New Deal because not only did it help them economically, it didn't affect local hierarchies directly so they could still be above African-American's, even if they themselves were actually not all that economically better off than a sharecropper. Nobody was telling them they had to send their kids to the same schools as said African-Americans to get that free electricity. 

OTOH, if you could somehow let these relatively low-info voters (and I'm not using that as an insult) that the same New Deal that was giving them rural electricity was also helping n-words in New York, support would drop by a whole bunch. 

Now, the backlash wouldn't be quite as bad as today, because, and I know people don't like to hear this, everybody outside of the poorest 10-15% of Americans live relatively comfortable lives, where even if they work a hard job for 40+ hours a week, they return to homes or apartments that would look like palaces to those New Deal farmers, eat incredibly cheap calorie-dense food, and then have basically limitless entertainment for basically free. 

People will ally with The Other if they literally don't have electricity or their children are losing arms in threshers to barely afford rent in a falling apart tenement, but if they already have Buy Out, Get One Free McDonald's burgers, cheap porn, an apartment where the heat or a/c mostly works, and Netflix, why not vote on what stories you read about on the Internet about people you don't like doing things you don't like?",AliveJesseJames,t2_c7zq2,2,0,reddit2

Technically speaking, a lot of what is now referred to as the PMC was traditionally considered to be part of the petty bourgoisie, though how exactly you want to define things is a whole other issue. The PMC tends to be much more reliant on the state or corporate entities for their existance, where what we usually describe as the petty bourgoisie - small businesses - is or at least attempts to be, more independent. The PMC does also have this sort of double allegiance of the traditional petty bourgoisie, but typically on the opposite issues, so when the petty bourgoisie aligns with the bourgoisie, the PMC aligns with the proles, when the petty bourgoisie aligns with the proles, the PMC aligns with the bourgoisie. This is all a vast oversimplification, but its a rough explanation of what goes on.

Historically this group has been overrepresented within the socialist movement for the reason you mention, but also that their interests were, in the past, more tightly bound up with those of the traditional working class. Over the last several decades, the antagonisms between them and the workers have grown for a variety of reasons, including social changes within society, struggle within the movement itself, and a certain degree of active subversion by intelligence agencies, among other things, which has led to the socialist movement becoming increasingly PMC in character, and speaking of the working class mostly in terms of charity, or by mistaking the PMC itself for the working class proper - we all have a boss therefore we are the same class, is the logic used, which in the extreme makes footbal players and CEOs working class, and as ridiculous as that sounds there are people who will say things like that.

I should probably be clear that I don't think the workers *never* fight against there own interests - everyone can be fooled in various ways afterall - just that I think the PMCs appraisal of what the interests of the workers are, or ""should"" be, are often missing out on a lot of perspective, and so end up being partly or sometimes totally wrong.",,,1,0,reddit2

* The graph not starting at zero is making the fluctuations seem 3 or 4 times larger at first glance than they actually are

* More importantly, the graph does not take into account the demand side of things, which makes it almost meaningless. Not factoring in the effects of Amazon, etc., the **line should go off the top of the chart just to keep up with population growth from the starting point**. The fact that it is well below there suggests that the number of drivers has never recovered from the dips. ~~If the last article is referring to the trough that precedes it, adjusting for population alone makes it more or less accurate.~~ **edit:** I should say that, if adjusted for population, the last article is not as inaccurate as it initially seems.",Apropos_Username,t2_bgaaj,4,0,reddit3

That’s not worth the extra effort whatsoever. 

Now that the federal government is soon pulling the rug out on extra unemployment benefits, you’ll see this labor shortage go away, however, a lot of people are going to be shit out of luck because these businesses have already gone under, despite the fact that they’ve been offering lucrative wages this whole time.

This is really the only data I can find about labor depending on if a state has ended the federal government’s extra payments. It’s only made a small dent in the *unemployment rate,* but that’s a lot different than a continued labor shortage. Like I mentioned, a lot of these businesses are gone now, so a lot of these people are shit out of luck, whether they’re ready to go back to work or not. 

There’s no mention of a continued labor shortage (people who don’t want to work). The only data we have is *unemployment data,* which could still be high because there just aren’t the same number of jobs anymore. 

What this really tells us is that we’re probably too late. Like OP’s post mentioned, the media will trot out the term “labor shortage” whenever they want in order to hide the issues of a failing economy, so we’re probably not going to know for a while (once lockdowns and extra federal unemployment benefits are completely over and we have a full picture of just how many jobs there actually are out there) if the labor shortage is still real or if they’re just blaming the common man for the failings of businesses and the government.

Engineering majors still generally pull in higher wages across the board, and most companies would still hire EEs in development roles.

That's still an incredibly healthy salary, don't get me wrong, but the field has also become stupidly competitive. It took me two years and I had to get a reference from a friend to land my first big gig at a major company. If you want to bring in big dollars, you're expected to be the sort of person who can almost singlehandedly drive projects, or at least pull your weight. There are a lot less high paying sys admin/webmaster jobs with lots of flexibility and downtime.

Savvy Indigenous leaders and activists also tend to look at it this way. Of course without denying the way in which racism has shaped them into racial groups

But sometimes it is reduced to racialism by certain tribal members. The notion that there is something distinctly biological/genetic that grants them “connection to the land” as opposed to cultural/political is not something exclusive to the noble savage trope in the mind of white america. There’s also sometimes a weird misunderstanding of epigenetics and ancestral trauma that leads people back into racialism. 

It’s tricky to talk about because you can’t dismiss the reality of life in Indian country, the disproportionate rates of poverty, diabetes, alcoholism and drug addiction, domestic violence, homelessness, despair/suicide etc etc.. that you can directly link to historical trauma like the boarding schools and the gold rush and such.

But like I can’t honestly pretend like wealthier native people with light skin who live out in the city and get tons of opportunities based on their identity have this genetic or biological connection to the land, or endure much present day hardship based on their “race” 

It’s not worth it for me to try and address though honestly, because the material conditions of people in struggle are the priority, and it’s not like most tribal people are unaware of this weird race-based claim of well-off tribal members.

1. Don’t say anything at all, even if it’s pro-whatever. Keep discussion either on work or normie hobbies.
 
2. If you have to speak up, or are expected to, criticize the perspective at hand as not being woke enough. It will be believable because you sincerely hold a different opinion, and it still falls within the confines of acceptable discourse. For example, pushing back on the pan-African teaching by saying you feel it marginalizes the rich collection of varied cultures that encompass Africa. I have found phrases like “X isn’t a monolith” or “generalizing makes me uncomfortable” helpful.

Now, if you went to the principal's office you would see a lot of books, an Ibram Kendi here, a Coates book there, maybe a Robin Di Angelo.  But in the classrooms, you don't see much of this, certainly not in mine.  Sure, in some English classes they may have books that reflect the students (Our population is black and hispanic), but it's certainly not very woke and I teach history as I always have.

Now, to add some more context, 2 years ago, when schools were re-opened and we were all masking up, our administrators tried to force some sjw drivel down our throat.  I'm trying to remember the name of this book that we read, which basically had your typical ""teach the TRUTH"" ladee dah stuff.  Like, I recall one moment where the author stated ""instead of teaching about the founding ideals of the United States, perhaps do a lesson on who REALLY built the structures in the US?"" And I'm thinking...teach about the architects?  The workers? Oh she means the slaves...or ""enslaved people"" is what the preferred nomenclature seems to be.  I think the book was called ""Cultivating Genius"" or something, basically that bipoc kids had ways of knowing that their ""mostly white"" teachers, did not.  Yes this is it: [https://www.amazon.com/Cultivating-Genius-Culturally-Historically-Responsive/dp/1338594893](https://www.amazon.com/Cultivating-Genius-Culturally-Historically-Responsive/dp/1338594893)

Now, last year, we did NONE of these readings.  Professional development was focused specifically on helping our students achieve.  I think one reason is the staff did not buy into that book at all, and mind you, the staff is very diverse along racial lines, but these are real people and few if any even know what ""woke"" means.

I worked at a public university up until late last year. I was there for just over 8 years, then they eliminated my position (via a department restructuring, they aren’t legally allowed to eliminate my old position because it’s state mandated so they just shuffled the whole department) and laid me off, so I’m no longer with them.

Ok, too much background. 

One time we had a series of 4 DEI trainings, 2 hrs each, over the course of a month. Already an absurd amount of time to spend on DEI. We also the guinea pig department, we were the first ones taking this training. 

I am not exaggerating, AT LEAST 6 of the total 8 hours of training was spent on gender nonconformity, transgender politics, and 2nd wave Feminists. 

We had about 15 of us in my department including my gay self, a no bullshit stereotypical home-depot gruff lesbian in her 40s (so literally had lived through some of what the presenters were monologuing about) and one closeted gay who had only come out to us two.

The presenters finally wrapped up their stale as hell 90+ min segment on some notable transition moments from 1st into 2nd wave Feminism. I think that whole 90+ mins started with the Pill or hit on some more prominent figures, but it 100% ended with stonewall and Marcia, so literally 1969. (Mind you, this was after the NYT article that debunked her throwing first brick, that she wasn’t even there in the first day, and there may have been little to no bricks at all. But they still lectured on that outdated info and us alphabet employees stayed quiet to keep the peace)

And then they jumped **from Stonewall all the way to fucking MATTHEW SHEPARD!!** 1998!! Near 30 years of MAYBE SOME SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT SHIT that they skipped!!

Us three let it awkwardly go on for a while and then the wonderful lesbian spoke up and said they missed a lot of stuff, and then us three literally spent the rest of the session telling that part of history from memory TO THE FUCKING PRESENTERS.

Grandpa also was sent to boarding school and started drinking to cope. Untreated CPTSD and alcoholism and poverty  made mom or dad grow up in a neglected abusive household and they were never given tools to cope. Now they have kids and can’t pull it together and get out of addiction, so cps removes kids and sticks them into foster care.

The part about Marsha not being there at the beginning and not being the one to start the riot is at 3:00. It shows Marsha herself said in an interview that she didn’t arrive until after the riots had started.
 
The whole video is good, debunking all of this moralizing and posthumous sainthood that exaggerated the impact of transgender people and people of color during the gay rights movement, to the purposeful detriment of all the activism and suffering and death that gay men went through.

I don’t have a problem acknowledging impacts or suffering of transgender people at that time. I don’t have an issue talking about how groups of lesbians stepped up and formed groups that went to hospital and homes of dying gay men because their entire families had abandoned them. I don’t have a problem acknowledging the Intersectionality of race and sexuality, and how those people specifically were impacted during that time.

What I did hate was the damn near complete erasure of gay men, especially white gay men. For most of the 2010s there was this absurd retroactive amnesia that resulted in gay men basically not being acknowledged during most discussions of significant gay history, from Stonewall through Matthew Shepard, gay men were a footnote, if that.

The Atlanta one wasn't too too bad actually but I think the following year was worse for things like that.  Of course 2015 was bad.  That was the one where Bernie was shouted offstage.  The following year in St. Louis, panels were interrupted as we were challenged to go on a BLM march right there in St. Louis to the old courthouse.  We went and didn't mind (we had been at a panel on economic issues which of course never took place)  but we and the famous panel speaker who had been going to speak at our panel (who also went despite being in high heels because she did not know this would happen) did not go on the Interstate beyond the old courthouse, and the Tweets were critical of the people who didn't go on the Interstate and/or were in the back.  But we couldn't find the main crowd by the time we went in any case.  The Tweets were to the effect that white people were trying to be in the back in order to be safe.  Seems Hunter Shackleford says the opposite--that white people try to be in the front of BLM marches for photo ops.  OK I just made up my mind at those two events to read the Tweets and learn what I felt I should learn and try not to look mad or get mad about the rest.  Lots of tweets about ""Look at all the mad white people"" who wanted to hear Bernie/other speakers who got interrupted in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

2018 in New Orleans, I think it was, was the worst in some ways.  In Atlanta in 2017 the person who got shouted off stage was a different Stacy (a white one) who was running against Stacy Abrams and I like Stacy Abrams and I don't hold it against her and the white Stacy was for school vouchers so that's what the interruption was about.  But in 2018 the major interruption was about the air conditioning not working as well in certain rooms and certain panels being scheduled opposite each other (we all have to deal with that, in my opinion...lots of times I can't make it to all the panels I'm interested in)  but this was presented as if it had been on purpose.   There had been a safe room for non-white attendees and reportedly the air conditioning didn't work as well in that room.  Now there was a good thing at the Atlanta one...it was on the same day as Charlottesville happened and we all went on a march.  But at the final keynote the major interruption was about these petty grievances including why weren't there more scholarships (free admission I think) for POC to the convention.  And why did the hotel workers have to be working while we rich people got to sit and get to go to a convention.  All kinds of grievances that in my opinion were petty to unhinged.  And then the people who took over the stage said for everyone who promises not to attend in the future, unless these things were fixed, to stand up.  I did not stand up, mean ""look at the white people"" tweets be damned, because I didn't want to be a hypocrite.  I knew damn well the white people standing up didn't mean it.

But the last straw for me was after the convention, at the airport.   An organizer reportedly said ""Let's see them plan something like this and not have one thing go wrong.""  And someone else videotaped that and put that person on blast.

Subsequent years have not been as tense or had as many interruptions except this year Free Palestine protested at the keynote...that was because of one of the speakers on stage probably.  But nobody was Tweeting.  I guess the era of Tweets flying at the same time something like that is happening are over for some reason.   I did learn a lot from reading the Tweets even when something I didn't like was happening.

This year I went in person and it felt like things had pulled back a little bit from the 2015-2018 era but I couldn't tell for sure.  I would still be willing to sit there and read the Tweets and try not to look mad and learn what I thought I should from the Tweets, letting the more deranged Tweets go by, but again, this year no one was Tweeting.",Pantone711,t2_nz0rl,1,0,reddit4

I don't necessarily disagree, it's just that you didn't give this nuance about 'intermingling' to begin with, you just wheeled out the tried-and-tested Right Wing smokescreen of 'Oh, no one wants to take accountability anymore!'

Actually, what 'no-one' does is acknowledge or address any factors that fall - even partially - outside of someone's control (unless you're rich or a massive financial institution of course, in which case you get bailed out. Fancy that.) when creating policies around all sorts of things.  All anyone talks about is how everyone ***else*** doesn't 'take accountability anymore', and those in charge use that to deny people the protections, services and regulations that they actually pay the state for through taxes.

Children should be re-homed for their own safety when it's required, obviously, but that isn't fuel for the bootstraps fire that has everyone running around yelling at 'the poors' for their own situation, and I'm sure there'd be *even less* children in care if there were *even less* wage slaves as a result of the kind of thinking going on here:

Force isn't a constitutive property of labor. On the contrary, *one* defining feature of labor (as opposed to pre-capitalist forms of work) is that it is not performed under threat of violence or force.

Contrary to what you write OP, though I sympathize with your outlook, the problem with ""emotional labor"" is that it performs a duty for capital. It draws another sphere of relationships, which has traditionally resisted commodification, into the market. It forces the regime of quantification and fungibility into the most essential part of what it means to be a human being. We come into the world and fall into illness dependent on our family and close ones. If those connections are commodified, we ourselves become no more than commodities to be used and discarded and evaluated according to how we trade for others like ourselves.

And then, qua women's movements, those structures began to degrade, and it got a little bumpy. It seems like people are still working out what to do with that.

And then this concept somehow cross-pollinated with people being (I think, reasonably) mad about some of the social expectations that people from marginalized groups are meant to be self-effacing and helpful, and people trying to communicate that advocacy ain't free particularly if people are arguing in bad faith--and kind of needing a word for that.

And this is why you're not a socialist; you're a feminist.

True socialism is about being one with your community and building it up. You should want to do this as much as you want to help yourself, because they are one in the same. If we all look to improve, it naturally comes.

Instead, look at you. You view the act of even helping your own children as a, ""chore,"" and something that requires payment (the underlying premise). That's the most disgusting thing I've ever read. You are incredibly selfish. I'm not against social programs to help out families (getting them a house, for instance) but to insinuate that the woman needs some kinda wage? What the fuck?

You should want to help your children and build them up. They are not a hindrance, but our future. We should WANT to build a better world for our children and not for our own shade, but by planting a tree so they can have shade 50 years later. This is one of the most honorable things a woman can do, raise happy children that will become happy brothers and sisters. Instead, you view it as a, ""chore,"" because it doesn't make you money... you sound like a fucking blood sucking capitalist.

The fact that you don't see this means you will never be a leftist. At best you're a libertarian and at worst a neo-liberal. In fact, people like you are far worse than conservatives.

gki3qno,t1_gkhsfr7,2021-01-24 06:28:17,stupidpol,"Correct. It was the sociologist Arlie Hochschild, in her book *The Managed Heart*, who coined the term--but as [she pointed in an interview out a couple of years ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/arlie-hochschild-housework-isnt-emotional-labor/576637/), its meaning has been completely twisted in popular usage: 

> **Julie Beck:** Could you lay out in your own words how you define the term *emotional labor*?

> **Arlie Hochschild:** Emotional labor, as I introduced the term in *The Managed Heart*, is the work, for which you’re paid, which centrally involves trying to feel the right feeling for the job. This involves evoking and suppressing feelings. Some jobs require a lot of it, some a little of it. From the flight attendant whose job it is to be nicer than natural to the bill collector whose job it is to be, if necessary, harsher than natural, there are a variety of jobs that call for this. Teachers, nursing-home attendants, and child-care workers are examples. The point is that while you may also be doing physical labor and mental labor, you are crucially being hired and monitored for your capacity to manage and produce a feeling.

> **Beck:** Since the time you coined it, have you noticed the term becoming more popular? How is its use expanding?

> **Hochschild:** It is being used to apply to a wider and wider range of experiences and acts. It’s being used, for example, to refer to the enacting of to-do lists in daily life—pick up the laundry, shop for potatoes, that kind of thing. Which I think is an overextension. It’s also being applied to perfectionism: You’ve absolutely got to do the perfect Christmas holiday. And that can be a confusion and an overextension. I do think that managing anxiety associated with obligatory chores is emotional labor. I would say that. But I don’t think that common examples I could give are necessarily emotional labor. It’s very blurry and over-applied.",Gorrest-Fump,t2_gtyue,31,0,reddit1

gkkcn7w,t1_gkhy75j,2021-01-24 13:48:55,stupidpol,"Now.  To be fair - there is a societal expectation for everyone to be smiling and pleasant, to everyone, no matter how insufferable they're behaving.  It doesn't matter if you're in a service industry or a while collar office job.  We're supposed to all be super nice and understanding, doesn't matter if you'e male or female.

In my opinion, insufferable twats have figured this out and are using it to their advantage - hence the rise of Karens.  I know when I'm at work (office job) and go home, I'm often mentally exhausted because people think it's okay to just wear you down and suck the life out of you.

It occurred to me this week:  I don't accept one of my 1200 lb horses bullying and being all up in my  space and pushing me, why do I tolerate it from a 180lb human?

I've finally quit accepting being treated like that.  Emotional Labor is not a cross to bear, it's a societal expectation and it's shackles we need to cast off.

Of course, while this may make your social life a little easier, ultimately, this doesn't solve the bigger issues that are caused by this, but neither does trying to take an egalitarian view and ""gotcha""-ing feminists about it, because no matter what they claim, they aren't playing a fair game here; if you try that then they will quickly demonstrate how happy they are to take advantage of all of the old gender distinctions that they claim to want to abolish, whether to make you out to be the big bad wolf and appeal to some other guy or women as a whole, or to paint you as a wothless loser to show you up against everyone - and of course they'll claim all of this will ""right historic wrongs"" or some other such nonsense - but the overall point I'm making is that ultimately you have to deal with them in much the same way you would on an interpersonal level by acknowledging the stupid dance we have to play, albeit with a few extra restrictions due to the political control they have.

ifiwobx,t3_vvb7ae,2022-07-09 22:07:08,stupidpol,"It's not just professor salaries. Consider the typical career path of a philosophy professor.

First you need the B.A., and if you get yours in philosophy, as is expected, you haven't given yourself much of a fallback option.

Then you need to apply for grad school, and a high GPA won't even help you unless it's also from a highly reputable institution and your letters are from the tenured faculty there. So, it's becoming increasingly common in the U.S. to first go to a master's program. Have fun filling out $50-150 applications for a master's program that's almost certainly going to be unfunded, requiring you to take out a loan.

Great, so after six years of school and five or six figures of debt, you're ready for the PhD program. Enjoy another application cycle that drains your wallet, and if you're lucky to get just one acceptance, you're looking at another four more years of school. During this time, you are given a stipend of $18k, and no, that isn't going to be adjusted for inflation. If you're thinking about getting a side job, good luck, because these programs are already full-time jobs requiring you to TA and/or teach your own classes.

Imagine making $18k in your mid twenties. That's just the reality for those of us insane enough to want to do this at all costs.

Now consider how this looks when you're rich:

First, go to an Ivy League because your grades are pretty good and your daddy's donation is even better. Here you'll excel because you don't need to work during your four years at Harvard, and you'll get privately tutored for any of your weak subjects.

After undergrad, go straight to the PhD program, which'll be about five years without having to do the M.A. first. Application costs? Pfft, daddy is ready to pay for 30 of those. Besides, your chances are good since you went to an Ivy League and were able to study the whole time instead of work.

Again, the size of the stipend is not a problem for you, because you chose to be born rich -- good move! Your chances of dropping out (something like 50% for everyone else) are much lower because you're not stressed and barely able to afford rent, let alone thinking about a second job.

That's what it takes before you reach the status of adjunct professor, where you'll finally be able to make...[$50-70k.](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/What-Is-the-Average-Adjunct-Faculty-Salary-by-State) Ignore the hourly wage column; you won't be getting 40 hours/week.

“Assortative mating is the process by which people of similar backgrounds, such as educational attainment or financial means, select a partner. Over the past half-century, there has been an increase in positive assortative mating within the marriage market. In Marry Your Like: Assortative Mating and Income Inequality (NBER Working Paper No. 1982), authors Jeremy Greenwood, Nezih Guner, Georgi Kocharkov, and Cezar Santos document this pattern and consider how it has affected income inequality across households.

To study this question, the researchers employ a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of households from the U.S. Census Bureau for the period 1960 to 2005. They find that more formally educated people are increasingly likely to marry those with similar educational attainment. Those with less formal education are also increasingly likely to marry those with lower education levels. Since household income is strongly correlated with the partners' level of formal education, the tendency for increased stratification has contributed to greater inequality over the study period. This pattern has been compounded by growing disparities in the earnings of those with high and low levels of education.”

Whether that is joining the military, building infrastructure or things all around the country for those who need it, working government service jobs, volunteering with the homeless, and so on and so forth.

This would be hugely beneficial in a lot of ways. 

First, it would allow people who finish High School some more time before they truly have to ""decide"" what to do with their life, letting people make better decisions and ensuring fewer people ruin themselves financially with college.

Second, it would encourage people to have more empathy and sympathy for people working in difficult fields, by forcing them to work a job where they don't decide their own hours and can't just ""quit"" for a couple of years.

Thirdly, it would provide essential services for the community and society at large.

Fourthly, it would make people more likely to be civically involved - including in areas such as politics - if involved in community-oriented or government-oriented jobs from a younger age. That could lead to better chances of things like pushing proper reforms.

The only downsides of such a program would be implementing it properly, and the difficulty associated with actually going through it for individuals. I think the benefits ""greatly"" outweigh these downsides however.

For the initial two-year period when it is implemented we could for example provide extra funding to schools and restructure educational facilities that might have expected those students to enroll sooner, and use that as an excuse to reform education as a whole to some extent.",echonian,t2_8bf7y,56,0,reddit2

Instead the rail workers should try and come up with some schemes that will outpace the media construction narrative.

Takes like this would be swatted down like gnats, but now they're just proliferating wildly and it's kinda scary.

This was something I pointed out as a red flag when libs were going crazy for Joe Biden 2 years ago because they wanted to get rid of Trump. One of the pitfalls of electing Joe Biden is that this kind of shit gets **normalized** and pushed into the left-hole in US discourse. At least when dumbass Trump was the president, the mainstream discourse took a nominally negative posture against Trump. It's true, a lot of it was over stupid stuff, like Russia hysteria, or typos, or tweeting at Cher and Bette Midler. But at least they were willing to be in attack mode.

IDK that it was ever that consistent. Even at its height I don't think union participation in the U.S. breached the 40s. That said, I've spoken with my grandmother about this period back before Reagan ruined the air traffic union, and she says something similar, that with Democrats in particular it was never a question whether you supported a union or their rights. That's what made Jimmy Hoffa pretty much one of the most famous men in the country, a man who has now been scrubbed from goldfish-memory-level American history outside of conspiracies about his death.

Well, what do you mean by being ""composed"" of people?

The people who work for companies aren't the ones that get to make decisions for what the company does as a whole, the owners do. Yet the owners aren't necessarily a ""part"" of the company in any meaningful way, as they often simply control it from a distance in an impartial way - usually just trying to maximize their profits.

I understand the excuse used for legal justification of corporations and such having ""rights,"" but ultimately by giving them those rights it leads to infringement on the rights and prosperity on the greater whole of society. 

It feels to me like giving ""rights"" to a serial killer.

Sure, a serial killer is a person too, and deserves some standard of rights in my opinion.

But you need to lock them up for the good of society, and any ""rights"" which they might have which let them cause harm to others and infringe on the rights of others are not ideal.

When giving rights to collective action leads to individuals having their individual actions be oppressed and controlled by the rich, I would say we probably should be more specific in where collective action justifies rights.",echonian,t2_8bf7y,2,0,reddit3

A 2042 press release just materialized on my desk. (Don't worry; this sort of thing happens.)

I'll just type it out but I'll have to give a translation because in 2042 almost everybody on the globe can now communicate together, which means everything you say is drowned in tens of thousands of people saying exactly the same thing. 

So it's become fashionable to obscure your speech so only those who put effort into understanding you deserve to know what you said.

**Notes**, for those unfamiliar with the future:

^^^1 ""Everybody"" obviously excludes straight white cis men.  However, it was decided in the First Nice Council (that one's for u/dougtoss) that in the name of equity, 'everybody' and 'everyone' would now exclude those they termed as SCWM (straight-cis-white-male). It was pronounced ""skwum"" and you only had to be one of those things in order to qualify.

'Everybody' knew they were really saying ""scum"" but they could [motte-and-bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) it into ""an innocent acronym that only upsets those who suffer from intergenerational fragility"". (Oh, just wait until you hear about intergenerational fragility in about 4 years time...))

^^^2 Oddly enough, the very woke future are huge fans of Red Letter Media.

^^^3  Excepting SCWM, obviously. See First Council of Nice.

^^^4 In the Second Council of Nice, it was agreed that 'everybody' could use the vocal mannerisms of American Southern Black preachers to describe any form of claimed oppression, harassment or micro-aggression. In exchange, everyone else agreed that Black preachers were the originators of all forms of human liberation, albeit backed by a choice of proud Black Unliberated Women.

^^^5 In order to recognize that rape is about power, it was decided that all power is about rape. Although in reality this was practiced as ""All **scwm power** is about rape."".

^^^6 All signatures came down to fingerprint now. This included signing into all forms of social media, which means that by signing up for a pre-order, the company had access to all of your social media. If you cancel your pre-order, or leave a bad review, your entire social media history will be scanned and all problematics brought forward as charges before the Justice Courts *^^^notanactualcourtoflaw and a predetermined sentence of Full Cancellation, No Mercy.

The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer can claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte).

In the long run, I think outsourcing of tech jobs will backfire. Why? Because foreign workers can't write code for shit and I've seen it firsthand. It's actually embarrassing to read some of the crap that makes it into production. At first it sounds great to companies that they can get extra hands on a project for a low cost, but in reality the quality of their work is so piss poor that it will cost much more to maintain or rewrite in the long run, and deadlines are constantly missed. The moral of the story is you get what you pay for.

Assuming you are in CS, which it sounds like you are, the whole entry-level market is fucked right now. Nobody wants to hire entry-level programmers because they tend to work for about a year, pad their resume, and then switch jobs for more money. That doesn't work in a recession though. Companies can't afford to hire someone who knows nothing, train them up, and watch them leave. So companies are dishing our more money to hire mid-level programmers, and ignoring the entry-level market.

My advice (and the advice I'm following right now) is to work your ass off to land big company interviews. Interviewing is totally broken right now, but you can use that to your advantage.

She has chronic pain in her back, (or so we thought) so her doctor did back surgery, and now she suffers from “Failed Back Surgery Syndrome”. It turns out the original pain she has was from her hip that needed to be replaced, she got her hip replaced , but now she has ACTUAL back pain for the failed back surgery syndrome. Her doctor then had some salesman come into his office, who encouraged her to get a spinal cord stimulator implanted (even gave out her number to have “previous customers” who’d gotten the stimulator to call her & tell her how amazing it was). We had to pay $115,000 to get this implant, and it NEVER FUCKING WORKED. Now she still has the pain & is unable to get MRI’s because of the stimulator, and it’s not able to be removed because it’s tangled up in her nerves & could paralyze her. This has been a breaking point that has reverted me back to being a socialist- capitalism in medicine is fucking disgusting.

His biggest problems are specifically outsourcing and younger workers in general as all younger workers don't have the leverage of experience to demand higher pay.


Immigration was a strict, nightmarish process that took ages and involved 18 hours of flying atva week's notice because we didn't cross the I's and dot the T's. Years spent wondering if we'd be torn apart by a letter in the mail. I don't understand why that is the hill to die on since outsourcing and contracting are far more common issues amd we're staring down the barrel of an aging population with the birth rate dropping.


It's not like people on worker visas are like illegal immigrants who citizens can't possibly compete with because they work for basically nothing. They're just like anyone else you'd work with except they happen to not come from within the same national borders. Ideally you would care less about these people because you wouldn't be in a system where you're forced to fight over pathetic scraps against them.

It's actually embarrassing to read some of the crap that makes it into production. At first it sounds great to companies that they can get extra hands on a project for a low cost, but in reality the quality of their work is so piss poor that it will cost much more to maintain or rewrite in the long run, and deadlines are constantly missed. The moral of the story is you get what you pay for.

  
I've seen this take since the nineties, and while a lot of companies did outsource code stupidly and get bit on the ass early on, the quality of third world programmers has gone up incrementally since then, and over the last five years there's been considerable gains. There's over a billion indians, and a lot have tiger parents that are making them program from as young as 12, and that's not including the ones in SEA, and the global south in general, that are doing the same thing. Even if only 1/10 become as good as a western programmer, that's still enough to completely saturate the field.   


In the 60s, Japanese products were considered low quality trash and everyone in New Zealand used to disparage them as being inferior to the British and American goods. By the 80s, Japanese electronics dominated the industry. During the 90s, Chinese products had the same reputation and people assumed that it was due to the Chinese only being able to create shitty imitations and having no capacity to innovate, now they're leading the world in 5G and have a good reputation for consumer goods. Give it ten years and you'll see the same thing with IT and the global south.",,,7,0,reddit1

I think it's more nuanced than that.  Some of the best programmers I've worked with were Indian H1B workers.  However I've also done coding interviews with would-be contractors who submitted fraudulent resumes showing years of coding experience, yet were unable to complete even a simple programming exercise.  Overall I get the impression that the top people from India are just as good as anywhere, but there are a whole lot more completely incompetent people just trying to ""fake it till they make it"" in tech.

Personally though, if I was looking to outsource coding work I would go with eastern Europe over southeast Asia any day.  The programmers there seem to be much more skilled *on average*, plus there's less of the ""say yes to anything even if you can't actually deliver"" mindset.",,,3,0,reddit1

When outsourcing/importing labor is easy, people will get upset about losing their jobs and downwards pressure on their wages.

Train them in sensitivity, so they're too scared to voice their economic concerns for fear of being perceived as bigoted. Make sure they know that the problem lies within their selfish and prejudiced hearts, not with their boss's need to buy a new beach house and pick up a Maltese citizenship (in case America goes south).

When enough people catch on and make it more difficult to get that labor, you need to cry about the lack of skilled (AKA cheap and not requiring training) labor, and have the government pay for the training you want, and sell everyone on the dream (while the engineers get paid less than sales, legal, or most any other department).

Employers would use these divisions to pit different groups of workers against each other, for example hiring blacks as strikebreakers or offering preferential treatment to skilled workers as a way to end a strike.  However once industrial unions started gaining momentum they just about blew craft unions out of the water.

But I've also been around very proficient and experienced developers. These people get paid ridiculous amounts, but look at what they bring to the table. They can write code as easily as you can write the words you're reading. They have an intimate knowledge of their tools. They have an eagle eye attention to detail, they don't cut corners, they don't settle for less. They're also great communicators.

If we consider the problem pragmatically, the only solution is to eliminate the economic incentive of hiring foreigners or relocate, which means improving the conditions of foreign workers enough that they are no longer cheaper than the competition. International worker cooperation ultimately makes everyone's lives better, competition only empowers the capitalists that exploit and profit from it.

Liberals pretend to ignore the problem and cover it up with propaganda, as you said, but to erect walls and be unreasonably hostile to foreign workers is the fascist way. The problem is not the Indian guy that, after ten generations of absolute poverty finally manages to land a decent job and enter the middle class, the problem is that the conditions in his country are worse and getting worse, which only opens up more opportunities for capitalists to exploit both them and western workers (that have to contend with the threat of cheaper labor, something that is enforced and tightly controlled by those very same capitalists).",hexalby,t2_twiv1,7,0,reddit1

This is wild, but probably not surprising.  I was one of those kids in the 80s.  In my area, there were a few evening papers (imagine multiple local papers! doing well!) so you could even deliver *after* school.  A paper route paid quite well by 6th-grade standards, and only took a little time.  Kids did it on their BMXs or even on foot.  People tipped their paperboys too.  A good route with good tippers was sought after and often passed down to siblings and friends.

The starting NIH pay scale is $52k, and when I was a starting postdoc 6 years ago it was $42k. I know that’s more than the median income in this country, but this is for a professional career that requires at least 8-10 years of post-secondary education to even start. It’s a dirty little secret of the business that the only way that any of academic science is sustainable is by flooding the labor market with cheap immigrants. These workers often don’t have American expectations about what their standard of living and ability to do things outside the lab (like buy a house or start a family) should be. If you made importing postdocs more expensive academic PIs would have to rein in the number of projects that were done, which they probably should. This would cut out a lot of the chaff in academia that generates low impact publications and overproduces trainees. In U.S. science there’s definitely an imbalance in the number of slots at the top and the number of trainees. Everybody basically trains to be a P.I. despite knowing that even at the postdoc level (when a lot have already washed out) 90% of people will never achieve the position they are ostensibly training for. The labor market is way out of whack and yet you can’t even question whether we need to have so many immigrants coming in when the incentives are already shit and most Americans who have the aptitude but are not independently wealthy would probably be wise to choose a different career even if they love it.",MrStupidDooDooDumb,t2_m6yjb,3,0,reddit1

Relocating is a lot harder than you seem to think. Moreover the jobs being referred to here are faculty and research positions at American universities, which \*can't\* be relocated.

>The solution can only be to eliminate the economic incentive of hiring foreigners or relocate, which means improving the conditions of foreign workers enough that they are no longer cheaper than the competition. International worker cooperation ultimately makes everyone's lives better, competition only empowers the capitalists that exploit and profit from it.

This is a monumental project that isn't remotely achievable in our lifetimes. The developed/undeveloped country balance isn't a task that American workers have a hope of fixing in the next 100 years. The only viable option here is to curb immigration one way or another. This doesn't need to be personal or an attack on immigrants as people. They are obviously just doing what's best for themselves.

The original conservatives were third worldists, most modern ""conservatives"" are povvos who directly advocate for nationalism (nationalism is a result of the french revolution). Imperialism in the roman sense was literally the same as globalism, have you not realized this? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana

>Third world theory states that the working class in the first world is largely a separate class. Economic colonization and social democracy allowed the first worlder working class to benefit from it, and become disconnected from the rest of working class globally. The interests of the ""domestic"" working class, and those of the colonized naturally conflict. 

Correct, I oppose colonization in the way it was done cause it ended, the global elite should  have pushed forth globalism throughout the world. The British empire, if it didn't collapse and nationalism didn't end it, would have ended up much better (it was evil at the start, but ending it was a bad idea).

Nationalism was a result of the French revolution, the idea of the phiosopher king and of wise old men running the world is preferable to local ""democracies"" which cause global minorities to turn things in their favor. 7 billion under rule by 5 men is preferable to rule by 500 million.

>As this thread shows, the first world classes do not want immigration because they don't want their wages and comfortable lifestyles to go down, but they could give less of a fuck of the life story surrounding that immigrant - how they had to deal with a drug cartel going after their families which was only made possible by the US war on drugs, or how they had to see their country, and their friends and family destroyed because of drone bombings.

Correct, and its not just ""drone bombings"", the poorest continent with 40% of the under 5 population is sub saharan Africans, they are limited in nature to their own continent and have nowhere near the opportunities of even the homeless westerner.

They I believe, should have the natural right to ascend, something nationalist leftists do not want. I am a conservative, but my views are a lot different than you think. I am an elitist, I believe the world is best helped when the deserving and willing are helped, not when we use a false sense of altruism to help willful rent seekers and forsake those attempting to help themselves.

geevsza,t1_gee4tj3,2020-12-02 20:47:07,stupidpol,"Let's follow this thought experiment.

* Biden administration open the borders and issues residency permits, full voting rights, and gives eligibility for all existing and new social programs. An [estimated 390 million people immigrate to the US](https://cis.org/Sussis/How-Many-Would-Really-Come-if-Borders-Were-Open) in the first two years, and then chain migration increases that total to 703 million in Biden's first term. Adding to the existing population of 328 million, that brings the population of the United States in 2025 to 1 billion people.
* Launches new social programs that eliminate student debt, provides free undergraduate tuition, universal basic income to all, free child care, abortion and contraceptives on demand, single payer medicare to all and if you can't afford it, the government will pay it for you. In addition to this, new residents get full voting rights.
* The vast majority of immigrants will be poor. Very poor. They are also less likely to be educated or have employment skills that are needed in a modern economy. They will need re-training and accommodations to get properly placed in productive positions. They will compete with others for minimum wage jobs and that drives wages and benefits down.
* Let's say that immigrants have the same proportion of workers to non-workers as the [current US population 63%](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219). There are now many, many more workers than jobs - particularly unskilled labor. This will put massive downward pressure on wages and benefits for existing workers. Those with jobs would have to fight hard to keep their benefits and to get new wage increases. Employers will try to hire people under the table and will fire employees for the slightest transgression. Minimum wage laws would likely be struck down or at least frozen for a decade or more. Unionized companies unable to compete with cheap new labor and will go bankrupt.
* Universal basic income, free healthcare, free childcare, free education in the face of dwindling employment prospects is a double whammy. Millions will forgo work hoping to improve their employment situation with education. Universities an colleges will be overrun and will provide very little value (you get what you pay for). Many millions will give up and subsist on government handouts, video games, low cost food, and possibly turn to crime as a way to try and get ahead.
* The best of our public servants: doctors, government officials, teachers, police will be massively overworked and under downward wage pressures. They will find better jobs in the private sector or retire early. You lose a lot when you lose your best.
* All of these new residents getting government handouts and going to demand a lot of goods and services, for the first few years inflation in consumer goods is going to skyrocket as people are willing to pay more to get what they need. The line at Starbucks is 4 times longer, traffic is way worse, schools will be massively overcrowded and need thousands of non-english speakers as teachers, and it's going to be very difficult to get a doctor's appointment or schedule a court date. To pay for these additional services and for new transportation infrastructure, state sales taxes and income taxes would be raised. Cities would increase their own sales taxes and property taxes significantly.
* New businesses catering to poor people will open and government employment will have to increase a lot to accommodate the needs of new residents. More police, public defenders, social workers, translators, etc. Taxes would have to go up to accommodate this.
* Suddenly there will be a housing crisis in the top 20 largest cities in the country. Millions of people will try to move to NY, LA, Chicago, Miami, Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Boston, etc. All the available housing will be snapped up and people still won't be able to find housing. Rents would go up steadily, and landlords would not be incentivized to make any improvements or investments in the properties themselves. Many neighborhoods over a decade would be quickly converted into low-rent slums. To support one another, immigrant families will tend to cluster, turning communities into ethnic ghettos where ethnic gangs and crime run rampant.
* With the cost of everything going up, and wages stagnating or falling for many people while taxes are going up means purchasing power is going way down. Way down. A lot of people will be a lot worse off. Millions will slip below the poverty line and they will be angry about it.
* The compounding effects of increased income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, the reduced quality of schools, overcrowded highways, insufficient infrastructure will have successful taxpayers looking for a way out. They will try and hide their income in tax shelters, they will move out of the cities, they will fund their own schools, and they will offshore their companies. The budget gaps for federal, state, and municipal governments will grow and grow as poorer Americans demand and vote for more spending and wealthy Americans vote to restrict spending and reduce taxation. In a US where the immigrant poor get to vote, the final taxation threshold is breached - wealth tax. The wealth tax is the final line in the sand for most wealthy people. It means their private property is not really their own. As soon as the money you have already paid taxes on is subject to further taxation - there is nowhere else to go. Wealth will leave US shores in massive amounts and the job creators and successful with it. To avoid this, government will have to arrest and imprison the wealthy and confiscate their wealth.

I think a lot of people who just know the name fail to grasp this basic concept: almost everyone has identities, identities are not bad in of themselves, it's the use of superficial identities that don't speak to people's actual, individual lives and using them to play off against others and cause conflict that is immoral and ultimately destructive and dangerous.

I don't think ""national identity"" matters per se, you're either a national or you're not, whether you care to think of yourself as one has consequences I suppose, if you're a national and hate your nation that can cause problems for sure as we see now, but nations that forget they have a self-interest that differs from other nations are not long for this world. You can definitely turn nationalism into corrosive and divisive politics, but you can do that with anything.

The Constitutio Antoniniana (Latin for: ""Constitution [or Edict] of Antoninus"") (also called the Edict of Caracalla or the Antonine Constitution) was an edict issued on 11 July in 212 AD, by the Roman Emperor Caracalla. It declared that all free men in the Roman Empire were to be given full Roman citizenship and that all free women in the Empire were to be given the same rights as Roman women, with the exception of the dediticii, people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.Before 212 AD, for the most part only inhabitants of Italy held full Roman citizenship. Colonies of Romans established in other provinces, Romans (or their descendants) living in provinces, the inhabitants of various cities throughout the Empire, and small numbers of local nobles (such as kings of client countries) also held full citizenship. Provincials, on the other hand, were usually non-citizens, although some held the Latin Right.

Because it objectively helps more people to a much greater extent, the ""poor"" in the West are not poor, they don't even deserve the welfare benefits they have, if anything those benefits are deserved by the ""global south"" that Marxists often write about. I am a neoliberal, but I'd advocate the welfare spending of the West (for nondisabled, able bodied non seniors) is redistributed to developing the global south. It would materially improve the lives of 3 billion massively, the ones in the West will just need ot work harder to make up.

The ""poor"" in the West have not experienced actual absolute poverty, nowhere near it. Read the UN definition of having under $5.50 per day PPP adjusted, that is actual povery, 60% of the world lives in that. Nobody in the West except someone who is homeless AND chooses to take NO public assistance even comes close to experiencing a similar condition of life.

>Are these Chinese laborers then also ""privileged"" and deserve to lose their jobs so Vietnamese ones can be the latest to enjoy the largesse of globalism? 

Once those Chinese laborers have built up wealth, have adequate housing, food etc. the neoliberal market focuses on improving the living standards of others, eventually they all become consumers and the global market shifts towards new technologies and services. They are not entitled to something by birthright, the chinese and east asians actually understand this, they dont invest in welfare states but productivity: look at Singapore, it is like heaven on earth compared to Europe.

This is just so absurd I don’t know where to begin. Workers in the first world are exploited to an extreme and have even more labor stolen from them than workers in the third world.

The global establishment class is the ultimate parasite. They exploit high skilled and low skilled workers alike in a highly sophisticated web of productive forces that siphons more and more labor value from the working class. Again, workers in developed countries have more labor value stolen from them than anyone else.

> US workers are the rent seekers living off unearned benefits of ""colonialism"".

You don’t seem to understand what rent seeking is. All the rent seeking is done by capitalists. If you can’t accept that fact I seriously don’t know what you’re doing here on this sub. Go troll somewhere else. 

> Rent seeking is wanting benefits without creating or playing an active role in producing them, unions and western workers tend to be the biggest rent seekers.

Western workers have more labor stolen from them than any other workers in the world. This is just a basic fact of how the relations of production are structured in modern society. Western workers conduct the higher value labor of all, and have the largest proportion of their labor stolen from them.

> They want to do the exact opposite via merit or employment based immigration, learn the definition of words and stop deflecting you communist pawn.

Lmfao um no, immigrants from developing countries are just as often petite bourgeois parasites trying to move up one more step on the social ladder and get out of their shithole countries. 

> Western workers dont deserve anything, they are global parasites. The first world working class are parasites living on consumerist largesse.

Western workers create the most value simply based on modern relations of production. For the last time, they are actually exploited the most from a Marxist standpoint.

The global relations of production give the vast majority of all economic benefits to a tiny minority of establishment class capitalists. Workers in every country have their labor stolen from them, i.e. they are exploited. Workers in Western countries have higher living standards because it benefits global capitalists to throw them a bone to keep them in line. The only hope of breaking the unequal geopolitical power balance, a relic of imperialism, is for Western workers to seize political power and the means of production from global capital. Only then can we work on the project of eliminating international inequality.

>Read above, doesn't matter, by your logic Elon Musk = ultimate laborer right? Or somehow mental labor somehow fails to matter when the guy is richer than you?

Elon Musk owns a huge slice of a half trillion dollar company. That's what makes him a capitalist, not a worker.

By definition, the petite bourgeoisie seek to emulate the ruling class. Their countries are shitholes because of global power dynamics and meddling from the West, that's just an observable fact.

It is doing the same to China at a rapid pace. The per capita income of the median Chinese grew 13,000% in the past 4 decades.

The Chinese live in similar buildings/housing to Western Europeans (tiny commieblocks), have access to similar transport (arguably faster as its newer), have similar life expectancies, have similar consumer goods and purchasing power and are slowly rising to beat them in comforts (Beating America is harder, America is just rich af).

So you respond to a statement about inequality in the U.S. by pointing to an extremely flawed aggregate statistic on economic production... do you have any idea how utterly nonsensical that is? The U.S. has the most billionaires of any country in the world. It has a gini coefficient on par with the third world. In the hypothetical scenario where *all* wealth in the U.S. was held by ONE person, guess what? The GDP per capita adjusted for PPP would be... exactly the same. 

>So you do admit Workers (and non workers, lets be honest those dole bludgeoners get the same shit) in Western countries have drastically higher unearned living standards?

""Unearned living standards"" is a nonsensical metric. They have higher living standards because of the global relations of production.

>This is a meme pipe dream which will never happen, neoliberalism and globalization lifted the equivalent of Western Europe's birth cohort out of abject poverty in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.

Hong Kong and Singapore are modern-day city states born from imperialist trading hubs. Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan got wealthier by selling stuff to the U.S. and embracing an exploitative global capitalist economy. Capitalism by nature *produces* winners and losers... the results are typically arbitrary. Capitalists force workers in poor countries into a middle income trap *unless* the countries in question can produce something Westerner's can't resist buying, like Japanese cars, Samsung phones, and Taiwanese electronics. But there are only so many niches available, and for most middle income countries it's a never-ending cycle of meager growth.

>It is doing the same to China at a rapid pace. The per capita income of the median Chinese grew 13,000% in the past 4 decades. It continues to grow at a pace where the Chinese will be materially on par with Western Europeans by 2033 using their current growth trajectories: yes,Chinese are literally going to be richer than Italians/SPaniards by the end of this decade, are on par with central euro EU countries like Hungary/Romania/Poland and came here after being at 1/30 the Italian GDP per capita 4 decades ago (they are at 50% the italian per capita GDP today).

Much of China is also falling into the middle income trap, which is why their GDP still lags far behind the U.S. when just 10 years ago everyone was proclaiming China would be way ahead by 2020. But ""China"" is an incredibly large and diverse region of the world, and different segments have had varying levels of success carving out a niche selling stuff to Westerners like the South Koreans and Japanese. Ultimately China as a whole is having the same problem the entire world is having re: economic growth, i.e. inequality and debt slavery are drags on growth. But the global capitalist class refuses to accept this, and so the world economy plods along while retarded capitalist fanboys cheer about the number of people earning more than some arbitrary, dollar-denominated threshold.

>So being really good at what you do and thus ""owning"" capital maes u not a worker?

Owning the means of production and not having to sell your labor to generate an income makes you a capitalist. Selling your labor to capitalists in exchange for a wage makes you a worker.

>Women and left liberals, I was recommended this sub by some left leaning liberal who was getting into your views, I have already convinced her the welfare state is bad.

>The ""petite bourgeoisie"" must be how you refer to people with over a room temperature IQ.
These are the people who build countries by harnessing the use of technology.

Yeah no the definition of the petite bourgeoise has nothing to do with IQ (which itself is an arbitrary metric invented by Western imperialists). The bourgeoise is the class that owns the means of production. The petite bourgeoise are the class of people who emulate the bourgeoise. They have little or no capital ownership, but culturally they simp for the bourgeoisie. A stereotypical example would be a 19-year-old frat boy jabroni vomiting libertarian propaganda in his Poli-sci 101 class, or pretty much any person who idolizes ultra rich celebrities but has a net worth under $100k. Of particular note is that it also includes upwardly mobile working professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants, etc. who try to break into the ruling class. Really anyone in the world who has a college degree. These people don't ""build countries by harnessing the use of technology"", but since the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, neolib simps will often make the mistake of thinking they are building the bourgeoisie's world when it is in fact the bourgeoisie who are the true architects.

>You are correct that global power dynamics does so, the only observable way to halt it is via neoliberalism and open borders.

Neoliberalism is the status quo and the culture of the ruling class right now, so saying it will upend the current global power dynamic is nonsensical. Open borders is a neoliberal pipe dream that's about as likely as a global socialist revolution. The reason is that it would cause so much social unrest that the economy would collapse and the entire world would devolve into anarchy. The ruling class likes to pretend it's possible, in order to trick SJWs into thinking that their privileges don't involve the exploitation and misery of workers all over the world.

>See what I said before, I believe in individual agency and believe individuals control themselves,not others. I believe in freedom unlike slave drivers like you.

Individuals don't run the world, institutions do. Individuals are molded by culture and institutions. They have been shaping you since before you can even remember. Libertarians like to pretend that a person's life is a series of individual choices stemming from mystical intrinsic personal characteristics. This is an utterly absurd notion often used e.g. by racists who try argue that a black drug dealer in Detroit is just a person who made bad decisions rather than a victim of their circumstances.

>These countries improve en masse when more people are extended economicfreedom (see: Singapore, South Korea, China today/ India in the future etc), immigration is part of free trade and free trade necessitates this.

I've already been over this but I find it cute that you include India this time, a country with a lower PPP-adjusted GDP per capita than 13/15 former Soviet states, beating out only Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. And yeah let's ignore the fact that all the countries you mention: Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan--have some of the most restrictive immigration policies of any country in the world. In China you can't even work in another part of the country without a state permit.

>You want to halt that so Western privileged can get easy paper pushing jobs they dont deserve.

No, I want to curtail it because like the governments of the above countries, I realize that immigration is a tool the bourgeoisie uses to serve its interests. When you're an export-driven country with plenty of cheap labor, you must prevent foreigners from cashing in on your newly accrued wealth. When you're a developed country and your living standards are already high, you can undermine your own labor force by using a steady stream of immigrants to disrupt labor organization. Petite bourgeoisie neolib simps will even pat you on the back for being woke.

The only way to disrupt the global power balance between developed and undeveloped countries is by first overthrowing the global ruling class. This requires workers to seize political and economic power within the current nation-state system in order to break it. Ideally, nation states could then be eliminated, but that's probably many decades if not centuries away.

>But there are only so many niches available, and for most middle income countries it's a never-ending cycle of meager growth.

Middle income Trap only has happened to countries which created welfare states and strayed from neoliberalism lmfao, not to ones which doubled down on anti welfare and locked commies in prisons (like South Korea).

They didn't have any demand for immigration till they grew richer and had a labor shortage (which Japan and SK do now)

And you're wrong, it sfar easier to immigrate to Japan as a skiled worker than to the US, same for SK, Singapore, Hong kong and so on.

You'd know this if you'd looked this up, to work in Japan all I need to do is apply for a job and in 3 years Ill get a permanent residency, the US has a fucking complicated mess with lotteries and whatnot for the h1b, with numerical limits; the US doesnt have deserving open borders, it just has free immigration policies for welfare bums to get democrat voters

>No, I want to curtail it because like the governments of the above countries, I realize that immigration is a tool the bourgeoisie uses to serve its interests

Those governments dont want to do so, you'd never support a Singapore or Hong kong or Korea or Japan style immigration system, both you and I know that.

Singapore has virtual open borders and Japan is doing the same currently, with its immigration reforms, Korea does too; fewer migrants go to Korea/Japan cause they arent as rich as Singapore/Hong Kong, though.

I agree with all of this, the unsustainable living standards of the Anglosphere (CANZUKUS)  and Western European (EU14+CH+NO) elite, who make up 6% of the global births as a world region together is not deserved and rests on a global financial system that systemically favors them via low cost of borrowing and resource control.

>What you're advocating for is creating an eternal slave class that will compete amongst themselves for scraps and make it impossible for regular working class people to gain any financial independence.

I'm advocating for extending financial independence and economic freedom to the world's poor, the actual poor.

You have to be willfully deluded to pretend the modern day Chinese and South Korea/Japan who are just China a few decads ahead are ""slaves"" and not pretend that their living standards for an average person didnt increase 13000% over the past 4 decades.

China is literally following the Singapore format of development. The average Chinese today lives in a dwelling of comparabl size to the Western European, earns a salary on par with the average Pole, has healthcare, access to fast high speed transport, has access to consumer goods, the internet and a life expectancy on par with the West. All of this from a country poorer than Zimbabwe and the Congo in the year 1980.

Sounds like you have a bit of a victim complex going on or are just using the usual neoliberal method of calling everything racist for political purposes. 



>agree with all of this, the unsustainable living standards of the Anglosphere (CANZUKUS)  and Western European (EU14+CH+NO) elite, who make up 6% of the global births as a world region together is not deserved and rests on a global financial system that systemically favors them via low cost of borrowing and resource control.

Well I personally think that the US has all the resources it needs for quite some time. We don't have to exploit anyone to be prosperous. That's why I want to limit any sort of foreign intervention as much as possible. 



>I'm advocating for extending financial independence and economic freedom to the world's poor, the actual poor.

Like I said before, poverty is relative and there are plenty of poor people here in the states that need that economic freedom and independence which they won't be able to get if competing with the rest of the world. I don't care about other countries enough to enrich them at the cost of the poor and working class here. We're the ones who build and maintain this country, it belongs to every American. 

Resources and the capacity for empathy is limited. You cannot extend those things to the entire world otherwise you'll have nothing left.



>It is honestly disgusting the disdain you and your fellow socialists have for the actual poor of the world. The ""poor"" and ""working class"" of America are a global minority that is neither poor nor working class. It comprises primarily of hedonists privileged by a military industrial and global financial complex that favors them at every turn.


Yeah, I don't care about the world, I care about the people here. As I said before, empathy is a limited resource. I don't care that you think people here are undeserving either. Every nation can do well for their own, it's not the west's responsibility to spread the wealth around when they can't even feed and house all of their own people.



>The rich in the US (the global giga rich) literally pay 95% of taxes, and you're right, those taxes shouldn't exist, I am a globalist.


I thought that globalist believed in a central world government. How does that government exist without taxes?  


Ultimately I don't think that you'll get a lot of people on board with your line of thinking unless they're well off in the first place. 

It is my strong belief that nations need to exist because the smaller the populace to be governed the more that government can represent their interests and the more that government can be held accountable to the people. That becomes much harder the larger and more powerful said government is. There's also the small thing of shared culture and values. There are places around the world where it's perfectly okay to beat your wife, FGM and honor killings are socially acceptable. I wouldn't want that culture coming into my country.


ETA: if the aim of your position is to enrich as many people as possible globally, wouldn't it also put limits on the upward mobility and prosperity of said people? Once they reach a certain threshold and quality of life where they're prosperous enough to outsource labor and industry to other nations, their own people would suffer the same as the lazy, undeserving westerners you're railing against. There will always be someone poorer willing to work for much less and in much worse conditions. You're only diluting the power of the working class, ensuring there is limited prosperity and enriching the 0.01% of capitalists who benefit from such systems the most. It sounds like the outcome would be even worse than a global communist system, as everyone would have something but not necessarily enough.",bladerunnerjulez,t2_1741bl,2,0,reddit1
