No, dork, my criticism of an *aesthetic* is not the same as using lame holy-shitballs Reddit language to insult a woman’s physical features. What does “meth-addicted frog” even mean? Between that and the Buscemi comment you’re just saying she has large eyes. 

If you want to make fun of Lightfoot’s *aesthetic* you can talk about her silly “I’m just your local hood lesbian” affinity for bad fits, dull color, and lack of hemming. And it’s a better insult because it’s something she actually has control over.

iwt5l0f,t3_yy755s,2022-11-18 03:46:21,stupidpol,"Let's start this with a story. Back in the 1960s IBM was the king of technology. They had monopolistic power over the computer world; everyone used their machines. They seemed unbeatable. That is, until 1964, when Control Data Corporation released the CDC 6600, arguably the world's first successful supercomputer. IBM was shocked they'd been dethroned. Their CEO wrote a letter to the employees, asking how, with their thousands of employees and vast resources, they'd been trumped by a company of three dozen engineers. When told of this, the founder of CDC supposedly responded, ""He's answered his own question.""

The point of this anecdote is to highlight that Elon's opinion of Twitter's employees is nothing new. It's a generation-old problem. So long as the money is flowing in and no competition exists, companies have no real need to engage and examine their own efficiency. The major tech companies today have near-monopolies on what they do and are continually producing record profits. As such, there is no desire to examine themselves and see what needs to be improved.

I hate to say it, but changes in technology have allowed lesser quality and frankly at times incredibly sloppy programming to sneak by. Hardware and bandwidth are no longer limitations for almost everything. Who cares about how efficiently you can program things when you can simply throw more server power at objects? Why bother making things perfect when the internet allows you to roll out patch after patch after patch? Even changes in development processes, replacing esoteric and hard to parse tasks with more natural languages, visual coding, and automated systems have all lowered the skill barriers to entry.

I've heard and seen this manifesting throughout the industry. Look at Meta's current disaster. With billions of dollars they've failed to implement legs for avatars, something that Second Life and VR Chat, with far fewer resources, have had functioning fine for over a decade. Numerous recent Triple A video game launches have been marred by basic problems, normally related to file size and performance issues, seemingly because no one working there is particularly good at the more technical tasks required. There are salacious rumors of numerous internal audits revealing terrible, sloppy practices, of the sort that [memes](https://i.imgur.com/RGLFim0.png) have been made about for years. 

There is no reason for me to doubt that this is exactly what's going on behind the scenes at Twitter. Everything I've heard has indicated that they had a massive amount of bloat, with too many employees getting paid obscene tech salaries to do almost nothing. I'm not going to shed a tear over people getting fired from any tech company; their products have been a disaster for the human race.",Noirradnod,t2_127hy4,188,0,reddit2

You buried the lede. This is the single most major issue in all of big tech. Big tech companies are more like mini empires than groups of people trying to build or achieve a common goal. They have their own politics, ways of interacting, hierarchies, social dynamics... It's insane. Layers upon layers of management detached from an actual thing being created into the world.

So what are most of us doing? We are extracting value from this bloat until we no longer can. That is the 70% who left. The ones who stayed are a mix of people scared of the state of the market (and they should be) but will still keep performing at the minimum under the radar as long as they can, and die hard people who somehow believe in the mission of Twitter, even though they did not come up with the idea and it isn't their dream. Founders vs followers.

It's very difficult to explain this to people who don't live in it, so I can forgive them for their ""haha Musk killed Twitter"" takes. You can't know how gross it all is unless you've swam in the filth for years.",robotzor,t2_rygry,141,0,reddit2
iwtjo97,t1_iwt5l0f,2022-11-18 06:05:35,stupidpol,">	I’ve heard and seen this manifesting throughout the industry. Look at Meta’s current disaster. With billions of dollars they’ve failed to implement legs for avatars, something that Second Life and VR Chat, with far fewer resources, have had functioning fine for over a decade. 

It’s somehow even worse than you’d think. (warning: niche interest rant ahead)

The much-maligned Quest Pro has a MiniLED screen panel that supports “local dimming” - a hardware feature that essentially allows an LCD panel to act like a faux-OLED display. It’s actually a pretty big deal for a VR headset and got keynote/press coverage etc. 

Local dimming is all handled in hardware by the DSP and just needs the software to say “hey, it’s dark here, less dark here, etc”. It’s obviously more complicated than that, but honestly not by much. 

Right now, this keynote feature is NOT enabled on the Quest Pro and Meta’s CTO is on record saying they may never get it working system wide because their shiny new $1500 headset is already so fucking overloaded that it doesn’t have the CPU cycles to spare on telling the screen which areas are dark. And for the same reason, the AR passthrough cameras only output at an extremely low resolution (literally can’t read large type text) because they can’t spare enough processing power to stitch up resolutions that amount to the average smartphone video from 5 years ago. 

It’s hilarious and makes me think John Carmack actually WAS running that whole motherfucker before he left Meta.

Edit: also, based on other headsets that have leaked or been announced recently, there’s a very good chance the Quest Pro is a tweaked reference design. So where the fuck did all that money go? Software side is obviously lol and the hardware side is just a fucking reference design with (admittedly baller) custom controllers?",trafficante,t2_h8rmv,58,0,reddit2

This is a bad example. The reason they ""failed"" to implement legs is because they were waiting until they figured out full body motion capture with just a headset. They've pretty much got it figured out now, which puts them far ahead of anyone else in the industry. VR Chat requires you to strap on a full body mocap suit to accomplish the same thing Meta is now doing with just a headset. 

I think people who only read reddit or news sites or whatever don't have a good handle on what's actually happening at these companies, where the money is actually going, and how much money it actually is when compared to their revenue. Meta has probably 3-4 billion total users across all of their platforms right now, or close to half the globe. A few billion is peanuts to them.

Most of the $44 billion purchase price was financed through loans against Twitter itself in a form of leveraged buyout. Twitter will be responsible for paying back the loans from banks and institutional investors that Musk used to finance the bulk of the deal, even though it was already drowning in debt and struggling to turn a profit.

While I agree many new engineers are nowhere near as knowledge of lower level shit as people had to be in the Past, this is just the result of the specialization of labor. Which is still a fact in the tech industry. As systems have scaled up entire new sectors of jobs have had to be created. We went from having a web master who would make websites and also put them on a server, to today having teams for both the back and frontend of a website and a team to put it on a server. Each sector is a lot more complex and often the tools used prioritize ease of use and speed over deep knowledge, and thus abstract away a lot of issues someone working at a lower level might have to deal with. Basically the field is just way too large and growing, it necessitates specialization, and if you’re never going to work at a certain level or with certain technology, why learn it?

If we ban TikTok, Instagram will just take its role domestically (their feature updates recently are basically just shoving in the TikTok experience). 

The issue with social media is it’s status more than the fact it exists. I’m with everyone here that believes we’d be better off without it, but I truly believe that is no longer an option.

Performing constrained physics simulations does indeed give better results than the commonly implemented inverse kinematics (IK) and it’s legitimately impressive that they’re pulling this off without trackers.

But accurate full body physics simulations that also interact appropriately with the virtual environment is obviously way too heavy a task for the XR2 series SoCs - particularly in a multiplayer environment like Horizon Worlds. 

It’s the sort of thing that we MIGHT see on PCVR within the next year or so but will require a dedicated physics coprocessor or something for standalone.

I can’t find the tweet right now, but one of the Meta VR guys even admitted that the most likely use will be a hugely scaled down version intended to accurately reflect the user’s body only to themselves so they can look down and not see IK jitter. Other players will just see canned animations designed to fit the virtual environment. Genuinely cool implementation, but not nearly what’s in the video.

Russia tried too hard to produce a tank with systems beyond anything in American/European/Chinese MBTs. They lacked the domestic manufacturing and financial resources to do so, so the result has been a program marred by setbacks and technical problems. It's a tank, it can do tanky stuff, but the advanced stuff like remote sensors, multispectral imaging sights, unmanned turret, and the new powerplant and transmission are not reliable individually. The marginal improvement in capacity it may offer is not worth the exponential cost increase. 

It's a common thing in Russian military procurement. They want to have weapons systems that are on par with or even more advanced than the United States, but don't have the resources to make this happen. Look at their respective 5th generation fighters. The F-35 first flew in 2006, has had 800+ made, and there are 2000 more planned in the next decade. The Su-57 first flew three years later, in 2009.

It's been a thing with him since at least the first Wing Commander, and it's why EA fired him after WC4. If you look back into making of stuff from the original wing commander, Star Citizen is the game he was trying to make back then until his boss told him he needed to ship something. And I'm talking about period making of stuff from the last century, long before Star Citizen. Dude just has an impossible dream game that he can't not try to make any time anyone gives him money. 

And Roberts invented the space combat sim, while Braben and Bell invented the space combat and trading Sim (or as I prefer to think of then, boring ass space trucker games). Every single wing commander game was on the absolute cutting edge, with the first few being as impressive in their own ways as the original Elite. 

And not to disparage their achievement, but the space trucker games that were clearly and directly inspired by Elite never stopped coming out, even in that long drought after about 2001 when Freespace 2  flopped and space combat sims just stopped happening entirely for over a decade, with really the only high profile one in the last 20 years being Star Wars: Squadrons, which was almost definitely prompted by Star Citizen and managed to come out before even the alpha of Squadron 42, the pure space combat side of Roberts' bloated mess.

Platforms make their bread from advertising. Thus they’re incentivized to help form more tightly cohesive groups. Marketing also works much better when it’s targeted than when it’s general (although some recent studies seem to deny this claim and the effectiveness of marketing. It’s an interesting subject). Unfortunately given our psychologies, it is the more extreme and often dark things that inspire deep emotional reactions in us, the type needed for high engagement. 

Back when we were on MySpace and early Facebook, the process had begun, but given it was so new there was neither as much conscious intent nor the time to develop such group think areas. People were still approaching the World Wide Web from a position of cosmopolitanism. Where today we understand the web is global but go to *our* places, wher we’re with *our* people, etc. 

Advertisers were eager to be able to reach millions of different demographics. As this played out The apps started keeping data which advertisers were eager to see. They used this data to make new ads and well targeted shit gives a higher return than general shit.

Oh man I remember this and you're seriously underselling how retarded the whole thing was.


tl;dr There was a massive content drought and players were worried about the future of the game.

They fucked up the plot of the season (genuinely fuckawful writing)  following the last expansion and player numbers were on the decline with no new expansion announcenemt in sight and less and less content with each release.

Then all of a sudden anet announces that they will be making an announcement in a hall (Yes they announced an announcement), which is a big deal, because normally they don't rent halls, they've only ever rented halls before during the very first expansion and never since, subsequent expansions were teased at the end of seasons with livestreams) so people thought something big was coming.

So the day finally comes, and during the presentation in the hall they announce:

* No new expansion. 

* Hot topic tshirts.


Fucking died laughing that day, they rented a hall to announce that they won't be releasing an expansion and that their merchandise now included hot topic tshirts.

Content releases past that point go so bad that they announced the new expansion in a blogpost to try and salvage whatever players hadn't already done the smart thing.",Redditossa,t2_bnootwc8,4,0,reddit3

When I see your statistic: 64% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, my initial thought is ""Jesus it's just getting worse out there"". But my second thought is about all the people I've known over the years that couldn't control their spending. Especially those I got to know while I was doing maintenance for a small property management company. A lot of people would struggle to pay rent, but about 50% of them had insane spending habits. $60k trucks, 5 TVs in a 2 bedroom house, ATVs and boats, etc. One of them I got to know well was a plumber making around $100k per year. At one point he was 6 months behind on rent. He knew I didn't care about rent so he would always show me his new unnecessary tools and toys that he bought, even while not being able to pay his bills. Technically, he was living paycheck to paycheck, right? And it makes me wonder if the others with poor spending habits would also continue to live paycheck to paycheck, even if they doubled their salary/wages. 

It just makes me think that this number may be inflated by those types, and if so, I'm curious how much. Obviously it's an issue in this country, but the approach is very different from people who simply don't make enough money.",cassius_claymore,t2_ebjie,17,0,reddit3

>As the Act is structured, to receive benefits an individual must be “unemployed” and “eligible,” as well as not otherwise statutorily excepted or disqualified.  An unemployed individual’s eligibility to receive benefits for a benefit period hinges on satisfaction of several statutory requirements, including being able to work; being available for work; and actively searching for work.  Tex. Lab. Code § 207.021(a) (3)–(5).

Maybe if you ""search for work"" while technically employed you can get the benefits. Though, I can't imagine that a woman who is just a couple weeks out of either a vaginal or cesarean birth would be ""able"" to work, and ""just apply and fail job interviews for 12 weeks"" seems like both fraud and a huge pain in the ass regardless.

There's an interesting bit of internet drama that encapsulates Jim's slide into hysterics about a game developer's political opinions quite well.

Back when that game series Five Nights at Freddy's got popular due to viral internet videos, he made a video about how he respected the man who made them, Scott Cawthon. Cawthon had made the first one in response to people making fun of various children's games he made which had a similar uncanny style because well, he's not great at making 3d characters look genuinely cute. Jim and several other youtubers had done some videos that made fun of the style in those older games for being creepy, uncanny, but Cawthon took that mockery of his creations as ""horrifying"" and decided to lean into it and made FNAF, using the uncanny style of his for deliberate horror effect. Jim Sterling, and all his videos mocking the older games is in fact, arguably part way responsible for that inspiration that led Cawthon to create a successful game franchise.

Jim had apparently spoken to him and they were on good terms, and it had always been preciously known that Cawthon was a rather devout born-again Christian. Many of his games prior to FNAF were explicitly christian children's games. So Jim was fine with him then, and clearly knew his hardline religious affiliation

Years down the line, it came out that shocker: Scott Cawthon is a Republican! Que the entire fanbase getting mad at him, doxing his family, and generally loosing their minds at a fact that should have been obvious to anyone from the get-go. Inevitably, Jim goes and makes a self-aggrandizing hit-piece video on Cawthon, completely ignoring their history, and the fact that he had no problem with the man in the past, and surely could have extrapolated that he had more conservative political opinions, given his religious affiliation.

Being motivated by love to do your job will cause you to burn out and feel betrayed do corporations don't want to emphasize that route too much.

Being motivated by duty works for jobs that are seen as noble/self sacrificing for the greater good of society, but they don't need to pay you well if you think your job is your inherent responsibility.

Being motivated by money is how you are supposed to view your job. You do the job to get paid, you are more interested in getting paid more to do more work 

Being motivated by ego is the stupidest and easiest way to be manipulated. They don't have to pay you well, just give you head pats while giving you more work and then don't share increased profits with you.

ine1a8t,t1_ind6ou8,2022-09-07 00:54:41,stupidpol,"At this small scale there is overlap. If you still perform some productive labor while also owning the commercial property and hiring labor, you'd be petit bourgeois. But to complicate it further, if you're in debt or paying taxes to basically finance monopoly capital, you're also in a sense proletarianized because you're being exploited in a similar since to a wage worker.

> Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consumes the labour-power he has purchased of him. [4]

> If the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself, he robs the capitalist. 

> The capitalist then takes his stand on the law of the exchange of commodities. He, like all other buyers, seeks to get the greatest possible benefit out of the use-value of his commodity. Suddenly the voice of the labourer, which had been stifled in the storm and stress of the process of production, rises:

> The commodity that I have sold to you differs from the crowd of other commodities, in that its use creates value, and a value greater than its own. That is why you bought it. That which on your side appears a spontaneous expansion of capital, is on mine extra expenditure of labour-power. You and I know on the market only one law, that of the exchange of commodities. And the consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts with it, but to the buyer, who acquires it. To you, therefore, belongs the use of my daily labour-power. But by means of the price that you pay for it each day, I must be able to reproduce it daily, and to sell it again. Apart from natural exhaustion through age, &c., I must be able on the morrow to work with the same normal amount of force, health and freshness as to-day. You preach to me constantly the gospel of “saving” and “abstinence.” Good! I will, like a sensible saving owner, husband my sole wealth, labour-power, and abstain from all foolish waste of it. I will each day spend, set in motion, put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration, and healthy development. By an unlimited extension of the working-day, you may in one day use up a quantity of labour-power greater than I can restore in three. What you gain in labour I lose in substance. The use of my labour-power and the spoliation of it are quite different things. If the average time that (doing a reasonable amount of work) an average labourer can live, is 30 years, the value of my labour-power, which you pay me from day to day is 1/(365×30) or 1/10950 of its total value. But if you consume it in 10 years, you pay me daily 1/10950 instead of 1/3650 of its total value, i.e., only 1/3 of its daily value, and you rob me, therefore, every day of 2/3 of the value of my commodity. You pay me for one day’s labour-power, whilst you use that of 3 days. That is against our contract and the law of exchanges. I demand, therefore, a working-day of normal length, and I demand it without any appeal to your heart, for in money matters sentiment is out of place. You may be a model citizen, perhaps a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and in the odour of sanctity to boot; but the thing that you represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast. That which seems to throb there is my own heart-beating. I demand the normal working-day because I, like every other seller, demand the value of my commodity. 

> We see then, that, apart from extremely elastic bounds, the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working-day, no limit to surplus-labour. The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working-day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working-days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working-day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides. Hence is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working-day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and collective labour, i.e., the working-class.

The Northern Pacific was the last, last leg of the Great Migration: San Francisco, Portland, Seattle all had very small Black populations until the 1930s, then saw large numbers of Black workers during WWII, and by the 1960s the mass migrations out of the South (both Black and White) had slowed. There just wasn't a large Black population that settled from 1940s to the 1960s in a relatively small, relatively isolated industrial port city. The idea that it was racism that prevented and still prevents Black Americans from settling in larger numbers (again, Portland has the same proportion of Black residents as the City of LA) has become so foundational to Portland's political and social identity.   


Based on research done and oral histories of the Great Migration, the prevalence and/or perceived prevalence of racism in a given area did have impacts on where people decided to settle and can still play a role on a micro-level, as well as retiscence to settle in areas without a well-established Black community, but I find it hard to believe that virulent racism determined how many people decided to take up jobs during World War II or the 1950s, or that racism continues to put people off from moving to the city where they otherwise would to the point that racism past and present explains the comparatively small proportion of Black residents in Portland (which again, is the same as Los Angeles).",abd1a,t2_8phjuarq,2,0,reddit4

Marxists have always acknowledged the dynamism of capitalism. There's a reason China allows a market and private businesses. The problem with capitalism is it goes from being revolutionary to being reactionary. It reaches a point where it ceases to innovate, to provide people more freedom compared to feudalism and monarchy, and it starts to decay while taking everything else down with it. That's where we are at now in the West

At the same time capitalism is inherently socialistic. It is built on the most socialized labor and technological base ever. It requires a big central state to regulate it and offset it's destruction of traditional social relations with state programs. It creates within it socialism. 

The problem tho is socialist revolutions so far have only happened in poor countries with almost no technological base for it (as opposed to well developed countries), so they cram both a political revolution and industrial revolution into the same process. It's like if the American Revolution, Civil War, and industrial revolution happened in 5 years instead of over a century+.

You're asking big questions, and part of making progress in discussions like this is wrestling with the difference in the Marxist worldview from other ones, and with the legacy of irl socialism. The verbosity of Marxists comes from trying to explain things thoroughly enough so you avoid just memeing at people.

Marxism is not a set of moral percepts or something, it's not a set of dogmas on how a society should be run. It's a method of analysis. It's supposed to give us the ability to assess our situation and make sensible decisions on how to reach a higher stage of social organization. So far it's mostly helped people in very poor countries become much less poor much more quickly than liberalism has. Few modem states use anything but economic planning, these days.

You can find advice on how Communists should act, from the low level cadre of a local club or militia which is carried all the way up to a chairman or president. Things like virtue, hard work, culture, discipline, education matter to us, and we think Communists should embody the best our specific culture, our class, and our common human inheritance. You can find advice on struggling against corruption, bureaucracy, and losing touch with regular people. The degeneracy of the Western left is especially egregious when you look at what the Left was historically and still is in foreign countries.

Marx thought America was unique and could have a democratic revolution because it didn't have a militarized bureaucracy. Lenin lamented that America became like Europe for developing one.

A lot of the advices is just common sense, and the strategies Communists use to get and maintain power are universally applicable. Vanguard theory, dual power, mass line, etc. 

But it's not enough to say and even practice these things, because being aware of circumstances does not make heterogeneous movements capable of mastering them or perfectly isolating all delusional and cynical people.

Peasants were constantly rebelling, but feudalism always reasserted itself because their mode of production didn't change. It took developments in technology to destroy feudal social relations. 

Socialist revolutions have so far not overcome the technology of capitalism, they've usually had to implement that technology just to get over their own semi feudal conditions. We're at a historical horizon where the elements of socialism are taken as a given all over the place, from central planning to socialized labor, but we're still stuck with the bureaucratic and centralized production of the technology capitalism developed. This means socialist states are fighting the same tendency of the state to become ever more alienated from the people that has been part of historical cycles sense the state arose.

Edit: if by pro capitalist you mean ""pro growth, risk, entrepreneurship, and ownership,"" I think those will be the basis of American socialism. It's in our nature, as much as personal freedom is.

There is a goal: a stateless, classless society, where the free development of each is the precondition for the free development of all. This is hypothesized to come from an advanced technological society that has eliminated scarcity, and by doing that the main motivation for violent conflict requiring a big militarized bureaucratic state. This is also assumed to be a global event.

This is based on the observation that modern industrial economies are already social, they already require global supply chains, they require economic planning, and they already produce more than the market can really allocate.

Here's what's important to understand Marx

There were millions of people who hated losing their land to agricultural monopolies, who hated working 12+ hour days 6-7 days a week, with no overtime or social security and disability benefits in conditions that routinely injured them and made them sick.

The response to that was incredibly diverse. The modern socialist movement doesn't start with Marx. It starts with Christian peasants and workers and progressive business owners trying to set up alternatives to capitalism. They failed to be sustainable. Marx wanted to find out how capitalism actually worked, how history developed, in order to give people the knowledge required to steer history conscientiously and scientifically.

You can be pro capitalist and support labor movements, but that gets complex, for reason Marx and other socialists explain. There's an inherently incompatible set of interests in any given economy between different economic classes, and that flairs up into conflict. When labor movements improve the lives of workers, it comes at the expense of capital.

According to the economist Michael Hudson, who worked for Chase Bank during the Cold war, everyone is a Marxist now. Objections to Marx's observations on how capitalism works are ideological or propaganda. Behind closed doors, the people who run the show know that real value is created by labor, that there's a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that is why they push austerity and outsourcing to offset those things.

I would actually recommend you start with Michael Hudson. Marx is a philosopher and a lot of his work is about how to think and analyze stuff. It's good and not as hard as you think. Stalin, Lenin, Mao, and Engels are very easy to read also and explain Marxist analysis. Hudson is working right now and applies Marxist and other classical economic thinking.

These people are so goddamn stupid. There are no voluntary communists seeking to immigrate to the US and there never have been because all communist nation's have historically simply become totalitarian. 

These fools think foreign communist wokesters are trying to immigrate in. No, they're in France sipping coffee. They have no desire to do so. 

They think everyone is just like they are. Please someone tell me to calm the fuck down.

f6xq55z,t3_dth9dz,2019-11-08 23:24:08,stupidpol,"do people still believe that shit of ""you will make less money doing the same job if you are a GIRL""

its complete bullshit, its not 1955 anymore. Capitalism doesn't do that reactionary NO BROADS EXCEPT FOR IN THE KITCHEN type of shit because its a death sentence, you can't raise a family on a proletariat salary and they will fucking starve if both spouses don't work . 

if anything its more profitable to pay your male workers less than girls nowadays so you can blast that diversity business masturbation in your own brain and to people who are taking a look at your company. Believe it or not literally no one thinks women shouldn't have jobs. And rich owners/c-suite executives aren't the type of people you argue with on /pol/, they are rich centrist liberals who would agree with literally every single thing hillary clinton says. 

Based on where i've worked office jobs in florida, white collars and the managerial class are nearly  ALL women nowadays (not as often ceo's though for some reason, but SOON we will have more women billionaires! 👏). I remember working part time as a marketing and sales specialist at a payrollSoftware company and 75% of the office was girls, the managers were girls, literally the only men there besides the cfo and ceo, were indian programmers who got revolving door fired on the regular. If you walked into my old workplace for the first time not knowing what it was and someone just happened to scan you in you would literally think it has a policy of mandatory segregation because all the programmers/testing/development had to sit on the left (like 40 indian males and 1 girl who is indian) and then sales and marketing and accounting was on the right (like 50 girls and 4 dudes) 

and to top it off my 26 year old marketing boss was the biggest asshole sociopath exploitative scum of a human being i've ever met on planet earth, and she was a complete ""2016 election resistance!/idpol millionaire feminist"" caricature. i never pissed her off or had problems with her but based on how she would talk to people and literally scream over the most inconsequential shit as if she relished in the power to fire people in her age group was so telling. meanwhile she did nothing all day but go to starbucks and checking ""the company facebook"" making the marketing part timers and paid interns do literally everything databasey that actually had to be done. she makes 160 thousand dollars a year to sit on her ass and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but hold a weekly meeting where she asks everyone what they are working on and yells at them for no reason. The most work i've ever seen this self described feminist do was say ""we should send our clients \*monthly holiday\* cards. which was ONCE A MONTH. and she got the job because the gay german chief executive officer was ""dads friend"".  (a common theme among the white collar petit-bourgouise, they have better jobs than you because most likely their class connections/nepotism/age. it has nothing to do with how hard they had to work to get there because they didn't college is easy as fuck when your parents give you a full ride and when your major is ""business"" or ""hospitality"" which they all do).

well I mean as a systematic issue, this is sort of true ... work itself isn't racist, but the issues that minorities and women come across in the workplace might be subtle indicators of underlying issues, right? even just getting hired ...

I'm curious about the 'sex work' context of the rest of this convo though o.o ... a lot of women actually DO engage in sex work in a way that is positive, and preferable to the typical grind of some low income shit job. not saying everyone, not saying that financial trade offs should be the motive for people to get into this kind of work, but I'm seeing comments that seem to think it's equivalent to sex trafficking and all that business, and it's really a rather more nuanced situation.",czerwona-wrona,t2_z65vn,-6,0,reddit1

Literally every reason is to do with lack of healthcare and social support services. Nothing points to anything inherently wrong with sex work that somehow makes it qualitatively different to other forms of work under capitalism.

>“Most women”?? Come On dude. You seriously think there is a large majority of women who would willingly put their life at risk every single night, run the risk of being raped or contracting incurable diseases, run the risk of legal fines or jail time, over working at McDonald’s?

I live in a country where sex work is legal so there is no risk of fines or jail time. The risk of harm is very low as they are protected by the same regulations that protect all other legal employees. The industry is heavily regulated to the point where you're more likely to contract an STD from having sex with an the average woman than you are from having sex with a prostitute as they're required to be tested every month to keep their licenses.

It’s weird, you can get heckled in my city for wearing both BLM and MAGA in some areas, but at work it’s quite different. Most of my colleagues are mid twenties to early thirties, or about to retire in the next 5 years. There’s really no outliers, and they just dgaf. 

I work with blue collar, middle class, men that have been working the industry for at least a decade and a half and they are all almost unanimously conservative. One or two rads like larping as centrists during break actively talk about Rittenhouse, 2A, trans rights, in a mild manner but with alt right undertones, but most literally distance themselves as far away from human beings as possible lmao.

I’m definitely not going to see the same effect here as say, the hiring manager at a tech company, or really anywhere with an HR department featuring more than a single person. 

I’m leaving this industry soon however and I know what I’m in for…

What I’m wondering is how is it best to act? I don’t think it’s right just cowing myself, I want to work to make my workplace experience free of  distractions besides the work at hand.

 >In the Abilene paradox, a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of many or all of the individuals in the group. It involves a common breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group's and, therefore, does not raise objections. A common phrase relating to the Abilene paradox is a desire to not ""rock the boat"". This differs from groupthink in that the Abilene paradox is characterized by an inability to manage agreement.

I wish we could still keep climate change front and center WHILE fostering more diversity, not kick out all the one-note climate-change-autists.  Now some of the one-note climate-change-autists are no fun, but for some issues that's what it takes!  Also there's a theory, and this seems to dovetail with my experience--that some extreme nature lovers got that way because they've experienced abuse and find nature healing and may find people threatening.  I'm not saying that's wrong-that may be what it takes for someone to devote their lives to working on climate change.  I feel that some of the one-note climate-change autists who may be socially awkward to the point of not saying the right things to show they are on board with the woke-scolds, got that way (can't read the room) because they may have been victims and oppressed in their youth!  and retreated into Nature.

It’s a liaison between public interest groups, congress, and the White House, not some role that ultimately dictates climate policy for the country.

Corbyn's Labour in 2017 is the closest the left ever got to realising the kind of rural-metropolitan coalition you're talking about. I've always thought that down the line that 2017 election will be regarded as one of the pivotal moments in European, if not world politics, of the 2010s.

But they didn't finish up with 40% of the vote by bashing immigrants, or cowtowing to establishment talking points, they did so by presenting a clear alternative to the Tories. And i think the reason they didn't win in the end, or even build on what they'd accomplished, was because they never articulated a clear vision of a Leftist Brexit - which isn't about dirty foreigners but dirty bankers.

And it wasn't Corbyn who failed in this way, it was the right-wing of the Labour Party, liberals who waged a ruthless campaign of liberal idpol and personal defamation to protect their own class interests and suppress the popular will. Again the problem is a lack of institutions to authentically articulate the wishes of working people - Corbyn had no way to respond to the daily smears of the Telegraph, the BBC, the Guardian. We saw what happened when he was allowed to articulate that vision in the run up to the 2017 election when the media were legally mandated to present balanced political coverage - 20% gain in polls in the space of 2 weeks.

A significant amount of Indian students and their parents unashamedly bring this prejudicial baggage with them into the context of school.

I remember when an Indian student of a “lower caste” background was successful in attaining a student leadership position, the amount of abuse he received online from other Indian students of a different background was insane. 

I’ve also noticed an interesting trend in that, more than any of the major groups represented in the school, Indian background students and their parents have been the most sensitive/hypersensitive to anything that could perceived as racial prejudice against them, whilst also being the most likely to be involved in incidents where they’re the ones expressing openly racist sentiments.

Even more interesting is that some of  the students/parents who’ve been so active in citing quasi-woke reasoning to accuse other students or staff of racism have also been exactly the same students/parents involved in racist incidents as the aggressors.

The most recent involved a group of Indian students who had been harassing the small population of African students at the school, taking opportunities to call them “N_ggers”, “Apes”, “Gorillas” whenever possible at school and even moreso on social media.

I’ve never in my entire career encountered students using that term in that fashion in such an unashamed way.

I used to manage a small group of sales employees who technically worked underneath me. We had this one guy straight from India who would put down the other employees whenever I was on the conference call. Whenever another employee would bring up a good idea, he’d chime in and try to take credit for it by saying that he had discussed this idea with them earlier. 

I told him to knock it off and that he’s not above them, and he tried to explain that he actually was. Idk what he meant by that, so I just told him that he’s leaving a bad impression on me, then he stopped immediately. 

The weird thing is, I had no direct say over the trajectory of this guy’s career. I couldn’t fire or promote him, but he still had this weird competitive respect for me but disrespect towards everyone else. 

I talked to my higher up about this, and he said that about half the time when they bring in someone from India, they initially act weird like this.

Parents taught me that stereotypes are bad, and that it's wrong to judge someone by their ethnicity.  After two bad experiences though, I’m going to think twice about taking another job with an Indian boss.

It’s not even “fresh” emigrés either.  Some are long-removed from India, but still stubbornly hold onto the dynamics of the caste system.

My current boss was born and raised in India, but has been in the US for \~20 years.  He’s mid-level management, reporting to a VP.  His behavior sometimes comes off as bizarre, and he clings to some management practices that seem to fail him time and again.  However, his actions all make sense when looking through the lens of the caste system.

&#x200B;

>If you're in a superior position to them, expect deference and a weird sort of doting.

Probably the most galling is when the VP above him asks for anything, the message is passed down to us as if the task is the most crucial thing in the entire company.  If the message comes from one of the higher-level VPs, the task is treated as the most important thing in the galaxy.  There is never an option for push-back, or even gently suggesting that a different path may be better.  It has been asked for by someone up above, so therefore it must be done exactly as requested, no question.

&#x200B;

>If they feel they're in a position of superiority over you, you'll be micromanaged and treated with no small amount of derision.

As his direct reports, it became clear early on that our opinions didn’t matter.  On any issue.  He was nice enough to solicit our thoughts, after which he would unceremoniously disregard and ignore them.  No harm, no foul, most in the group just quit giving feedback, and continued on their normal path.

More interesting though is when he’d reach out to other organizations, and direct them what to do.  He always seemed surprised when his direction wouldn't be followed, and why other Directors would be upset at him for trying to tell their people what to do.  After all, he is a Director, right?  All of the individual-contributors in the company should follow his every whim.  Who cares if they don’t fall under him in the org chart?

I fucking hate it all.  Even worse is that he’s not a bad guy.  For the few brief moments I’ve gotten him away from the office with a beer in hand, he’s a normal, reasonable person.  He’s intelligent, and has a good work ethic.

But when he steps into the office, it’s like a light switch is flipped, and everyone in the entire company is racked-and-stacked via the caste system in his head, and treated accordingly.

For sure, there are shitty bosses of every ethnicity.  But after two similar experiences in two wildly different companies (one a startup, one a Fortune 100), I’m going to be very careful about not signing up to be a “lower member” in someone’s made-up caste system again.",roger_roger_32,t2_2w4gvfml,156,0,reddit1

Cultures are not remotely equal in their outcomes, most have fundamentally incompatible values, and some (at least some their practises or attitudes) create far more harm or unfavourable outcomes than others (both for people in and for people outside the culture). Immigrants have a responsibility to their adopted countries just as much as native born do to immigrants. At the very least, immigrants must adopt the values of their Host society, especially in the instances where they contradict with their own cultural/religious ones. 

Where immigrants have no responsibility to their host countries and are allowed to keep their own cultural practises and indentities unfettered, to self-segregate and feel ungrateful for the opportunities they’ve been given, you get the disaster of Muslim immigration thats unfolding in Western Europe especially France (not just the insular communities, the terrorism, and the crime, but also the far-right xenophobic backlash).",preciousgaffer,t2_13hg31,41,0,reddit1

I've had a lot of class mates from India (as in born in india) - all the women except one whom I'm close friends with are/were hardcore wokesters. They'd whine about white supremacy, colonialism, toxic masculinity, whiteness, they'd act like they knew all about the struggles of inner city blacks despite never having lived in the US etc. whenever possible and they'd always take a weird mixture of ""I'm a strong brown woman"" and a ""victim"" at the same time. They all generally grew up in upper class environments in my experience a lot lived in Dubai (or UAE in general) - a city built off the back of literal slave labour, ruled by despotic oligarchic theocratic absolute monarchs, a place where women who are raped can be thrown in jail for ""adultery"" etc. They spent their whole lives with servants cooking them all their meals, attended private schools with rich kids, had private fucking drivers, never made their own bed before 18 years old (if that), they got whatever Gucci Vuitton shit they wanted from daddy etc. But of course none of that matters because they happen to be brown - they'll act like they struggled their whole lives when they had a fucking golden spoon since the day they were born. Furthermore they all held or do hold a ""chip on their shoulder"" that the whole world somehow owes them something. 

The thing I find most annoying is that for supposedly believing that ""white people ruin everything"" or ""all the world's problems are because of white colonial supremacy"" they voluntarily move to societies which are predominantly white. They want all the benefits of living in a continental European country for example but at the same time act all repulsed about it being ""too white"". I'm an international student in Europe so I'm with other international students - I find it incredibly annoying to be around these sorts of people. If you absolutely hate white people so much no one is stopping you from doing your degree in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, UAE etc. All those places are non white. They just want to hold a ""victim"" position.

They also always seemed to only date white men despite hating ""whiteness"" or what not as well which I always found hypocritical. At least racist skinheads are honest in following what they say or believe generally in regards to relationships.",Uskoreniye1985,t2_51m7lplg,57,0,reddit1

However i think its more complex than immigrants being ""allowed to keep their own cultural practises"". At least from my country (Germany) I know that many first wave immigrants (be it turkish ""guestworkers"" or contemporary refugees) are much more open and progressive in their first generations or, in the case of refugees, years of arrival. In the particular case of turkish workers, them being treated much worse than the average german worker economically and the societal climate (for reference: you could still find SS cadre pictures in many bars of less urban cities in the 70ties) drove many into insulation. Only with the possibility of (political) participation and economic equality this improved. And yes of course there are many more factors, for example wahabi or turkish nationalistic organizations being able to stock mosques without the states control, but these are fringe problems compared to the economic and societal core of what integration from both sides entails. 

Also, I dont think you explicitly said it, but its kinda sus to frame it like ungratefull immigrants are responsible for right wing backlash. At least in europe we always had right wing terrorism and extremism, and most terror attacks are not correlated with any ""misbehaving"" of migrants (in my country for example the Oktoberfest Bombing, Rostock-Lichtenhagen, the national-socialist underground (NSU)).",UnrelatedEvent,t2_433ce8pi,2,0,reddit1

hmqt4l5,t1_hmqp2ll,2021-12-01 02:18:03,stupidpol,"Right-wing and anti-immigration views covers a very broad spectrum (just like left-wing beliefs do). The neo-nazi types certainly do want genocide, some want forced remigration, some want to stop any further immigration, some want slower more controlled migration, some just want to better assimilation of immigrants, and there are other positions as well. There are also different reasons for being anti-migration (there are some \[flawed\] leftist arguments too). My comment wasn't about immigration - it was about multiculturalism and cultural assimilation.

An anti-idpol position would recognise national (and civilisational) identities are just another stupid and arbitrary idpol. What I care about is harm reduction and prevention, and some cultures (or some of the practises, attitudes, beliefs therein) cause more harm than others. I don't care what the people in my society look like or identify as as long as we agree on the same fundamental values (and can communicate in the same language). If the practitioners of these cultures want to come to my country or any other (where i think the \[existing\] culture/institutions/values, while no where near perfect, produces less harm), I think they should have to assimilate to \[at least those specific\] societal/cultural values (I don't care if they have a different religion, or different cuisine, different dress, different music and art, different hobbies or recreation, different sport, or speak a different language amongst themselves).",preciousgaffer,t2_13hg31,17,0,reddit1
hnhcy7z,t1_hms41zg,2021-12-06 17:29:19,stupidpol,"As I said, host countries have responsibilities towards immigrants (creating tolerance, inclusion, and opportunities) and immigrants have responsibilities towards their host countries (integrating, being productive members of society, adopting their host countries values, and eliminating harmful lingering cultural aspects in their communities). America (minorities less so), Canada and Australia have, for the most part, seemed to do a good job of balancing these responsibilities (although increasingly less so). Western Europe has been a disaster, and I'd argue its been less so the failure of responsibilities of the host countries \[with obvious lingering right-wing/conservative elements\], than the complete lack or failure of responsibility demonstrated by many, if not most immigrants, particularly recent ones and second generationers). And to a significant extent (as well as capitalism creating inequality, and the racism of conservatives/reactionaries) left-wing/liberal identity politics has been to blame - the accommodation of immigrants has gone ""too far"": they face no pressure to integrate into the societies of their host countries and are held to a lower moral standard - infantilised so that they have no agency or responsibility over their own actions, and are not held accountable for them (specifically when their bad actions were provoked by their religious/cultural identites - e.g. extremist terrorism, honour killings, that are the responsibility of the entire community to weed out, instead it frequently proliferates), and treating them as perpetual victims who have to be coddled and any criticism of their communities or identities dismissed as xenophobic or racist). If you think entire communities shouldn't be held accountable for the actions of individual members, then I say, ok, lets apply that standard equally: white people shouldn't be held accountable for racist white people or crimes against minorities in their societies (I think communities should be held accountable, white or otherwise: for the members their societies and cultures produce, and if their society and culture keeps producing anti-social/right-wing/tribalistic members that's on that society to self-examine and reform itself - i think the white West has, unilaterally unfortunately, been doing a good job of this over the last few decades - racism is by white people is still socially condemned, less so when non-white people do it, and its arguably led to the tribalistic, hold-non-white-people-to-a-lower-standard identity politics we'e inundated with now). It comes as a shock to many insulated western leftists, but (outside of economic issues or foreign policy directed at their countries of origin) the vast majority of non-western people, and thus immigrants to Western countries, are incredibly conservative, tribalistic, and right-wing, and significantly more so than most modern westerners (of course there is significant variation both within and between societies and various reasons for them being so that doesn't essentialising people to their identities). They might vote for center-left and left-wing parties in the West, but that's because of the bigotry and native/white/christian identitarianism of Western conservatives (on most social issues they have far more in common). Identity politics has led to tribalistic loyalties to ones identities exclusively, and see power as the gage of the moral actions in one society (where black people can't be racists, muslims can't be dangerous extremists, etc). In identity politics, people can only have loyalty to their identity, not to the larger society they are part of (as we see the increasingly larger numbers of immigrants and minorities who refuse to integrate, disrespect their host societies, and self-segregate). Empathy and tolerance can't extend to people who are not acting in good faith, who are themselves harmful and intolerant, they'll always pray on it and take more and more with no intent to change the ways that are in their own self-interest (i'd use someone like Muhammad Hijab as a prime example of this). Sometimes, tough love produces better and more stable long-term outcomes. If the left (even liberal/centrists) don't try to do it, the right will come in far more brutal and with far less discretion or care.

&#x200B;

The rise (or if you want to call it resurgence) of the far-right across Western Europe in the 21st century has been directly in response to mass immigration and the resulting social tensions of failed integration. Most poignantly during the migrant crisis and the wave of terror attacks across Europe starting in 2015. The far-right will always exist and they'll always hate difference (they're by definition identitarians) but they've become much more popular in the last decade (amongst mainstream conservatives and even centrists/a-political people who have been radicalised by the situation) and anti-immigration has been at the fore-front of their platforms (look most visibly in France with Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour). They wouldn't have become as popular as they have if they're haven't been signifiant problems that certain immigrants are at least significantly responsible for. Very rarely in our modern society does bigotry exist (certainly not as prevalent as it has become) unilaterally or without some reason (European attitudes to Roma should be most evident) - it doesn't mean it justifies it. But the interaction between groups, even those with different levels of power, is never that of some hateful oppressor and some innocent victim group. There's a reason they significantly and most furiously rally against muslim, MENA, and African immigrants, not East Asian or Sikh or Hindu ones. It is an undeniable fact at this point that immigrants and refugees have much higher crime rates (and in Europe's case particularly sexual assault and gang crime) than the native population (and amongst a whole host of reasons, culture is absolutely a major one - and i'm not just talking about the culture of their birth countries but of the ""immigrant/minority"" cultural identities they have since developed as immigrants). e.g. People from much more misogynistic and patriarchal cultures, when still allowed to freely practise that misogynistic culture, with no attempt to socialising them to the more gender-equal attitudes of their new country, are going to exhibit those misogynistic attitudes and cultural practises (especially when unaccustomed or unintroduced to the more ""liberal"" freedoms and dress codes of western women - which they may misinterpret as slutty and inviting).

&#x200B;

Take your country Germany, which has a large problem (not a society-ending or destabilising problem yet, but it will only get bigger as these issue persists) with Turkish ultranationalism (people who while, living in Germany and enjoying all the fruits of that society, clearly feel no loyalty or responsibility to it and have no intention to integrate into German values). Two-Thirds of Turkish expat votes in Germany went to Erdogan - a nationalist, islamist anti-democratic, anti-secular demagogue. These people (to clarify the Turks who don't integrate and are nationalists, not all Turkish immigrants) are profoundly far-right, tribalistic people and they'll will prey on Germany's ""empathy"" and ""kindness"" until they turn Germany into what they left. They should be treated like white, christian far-right people, and if they're not citizens, deported for public safety (same with Islamic fundamentalists, or any other far-right immigrant groups).  Or the problem with many Syrian refugees (letting in in-one-go millions of people of a different religion and culture, and making no long-term plan to integrate them into your society and culture is going to create a whole host of problems we have seen - not the least fuelling the prolongation of the migrant crisis, people smugglers, and Mediterranean drownings) who absolutely have higher crime rates, including rape, than native Germans). Refugees especially have a responsibility and a debt of gratitude to their host countries for being taken in. France, Sweden, and Belgium have a similar problem, even bigger with Muslims, North Africans and Black Africans. These are real problems that can't simply dismissed. People, no matter their race or religion or ethnicity or nationality or any other identity, need to be held accountable for their actions, and everyone has the humanity and agency to be held to the same standard and scrutiny (people very quickly recognise hypocrisy and become fed up with it and reactionary to its proponents).",preciousgaffer,t2_13hg31,1,0,reddit1

As in the problem is isolated and removed, not used as an excuse to Other a whole group or fight stupid fights. For example, with an American, you don't attack his love of burgers or rock music, you focus on the actual problem, the hyper individualist culture that disintegrates all community and harms themselves and the rest of the world. Sure, relations between labor and capital affect culture, but whether people are willing to fight and preserve a new system is also dependent on culture, especially when it requires self sacrifice for the common good.",JCMoreno05,t2_14xsjg,12,0,reddit1

Hell, I use think that way for a bit. Any attempts to ban or limit harmful cultural practises (either amonst immigrants) or in their own countries is ""western imperialism"". Many really do believe in cultural relativism, that you can't judge these practises (whether its terrorism, or fgm, or wife beating, or homophobia, even if they recognise the acts themselves are bad) because its part of their culture, and these people must be cuddled and treated like they have no responsibility over their action. Where, whenever there is an Islamic terror attack (then they aren't outright trying to justify it as ""blowback"") the main concern must be that muslims aren't feeling ""targeted"".  It's not just condescending woke white people who do this, many of these minority activists infantise their own communities (some have clearly recognised the easy grift on preying on woke white people desperate to not be seen as racist).

I do acknowledge that the way of addressing these problems often comes out to painting broad strokes about the entire group or othering their communities (for right-wing arguments, this is often the deliberate intention). The limitations of language - and assumed knowledge - create this problem even if its not the intention of the person speaking (and it sure as hell happens the other way too, in comments and criticisms about the white or western community). People are inherently triabilistic and even progressives are reluctant to criticise their in-group in front of the hostile out-group (but even most right-wing people are willing to criticise the in-group to others in the in-group).  Essentialising people to their identities is a bias everyone falls into (especially ignorant people, and everyone is incredibly fucking ignorant).",preciousgaffer,t2_13hg31,9,0,reddit1

indian muslims who have genes of irani and arab invaders, and whose ancestors served the former islamic-indian power structures- the ashraf, are closer to the top of the caste structures. 

native converts- the pasmandas, who are overwhelmingly lower caste hindus who ironically converted to islam to escape the caste system, are near the bottom of the structure

ashraf muslims exclusively occupy what little positions of power the indian state grants her muslim subjects. pasmanda muslims are the actual workers who work in factories, ply auto rickshaws, fix punctures, pull fruit and vegetable carts- all the work that the ashraf consider beneath them. there is no inter marriage between the ashraf and the pasmandas, just like in the hindu caste system

j1n76d4,t3_zv2kfx,2022-12-25 20:08:50,stupidpol,"One of the core themes of the book Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen is how over the past century Americans have become more and more infantilized and the line between childhood and adulthood has become more blurred than ever. It's no coincidence that adults who consume as much as children do and are as ignorant and fantasy obsessed as children make for excellent costumers and harmless citizens. Why grow up and care about Capitalism and societal decay when you can watch CGI superhero battles, play video games, collect Funko Pops and go to themed parks and restaurants?

Here’s a relevant excerpt:

>A new national fantasy of permanent youthfulness kicked in. No matter how old you got, you could continue dressing like a kid. You could continue riding your skateboard, continue listening to rock music and smoking pot, continue obsessing over ever-more-amazing ice cream and cookies, continue watching cartoons and comic book movies and reading comic books, continue going to Disneyland. In The Making of a Counter Culture in 1969, Ted Roszak noted and disparaged “the commercial world’s effort to elaborate a total culture of adolescence based on nothing but fun and games,” but he couldn’t yet see that the new countercultural paradigm would meld perfectly and powerfully and permanently into that total culture of adolescence. It was in the 1960s that we first learned of our inner child, that we should each attend to his or her wishes and aspire to be more childlike as adults. 

>That was one of the heartfelt, enduring takeaways of the era, part of nearly all the therapeutic and pop-psychology strands spun out of Esalen and its kin. If it feels good, do it: invented by Americans barely past childhood, that motto made the inner child idea actionable, and although the phrase faded quickly, the ethos lived on. Instead of taking the correct lesson from Bob Dylan’s 1973 anthem “Forever Young”—to “grow up to be righteous” and “always be courageous”—way too many baby boomers chose to remain in Neverland, to keep believing they’d always have nothing but fun and never resemble mom and dad. The principle set forth in Peter Pan—“All children, except one, grow up”—was just another oppressive and unfair old-fashioned rule to be cast off.",Cmyers1980,t2_gfj7b,34,0,reddit2

It also has the effect of influencing children's media, as we will likely see more remakes of 80's and 90's cartoons to appeal to these ""kidults"".

I own a home, I have a secure job, I have a good income, I have a large savings account....I don't have a wife and kids because I was never interested, but I date regularly.  

I enjoy doing home reno.  I wouldn't say my home maintenance skills are on par with my father or grandfather's generation, but they're decent.  I love doing landscaping.  I look forward every spring to planting my garden and love maintaining it through the summer, it's something I really take pride in.  I like to work on my culinary skills.  I own a little laser sailboat, because I live on the water.  I wouldn't mind something much bigger, I'd love something around 25 feet, but it's not practical in today's economy, even with a ""good"" income.  I mean fuck, even one from the early 80's is going to cost you almost 10 grand.  



All that said....I love collecting retro toys from the 80's and 90's.  Things I had as a child, or wanted as a child but never got.  I still play video games.  I still like watching cartoons.  
I even like some of the modern toys that my nieces and nephews have.  


So again, I agree with your opinion when it comes to *most* people who are being talked about in this article....but I also think some people like myself are fully functioning adults who just happen to enjoy toys and the like.",amphetaminesfailure,t2_aq710,57,0,reddit2

This isn’t a new tactic, Hasbro launched the Equestria Girl line awhile ago to get bronies to spend their dollars there and leave the mainline My Little Pony toys to the children.

She’s the polar opposite of my mother.

Now me. I play video games, board games, tabletop games, collectible card games. Some of my favorite shows are cartoons, even a couple of them being anime. Hell, there’s even a few figurines on my shelves. I’m largely still spending my free time doing the same stuff I’ve been doing for the last 30 years. I’m also married with kids, have a full-time job, a house (in this economy, no less!) and am fully capable of swinging a hammer or wrenching on a car when necessary.

My dad certainly wasn’t into “kiddie shit” and gave me grief for my hobbies. He also never developed the necessary level of humility and self-reflection to realize that he was responsible for his shitty life.

Funkopops are literally the exact same mold repainted over and over with soulless eyes and no real value other than to go ""I got the thing from the thing I like!"", they're the ultimate display of mindless media consumerism. Funko also has the unfortunate advantage of being stupid cheap to produce, so products based on popular media franchises (high quality figures, model kits, clothing, etc.) take time for others to make after something is released or gets big, but Funko puts out their soulless consoomer bait right away due to how lazy their design is and those rabid animals eat it up wholesale.",virtous_relious,t2_5wb0w,5,0,reddit2

So…perhaps the crux of the issue here isn’t people spending their money on plastic tchotchkes and YA-marketed entertainment and more to do with people just not having their shit together?

Another angle to consider is that things like video games, funko pops, anime, etc, are all fairly recent developments in the western mainstream. Definitely within my lifetime, at least. They may be considered “kids stuff” these days, but in another generation could be considered what toy soldiers/model airplanes/train sets were a generation or two ago.

Rent, outside of the most rural or economically depressed areas, is insane in the US.  Lack of affordable home building, zoning laws, REITs, poor transportation infrastructure, and more all contribute to the problem.  

Many mortgages are cheaper, per month, than rent would be in the same area, in part due to the subsidies the government grants to homeownership.  Rent is basically paying off someone else's loan while not building any equity; a terrible financial move for anyone but high-income professionals who regularly move between big cities.    

However, one still needs ample savings and good credit for a home loan, things which disqualify a lot of young(er) Americans.  And even renting is not that easy.  Many landlords also run credit checks (even though this is legally suspect in certain locales) and require proof-of-income that ones makes more than 3-4 times the monthly rent.  In many cases, they are unwilling to bend these restrictions for multiple tenants^1.

I'm an autistic gamer who would probably be considered overweight.  I also, however, turn 46 next month.  I'm aware of many of the tricks which marketers employ to try and relate to what they see as my demographic.  If I get the sense that someone who is trying to sell me something genuinely ***does*** understand me, (or at least, the bracket I do fall into in some respects) then yes, they are more likely to make a sale; but I've got pretty good at identifying superficial strategies which can be used to make a campaign ***seem*** relateable, when in reality the people behind said campaign don't have a clue.  I especially do not like being deceived, and if I feel that I have been, I won't just not bite on the first attempt, but I will remember the company who did that and will not buy from them afterwards either.

I used to resent marketing, but I don't any more as much, because I've come to recognise that there genuinely are several different groups of people in society, and it actually benefits me more if there are products that are specifically designed for my demographic, rather than just being generalised.  I didn't like *Star Trek Discovery* because I thought it was chronically woke, but then when they introduced *Strange New Worlds,* I watched at least the first four episodes of it and liked it more, because although the girl power was still evident, it wasn't as vindictive or otherwise cringe inducing as *Discovery* was.  I liked it when Blizzard finally re-released classic World of Warcraft, too.

I also had the good fortune of growing up around computers in a period where the actual measurement units of speed and size for computers were used instead of marketing terms which don't actually mean anything.  That means that I have been raised to look for concrete, operational definitions.  Marketers still ***can*** manipulate me emotionally; but if they want to, they have to tell me what their product can actually do for me, and then rely on my emotions associated with that to make the sale.

I also can't have too much sodium in my diet, and I'm aware that McDonald's typically has a lot.  I actually do have positive emotional associations with cheeseburgers, but an unsalted version would be an easier sale.",petrus4,t2_4a3yu,7,0,reddit2

Home ownership is also out of the question. And sure, lots of annoying landlords also make you jump through 101 different hoops of proof-of-income etc. but there are also loads that don’t if you actually look.

My contention is that, for most people, it's a bad economic move.  If you're lucky enough to be able to live (rent-free) with your family, it's far more advantageous to do so financially.  There is an element of agency here, I'm not going hardcore determinist.  

In your example at $8 an hour, would you rather pay rent or not?  Cutting out the largest expense one has (housing) makes it much easier to save and build a stronger financial future.  One is paying a huge premium for ""independence"" in today's market, and it's no surprise a lot of younger people don't find it worthwhile (lot of cultural reasons; probably not worth wading into those weeds).",cardgamesandbonobos,t2_x4wsp,6,0,reddit2

I think this is the crux of the issue...the premium that one places on a certain kind of independence.  For many people, it just makes more financial sense to stay at home, greatly reduce expenses, and be able to have a shot at building wealth/assets (or eliminating debt^1).  Four or five years with the parents, even at some underpaid McJob, could be a downpayment on a house, or capital for a business; making forward progress financially rather than treading water.  This is the economic incentive that makes a lot of Americans choose multi-generational living.

Of course, it's currently non-waiverable, and I personally blame the Karen moms of severely autistic children for the way the disease is treated in this country today. We used to have levels to the diagnosis, and the military could have taken that into the situation.

The only track I could find in 2004 was deploying with blackwater, sticking with the military (60k a year - meh), or doing some dipshit police work. The economy was so good in 2004-2007 that I was able to leverage a lot of other options I wasn’t aware of initially. 

To put the $$ in perspective - there were rangers, infantry and special operators that were getting similar offers, if not more depending on their job (MOS, rating, whatever). I heard of people getting 200-300k first tour and then I heard of people getting up to 500k for second and third tours. I guess you could call it “operator work”. I actually can’t remember a lot of it - I’ve lost track of a bunch of those dudes. 

The $$ was tax free if you met a handful of conditions. I wouldn’t recommend it - it’s not the same as the military.

Menial jobs were never, ever paid anywhere close to this well.  They always hired 3rd country nationals to do this kind of work for pennies.  There were hundreds if not thousands of Indians working in Helmand, AFG when I was there, doing laundry, cooking, and maintenance.  They sure as fuck were not making 150 to 200k.

When we withdrew from Helmand in the early 2010s there was a bit of a crisis when hundreds of Indians, who had all finished their contracts, did not have a way to get home because they sent all their pay as remittances to India.  They made a giant tent city at the end of the runway way in Dwyer and became a legit humanitarian crisis.  I believe the military chartered flights to get them the fuck out of there since they were all broke and would have been at the mercy of the Taliban.

By 2011 to 2012 almost no contractors were making 200k anymore.  Even highly experienced intel analysts were complaining about being ""lowballed"" around 120k for a tour.

ipewd84,t3_xkgzsu,2022-09-22 01:42:29,stupidpol,"Can't help with pump supplies, but for insulin, there's a number of programs to get it for relatively cheap.

Sanofi has ValYou, which you can get any combination of their long- or fast-acting insulins, up to 10 boxes/month, for $35 now (used to be $99, but the actual coupon is down to $35). This includes admelog - which while it's technically not approved for pumps, it is a biosimilar lispro and should work the same as Humalog. Novo also has My$99Insulin, which allows you to get up to 3 vials/month of any combination of Novolog or their long-acting insulins (such as Tresiba) for $99.

There's also Walmart-brand Relion Novolog, which is $72.88 a vial and doesn't require any kind of coupon. It's identical to the ""normal"" Novolog, and unlike their other Relion insulins can be used in a pump.

Now, unfortunately, all of the above do require a prescription - but while you can't get in to see an endocrinologist right now, you may be able to ask your former endocrinologist to write some refills on your insulin as a courtesy. Most will do it - given you need insulin to live. Another option, since you now have insurance, you can go see an urgent care and ask them for an insulin refill. Again, they usually won't refill maintenance meds, but given you're a T1 and need it to live, it's usually an exemption. Any physician can write you a scrip for it. It's probably a reasonably good idea to establish with a PCP anyway - though availability may be slim there too. Absolute worst case scenario, if you run out of supplies, most ERs will write you a bridging prescription for some insulins, but that's expensive. (Even worse case scenario than that, which I really wouldn't recommend doing without a doctor's direct advice, would be transitioning to Walmart Relion R and Relion N, which are a short and intermediate acting insulin you can buy over the counter without a prescription. They're rather tricky to dose via shots and should NOT be used in a pump though, so do not recommend).

Only idea for pump supplies is to simply call the relevant manufacturer directly. Medtronic, Tandem, and Omnipod will often be able to just give you a few weeks worth, but it totally depends on who you talk to (helps to get in touch with your local rep for the company, but they vary in quality).

You can also try calling around more endocrinologist offices to see if anyone has sooner availability. March is six months away - it's unlikely *none* of them have sooner appointments. You can ask to be added to some cancellation lists if they offer that. Or do a telemed with your old endocrinologist if they offer that as an option - though if you no longer live in the same state they may decline.",Rarvyn,t2_t3ksl,29,0,reddit1

So this is totally dependent on your own doctors policies. Some kinda farm it out to their medical assistants who just put in refills, others do it themselves. It's not automated. Many (if not most) offices will only do it if you've been seen within the last N months (can be as low as 3 or a year+) AND if you have an appointment scheduled soon. If that's the case, they'll often only give you enough refills to last until that appointment. Even the more lenient docs will stop refilling your medicine if you stop coming to them entirely.

It's not just because the doctors are interested in holding your prescriptions hostage unless you have a visit - though unfortunately for some people that *is* part of it - it's a liability concern. If you keep refilling meds blindly and someone has a complication because you didn't see/talk to them, review the relevant data, get blood work, etc - you really have no way to defend yourself.",Rarvyn,t2_t3ksl,3,0,reddit1

As a general rule - and this isn’t individual medical advice - switching to shots from a pump isn’t super complicated. You can use the same carb ratios/correction factor to dose your humalog and then take a shot of long acting insulin based on your typical basal requirements on the pump. If you’re overall well controlled and switching to a different modality, it’s reasonable to just reduce all doses 15-20% just in case absorption is different - reduces the risk of lows - but that’s primarily just being conservative. You lose the benefits of control IQ but overall it isn’t *that* different. 

But you absolutely need long acting to go along with the humalog, and for anything other than Relion N (which isn’t truly long acting, requires twice daily dosing, and has a peak besides) you need a prescription for that.",Rarvyn,t2_t3ksl,2,0,reddit1

ipi0joo,t1_iphh19i,2022-09-22 18:15:15,stupidpol,"> Can you name any evolutionary adaptations that help us eat meat? 

Our metabolism is the most obvious one. Gorillas can digest and utilize protein from cellulose - they are truly adapted to plant-heavy diets. Humans cannot. We require a lot more modern industrial luxury to meet essential amino acid requirements on plants. You require a combination of many different legumes and other sources to get all your essential amino acids, whereas meats provide proteins that are complete with all the essential amino acids you require. 

Modern vegan diets can attain this today because we have modern scientific knowledge and and modern logistics delivering a wide variety of goods to the supermarket. But it would be impossible to have this diet 200 years ago since nobody knew about amino acids and the vast majority of people could only access a few staples.  Therefore modern vegan diets are not relevant to our evolutionary history to date since they are a modern concept. 

Further, legumes only became widely available (in some places) with agriculture (~10k years ago), when humans had already spent 200k years eating meat. Someone from 100,000 BC could survive only on meat much longer than someone who only ate whatever plants were available around them. 

>We have amylase in our saliva

As well as enzymes that digest animal proteins and fats further down the GI tract. 

>We die of stroke, diabetes and heart disease if we eat too much meat.

Your health also suffers if you only eat plants without using modern knowledge, technology, and available variety to balance it perfectly to ensure you get your nutritional needs met. Someone eating only leafy greens would die much faster than someone only eating steak. Meanwhile, people can (and do) just eat an omnivorous diet without thinking about it too much and maintain their health in relative order - because humans are meant to eat both meat and plants.",DookieSpeak,t2_yetwpzp,2,0,reddit1

She never told anyone she was on WIC or that she was back with her parents, and by appearance you could never tell.

Rural peasants, especially in the Vendee region, resisted the revolution for 2 key reasons: 1) the Revolution’s leaders sought to obliterate one of the key institutions anchoring peasant life, i.e. the Catholic Church, and 2) the rural noble elites were not nearly as rich and oppressive as their class peers in Paris, so there was less pre-existing animosity.

In contrast, the urban, poverty-stricken sans culottes were much more alienated from the Paris nobility and did not interact as much with the Church or see it as a unifying institution. Hence they ended up finding common cause with the bourgeois revolutionary leaders.

Today’s radlibs also seek to obliterate basic conservative institutions and customs, e.g. abolish the family, abolish the police, drag queen story hour, etc. And rural capitalists are also often poorer and more well-integrated in their communities. Someone who owns a farm supply company or a machine shop in the Rust Belt is technically a capitalist, but not on the level of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, or Jamie Dimon. Therefore rural working class types are reactionary for much the same reasons the rural French peasants were reactionary.",UrbanIsACommunist,t2_134s4x,13,0,reddit2

1: There should be a distinction between an 'owner-operator' type of capitalist, someone like the farm owners you describe whose capital assets maintain or appreciate their value due to direct labor and competent management on the basis of the owners, in fact their capital assets would quickly degrade without their managerial or direct labor, and the sort of 'passive income' type of capitalist who literally derives their income purely from the non-act of ownership.  


2: I don't think the owner-operator types should be overtly vilified, inherently, mainly because they can be seen as simply conforming to the world as it is and even in a very socialist economy it is likely that those kind of personality types would fill comparable roles.

fvyofs1,t3_hfhdty,2020-06-25 15:33:11,stupidpol,"Pretty spot on. And resonates with some things that have been a part of working-class ideologies for centuries
 You are quite right, for instance, to highlight the labor theory of value. In the US context, the 18th and 19th centuries were dominated by ideas of ""producerism"" which saw class struggle between ""the producing classes"" (made of farmers, small proprietors, wage workers who wanted to be small proprietors etc) and ""the non-producing classes"" (merchants, bankers, and their employees). In part because that was a time when the petit bourgeoisie was a much bigger part of the population and political formations, and because the distinction between the petit bourgeoisie and wage workers was less well defined. It is how you get 19th century working-class politics that is critical of banks and business clerks but defensive of ""capital"" and it's place in the economy. You can trace this from Adam Smith to Henry George, and the types of feelings you're describing shows it likely never entirely went away.

The welfare stuff adds a wrinkle that wasn't there so much in the 19th century, though perhaps it too has parallels in their own ideas about the undeserving poor that feuled temperance crusades and the like.

Marxist theory tends to associate these ideas with the centrality of the petit bourgeoisie and a not-yet-fully-formed and more plebian working class in political economy. I guess it's not surprising that it is something we associate with the Republican party in the US, which includes the rural bourgeoisie as a major part of it's coalition. 

Marxist theory also tends to see these ideas as ""antiquated"" ones that will, even if not replaced by proletarian class consciousness, at least be replaced by something different under new systems of production. We might have some 'splaining to do regarding their persistence in and adaptations to new contexts over the years.",locofocohotcocoa,t2_1ng0hb34,1,0,reddit2

fvyd1yq,t1_fvy3fe9,2020-06-25 13:52:29,stupidpol,"Exactly. I think it's important to take this attitude seriously. On a common sense level, it is pretty reasonable to feel proud that you've managed to lift yourself out of poverty without giving in to the temptation of going on benefits. You can relate to that feeling. You've tried waking up and thinking, ""Fuck it, I'm calling in sick. I'm quitting this job. I can't be bothered"" a thousand times, but you've still got up and gone to work. When you see someone else who instead chooses to stay in bed, then might feel a deep seeded contempt for their (perceived) laziness and lack of willingness to be a part of the system that you've accepted.

This lack of willingness to participate, however, also provokes you on a deeper existential level, because it reminds you how futile your own battle has been. Why the fuck did you put in all those hours at work, just to be marginally better off? A while ago, there was talks in my country about lowering benefits for the unemployed and some boomer made a comment on facebook about how unemployment benefits are a mockery to those hardworking people who get up at 5 to go to work etc. In other words, ""if people can survive relatively comfortably without doing a bullshit job, then what the fuck am I doing with my life?"" I reminds me of an analogy that Michel Houellebecq has in one his books where he talks about how a monkey in a small cage can get stressed and freak out, even harming itself or killng itself in the process, but if you were to put a large bottomless hole in the cage, then the monkey calms down, cautiously approaches the hole, investigates it and is careful not to fall in it.

The problem now is that the people who call themselves socialist are more often than not trying to look for an angle on why they shouldn't have to work or only do the easy jobs. It is infuriating and I'd say that attitude is more prevalent in far left circles than among liberals and right-wingers.

The property value doubled between when she bought the house and today, and she's got it on the market and plans to live off the money in a trailer travelling around the country doing odd jobs. The idea is that if you work hard and are a prudent saver, than you've earned the right to your free time in your 50's and older. 

It doesn't seem ""Fair"" that welfare recipients get to subvert that process, and that's why a UBI is such a good idea. The socialist critique I've heard of UBI is that with Automation, either the UBI will have to be increased to guarantee a standard of living to everyone, but the proportion of wealth is still concentrated in a wholly unequal way. There will still be an unimpeachable entrenched oligarchy capable of manipulating legislation through lobbying that will fight to reduce the UBI to the minimum possible amount to prevent revolution, much in the same way wages are suppressed now. So while there will be a baseline, there won't be the opportunities for economic mobility once labour is obsolete, which is why the means of production must be collectivized to ensure equitable distribution of that UBI.

This is pretty much the idea behind Mutualism (Tucker and Proudhon). The idea is to limit the power of land and banking monopolies so that the cost of acquiring capital remains low. Small scale industries and services could function as individual proprietorships while larger more complex industries function as cooperatives. Because workers aren't losing a portion of their wage to an ownership class, and the cost of starting one's own business is low and not protected by the capitalist's class interest, it's a lot easier for any citizen to transition between whichever form of organization and work they find fulfilling.

&#x200B;

One has to be careful though, because it's insufficient to simply organize farmers/machine-shops/small-businesses as co-ops. There's a strong emphasis on public control of banking and land. Doing the former without the latter leads to those co-ops identifying more with capitalist structures than socialist ones, and the goal of organization should be to get people more sympathetic of socialist structures.",idw_h8train,t2_3b6yr3ci,12,0,reddit2

The worst thing that could happen is that a survivorship bias happens to individuals who benefit from similar redistributive programs, but without the major institutions of banking or land ownership under strong public control. That bias then develops into reactionary or pro-capitalist beliefs, as recipients will identify more with the self-reliance/captain-of-industry attitude, and thus have solidarity with private bankers and landlords instead of the population at large.

I still think land and credit monopolies are the biggest opponent and barrier to socialist prosperity. Land is finite, and technology is still limited for being able to create sustainable habitats for humans in the oceans and space. Land is also the basic input for a variety of productive activity, whether it's farming, mining, or just functioning as a site for a building. If someone else owns the land you perform your labor on, they have some degree of influence on you, the very least collecting rent on your labor. If the Earth regularly ejected pieces of itself that contained minerals, water, atmosphere, floura and fauna into space, then those dissatisfied with the status quo could simply leave Earth on them to self govern, but we don't have that luxury. 

&#x200B;

Credit is highly similar. Just as land is intertwined with so much economic activity, so is credit and currency. The manipulation of interest rates and monopoly on circulating new currency is too powerful to be trusted in private hands. Banks already exploit cycles in order to acquire more property through foreclosure, and debt is used as a tool to exert control over other corporations.

This caused extra chaos because not only did her budget piss off every single part of the electorate but the tories won the 2019 election campaigning on the opposite of what she did so she had no democratic mandate (or as much as can exist in bourgeoisie democracy) thus leading to their polling collapsing to the point they won't even be the second largest party.",Jaggedmallard26,t2_94qvz,54,0,reddit3

There's even differences between the Tory party (who largely wanted Sunak) and the Tory membership, and this is relevant for their leadership contests as only the last round is voted by the base.

It can be everything from soccer mom feet pics to sexological bodywork to fuck for a fix. 

Outdated obscenity laws don’t help and the current zeal for sweeping everything under “consent” doesn’t really either.  

Seems we have these current ideas about solving this problem:

1.  Fundamentally change economic relations and human exploitation via a socialist revolution.  We can be assured the problem of “get fucked or starve” will still exist in some form but should be greatly reduced or will more truly be a free choice. Attack the material exploitation and the rest will fall in line. Law will still be necessary!

2.  Outlaw porn, sex work, paid surrogacy, etc.  different rationales but popular with the Dworkin/Schlafly overlap set.  More internally consistent but doesn’t work without a police state and lands hardest on the pauperized. 

3.  SWIW!  Consent is key to everything and we should be free to use or change our bodies however we want for whatever reasons we have.  Might sound good on paper but quickly goes to an exploitative clown world as this slogan is a bourgeois one and is coupled with muddled and contradictory values.

jhaapgn,t3_12v74ag,2023-04-22 16:27:47,stupidpol,"The ""sexual objectification of women"" theory is the main reason I reject radical feminism despite agreeing with them on gender critical issues, indeed I'll go further and argue that the excesses of transrights activists, specifically the insistance that people shouldn't have ""genital preferences"" thus that say Lesbians are morally obliged to consider males who identify as women as potential sexual partners, is a direct consequence of the nebulous ""objectification"" theory, which implies we ought to consider intangable qualities of more importance than the physical.

The idea of 'sexual objectification' neglects the complexity of object-subject relations in the human psyche, the fact we are both objects and subjects, we are our bodies and sexual attraction is primarily physical and based on the tangable body. This is exactly why pedophilia and beasitality are abnormal, attractions towards physical objects that haven't developed adult sexual functions. Homosexual and Heterosexual attractions are based on the physical body. People might require all sorts of non-tangable qualities in a partner, intellegance, kindness, power, humour, but they must come in the right physical form first.

Since we are both subjects and physical bodies, we must identify with the bodies we see to empathise, this requires a split within our own identity, the mirror stage in which the infant realises that the bodies of others around them have feelings, and that it itself is an object, as if seeing itself in a mirror. Human empathy then is always based on looking at other bodiies, this enables us to identify with images of bodies on screen, even with drawings of cartoon animals or spounges. If we didn't do this we'd never look at pictures more than once, we'd react to pictures like cats.

In otherwords there is no such thing as ""objectification"" between non-psychopathic humans, there is using humans as means instead of ends, something Kantianism inherantly objects to, but I'm utilitarian. I regard consequences as more important than moral abstracts. I don't support or oppose prostitution, it's not something I've ever engaded with and I regard ""sex work"" as a larger category including porn production.  People have very different attitudes towards sexual activities, what might be intolerable to one person might be tolerable to another and desired by yet another.

For example I had a quick read of a few of the ""invisable men"" and felt little of the shock or repulsion the introduction built me up for, clearly the expected responce, which thus simply strengthend my already existing stereotype that ""anti-sex work"" feminists are prudish Kantians to begin with, some might be worse, the types who enjoy reading about shocking sex acts, who are driven to seek out news reports of sexual violence, with a disapproving tone because of their own repressed sadomasochism.

As such, I think we are all obliged to build a society in which nobody is forced by economic circumstance or direct coercion to work in jobs they detest, if prostitution then disappears so be it, if it remains fair enough, I don't see the need to treat it as a special case, but then that is the result of my own attitudes to sex. I simply don't see it as sacred or the most intimate possible activity or that it and our sexual preferences should define us above all other aspects of ourselves. The fact I don't see sex as scared, a special activity distinct from all other physical things, that hypothetically I could have emotionless sex, hasn't impelled me to indulge prostitution, nor is it caused by prostitution, but then I've pretty much always been in an intimate relationship with someone since I was teen.

The fact prostitution and sexual violence are so central to radfem thinking, their explaination for the lower status of women,for the existance of patriarchy, their subsequent rejection of passivity/femininity as only an inferior status forced on women by patriarchy through violence, can never work. It replicates the original patriarchal value that egotistic activeness (masculinity) is superior to passivity (femininity) and that implication will in fact preserve women's lower status, because men have a head start in symbolic activeness, bigger, stronger, faster, more prone to externaland physical activities, designed to penetrate in the sex act itself.

So, I had social service clients in hostels who were former rough sleepers - mentally and sometimes physically scarred men - who would pay from their benefits and use these kinds of services  as a kind of 'deep' therapy or at least different kind of 'escape' to drugs, during which   thye could feel someone was willing to  be in close contact with them without recoiling or listen to them speak without  judging them or immediately trying to score or turning it into something predicated upon professional boundaries.  Yeah, I'm sure there were even amongst those same populations, some number of men whose relationship to the female body was  just pure objectivization (as opposed to the more formal psychoanalytic dimension of 'some necessary fantasy/objectifying'  you get people like Zizek talking about in terms of 'all desire') and who would ask for humiliating or painful things out of being so broken or being exposed to broken images of desire/interaction ( hardcore, for one)  or just through some psychopathology, but those weren't the sort of things I'd hear. And these men would be pretty candid (and , pretty shamed about it all the same).  
  
I don't think equivocation is healthy, but  would also agree with posters above about a number of more 'respectable' forms of 'transaction'  in the world underpinning relationships.  IMO we should also 'judge' those as not being expressions of the good life (in the classical sense, religious one, or in the sense of any socialist society to come), as materialists of some stripes we should recognize those dimensions and how they partly drive 'more' or less ostensibly virtuous behaviour or authentic  connection as opposed to binaries. Likewise, the unconscious  in any kinds of relationship where all kinds of  motives and self-justifications, good' and 'bad' faith get condensed, whether it's a 'john' or a girl hooking up with some richer guy to pay off her student loans. We still get to talk after that about homologies and degrees of exploitation  under class society or produced within classes, as well as what society should cultivate or discourage.

Beyond that... some combination of  better mental heath provision, 'sublimated' forms of social contact for people who are vulnerable/lonely, and also providing a  society where more men are able  to assume forms where they can be 'viable',  in terms of their confidence and independence as well as  - stripping away contingent aspects of 'desire' that make up of 21st century's worst social judgments - 'attractive'",ExternalPreference18,t2_9xzxqrhj,3,0,reddit4

My reasoning to preserve myself was: Im not doing anything i can tell they dont want to do and say this to them explicitely right off the bat.

She doesnt say anything, turns herself around in the bed and shows me the back of her neck. There it was, the name of her pimp tatooed on the back of her neck.

According to many sex workers, most of their clients are either married men or men in relationships. So I don't think that adds up, and additionally, the reason men are able to buy prostituted women is because they dissociate themselves from the women's humanity during the act. The more they buy sex the more this dissociation sticks with them, the harder they find it possible to view women as equally human and not objects they can masturbate with.

For some people sex isn't something intimate at all or it atleast doesn't necessarily have to be for them to enjoy it. Maybe the majority isn't inclined this way and maybe it's more common in men then women, but how is it morally wrong/ a sign of psychological defect per se? That's the way many promiscuous people seem to tick.

I assume I would regard sex with a prostitute about as physically intimate as having cut my hair, getting my teeth cleaned or getting a massage. And I assume I would think of and treat the prostitute just like I would any other worker delivering a physical service to me in exchange for money. Granted, I have never hired a sex worker and I'm not going to do so for science, but I wouldn't expect things to be fundamentally different, just because the service in question happens to be sexual intercourse.

It's perfectly fine to not share this view regarding sex, exclude people who tick this way from one's social circle etc...

jhddb1j,t1_jh9z68y,2023-04-23 08:23:55,stupidpol,">Today, it's necessary to defend love. Love is the most powerful way known to humanity to have an intimate relationship with another. It places you in a state of dependence on another. Which is something that is fundamentally against modern individualism. If the sole motivation of human action is to satisfy one’s wishes and interests which is after the dominant idea of the modern world. If that is humanity then love can indeed be seen as a danger. We should be wary of love and in particular, what happens on dating websites. Where we try to guarantee a romantic encounter in advance by ensuring that anyone you meet is just like you. They have the same tastes, same wishes, and the same determination. I think that goes against the very definition of love. Because it means there’s no element of adventure, no risks are taken, mutual satisfaction has to be guaranteed, like some kind of business contract and that I think is a serious threat to love. 
You need to defend love as a real, risky adventure against this individualistic, even egotistical vision. Because the truth is that love can’t be reduced to individualistic egoism. 

>Love is, in a way, a lesson in courage. In arranged marriages there is no risk. The same with dating sites. You try to avoid risk. Avoiding risk by calculating how to maximize a relationship with another. I think that all creation, all truth with any real significance is always linked to an event. Anything else is just a normal consequence of everyday world. It is neither a creation nor an invention, just a continuation. What does it mean to start something? If you want to consider something beginning, you have to consider there is an element of chance. If there isn't a chance involved then it’s not a start because it's something that already exists and is predetermined. So when I focus on risk, I focus on the fact that, love as a creation, as an invention is closely linked to a meeting, A meeting which is risky. And can be a meeting with people form completely different worlds. It's precisely because of the role that chance plays that love can have a creative dimension that is really interesting and universal. Love, true love, makes possible what was previously impossible. 

>The modern individualistic world is a world that represents humanity as a collection of single entities. Each is one. In its purest sense love is this passage from one to two in the experience of life itself. Love creates a perspective and an existence in the world which is not from the point of view of one because it is the perspective of two. The passing from one to two is a revolution. A great revolution. It's as if we are putting things in perspective as if suddenly the world has an extra dimension and it's an absolutely fundamental experience because it shows us that the truth of the world is in fact sustained by multitudes not by the atom that is you personally. Many people give up on love. People don’t understand clearly enough that love is a creation. A modern tendency, when there’s an obstacle, is to let go and move on to something else. If we settle on the idea that as soon as something is hard we have to give it up, we will settle for an uninteresting life. I don't deny the existence of love’s sadness. Abandonment or disappointment can be terrible emotions. But if, because of this, you renounce love then you reject the greatest experience of another that you can have in your existence.

>Sexological Bodywork® is a body-based educational modality that supports individuals, couples, and groups to learn to direct their erotic development and to deepen their erotic wellbeing and embodiment.
>
>""Soma” or “Somatic”  is ‘of the body’ but not merely the physical body. Our Soma includes our spirit, our mind, our body and physiology, our emotions and our feelings.  In somatic work we are supported to turn our focus inwards, to the sensations we experience in our bodies, including information sourcing from our tissues, structures, trapped emotions and even the stories we hold in our nervous system which contribute to our habits and help shape how we experience ourselves and what is possible.
>
>Certfied Sexological Bodyworkers use a client-centered approach to empower, educate, and bring attention to the felt experience through movement, breath, touch, sound, and placement of awareness. This approach facilitates the ability to change limiting habits, unwind and release what is no longer supportive, re-sensitize the body, and create a more expansive erotic state that integrates both body and mind.

The problem is not men feeling entitled to women, any more than Ayn Rand screeching about people feeling entitled for ""other peoples money"". The problem is that men - in this particular case johns, punters, buyers whatever you wanna call them - are ok with buying people (and of course selling, but the focus was on the buying part).And the pimps and sellers are not just empowered by a cabal of men (though of course that also is happening, in particular the human trafficking part) but capitalist consumer societies - which women are an active part of. If you know German, than you should know that the loudest propagandist for ""sex work"" are women (in the media sphere that is) - indeed women who also call themselves feminist. They are not just manipulated by ""entitled men"". Making shit legal does give moral and conformist signals as well.

Being a women also does not grant you access to be singularly enraged, sad and disgusted by this. You know how most of my female colleagues talk about the brothel next to our workplace? “A place for desperate guys, I bet”, “I knew you are not one of the guys who had the need for it”. They talk about the lack of sexual “conquest” as a reason for the punters, not about the dubious moral or personal character of them.Nor does being a women give you an excuse for ignoring other potential ways of thinking about it than your own particular narrow set of feminist mantras. Though I can understand being exhausted by pointing out the obvious while potentially being treated as insane.

But also of course: Thank you for sharing. I'm sure you're doing your best and all. As I said, my workplace is right next to one of those places (somewhere in Southern Germany). Always feels like pure surreal insanity to have an outrage next to you while everybody acts like nothing is going on.  


  
Edit: Just to be clear, because I probably overreacted to the ""entitled"" quote. I think OP is absolutely based in her condemnation of buying peoples body as masturbation tools (which is THE BEST CASE scenario of prostitution). I think hat everyone who really can't wrap their head around the fact why this is a moral and political problem is not less lib brained than all the ""losing weight is genocide of fat people"" autism. OP comes understandably more from the view of the dignity of the prostitute, I would just add that all punters, regardless if sadistic or socially incompetent, deserve to be criticized because as human beings they have potential for a better version of themselves and their moral and sexual life.

Sometimes humans might treat objects ""as if"" they have feelings, like tearing down a statue of a dictator, or getting frustrated with a tool and throwing it across the room, they aren't in such instances trying to ""hurt"" an object, they are treating it like a subject either symbolically or because of confusion in a moment of frustration.

>If not, then how do you explain rape ?

There are 4 main motivations for rape, power assertion, power reassurence, anger and psychopathic sadism. Only the last category, which is the rarest, involves mistaking someone for unfeeling and that's because the rapist is a psychopath and generally cannot empathise with anyone, they are calculating and the most likely to indulge in bizarre activities and kill to protect themselves. Anger rapists are the most violent, they think they have been offended against, either directly or by some associated female figure and seek to ""punish"" the victim, they wouldn't bother if they didn't think the victim had feelings to hurt. The power rapists both feel a need to assure themselves of power, the assertive type has high confidence in themselves, the reassurence ones less, clearly they feel the need to do this with a feeling victim.",Carnyxcall,t2_6qgce5w1,16,0,reddit4

Although obviously looking at images involves the same processes whether looking at images of bodies or any other object, why would it be different for anyone, there is no innate processing difference between looking at a picture of a table or a person, unless perhaps you recognise one of them. 

I've encountered people arguing that neuroimaging proves that males who identify as women are truly women because similar parts of the brain show activity to certain stimuli as females. This compounded by the false idea males and females have differently constructed brains, that males have bigger brains with more grey matter, females smaller with more white matter, when these differences are really a continuum as a result of body size, not sex. I asked the transrights activist who was arguing this with me if she regarded smaller males as women and larger females as men, she couldn't answer.

Yeah, they could. If you live in a country where prostitution is legal, that could certainly happen.

>If prostitution was work, we'd send our little girls to brothels on bring your daughter to work day and have her try some Johns

A child is not capable of consenting to any sexual act. It is illegal, along with child labor, because children are not mature enough to understand what they are doing, and anyone unable to understand exactly what they are about to do cannot give consent.

[This is an established legal standard, goes for adults as well.](https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/02/14/court-bans-autistic-woman-from-having-sex/)

''The Court of Protection has ruled that an autistic woman with an IQ of 64 does not have the mental capacity to engage in sexual relations, on the basis that she does not understand the implications and cannot effectively deploy the information she has understood into her decisions.''

This should cover your child labor point as well.

>If prostitution was work, unemployed men could be forced into providing sex to rich gay men

Male prostitues exist, yeah.

>If prostitution was work, a raped woman would just be paid 50 bucks for loss of services or denying services instead of seeing their rapist go to prison

Existence of prostitution does not invalidate the act of consenting to an act. In prostitution for example, both parties understand that sexual services are exchanged for money. Both parties know what to expect, they understand the implications and consent to it.",TurklerRS,t2_10sg7t,9,0,reddit4

jhdvttj,t1_jhdbnt4,2023-04-23 12:28:48,stupidpol,"Maybe it’s my being unclear.  As I said, I have issues from a  political perspective with society affirming any kind of formal sex work (and also a religious perspective, though I know much of this sub doesn’t have truck with that- n.b. I’m not some integralist, so it doesn’t matter either way). And I hope it’s obvious that I don't think anyone should be compelled to work in that sector, either by some nightmare handmaids or joy division scenario, or by ostensibly free choice of market compulsion, even if it's just doing what a ‘sex surrogate’ practitioner  does (which doesn’t include penetrative sex).

But the latter goes to my point re compulsion or right. So, you talk about bodies being used: Do you think, then, there's an issue with women -  setting aside again those marketplace coercions associated with capitalism - working as therapists and having to do paid 'emotional labour' for men?  Labour that itself isn’t just listening but having to perform in a  therapeutic environment. Do you also think men with psychiatric issues should  have to ‘deal with their emotional  bullshit’ themselves rather than burdening a woman if she's remunerated for it  as a counsellor/psych and has - to the extent that you can separate that from the sheer compulsion to work - a vocation?

Likewise, what about a woman who enters into a  relationship with a  man she might not be spontaneously physically attracted to (and I say this with the caveat that there are clearly other kind of libidinal 'investments in terms of the fantasy of safety or attraction to the idea of status which we can acknowledge without going own the reactionary avenues of evo psych or into obscuratist psychoanalysis)  for access to resources of social capital: even under socialism you might not completely eradicate that, whatever other equalizing measures and education in gender you provide. What about when some 25 year old starts dating a 50 year old hedge fund guy, or her former professor as a grad student (with the implicit knowledge he can get  probably secure her a funded doc or postdoc), or the myriad other scenarios we’re all familiar?   She might be 'providing' him, in an unstated, maybe not entirely conscious, exchange, the fantasy of his own desirability - either directly, ‘he’s \[coded as\] fit/virile’, or through the 'power' of his money - through the use of her own body, through any haptic gesture up and including sex.   Are you going to investigate whether she's being exploited or its more of an elektra complex or some mixture?

The fact is, however you square it, both men and women, however asymmetrically, fulfil ‘functions' in relation to each other within relationships or , yes,  'do the labour'.  You can’t purely schematize a relationship in those terms, but they are 'working' to respond to the desire for types of happiness or the lack in the other.

Not all relationships are the same, and we should aim for a mutuality that doesn't include disproportionate economic/capital force  on the part of one person that traps the other person or turns ( say, liberated,  'post-feminist'  seeking-arrangements) 'using' into  feminine self-exploitation. Nevertheless,  there are few, if any relationships, where at some point 'affect' and the body aren’t used as crutches or compensation to some degree rather than remaining wholly ‘ transcendent’  ( insert term, whether you want to use the language of the ‘sublime’ or ‘gift for this or any other kind of language around mutuality and non exploitation), and none where this idea of the 'fantasy' is completely gone  in favour of some unalienated Real, to deploy bastardized pop=Lacanese.  And sometime those ‘normal’ relationships are more overtly transactional or contractual than others—which, again, I don’t think is outside the ambit of society to condone or disincentivise, contrary to the more libertarian members of the sub, but it does have to be acknowledged.

Again, this isn’t super straightforward – when I was working in care, there was roughly 50/50 split with my colleagues (psychologists/nurses/support workers/social workers)  around if and what should be legalized, so I’m not accusing you or anyone else of bad faith.  I just don’t think that discussing these things constitutes condoning destructive tendencies  or reinforcing patriarchy:  rather, we have to  confront the messiness of human psychology and the ‘other’ as well as dividing lines between  what is dignified and undignified work, in and beyond the vagaries of capitalism and the production of ‘official’ and unofficial bodily-emotional labour- if we want to deal properly with exploitation or abuse.",ExternalPreference18,t2_9xzxqrhj,1,0,reddit4

The point for lenin was political, it was not about the rights and wrongs of this or that but about how to make a world revolution happen. 

Feminists today demand this or that legislation from the capitalist state, usually to restrict people‘s freedom. This has historically been the case too. Be it prohibition of alcohol, banning of pornography or prostitution. Not because women are authoritarian (which is a psychoanalytical discussion for another day) but because as a political movement, feminism is petit-bourgeois in its consciousness.

The SPD when it was still a revolutionary party did not lobby the state to legalize abortion but organized doctors to perform abortions in working class districts independently of the state. It matters more who does something than what is being done.

In theory, yes, but in practise, awful, awful things still happen. I live in a city with legalized brothels, and is a sex tourism destination because of that. Many of the ""legal"" brothels are owned and operated by criminal organizations (despite being a very safe and prosperous city) and the conditions in these establishments can be a nightmare. Prostitutes are offered drugs to tolerate the hell that is their occupation. Due to the lax enforcement of the sex trade, for every legal, licensed brothel there are three illegal ones, and I can only imagine the conditions in those are far worse. Then there are the pimps who hire out airBnBs for one or a few nights and desecrate the house with a rotating cast of johns abusing these poor trafficked women. Political tolerance for sex work may seem like a method of harm minimization, but in reality it enables a new realm of trafficking and exploitation. Additionally, demand for prostitution is much higher in areas where it is legal, and trafficking does too.

I think the solution to this problem is two pronged: first, adopt the Scandinavian model of criminalizing pimps and johns, but ensuring the sex workers themselves face no legal consequences. Second, ensure access to tolerable, regulated and fairly compensated work so that sex work isn't as compelling a vocation for the desperate poor.

Men being lonely isn't an excuse, loneliness isn't an inherent, immutable trait, and it certainly doesn't mean we should legitimize a trade that ultimately dehumanizes women as a whole. Men can claim they are ""lonely"" for all they can, it's not remotely close to be a reason to jeopardize the living conditions of hundreds of women as well as the situation of women as a whole by putting them on the same scale as some man's cock.

'Sex work' is unique because it preys primarily on women, it is an insitution of gender inequality entirely built on the objectification of female bodies. There is an axis of misogyny and catering to the straight male gaze that isn't present even in other exploitative careers. Are we going to pretend that this isn't real ? Or that it will not lead to justifying the objectification of women as a whole ?

I want to add that it's not because anything has a financial compensation or any form of compensation attached to it that it automatically makes it a legitimate 'work'. There are a lot of structure that fit this criteria but aren't considered legitimate lines of 'work' in our current societies, mainly slavery and child labor.

Slaves are compensated by having a roof to sleep under and food and sometimes medical treatement, child workers are also given monetary compensations for their labor. Which begs the question; why aren't they considered legitimate lines of 'work' despite them fitting the criteria for compensation that all current legitimate lines of work do ?

The answer lies in the connotations, exploitation, power imbalance and inherent degradation of the group of people involved in these institutions, and the social implications for the demographic they belong to, whether it's from the race, gender, or age angle.

Based on the same line of thought we can reach the exact same conclusion about prostitution (real or digital), it inevitably contributes to the cultural notion of women being sexual objects for men to consume, and it certainly dehumanizes women as a whole.

The difference between gold digging and prostitution is non-existent and yet i don't see any calls to stop Gold Digging.

No one is against stuff like Ivakaa marrying a fossil for money because she's making bank.

So, i conclude that no one's actually against ""prostitution"" but rather, people just want to make sure Women maximize their Sexual Profits and guys trying to get a cheap fuck are seen as cheaters of Sex Economics. The only difference between the John Doe the walmart manager going to a call girl and Trump is that the latter is filthy rich, so that means he has paid ""the price"" Liberal Culture deems *enough* to purchase Sex from a Woman.  

Illegal Prostitution is bad, that's why Govt should legalize it and make it safe for Women. BUT, i don't see any supporters for that, most people just want to keep it banned. Because like i said, people want Men to pay the ""correct price"" for Sex.

jhcmrq2,t1_jhakvco,2023-04-23 03:11:30,stupidpol,"I’d take issue with the idea that religion is the primary source of sexual conventions; there is undeniably a psychological antecedent to this kind of Puritanism upon which religious norms are based (granted, cultural factors do have the ability to turn the dial way up).

If we ignore this, then we risk making the argument that religion has suppressed natural desire, and capitalism is here to liberate those desires by eroding cultural conventions regarding sex and relationships. The problem then is that this amounts only to submission to the system, and whatever new, highly commercialised norms it offers in place of the old: a world in which it’s accepted that the human body is a commodity like any other.

The obverse argument is that there is some natural base and utility to sexual/romantic norms, and that capitalism has set its sights upon contorting another part of human nature towards its own ends. Arguing for the normalisation of sex work as akin to any other form of labour would only serve the interest of capitalism’s projects of assimilation and social disintegration.

So the argument against a liberalisation of attitudes towards sex work needn’t be based on the sanctity of the sexual act. Instead, it can be based upon suspicion towards capitalism’s propensity to contort and assimilate natural human behaviour to serve its own ends. If it has already successfully subjugated and alienated billions of unskilled labourers, why would we gleefully give up more ground? 

You made a great point about how natural cooperative instincts are exploited in order to coerce people into menial jobs. Is it not also the case that capitalism also tries to hijack natural sexual/romantic instincts towards similar ends: towards the wilful commodification of one’s own body, the consumption of other bodies, and the abandonment of natural desire for a new world of hyperdrive, commercialised desire?

Surely the conclusion of your argument should be that we need to undo existing ills — to create new taboos against exploitative labour, rather than abandon existing ones. Otherwise the only result is new category on the list of socially ratified exploitation.

I actually just this moment realised you said “rightly seen as an injury to their personhood,” so it seems like you do actually agree with the above. 

Edit: realised this needed clarified.

On the original point about the angle of approach, the answer likely lies somewhere in the middle. Meaning, there certainly are some puritanical religious conventions which run counter to natural desire and can happily be disintegrated (homophobia for one). 

However, sex work and pornography seem to — rather than simply serve natural desire — contort and exacerbate it to extreme levels, in order to supplant the original object of that desire with plastic surrogates. This commercialised version of sexuality can be objected to without deferring to Puritanism. My position, which I now realise you probably share, isn’t that sex work is horrible or unclean, just undesirable for the individual (even if learned desires gleaned from culture demand otherwise).

The point was not to defend sexual Puritanism as natural, but to show that lumping all objections under its umbrella risks throwing out some crucial nuance.",Zealousideal_Pool_65,t2_7zd1r5wm,2,0,reddit4
jhd3fpo,t1_jhakvco,2023-04-23 06:06:25,stupidpol,"I know I’m writing a double reply, but the thing you said about human cooperative psychology being hijacked has had me thinking all morning. 

I read a newspaper opinion piece where someone talked about wanting to be ‘productive to society’ into their old age. This has always seemed a limp sort of phrase to me: to what extent is most work ‘productive’ towards increasing the wellbeing of others? 

Much of it is actively detrimental, propping up systems which slowly (in the case of working for an environmental polluter) or quickly (in the case of working for a missile manufacturer) erode quality of life for other people, and human ‘society’ as a whole. So why is it that we default to the idea that work brings a net good?

Your point seems like a solid explanation for the prevalence of that strange little modern slogan: we are inherently programmed to see work as a social good, even when it is insignificant or harmful to the greater good, because within the far smaller social structures of the distant past, every contribution would have been essential, and we were never so estranged from the consequences of our actions that we could ignore the net negative effects they had on our little societies (whereas now, in a vast and complex world, these negative effects are so remote from us; the guy who solders the chips for a Tomahawk missile doesn’t have to then watch it blow up a farmhouse).

Can I ask where you first read about this link between human cooperative psychology and its exploitation under capitalism? It’s something that’s never occurred to me and I’d like to read up on it some more.",Zealousideal_Pool_65,t2_7zd1r5wm,1,0,reddit4
jhci5oc,t1_jhai849,2023-04-23 02:31:37,stupidpol,"Of course it is. But that’s the same laziness again: “all instincts = all instincts.” There are obvious qualitative differences here too.

1. Who’s getting paid to eat? I assume you’re talking about the consumer’s end, but in a sex work transaction, both parties participate in the same act. Within the category of sex work there are obviously different dynamics at play across a broad range of transactions, but just see the original post above for a typical exploitative example: a person offers their body for consumption, a consumer consumes. The fact that food is often used as the comparison is telling of the processes of objectification at play.

2. Just because physical energy is spent on other jobs producing commodities, it doesn’t necessarily make them the same as jobs where the body *itself* is the commodity. Commodification of the body is not the same as exertion of the body in the production of commodities. You might argue otherwise, but it’s crucial for you to identify then resolve this difference, rather than ignore it entirely.

3. Participation in sex work is not a feminist nor anti-capitalist statement, *even if* the person enriches themself in the process. Capitalism is not some abstract force or shady organisation, it exists within the socioeconomic relations between people. It thrives particularly when individuals are successfully coerced into disintegrating existing social relations and overriding their personal desire in service to it (or rather, allowing a new world of commercialised desire to supplant their basic desire). The system guides the will of the individual, and makes them its agent. Participation in sex work as a form of anti-capitalist ‘liberation’ is nothing of the sort: it is a actually just an thoroughly enthusiastic form of submission to, and validation of, the system. What you’re arguing for is greater submission to the system — an end to resistance against its project of social disintegration.

4. Sex drive has a far greater connection to socialisation than the drive to eat. Despite what certain sects of eccentrics might argue, there are psychological antecedents for ‘moralistic’ phenomena such as monogamy, sexual shame and modesty; to wave these away as ‘capitalist constructs’ misses the point that all human activity is a *natural construct*. This might seem intolerable to some because…
- A. It seems to invite a naturalistic justification for all prevailing injustices (which it needn’t: this is an incorrect conflation of the natural with the good)
- B. It appears too fatalistic and grim — we much prefer humanist grand narratives of transcendence and willpower. 


Given that last point, the task as I see it is to examine these psychological antecedents and…
- A. Determine to what degree they are instinctive, and how much they are learned/reinforced in culture.
- B. Determine if they are desirable, or something that would be better of ‘edited out’ of humanity, were that possible, or suppressed in the meantime. (Rape being an obvious one)
- C. Ask ourselves to what end we would be trying to restructure these psycho-social drives and the resulting social structures: who would benefit, who would lose out, and would it be for the simple good of the individual or in the service of ideology?

In the case of sex work, that very last point is absolutely critical. Because the liberalisation of attitudes towards sex work has the very real potential to act purely in the interests of capital, which would happily erode all social relations beneficial to the individual, so that it can sell plastic surrogates in their places. If done with the attitude you espouse, it would only serve this project of commodifying all things — even the human body.

The kind of universal equivalence you’re arguing with only serves that end. It’s not the argument of a critic of capitalism, but a capitalism apologist. That much should really be clear even on the surface level, because ‘normalising’ sex work inevitably means more of it happening. If your argument is “it’s just the same as working at a fast food place” then what’s essentially being said is “we should accept this taboo form of exploitation as equal to mainstream forms of exploitation.” So the result is not an end to exploitation, but a net increase: a new boom in the market. 

We can’t just reject any counter-arguments as moral Puritanism. The arguments might appear to echo some of the petty moralists’ sentiments, but that’s because both positions to some extent recognise the utility of the social conventions being eroded, and are suspicious of the motives of the people/system eroding them. The position I’ve outlined here doesn’t rely on moral arguments, but does recognise the power of capitalism to steamroll and exploit all things, even the basest human instincts, for its own ends. 

Again, all of these points are only the starting point for a more interesting conversation. That conversation begins only if we can avoid smothering all nuance under this kind of laissez fair liberalism: “everything = everything, and it’s all good.”",Zealousideal_Pool_65,t2_7zd1r5wm,0,0,reddit4

>Prostitution is an industry where men feel the most justified in dehumanizing women

This is an overly absolutist statement which further implies that men are correct to ""dehumanise"" in this context, that it's a legitimate responce to the situation. Further with my objections to ""sexual objectification"" as a theory, I object to ""dehumanisation"" too as a explaination for violence in general. In fact the ""objectification"" theory is based on the earlier idea wartime violence is enabled by ""dehumanisation"" without recognising the innate difference between dropping bombs on a city of invisable strangers and attacking someone one you are in intimate contact with. 

I should add that the term ""objectification"" is used in a number of different contexts, originally feminists used it to describe how they were assumed to like or perfect certain ""feminine"" activities, regardless of their individual preferences or skills, simply because they were women. They were expected to be good cooks, or want to make the tea, simply because they were women, the ""object"" in that case was ""woman"" itself not the physical body.

All work is an invasion of your free will, your body and mind are exploited to directly benefit someone else.

I could have elaborated that even more but (a) time; (b)  people wouldnt read it and (c) I'd be accused of being pretentious.

Further to that , It's also reiterating points which have been made by other commentators all over this thread and  in the literature  about all kinds of 'free' work involving 'selling the body' (not just labour time but exposure to dangerous substances, to mental health stresses, humiliation etc), and all kinds of formally 'free' personal relationships actually involving levels of exchange- that isn't to apologize for either of those kinds of alienation but to contextualise the discussion. If you want to make this a special exception, then  I wouldn't  even disagree with this (though I think a thomist/neothomist perspective is stronger on this than ordinary marxism in terms of the dignity of the body making sex work inadmissible, rather than  potentially leaving space for a 'non-alienated' form after capitalism) ,  but  you have to say why and take into account continuums of exploitation .  What's the point of having a discussion if you're just going to dismiss  it after a paragraph as apologetics for coercing women into sex work (especially since the first line was essentially 'abolish prostitution')!   It just reduces the whole debate to a binary of 'sex work is empowerment', just with rad lib and marxist variations,  vs 'any work that involves intimacy is exploitataion, in all worlds and under all circumstances, and any man that seeks it out is automatically a predator'. 

My position is that we should develop a society in which prostitution isn't solicited, and people are in a position to undertake healthy relationships without being guaranteed intimacy; in those circumstances there might also still be a space for  intimacy counsellors, in the same way that those roles actually exist (practised by women with postgraduate degrees in psychology and in psychologists offices) using a  combination of language and the haptic, but have been largely confined to the wealthy, to deal with intimacy issues as a psych intervention, but that even the post-capitalist existence of this kind of work is something I had reservations about. I'm with Mark Fisher that mental-health ( including loneliness, frustrated desire) should be  dealt with through reorienting society, including anticapitalist work structures but also political  consciousness raising (and therefore including the kinds of feminism I presume you would support which is working against 'objectifying' the other )  rather than personalized and pathologized..and neoliberal.

ji63rzc,t1_jhaj6gq,2023-04-29 10:44:37,stupidpol,"Great points. I think the argument that the other person is making (poorly) is that moral standards are arbitrary, and that there is no material basis for the aversion to sex work beyond a kind of Victorian moral Puritanism. 

They essentially believe that there would be no psychic distress attached to these acts, if these taboos were expunged from the culture. The believe that these attitudes are just arbitrary, mutable cultural trends which (perhaps over some generations) can simply evaporate without consequence. 

The missing link on our end is the argument that there are psychological antecedents for these social-cultural attitudes to sex work. The social structures of monogamy, aversion to sex work, etc. are not entirely self-suspended constructs, but ones which are derived from human psychology itself.

That is the only possible explanation for the general uniformity of these institutions across the entire world, for all of recorded history. Therefore, the idea that all social constructs are arbitrary and must be destroyed is shown as nonsense.

………

Side note, in regard to the other person’s argument. 

In the past, I’ve seen countries like Japan and Korea — where sex work is much closer to the mainstream — used as examples of an idyllic world in which Christian sexual taboos never existed. This is supposed to represent a sort of model of taboo-free sex work, and prove that there is no essential aversion to these things in human psychology (meaning they are purely cultural and mutable).

However, they miss the point that the attitudes to sex work in these places are still generally disdainful. What’s more, they’re not a product of progressive liberalism, but exploitative conservatism. In Japan particularly, the conservative, anti-feminist culture is extremely strong. Think 1950s America. 

Women here have their psychology actively and intentionally morphed into the shapes that Japanese society deems acceptable for them. These are housewife, salarywoman, and prostitute. Two out of three exist solely for the service of men. This is actual patriarchy, in the most dictionary definition sense.

This really seems to suggest that liberalised attitudes to sex work only actually act in favour of male domination, and the exploitation of women, rather than the inverse.

The sex industry in Japan also represents a kind of turbocharged ultra-consumerism. It’s living proof that liberalisation of attitudes towards sex work not only acts in favour of female exploitation, but also directly in the interests of capitalism.

The so-called feminist, anti-capitalist sex work advocates are actually patriarchy/capitalism’s most zealous agents!",Zealousideal_Pool_65,t2_7zd1r5wm,1,0,reddit4

It was my first time ever going on a date, so I didn't do great, but I did really enjoy myself and I felt like even if I didn't give an A+ performance, the girl still enjoyed our conversation (we talked at length about a lot of common interests, but I think that I didn't do quite enough in terms of asking questions to get to know her). Then when I messaged her on the dating app asking about a second date, she left me on read for 3 days and then unmatched me without saying a word.  I was left with literally no feedback about how to improve.

I'm currently in the process of trying to get a first date with a girl I'm matched with who seems like my type, but she seemingly only checks the app every few days, so I have to keep sending messages into the void and hoping she eventually responds.

According to Marx, it was historically constituted as the enemy of the proletariat. 

The lumpenproletariat is generally composed of “a mass completely distinct from the industrial proletariat, a nursery of thieves and of all sorts of criminals, living off of society’s waste : ""individuals without a chosen profession, drifters, people without vows and without home, differing according to the degree of culture in every nation, never belying the character of scoundrels”  (The Class Struggles in France).

He also clearly states that : “**Prostitution is a relation where it is not only the prostitute who is degraded, but also the john, whose ignominy is all the greater**,” (Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844).

From these two extracts above, it's reasonable to deduce that Marx placed prostitution under the category of lumpenproletariat , which entails that prostitution is not placed in a “positive” class of work, in that the work does not constitute an achievement for humans; and secondly, that it is distinct from the proletariat. In these conditions, it does not even fit the definition of a “negative” type of work, as it exists under the auspices of capitalism.

Another reason is that men in their obstinate refusal to acknowledge women's grievances and instead chosing to demonize the feminists who speak about those same grievances, made it clear that men have no interest in trying to empathize with women, nor admit anything is wrong with their socialization and attitudes towards women.

jhbwpng,t1_jhbn69b,2023-04-22 23:32:33,stupidpol,">the deteriorating economic conditions paired with this rising tide of gender hatred and contempt on both sides is undoubtedly crushing healthier expressions of sexuality.

This is true, but the truth is that one side is angry because they feel like they lost control over the opposite sex, and see themselves as deserving of such control and the other side is angry because of the outrage and disappointement they feel when they realize the other sex views them as little more than sexual objects they still feel entitled to control. These are real concerns here.

It's not because both sides are angry that their angers are equivalent, one side's anger is possessive, the other side's anger is defensive.

Another important factor that led the anger on women's side to be amplified is pornography. The themes and acts performed within pornography didn't developp in a vacuum, they are the exact reflections of the desires of porn's large male consumer base. Porn is the way that it is because men go to it's platforms and vote with their views, if men didn't see misogyny and the degradation of womanhood as intrinsic to their sexual entertainement, the themes of porn would have been very different from what they are today.

Let's not forget that porn as an industry within a capitalist system is a feedback loop, meaning that it accomodates the requirements of the demand in order to subsist and maximize its profit.

Porn didn't create the  cancer that is misogyny, machismo and women's dehumanization, porn is only a manifestation of the already existing ills within male-dominated cultures, mainly the deep-seated hate and control lust men felt toward women for millennia. Porn is the symptom, not the cause, it is not a free- thinking, sentient being that exists independently by itself. It is created and constantly molded by men as they constitute the majority of its consumer base.

Porn is awful. It definitely is responsible for the exploitation and abuse of untold women and children. It exacerbates the sexual deviance of men. It is absolutely responsible for the trends of abusive sexual assault we see masquerading as kink. But it did not CREATE these things.

With these realizations, it became much harder to think of male depravity as something only a few remote men engage in and entertain, it became so much harder to ignore the connection between men's internalised machismo and the collective manifestation of their sexual preferences in porn. This is true for the women in China as well, if you go to their subreddits you'll find that they are concerned with this problem among others.

Do you blame us for feeling fear and disgust towards men as a sex class while knowing the fantasies they entertain and bring to the top of every porn site ? I personally wouldn't blame any woman who choses to desist from a risky dating scene.",shedernatinus,t2_4xgvt5z3,0,0,reddit4

What you are ignoring is that there's a large number of these men who are attractive and can have access to whoever they want, but still prefer to buy sex , because according to many of them, it's more about the power trip that comes along with getting sex at the push of a button than the act of sex itself. 

Many male sex buyers buy sex because it gives them absolute control and enables them to do whatever they can, that they no longer can endure having sex with non-prostituted women since they are too ""emancipated"" and will demand to be treated as individuals.

&#x200B;

>Not because sexless men have some unalienable right to sex, but because, at some point, they’re are gonna start causing trouble.

Concerning the sexually frustrated men who turn violent as a 'result' of said frustration, here's a fact  worth mentioning : Sexual frustration on its own doesn't guarantee that the individual experiencing it will turn resentful, violent or murderous. It's more related to the way the individual processes his feelings of frustration and the kind of mechanism he adopts to overcome them. If the individual deeply believes society 'owes' him a partner and feels entiteled to this mindset, any instance where his expectations aren't fulfilled will trigger disapointment, then anger and possibly even violence.

The emergence of incels can easily be explained by these evident factors, which are also a byproduct of the way culture shapes masculinity and codifies male sexuality  and male sexual experiences as accomplishment and personal elevation. Something the vast majority of men internalised to varying degrees while growing. Knowing this, it's only natural to expect many men interpreting their 'inability' to reach such 'achievements' as a shameful personal shortcoming and a 'stain' on their worth and 'masculinity'. 

This vision only becomes magnified and more pronounced in the particular case of online spaces and echochambers known for encompassing like-minded individuals, who are probably struggling with similar issues and who won't understand the full nuance and complexity of socio-cultural issues enough to pinpoint the origin of their problem. What will happen instead is that they will focus on their feelings of disapointment, anger and violated masculine self-worth which will  lead to exacerbating hate and anger and finally the need to exteriorize these emotions.",shedernatinus,t2_4xgvt5z3,0,0,reddit4

MacKinnon was influenced by Marxism, yes, but only by borrowing its methodological approach, substituting Marxist concepts with feminist ones (e.g.: proletariat-> women, bourgeoisie -> men, capitalist accumulation -> male sexual desire, etc).

“The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production. For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce the community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial. Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives. Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.”

Men can also have one night stands? The people I personally know who date around the most and sleep around the most are males so I’m not sure why you think it’s the other way around. Maybe you interact with men who don’t date but in my experience, most young men don’t struggle as much as you imply to find dates or one night stands.

Idk why you think prostitution provides intimacy when it’s literally a transactional encounter with someone who is only doing it for $$$. Any man paying for sex knows at some basic level the person they’re fucking doesn’t actually want to do it, hence why they’re paying for it. What is so intimate about that? 

And who judges men for buying sex toys? Where is this notion coming from? Do you honestly think women aren’t shamed for their sexuality? What? Male sexual interest is glorified if anything. It’s in advertisements, men who sleep around are considered alpha, etc. and the market to feed the male sex drive is endless. To the point that actual human beings (porn actresses and prostitutes) are commodities in this very thriving and insatiable market. Not sure why you think men who want sex are somehow shamed for it.

jhc0itj,t1_jhatzxg,2023-04-23 00:03:45,stupidpol,">Concerning the sexually frustrated men who turn violent as a 'result' of said frustration, here's a fact  worth mentioning : Sexual frustration on its own doesn't guarantee that the individual experiencing it will turn resentful, violent or murderous. It's more related to the way the individual processes his feelings of frustration and the kind of mechanism he adopts to overcome them.

Yeah sure, but this is kind of like saying that poverty doesn't cause violence because individuals have the choice of not being violent. We know that that's true, and violence shouldn't be excused, but we also know that the alleviation of poverty greatly decreases criminal activity. You can say that individuals can make their own choices while also recognizing that there are societal conditions pushing people in aggregate to make those bad choices.

Similarly with sexual frustration turning to violence, I've always thought that it's a symptom of the extreme loneliness that our society has created. Loneliness is a precursor to sexual frustration because so many people don't have the social skills or opportunities to find a partner or even make friends. 

I don't think anyone has a right to sex, but I actually do think that people have a right to friendship, not any friend in particular, but we need real life friend groups to keep us from going insane. The current [widespread loneliness](https://www.theringer.com/2022/11/29/23483319/why-america-is-suffering-a-friendship-recession) is a massive failing of our society and it's not surprising to me that it is breeding incels, increasing [suicides and deaths of despair](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/deaths-of-despair-on-the-rise-in-the-us-why-here-and-not-in-other-nations). People say that they want sex, but most of the time when you dig deep enough they just want intimacy, and that has more to do with friendship than the incels like to admit.

>The emergence of incels can easily be explained by these evident factors, which are also a byproduct of the way culture shapes masculinity and codifies male sexuality and male sexual experiences as accomplishment and personal elevation. Something the vast majority of men internalised to varying degrees while growing. Knowing this, it's only natural to expect many men interpreting their 'inability' to reach such 'achievements' as a shameful personal shortcoming and a 'stain' on their worth and 'masculinity'.

I just think that it's more fundamental than that. The 'achievement' piece is secondary to the fact that it's become much harder to form even the most basic relationships. That's something at the core of humanity and supersedes the cultural aspect. Even if it is expressed in a vile way through hyper masculinity, taking it at face value doesn't really get to the root of it.",mis_juevos_locos,t2_ce27g,12,0,reddit4

You can really only be one but not the other. Radical feminism rejects Marxism's belief in the primacy of class struggle (what is today often smeared as ""class reductionism""), substituting it with various theories about the oppressive nature of sex and sexuality. This is why MacKinnon criticizes Marxism and calls herself a ""post-Marxist,"" not a Marxist *per se*. She basically just opportunistically used Marxism for her own purposes, while rejecting its entire political program. 

>They both agree on the abolition of prostitution and other industries that commodify women's bodies, like surrogacy.

Kind of. Marxist feminists today generally recognize sex work and surrogacy as work, potentially very exploitative and degrading work, but not necessarily worse than other jobs. For an example of this, Silvia Federici [described this position well](https://sur.conectas.org/en/silvia-federici/#:~:text=I%20am%20aware,system%20of%20oppression). The abolition of prostitution and surrogacy is therefore inseparable from the abolition of all work as we know it under capitalism. They are in this sense unlike radical feminists, for whom prostitution is qualitatively different than other jobs, unworthy of the label ""work."" It is ""being raped for a living"" and must be done away with as a precondition of liberation, not as a consequence of it.",frackingfaxer,t2_eq2hi5rw,1,0,reddit4

I know Dworkin never literally wrote that ""all sex is rape."" I know it's not that simple, and I know she claimed that her point was that ""sex must not put women in a subordinate position.""

Your ""queen"" did, however, say that sexual intercourse was ""by its nature, violent."" She also suggested in chapter 7 of *Intercourse* that the violent and degrading physical mechanics of coitus made it ""immune to reform."" That is to say, even post-patriarchal coitus may not suffice; PIV intercourse might still ""subordinate"" women then. Luckily, as she suggests in the very next paragraph, developments in reproductive technology, e.g. cloning and artificial insemination, may make intercourse unnecessary for the continued existence of the human race. So why even try to save intercourse? And that's in some hypothetical future, mind you. Never mind her opinion of intercourse as it actually exists for us now living under her mythical patriarchy. So I'd say ""all sex is rape"" is pretty accurate shorthand for Dworkin's views on sex. Crude shorthand, perhaps. In longhand, it might be something like: *Nearly* all *heterosexual* sex is rape *as it exists now under conditions of patriarchy, and that might change after we overthrow patriarchy, but honestly I'm not sure, maybe it'll still be mostly rape then too.*

So what kind of heterosexual sex act is ok for us now? Dworkin suggested something without all that violent thrusting, suggesting instead ""a mutual lying together in pleasure… vagina-covering-penis, with female orgasm providing much of the stimulation necessary for male orgasm."" To the best of my knowledge, that was the only heterosexual sex act that Dworkin ever wrote approvingly of, and it's not described in detail how that would work exactly.

Men get their genitalia mutilated and nobody cares and it’s never talked about, men aren’t allowed to be raped in Britain because rape is defined as “forcible penetration”.

Then it's good idea to regulate the sector, create appropriate safety measures and also actually enforce the rules. The non-legal status of the business is one reason for the prevalence of cruelty, etc... in the industry.

The other one being that prostitution is often a last resort for (mostly) women without other economic options. That problem is a little bit harder to tackle, but as long there is poverty, there are going to be sex workers - legalized or not.

It's really not my intention to create an idealized vision of sex work - it's never going to be a popular career choice, it's just another crap job that would likely disappear if other options were available. But I doubt that (asymmetric nordic) criminalization is actually able to deliver on it's promise.

There are women who live to rescue a lonely, dysfunctional man and do their best to help them flourish. I know this because my first girlfriend was exactly this type. There are women who fetishize virginity, but admittedly at a much lower rate then men. I know of one. There are women who find lack of experience and awkwardness endearing for many reasons, but I believe the primary one is that it exudes an earnestness that the highly experience can lack. A highly experienced man often has developed a contrived persona that maximises his success with women, but being disingenuous is a recipe for a terrible relationship.

Best advice I can give you is as follows: be interesting, passionate, and enjoyable to be around. The more you are, the better your dating prospects are. It really is mostly true that ""girls just wanna have fun"". When talking to women, listen intently and ask questions more than you talk yourself. Most people love to talk about themselves, and being somewhat withholding gives you a mystique that many women find irresistible (you can drop the mystique and talk more once you get close, the ""trick"" is getting a woman invested in you, once they are things become much easier and intuitive). The dating apps are a hellscape because you are competing against potentially hundreds of men, but they are probably still worth using just to give yourself more chances. Find a real life hobby with a favorable gender ratio and just try and befriend women you find appealing. Not even with the intention of pursuing them romantically, just try and be a good friend to them, because a female friend is a thing to cherished. They might even set you up with dates if they like you. The ""friend zone"" is mostly a myth, if you get along with a woman, and she finds you passably attractive, you have real hope of developing a romance. Take a genuine interest in her, and ask questions that reveal you are listening to what she says and thinking about it. Also, a hobby is a much lower pressure way of interacting with women, far less so than a date when you are being constantly assessed. If you are black pilled, keep it to yourself at least until your relationship has a solid foundation.  Lastly, don't give up. Modern dating is a mess, but finding a loving partner is worth trudging through hell.

Sounds like they had plenty of fun. Sure, it's a bit weird and maybe a tad hypocritical for a political lesbian and a gay man to do this, but I'm not one to judge people's sex lives, odd as they might be. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for her. She took her own personal experiences and her own aversion to intercourse and universalized them, insisting that we all follow her example and believe what she did.

My rejection of Dworkinism has nothing to do with my personal opinion of her. I brought up her personal life, not as some ad hominem attack, but in an attempt to make sense of her extremist opinions which are, to the vast majority of people, nonsensical and utterly divorced from reality. I think that's fair game, especially given her own aforementioned weaponization of her unusual personal life.

Well, ""copulation"" is an already existing term. ""Penetration"" is just one synonym for sexual intercourse among many others. If you want a new term, may I suggest, to paraphrase Camille Paglia, ""devourment""? Her description of intercourse as man ""being devoured by woman"" provides a good antithesis to Dworkin's description of it as a ""violent"" ""occupation."" 

>and two , sexual intercourse shouldn't be the mean focus of heterosexual interactions.

Well, that brings us full circle to the topic of the social construction of sexuality. I'm fairly certain that the centrality of sexual intercourse in human sexuality (or to put it in the vernacular, the fact that we really like to fuck) predates patrilineal class society (""the patriarchy"") and is therefore not a patriarchal social construct that was invented to oppress women. After all, you see this in our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, and they supposedly live in a matriarchy. But that's just me.

No, racial politics are material politics. All politics are material politics. So you're either for improving material conditions or you aren't.

the problem is that she applies this philosophy to center-right Democrats too—I've seen her gushing plenty of times over *speeches* that Joe Biden made, even as he followed through on absolutely none of the shit he promised & continued leading the country's decades-long march further and further to the right

I even saw her once literally lift a quote directly from Bernie and attribute it instead to Biden in order to paint him as *way* more progressive than the guy's ever actually been

if she wants to position herself as some kind of prominent figure on the American left, then she's gotta actually lead—rally the people, organize everybody, and start getting them engaged in real direct on-the-ground action that presents a genuine, honest-to-god challenge to establishment power—and until she does, I have a real hard time seeing her as anything except a pressure release valve to help people feel like maybe there's some hope that if we just hang on long enough, somebody will show up to rescue us

Liberalism is all about virtue signaling. These people have, in their refusal to acknowledge their complete and total lack of political autonomy and the myriad ways the system has shut out true democratic participation, created straw man issues to take stances and vote on/for/towards/against, not because of the meaningful changes they'll have on society (because this is an exercise in refusing to see that we don't actually have that kind of say) but simply for the self-image it creates. I can think of myself as an upstanding, moral individual doing 'what I can' within a society that just happens to find itself in a dog-eat-dog world (it couldn't possibly be the other way around). Sure, I can't solve world hunger but I can stand up for a marginalized transgendered femqueer bi-curious person of color (who never asked me to, by the way). I can't fix the economy or end the wars but I can let everybody on Facebook know that I absolutely support a woman's right to an abortion.

And the last thing, the very last thing that they'll ever see is that this false politics they engage in comes at the expense of the real politics they deny themselves in sleep. Which is why they're allowed and encouraged to engage in it.

Anecdotal, but I ended up at universal studios in Florida where they have the Harry Potter world or whatever, and it was consistently the most packed part of the park. There was a lot of cringe adults walking around in capes, I’m not a fan of the IP, but it is very well realized and the people there really seemed to love it, adults and kids. I bet if I surveyed 1000 people there asking about JK Rowling’s views on trans people, lots of the people would say “who?” (The movies are the biggest component of the IP, most people may know that Jurassic Park was a book but can’t name Michael Crighton), even more would say “what are you talking about?” Maybe a few would offer some kind of engagement with the concept, but it simply doesn’t matter to 99% of people.

That's what gets to me about this and other ""bad person getting my money?!?!"" freakouts. I always see it in the context of health. Going by the stats, it's almost certain that anyone complaining about Rowling is also buying tons of unhealthy packaged/fast food. Food that the people making it know is destroying the health of their customers. Who deliberately manipulate a million different PR angles to hook people early on before they have the ability to make an informed decision. And who, because of that, will usually never be able to learn how to consume that kind of thing in moderation. Or learn the skills needed to design recipes or cook healthy alternatives that should be the base of their diet. 

I know that this can come off as hyperbole. But it really is analogous to the tobacco companies who were hiding the health risks for as long as they could from a public that they knew wouldn't be jumping into medical journals for the latest studies. Hell, a lot of the people who led the strategies in that industry jumped into packaged food and drink later on. It's especially wild when you look at people's probable causes of death. Unhealthy lifestyles are going to be what first destroys the health of most people. And, likewise, what eventually kills them after decades of reduced quality of life. 

In short, the people complaining that an author is mean are literally giving money to the companies who'll kill them. They'll give tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to reward their own murderer and encourage them to keep doing it to others. But actual evil is excusable while being a big meanie (according to them) isn't. 

I get that I'm a bit biased because I actually see the end result of people's unhealthy lifestyles. But it's a bias born of seeing the reality that our culture tries to keep hidden away.",toothpastespiders,t2_a2uzegb8,12,0,reddit4

Yeah I also found that funny. Rowling is obviously a very liberal individual, her paranormal world isn't threatened by some cool lovecraftian horror but basically by magical nazis.

j4ctuy6,t1_j4bdwsk,2023-01-14 20:29:03,stupidpol,"I would argue it's because the vast majority of these culture warrior types were raised on JKR's fiction and all the subsequent knockoffs of her fiction trying to replicate her success. Harry Potter was like a cult, but it was also a giant allegory. If you've read any of the novels you see it almost right away.

The ""weird"" and ""different"" people, the misfits who don't fit in and get punished for who they are in the real world, well turns out they're actually unique, special and powerful. And because of that they are whisked off to a special world where everyone is a little different just like them, and they become the heroes of their own story. Any of that sound familiar?

That's a pretty powerful narrative shift from past fiction. The message wasn't  *""just believe in yourself""* or *""it's okay to be different""* anymore. With Harry Potter JKR was saying *""Being different is not only okay, it's highly preferable to being 'normal' which is now the worst thing ever. So be as different as possible because it's the only credential you need to be loved and accepted""*

You take that kind of messaging, throw in the fact that the internet and social media have made it almost impossible for an individual to stand out in any meaningful way, then add a couple decades, two financial crises and a broken home and I'd argue that's a pretty good recipe for the kind of behavior we are seeing from people now. If the real world isn't exactly like Harry Potter... then just force it until it is! They don't understand that the Harry Potter franchise didn't become a sensation because it was revealing some important truth about how we should live our lives, it became a sensation because it made a metric shit ton of money feeding people's fantasies.

So now they're pissed at JKR because they wanted her to be their queen. The ""Queen of Legitimacy"" who says it's okay to dress like a wizard and legally change your gender to werewolf. The Queen of *""I'll do whatever the hell it takes to stand out and I want to force everyone in the world to accept me for it""* A surrogate mother for a bunch of lost, confused 35 year old adult children if you will. The much needed roll of flex tape to keep reality from seeping into the boat.

But nope, she snubbed them on something they consider basic like gender because oh turns out it doesn't matter what feel good crap she wrote in Harry Potter she's still a stuffy British boomer with more money than god and no desire to associate with the types of people who she writes about. So now she's persona non grata, you don't just *stop* feeding a raccoon, they get pissed. Not that I imagine JKR cares all that much though, because again, she's swimming Scrooge McDuck style in a pool full of gold doubloons.

I just need to mention the fan service at the heart of the HP franchise. In real life bullying is not an unusual phenomenon, a vast chunk of the population is subject to bullying of some kind particularly when you include social attacks not just from peers but also some parents, teachers, older children, co-workers, bosses, and in a sense society itself. It is actually pretty common to be a target at some point in one’s formative years. In contrast, the HP franchise presents being the target of bullying as not only rare, but evidence of how special, unique, morally worthy, and literally magical the victim is. HP himself suffers through bullying without putting up direct resistance until a magical force literally swoops in from the sky to provide him with all the good things he inherently deserves. His primary target and the nemesis of the franchise is not his bullies, who he merely needed to tolerate and outlast, but a distant villain he initially knows nothing about until being socially informed of their crimes.

There’s a lesson here about the social position of the fan base as abused working-to-middle class wage laborers taking their cue from society instructing them to direct their hate *away* from those actually abusing them on a day to day basis and towards the target already held by the socially credentialed of their special ingroup.",animals_are_dumb,t2_4v8aon06,40,0,reddit4

Didn’t seem like either of those were intentional at all, but rather she was just hopping on board of whatever hype was going on to remain relevant.

That doesn’t change that this position, the one she holds and that you and me see as reasonable, is still unacceptable. It doesn’t matter that she acknowledges their hardship and supports them. That’s not what this is about. This is about whether JK sees trans people as 100% equivalent to people born into the gender they’re transitioning to. 

All the nice supportive things JK says about trans people always have a “but” attached. The “but” being that JK still sees a fundamental difference between a trans woman and a woman who was born a woman. And this is evident in her positions to for example womens shelters where she does not think trans women should be allowed (as a side note I think this has an easy solution but one people won’t like: let individual shelters *vote* on whether they want to allow trans women. My guess is that given the dominant ideologically trends, it would result in most shelters allowing trans women). 

The logic at play here is one that sees an acknowledgment of difference as the first step in process that ends in extreme persecution of trans people. It’s just a slippery slope argument at the end of the day. It’s based on fear and the unknown, that’s why it’s kind of impossible to argue against. Outside of a fortune telling sphere (idk what they’re called) no one can tell them that this won’t happen, it’s infalsificable. Thus they take the position that if we all believe trans women are the exact same as bio women, then this risk cannot materialize. Acknowledging the difference is seen as opening the door to this worst case scenario. “The Jews didn’t go to the camps in the beginning, they were labeled first”. 

That’s why you can show these people all the times JK has said good things about trans people, and it means nothing to them. It’s not really about what she has said, it’s about what she *wont* say: trans women *are* women.",,,2,0,reddit4

Speaking as a TERF, I agree with you. But Reddit is unfortunately still kind of mainstream, and it's important to have our voice heard by as many people as possible.

Like, I never watch cable news. Even if it weren't an outdated and useless format, the bias these days from both sides is off the charts. But any non-Fox news outlet talking honestly about the problems that surround the issue in question is *always* huge. So even *if* cable news isn't worth watching (and pretty much unsalvagable at this point), a LOT of older people still watch TV for some reason. So it's always good to be heard there, because we need to be heard by as many people as we can get.

So yeah. The same logic kind of applies to Reddit. So I'm actually with the jannie on this one.

They powers that be are probably gonna ban us from this site eventually. And when they do, it'll probably be the day I finally leave Reddit for good.

Shitlibs cannot have such consistency, because it’s a hindrance to their one most central and most actionable ideal: to abhor anything that falls into “not okay” territory, and light aflame anything even peripheral to it. Hence why they can’t even enjoy a book with the author’s name on it because she said things they disagree with.  They lack the consistency to say, “it’s a damn shame I disagree with Rowling on this subject that is important to me, because man did I enjoy her books”. Instead, they have to go into pretend world where they can still love the books with all of their being while denying that they were written by the author, who they can’t reconcile disagreeing with on a subject- by shoehorning inconsistency into reality that attempts to camouflage their own.

A few years ago when I was tutoring high school students, one of my kids came in and said he had a movie he had to watch for class.  The movie in question was *Enemy at the Gates,* about Stalingrad.  The opening sequence is a massive, harrowing battle sequence considered by many to be the best WWII scene this side of Saving Private Ryan.  I would call it stimulating to say the least.

This kid, who was one of my favorites, and who seemed significantly more emotionally mature than his peers, let the scene play out on his laptop while his eyes were glued to his IG.

So there you have it, teenage boys aren't even interested in blood death and destruction anymore.  There isn't a movie in existence, let alone a book, that can draw the average kid's attention away from their phone.

People like to play meta-contrarian and rag on boomer ""phones bad"" memes, and yeah, obviously Facebook boomers aren't posting with your preferred ""theoretical grounding"" or whatever.  What I've seen makes such complaints seem utterly pedantic.  **Phones Bad**, never apologize or feel embarrassed for saying it.

Parenting: you’ve nailed it. Whether it’s a conscious choice by some granola bitch or parents who are just disconnected and don’t fucking care, kids today have no discipline, drive, grit or anything really. They stare at their phones, they’re braindead zombies. Kids don’t have hobbies, interests, activities, fucking NOTHING beyond their goddamn phones. Membership in clubs, activities, and sports is at an all time low because their fucking phones didn’t tell them to do it. I’m a *bit* older (mid 30s) and I have a bit of a tech addiction myself, I won’t lie to you and pretend I’m a Luddite. But my GOD, these kids are completely helpless and it is because of lax parenting and them letting an iPad do it for them. Don’t give me any bullshit about single moms working 8 25 hour shifts per week, that’s not NEARLY as common as this sub and r/teachers leads you to believe. My wife is pregnant with our first, and we are in lockstep on being firm but fair and severely limiting screen time, this is our child not our friend. Sure I’m “friends” with my parents now, but I am a fully grown man and their job of raising me ended 15 years ago. Calling parents doesn’t matter. Rich or poor, they don’t give a shit and the type of parent who’d be responsive and engaged when I call, I don’t need to talk to them anyway. My most memorable call was a parent who said “fuck you want me to do” when I called to report her kid throwing a chair at me for telling him to get off his phone. Idk, be a parent you ignorant sow? Which leads me to…


The board and the administrators:

These two can be addressed together. It is a MASSIVE problem as you said, you nailed all the reasons why and I don’t have that much to add. I can give an anecdote about the disasters of ReStOrAtIvE jUsTiCe though. I wasted a year of my career at a black inner city school with a woke af principal. She explicitly told us that standards of behavior and discipline were constructs of white supremacy and thus engaging in disciplining black kids for their “culture” was colonialism. This meant anything goes, and I mean anything. Lighting up a joint in my classroom? Principal gets on my ass for not being engaging enough to keep their attention. Constant theft? I had 45 TI 83 calculators. By October, every last one of them was gone. Blah blah struggle to survive. Oh horseshit, we had biweekly grocery giveaways to every single kid and they fished out the snack foods and threw the rest on the floor and we’d spend hours cleaning up the waste. Breakfast and lunch free, and students could come back to the school with their families for free dinner. Fuck off with this StRuGgLe bullshit. Violence? A ok, explicitly told us that African Americans solve their conflicts violently and to step aside. This included teachers. I had chairs thrown at me for failing grades, they’d get up and start swinging if I told them to put the phone away. Teachers would be reprimanded for being assaulted because that was proof we provoked the kid. Now this situation is obviously extreme, it is NOT the norm. But if shitlib portland style activists get their way, it WILL be the norm. 

The teachers: yeah I struggle a lot. But I’m a school now with a STRONG admin team, and we still struggle with the attitudes of the kids I detailed above, but our principal is a hardass and she refuses to accept that shit and backs us up.

The opposite is true. We're just lowering the skills necessary to obtain a college degree. Professors have the exact same pressures you talk about for the exact same reasons. ""Don't fail our paying customers! If they aren't passing, it's your fault!"" 

As a teaching assistant, my professor asked me to ""try not to fail anyone."" Barely acceptable papers easily became B+, while complete gibberish skated by receiving Cs. One time a student turned in a barely coherent paper that was obviously written for a different class and on a completely separate topic. My professor's advice? Give it a little more than half credit.

Teaching at a community college, I routinely had to grade papers by students who didn't even know where to put a thesis statement. The essays were full of basic spelling and grammar errors. Their comprehension of the actual material was abysmal. 

I'm talking like, I'd try to teach them about Descartes, and the assignment would simply ask them to write what Descartes said about something and restate it in their own words, and then take a stand on whether they agree with it. Please just tell me in the first paragraph what you're going to take a stand on and make it two pages. This should be so easy. I'd get a one page paper triple spaced, saying that ""Descarte"" thought only thinking things exist, but he's wrong because non-thinking things like rocks exist. I just...I don't know how to help people who clearly never should have graduated high school.

If I were being honest, 90% of them deserved to fail. But failing 90% of your students is a red flag for administrators who only care about student retention and number of degrees conferred.

ifsfitj,t3_vwt1na,2022-07-11 23:35:52,stupidpol,"This is from Mark Ames's book on mass shootings, *Going Postal*, from more than a decade and a half ago. I believe I posted this excerpt somewhere a while ago, but it would be of interest here as well, I think:

> The stress starts as soon as the child is born. Parents leverage themselves to get into the right school districts, which, like every facet of our post-Reagan society, are becoming increasingly segregated along socioeconomic lines. Theoretically school is free and open to all—but the cost of living in the right school district already acts as a kind of tuition surcharge—a massive tuition surcharge. A property’s attached school district can mean the difference in hundreds of thousands of dollars on each house. Parents have to work even harder and succeed even more in order to get their kids a decent education—to make sure they are poised to get the kind of job that will allow them to get their kids into the right school, thus maintaining this vicious lifestyle cycle. So in order to help their children get a leg up in this struggle, most parents today enroll their children in preschools.

> In the 1960s, only four percent of children were enrolled in preschools. Today, over two-thirds of three and four-year-olds are placed in preschools. But you can’t just be placed in any preschool anymore. Your child has to get placed—or rather accepted—into a top preschool in order to ensure that he or she gets into the right elementary school, which feeds into the right high school, which feeds into the right university. That means that the fight to get a child placed into the right preschool is savage. As soon as the diapers come off, the child is tossed into the cage match. Preschools now have admissions requirements. Many children have to write essays or take an IQ test, called the ERB, to qualify for these elite preschools and kindergartens. To prepare their children for the test, parents pay tutors or psychologists to acquaint their children with the types of questions expected in the entrance exams. Many kids are tutored in “pre-reading” classes to help them stand out against the others. Tuitions for preschools run in the thousands of dollars. Top New York City preschool tuitions range up to $15,000 or more, while even at a Chicago public school district preschool tuition was $6,500 per year, more than the tuition at the University of Illinois, according to Two Income Trap. The best nursery schools have long waiting lists and stringent requirements, including interviews with the child and parents. The pressure to get one’s child into the “right” preschool is seen as a prerequisite to putting the child on the path toward a top university, the only way to ensure that one’s child might avoid the middle-class vise. It isn’t just about being rich—it’s about ensuring that their children never have to suffer the misery of the middle-class vise. And it’s also about social prestige. Striving parents want to brag about which preschool their baby got accepted into just as badly as they want to brag about which university they get into later in life.

> Perhaps the most famous scandal surrounding a preschool involves the recent securities fraud case of Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill and star telecoms analyst Jack Grubman of Citigroup’s subsidiary, Solomon Smith Barney.

> First, a little background on Weill, one of the grand dukes of the post-Reagan feudal elite. In 1998, he earned $167 million as Citigroup’s chairman, just about the same time that his company was planning to downsize its workforce by 5 percent, and cut its remaining employees’ 401K plans, pensions, and other benefits. Weill’s success in transferring wealth from employees to his pocket clearly went to his head. In 1999, Weill pressured Grubman in 1999 to raise his rating of AT&T’s stock in order to curry favor with AT&T’s CEO, who also sat on the board of Citigroup. (Weill was in a vicious boardroom battle at the time, and he needed all the allies he could get.) Weill’s offer was this: if Grubman would lie to investors about what a bargain AT&T stock was, Weill promised to help Grubman’s children get accepted into a prestigious Manhattan nursery school. Grubman, who earned a $20 million bonus in his best year at Solomon, complained that the nursery school was “harder than Harvard to get into.” Since Citigroup had donated $1 million to the school, Weill was able to successfully wield his influence, getting both of Grubman’s children in.

> “I tried to help Mr. Grubman because he was an important employee who had asked for my help,” Weill admitted. In other words, countless numbers of Americans, perhaps tens of thousands or more, were tricked into buying lousy stock resulting in untold millions lost—so that an analyst could get his children into the right preschool. This was one of the biggest Wall Street scandals of the last few years—and the silliest. Yet it was also a grotesque reminder of how far the culture’s pressure-cooked insanity had reached: even babies are no longer safe!

> It may seem ridiculously funny, but the competition can be devastating—for the children, and for the parents who pass their disappointment and stress onto their children, as revealed in a New York magazine article about an ambitious couple and their four-year-old boy named Andrew:

> “I doubted myself; maybe I overestimated my kid,” Cynthia admits, referring to her disappointment when Andrew’s scores arrived in the mail. “Maybe I’m looking at him with loving eyes, and maybe I’m wrong. He’s very cute and animated and bright. But maybe that doesn’t mean he’s smart in an academic sense. I stopped trying with him. Before, we’d talk about the days of the week, or I would try to get into more detailed discussions. Now I felt it wasn’t going to make any difference. I was so disappointed.”

> Although this post-diaper rat race has proved a boon to entrepreneurs— standardized test prep course programs, baby psychologists, and the shareholders in these expensive preschools all reap massive windfalls—it has demoralized traditional educators.

> As the head of one preschool program explained in the same article: “I used to think it would get worse and worse and then get better. But now I know it gets worse and worse and worse and worse.”

> An educator who works with the Saratoga school district told me that the high school is under constant and intense pressure to achieve top scores on the standardized tests in order to maintain its top ranking in the state. The reason is obvious. If the school is ranked at the top then the students’ chances of getting into top universities increase, which is why parents struggle to get property inside the Saratoga High district. The administrators pressure the teachers, who form their curriculum to “teach the tests,” that is, to prepare them for the standardized tests, rather than to educate the kids. The educator I spoke to, who asked to remain anonymous, also alleges—as have some students—that the less-academically-successful students at Saratoga are often encouraged, or even pressured, into not taking the standardized tests, since their scores could lower the school’s collective score. The educator told me that he was so incensed by this that he made sure some of the struggling students he worked with took the standardized tests just to upset the school administration—and bring the overall score down a hair. I talked to a few students who did not get good grades at Saratoga, and they agreed that they were essentially ignored and marginalized by the structure.

> “They just don’t even know I’m there, and they don’t even really want me there,” one Saratoga student, whose grades were merely average, told me.

> “The school doesn’t have time for these kids,” the educator told me. “The administration there doesn’t give a damn about the bottom half or about their lives or how this will affect them later on. All they care about is keeping the test scores high.”

After this, Ames quotes the local paper's publisher, who connects the concern with test scores and ""a good record"" for the school with property values. The entire section on Ames's old high school in *Going Postal* would be worth reading in relation to this. Jean-Claude Michéa also makes similar points in his essay ""The School of Ignorance and Its Modern Conditions."" I posted excerpts from it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/lsj65z/tittytainment_jeanclaude_mich%C3%A9a_on_the_school_of/) and a link to the full essay.",RepulsiveNumber,t2_33zqy4fr,147,0,reddit1

And later on entering university, what the rich city kids had been learning. I'd always thought that my hick-ass education must have been fundamentally lacking. And in a sense it absolutely was. 

But the real shock was how much worse a lot of the more well-off kids had it. I think the larger level of parental apathy kind of worked in our advantage in a way. Hell, the psych teacher had a beef against advertising and spent about half the semester just pointing out various methods used to manipulate us. In a sense, he wasn't doing his job. But in another he was excelling at it in a way that I suspect wouldn't fly in a more strictly regulated environment. 

On really seeing more of the world I couldn't believe how much worse the level of education was in more affluent areas. On a technical level, they were usually great. But they generally suffered from the problems highlighted here. Though with an additional lack of attention to physical health and exercise. 

Someone on reddit once seriously accused me of having 'poor privilege. Because I grew up knowing how to cook on account of the fact that we HAD to have those skills if we were going to eat. It really rubbed me the wrong way at the time. But in retrospect, I sometimes wonder if there's a kernel of truth to it. There's a lot I hated about growing up how I did. But it also gave me a love of exercise, the outdoors, and actual real non-processed food. And even though I didn't realize it at the time, a shockingly good education. Even if just in comparison to the average in the US at the time. 

Not much point to this rambling other than just to point out that the country's a big place and a lot is going on that we don't necessarily notice.

I have had the most whack experience with admins and school boards, but if I go into great detail, the subreddit will figure out where I work.

There’s a huge gap in the salaries (between aides, teachers, and admins) that needs to be leveled alongside a reorganization of school work, where we have actual workplace democracy, if we want these places to stop being a fucking mess.

I believe elementary education should be play-based and it should start when babies become toddlers, and school lunches should be free. We also need beautiful campuses and child-oriented buildings for kids to be able to explore, with artistic and playful teachers who like kids and are willing to follow their interests. Teachers can still be authoritative over behavioral issues, especially with things like meal-time manners, but allowing free play will help kids socially discipline one another— since another huge problem in American families that you missed is that family sizes have shrunken, and many only children are awful with other kids. 

By opening the doors earlier, and feeding kids, we can combat the rampant neglectful parenting and give children strong foundations based on love, curiosity, and kindness. By having school be play-based, we will be able to keep the culture war out of the classroom, and teach kids important skills like caring for animals, gardening, communication, sensory exploration, and friendship.

Areas like aerospace, scientific computing, drug design, data science, and other high tech fields, are drastically more complicated than in the past, and the idea that students are expected to be ready to hit the ground running coming out of undergrad or even grad school, has morphed into an excuse to outsource labor.

Throughout primary school, there is a serious issue with screen time and technology. In my state, every single classroom is equipped with Chromebooks. In almost every single grade level, students begged me to use these Chromebooks. And for many teachers, Chromebooks are the last resort when teachers can no longer manage the class. When Chromebooks are used, usually this means surfing the web until they are caught for less obedient students. For more studious students, this means education platforms like Prodigy or Epic, which gamify education to match the ubiquity of gaming in these students' lives. Some of these students will even try to hide these Chromebooks in their desks to continue using the education platforms. 

As far as parenting goes, many teachers agree that more of the burden of socializing students is ending on the backs of teachers. COVID really set the socialization of students behind. Most students are 1-2 years behind in their social development due to closed classrooms. This deficiency put a huge burden on teachers because classrooms are simply chaos as students never learned how to sit still. Imagine teaching a 2nd grade class when those 2nd graders never had an in-person Kindergarten or 1st grade. You are forced to do the socialization work necessary to make up for two lost years. I imagine these students who went through the system during COVID will be affected for years to come. In Spain, the issue of socialization was top priority and schools went back in person the fall after COVID hit Europe. Here in the US, the issue of socialization wasn't apparent until students actually went back to in-person classes. 

Your point about Admin implementing cutting edge programs that are questionably useful is also on the money. My school implemented multiple programs meant to address reading and writing deficiency, which were totally ungraded. Students realize when works isn't going to be assessed so the periods reserved for these hours are often pedantic and boring since both students and teachers know the work is bullshit. 

Interestingly, although full time teaching is not financially rewarding, substitute teaching had a huge boom since the pandemic. If any of you have college degrees or are in the process of acquiring one, I can full heartedly recommend substitute teaching as a good gig. At least in my state, school districts can pay up to 260 a day for a substitute teacher. Moreover, if you end up being good with kids and teach well, many schools will take you on permanently as a site substitute (a new phenomenon brought on by the pandemic as the gig system for substitute teaching became overwhelmed due to the lack of substitutes).",ReardenVI,t2_96vy6,27,0,reddit1

One thing which stands out is the extreme student preference for attempted 'gaming the system' over learning. In some cases there is an almost visceral opposition to 'genuine learning', of the sort where knowledge is likely to be retained for some appreciable period or some conceptual understanding is attained. 

To some extent this seems to be because almost no one has time to assess work other than on the basis of parsing something for grammar and keywords. But the attitude also persists even when it fails to give academic results so a 'high marks, low effort' strategy isn't the whole story (look for example at how students who are wedded to this approach meltdown rather than change their attitudes when they attempt some subject where bullshitting won't work). 

I suspect it is to some degree because young people can see that 'sophisticated bullshitting' is really well rewarded in western society. In fact moderately literate narcissists who have developed a way to quickly learn the rules and negotiate them in a Machiavellian way tend to do quite well for themselves.

Probably to some large extent it is also because the typical material is rather dull, and more dull than it needs to be, so that could provide some scope for improvement, but 'try and make your lessons interesting' is something that has been attempted for 60 years or so, and restressing it is likely to have little impact.",fluffykitten55,t2_1vcp87hd,7,0,reddit1
ifuj8ck,t3_vwt1na,2022-07-12 12:18:20,stupidpol,"Please also include the distinction between authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles. I am an 'attachment parent' as I understand attachment theory. I also know how to set boundaries and entertain reasoning about my rules. Being an attachment parent doesn't automatically mean I have a permissive parenting style. It has more to do with helping children manage difficult emotions, not coddling. Yes, parents are extremely permissive and call themselves attachment parents but that has little to do with actual attachment theory.

It also seems that you don't really understand operant conditioning. Punishment, using suffering explicitly as a disincentive is not an effective teaching tool. There can be restrictions based on a child's maturity but there has to be better reasons than ""If you don't do what I say then I'll take your toys away.""

If you want your child to be able to think critically then you have to lead by example. You have to be ready to answer the 'why' and have a debate about your reasoning. This isn't the same as negotiating.",Drutski,t2_8xu01,8,0,reddit1
ift2207,t3_vwt1na,2022-07-12 02:23:47,stupidpol,"While I agree that parenting these days is overly relaxed in terms of screen time and internet control, I don’t think parenting is becoming more permissive. Note that this is just my opinion based on some heavy research I’ve been doing on parenting for the last 6 months as well as experience working in a children focused medical practice.

The most common “trends” in parenting 20-30 years ago were one of 2 main situations: either your parents beat you till you behaved, or your were spoiled shitless and had 0 discipline. Some people managed to avoid these scenarios but I wouldn’t consider them a big enough group to matter here. 

Now these 2 groups grew up and have decided one of 2 mindsets: “I hate how I was raised and I want to raise my kids differently”, or “I was raised fine and will continue to raise my kids the same way”. Most of the kids who were beaten grew up to be adults who didn’t want to beat their kids, as seen by how mainstream the anti-child abuse movement is, whereas spoiled kids who never had to think of others have no reason to want to change the way they would raise their kids. 

This leads to current trends in parenting, which are  authoritative, but NOT authoritarian. The current biggest/most mainstream trend in parenting is Montessori; which relies on teaching natural consequences and how to fix them rather than punishment (for example: you child spills juice on the floor, child is taught how to clean it and is expected to before he can get another one, rather than yelled at/hit). This falls in line with what the study you linked deems authoritative parenting: behavioural control and emotional support with no psychological control (note that authoritarian parenting would not satisfy this category, as it includes more psychological AND behavioural control). This is a step in the right direction in my opinion, but lacks what I think is a critical aspect of parenting and child development: community.

I think children in most western cultures grow up with extremely individualistic environments, never really considering themselves part of a group or community. This results in a lack of class awareness as adults and the rise of identity politics, because it’s a group of ideologies that makes them feel like they belong somewhere. Why be a straight person by yourself when you could be “queer” and celebrated by a growing community? 

Point is, I don’t think new parenting trends are the issue; from what I’ve seen, people who are actually concerned with how they raise their kids almost always do great jobs. It’s the ones that are permissive/negligent/abusive that end up causing more harm, but thankfully we’re actually seeing a decline in those (anecdotally)",The_Snuggly_Duckling,t2_3lcp8qhr,26,0,reddit1

ig52ybx,t3_vwt1na,2022-07-14 15:47:01,stupidpol,"Awesome post. I am a teacher; this is my eleventh year. I love teaching and and my students more than anything and will always believe in the power for strong education in helping people be their best selves.

I have taught in many models of schools: RTFs for young adults with severe disabilities going into assisted living and care. Charters, parochial, public, and online. Only one school where I have taught had actual social studies as a block during the day. This is my current school and they got rid of it for next year in favor of ELA integrated SS, which will merely be more test prep for TDAs. Most of my students now don’t know things like landforms and water bodies, the five basic needs, city/country/world, community helpers, or states and capitals. 

I sincerely believe that there is an intentional push to eliminate social studies and all of its pursuant content from school. I teach first grade but as they age think of the concepts,not just from traditional history, but anthropology and sociology, linguistics, philosophy, and more they’ll miss. And, most critically, economics. History is a huge inroad into political, philosophical, and theological thinking for young people, and truly a way for them to begin thinking about class. No other subject even touches it. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that it’s disappearing.

I think public ed is dead on the vine. I truly believe in the idea of it but it’s current practice is rotten. I feel it’s one of the most insidiously corrupt public institutions we have and it weaponizes the sincere heart and love many teachers bring to the table. We are manipulated into believing these tests create opportunity and our backs are often against the wall. 

My fiancée and I recently were able to purchase about 50 acres of land and my plan is to open a small preschool through kinder program that is entirely divorced from modern public Ed. Eventually my hope is to be able to balance scholarship students with tuition students and also train new young teachers in real teaching, not the slop they get in the teacher training programs now. I hate that I’ll have to go a tuition route but the licensing is a boa constrictor ruining the chances of schools having autonomy and voice for educators and families. It’s going to steepen the class divide as you said .

At any rate God bless every educator who truly does the work in this country because we are assaulted from all sides, denigrated, and often physically assaulted by our own students. I have been choked, hit, spit on, had furniture thrown at me, chased, cussed out and more from *first grade students*. That’s six year olds. My experience might not be the norm but it is increasingly common. I have had parents verbally abuse me to my face while my principals sat and texted at the table with us, never sticking up for me. I routinely spend anywhere from 1-2k a year on classroom supplies. I had a PD presenter tell me that because I was a white teacher in an all black school I was a “spiritual murderer” of the black children for whom I did laundry, provided food, school supplies, backpacks, and pseudo parenting.

I genuinely believe K-12 education can honestly be compressed into about 12 months of online classes given how shallow and uninspiring it is. I was taking 5+ AP courses from Sophomore year onwards and even then the challenge was nonexistent and the content felt juvenile and surface-level in nature. I was learning far more and at a much faster pace just checking out books that interested me from the library and diving down internet rabbit holes on a far wider and more immersive variety of topics than what was offered to me at my WELL-FUNDED, TOP 100 public high school.

Public schools are a zoo and a prison. 

The worst part is that it didn't even get better in undergrad. 100 to 400-level courses literally just felt like high school, and in some cases even more slower-paced and surface-level. I can't think of a single course outside of a 600-level comparative IR course I took under a professor who is a leader in his field where I actually learned something new or felt challenged. My chosen field essentially requires a graduate degree to break into, so I'm hoping grad school is a bit more stimulating.

Honestly I think everything in OPs effortpost is just a symptom of people growing sick and tired of capitalist credential-fetishism. I have essentially wasted nearly 20 years of my life in organized credentialed education because people believe these diplomas and degrees actually represent something meaningful. There is essentially no way (outside of nepotism and extremely diligent networking + good fortune) to escape this requirement for tons of jobs and fields.

I think it's a large part of why there's such a sharp rise in mental issues—from the relatively benign, like ADD/ADHD and general constant ambiguous stress, to far more serious issues like bipolar disorder, autism, training/dysphoria, etc. and even full-on outright snapping and shooting up places and whatnot.

I also firmly believe external factors which are not stimuli, like lack of healthcare, education, food security, housing, etc. contribute greatly to some of these issues as well, to be clear, but I do think a lot of the 'it' issues could possibly be attributed to overstimulation by 24/7 access to everyone and every piece of information there is.

Consider the kind of case where people will get so spun-up raging mad about what some hypothetical archetype Other thinks about some issue and the time people spend making inane connections based on that—""I hate Texans, they voted for Trump"" or whatever—and consider how that whole dynamic of seeing some anonymous entity on twitter forming people's worldview via second-degree proxy was not even a possibility, really, even 15 years ago.

Some examples of extreme behaviors that I never knew were just “black culture” until this cunt told us it was:

Our district issues laptops to every kid, our enrollment was around 1000 and we issued roughly 2500 replacements, no questions asked. Hundreds of them ended up in local pawn shops. 

If not sold, then just destroyed. I once came up on a few kids throwing the laptops against the wall, just because. I told them to stop, they became violent and threw a laptop at me. I go get an AP, and she took them down to the tech room for replacements and that was the end of that. It wasn’t long into the school year that I gave up on trying to enforce anything I thought of or knew to be good practice since I was already 5 years in at that point. I spent each period with 30-40 animals and about 5 kids who were there to learn and just worked with them. There was no point in trying to corral the rest when admin was against us. My experience was not unique, teacher turnover at this school is 70% or so annually. 

Our college counselor was downright fucking evil. The few good kids we had, she would sabotage them and fuck them over if they didn’t agree to go to an HBCU. Had two kids, both high achievers in this shit environment somehow finding the motivation to do good, both come to me after school literally sobbing with rage. Both had been accepted to exceptional universities. One Stanford, the other Cornell. She lit them up, refused to help them with any financial aid forms or anything else because they’re “turning their back on their community” by choosing top 10 schools over fucking Grambling.

At a Catholic school, yes you have to take a religion class every year and every school usually has a mass at least once a month but if you’re worried about the religious aspect of the school on your kid, going to a Catholic school made me able to learn more about religion and to that degree, got me to question religion even more and solidified me becoming an atheist. 

I can’t speak on secular private schools but there’s something about the structure and discipline of a Catholic that I really think helps students for their future.  This isn’t the 1950’s or even 1980’s anymore, students aren’t getting whacked with a ruler or there’s no physical discipline by teachers towards students, those days are long gone. However, if the kid fucks up, there’s ZERO tolerance and consequences must be paid thru mediation or a detention/suspension. We would do some dumb shit as teens but you never saw a brawl in the lunchroom or you wouldn’t worry about your shit getting stolen from your backpack. That just never happened. Even talking to other friends that went to other Catholic schools, it was very rare to hear about wild or violent stories during school hours.

Maybe this is a reason I’m on this sub but when I went was in high school, there were no culture war bullshit in the classroom. You learned what you needed to learn in your class. In history or English classes, there might have been debates but debates within the context of what was being taught.

Unless you are an officer, or like under the age of 22, the pay is absolute dog shit. And pales in comparison to what you could be making in the civilian world.  


A normal work week, I would be at my unit from 530am to around 530pm, possibly later. That is 12 hours a day, 60 hours a week and that is assuming you arent doing any overnight or weekend training.

As a parent I use love and reassurance to quickly dampen down the overstimulation of the amygdala in stressful situations. Only after the stress hormones have come down to a normal level can you try to reason with a child. Trying to reason with a child in that emotionally stressed state is how tantrums happen.

We really are just biological machines and until they are physically mature enough to manage their biological processes themselves, it is our jobs as parents to do it for them. It takes a lot of patience and it is hardest when you are exhausted yourself, but having put that effort in I can honestly say it is saving a ton of time that would otherwise be spent on fighting. I see it as an investment that has paid off, a lot sooner than expected also.

Some people just can't get over the idea that they are the adult and their children should submit to their will based on that fact. I wouldn't accept that attitude from another adult, why should a child? Our sense of justice is instinct from a very young age. A side effect of this approach is that if my daughter makes a promise to do something as a condition of me allowing some privilege, she does it happily. It's fascinating to see her finishing playing and jumping up to do a chore on her own initiative.

With regards to being shocked by the behaviour of other adults. Well, that is a learning experience in itself. There comes a point in your life when you realise people are not authorities just because they are adults. I remember it as a teenager. Maybe that is why they become so rebellious.

>There are many opportunities for low and middle-class students to avoid debt, sometimes entirely

Yes, you are correct that (on a micro level) there are many opportunities that can reduce the financial burden of debt. But from a macro level perspective, scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid are only bandaids to towards the flawed educational system of the US.

To give an example towards the severity of the situation regarding education,[according to a report released by Georgetown University in 2021-](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/the-gap-in-college-costs-and-earnings-for-young-workers-since-1980.html)

>College costs have increased by 169% since 1980-- but pay for young workers is up by just 19%

To add on from the report, Postsecondary education policy has failed to keep higher education affordable even as formal education beyond high school has become more essential. The 19% increase in wages regarding young workers is specifically noting those between the ages of 22 and 27.  
In the 1980's, individuals used to be able to work through college and come out debt-free but now that formerly realistic goal seems to be unattainable currently. Another ripple effect that I truly don't believe people focus on enough is that students under financial stress are put into positions where they are unable to fail. In the current structure of our education system, Students are penalized for their failures. For example, due to the ever-increasing prices of college tuition, students that are disadvantaged, low-income, or rewarded scholarships/grants that are tied to their academic performance are more likely to commit forms of academic dishonesty such as cheating, collusion, etc. in order to secure their financial aid. Due to the high-risk implications ""Failure"" has on the continuation of one's education and potential of one's future career earnings, i.e, we are creating a learning environment intolerable towards failure thus producing inept professionals to care for our society which could have rippling repercussions for those in high stakes careers like Lawyers, Doctors, etc.

  
The average student loan debt is something like 30k, but this is disproportionately distributed; individuals who were lucky enough to be born into wealthier families have less debt than those who are not. Although I don't like bringing topics like these back to racial matters, it is quite evident that the majority of America's wealthy families are of the White majority. The financial burden of college debt creates a further disparity between POC-Whites and nothing is being done to close this gap.  
Personally, I can't even begin to imagine College being an option for any children that I decide to have in my future with how much tuition has increased from my parents generation to mine.  
TLDR: US Education system severely flawed and is digging the current generation into a financial grave.",unsvlicited,t2_55ubamnh,1,0,reddit1

What you say about the amygdala and stress hormones makes perfect sense and I feel silly for not considering it, since I've read plenty about amygdala responses in adults.

The concept of rebelliousness and its development is an interesting one, I wonder if we've done any good studies examining parenting styles and environmental factors in its development. I know I became rebellious extremely early, around eight years old, but I had some pretty terrible parents. it could have to do with the rather narrow view children have of the idea of fairness, which might be a more accurate term for what you're talking about than justice (justice arises from an idea of fairness, but is more about methods of enforcement and evaluation of relative outcomes; young children don't really have the agency to explore this yet). It's probably easier to enter into a rebellious state when your world seems consistently unfair, like immediate outcomes will never favor you unless you actively fight to enforce your will. I suppose catering to a sense of fairness might be important for developing a sense of agency in a young child. I've certainly encountered children who behave as though they have no agency, no control over anything around them, though (in my personal experience) they all had overly permissive parents, not authoritarian parents. I can imagine the *way* in which parent-child conflicts are resolved serves as a model for how a child should assert their will, and a lack of any conflict fails to develop this at all.

On a macroscopic level, the price of college has increased at a far higher rate than median incomes, causing college to become a riskier investment and a far less attainable option for many students, particularly those who don't come from privileged backgrounds. I'm not trying to argue that the US education system isn't severely fucked up. There are plenty of capable students across the country who simply cannot afford college, and it's a travesty for those who want to go into a field that requires further education.

My comment was only highlighting methods that an *individual* student (i.e. on the 'microscopic' level, as you said) could use to pay for college. Even still, I agree that the US educational system is very flawed on a macroscopic level. The immense cost of college inherently favors the rich; individual low-income students may be able to find grants, scholarships, etc. for good high school performance, but they are the exception, not the rule. The system is designed to filter by income, like every other part of American society.

There are a few poor students who slip through the cracks and are able to obtain full rides or other significant aid. This is very important for students who want to enter a field that requires college. But these students, by and large, get fucked by the system. All I was saying is that there's a few lucky students who may be able to obtain financial aid opportunities, even if such opportunities are shoddy fixes on a macroscopic level.",Marsium,t2_jmhr0lw,1,0,reddit1

With no other stated reason whatsoever, you are just asserting that your case generalizes, because you're smarter than average because you happened to like learning. 

Perhaps you are an outlier, and the current ""government-funded subject matter experts"" already exist, not as personal tutors, but as university professors. Not coincidentally, they're able to reach more students at once this way. 

This might be why most intellectuals actually go through the ""Foucauldian panopticon"" of formal training. Most philosophers and scientists go through so much schooling because they want to, not because they have to or because they'll get wealthy doing it. I am willing to bet when you do your learning, you're primarily reading from experts who went through a whole lot of formal training. 

In fact, this raises the question of how they are supposed to earn the status of ""subject matter experts"" in the first place. Perhaps there should be some institution of learning where they can take tests, converse with other students in their field, and ultimately perform original research?

It's not like he came out of absolute nowhere. But there you go, there's an example. Run wild with it if you think you can!

You can't, because these are exception cases that don't generalize. Most people don't do what Kripke did, they work closely with their supervisors while developing draft after draft, getting feedback, and asking for reading recommendations.

Furthermore, your train of thought could be applied to high schoolers who study for their GED or even savant children who excel on their own. Do these exceptions entail we should abolish primary and secondary education? Of course not, that's ridiculous, as most people really do benefit from them. Most people aren't autodidacts and this applies to every stage of education.
