When I was on nexplanon all of this stopped and it was amazing to be treated like a human being prioritized over what might be in my uterus.


Women are much more familiar with their periods than their doctor. Asking the last date doesn't even give that much info and people can easily just lie, I really don't get the point of it.

On the other hand, there are *mountains* of laws protecting health information, HIPAA being the least of them. Government agencies can’t even request bulk de-identified data without a compelling reason, *much less* individually identifying info. Even if that medical information is relevant to a criminal case, it is extraordinarily difficult to subpoena. Health records are some of the most heavily protected in the entire nation, and for good reason.

Moreover, menstrual data is often incredibly relevant, medically speaking. The most common example is with women whose chief complaint is abdominal pain. If you tell me you have bad stomach cramps and *don’t wish to disclose* your LMP, I am going to request a pregnancy test anyways to rule out ectopic pregnancy—which is even more damning, if your concern is that your medical records are vulnerable.

Nursing, not so much these days. There are nurses that can't pass basic human anatomy that are treating you. Nursing schools tend to be regional in their draw area so you might have ultra religious nurses rolling out of a school that see their duty as ""church first, everything else second"".

Conservatism is the political movement to protect aristocracy (intergenerational wealth and political power) which we now call oligarchs, and enforce social hierarchy. This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights.
Populist conservative voter groups are created and controlled with propaganda. They wish to subjugate their local peers and don’t see the feet of aristocrats kicking them too.
Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.

More Than 75 Health Care Organizations Release Joint Statement in Opposition to Legislative Interference
“As the U.S. health care system enters a post-Roe era, we, representing dozens of major organizations of health care professionals, oppose all legislative interference in the patient–clinician relationship. Our patients need to be able to access—and our clinicians need to be able to provide—the evidence-based care that is right for them, including abortion, without arbitrary limitations, without threats, and without harm.

“The wave of abortion bans going into effect in states across the country will harm patients, impair the integrity of the medical profession, and have a devastating and unquantifiable impact on the patients and clinicians it affects. People in at least half the states will now face a cruel choice between traveling hundreds of miles to receive abortion care (which is simply impossible for those who lack the resources, means, and opportunity) or being forced to continue with a pregnancy that may threaten their health, well-being, and future.

“Clinicians who practice in good faith in these states will be subject to a similarly untenable decision: risk criminal prosecution or other civil sanctions by providing appropriate, evidence-based care in accordance with their patients’ needs and wishes or withhold safe and effective reproductive health care from patients in need.

“Banning abortion care is a decision not founded in science or based on evidence. In all facets of medicine, clinicians train for years—some for decades—to learn how to provide the best evidence-based care possible to their patients. Patients form trusting relationships with their health care professionals, but when health care professionals are prevented from providing the full spectrum of care by threat of legal action, the quality and scope of care they can provide is limited, endangering both patient care and the patient–clinician relationship. Just as patients should not be forced to leave their communities to access abortion care, clinicians should not be forced to uproot their lives and leave their homes in order to practice in safe, supportive environments. Restricting access to care and eroding the trust between patients and health care professionals will worsen existing gaps in health disparities and outcomes, compounding the harm that underresourced communities already experience.

“Abortion care is safe and essential reproductive health care. Keeping the patient–clinician relationship safe and private is essential not only to quality individualized care but also to the fabric of our communities and the integrity of our health care infrastructure. As leading medical and health care organizations dedicated to patient care and public health, we condemn this and all interference in the patient–clinician relationship.”""

ih7ogio,t1_ih7gkoi,2022-07-22 17:13:58,TwoXChromosomes,"im gonna copypaste a rant I did last night about this exact ppont. Please forgive me if it comes off a little combative; it was origonally directed at some idiot talking about ""StATeS RiGHts"". The first paragraph is in response to ""doctors are manditory reporters so HIPPA dosent apply to intent to kill"" 


The difference is that a fetus is not a citizen of the US, nor a person under any legal status. As such, a doctor isn't legally required to report on it - there is no crime to kill a living thing that isn't a person or a specific animal called out ina specific law, eg animal cruelty, but you can kill as many amoeba as you want because they aren't explicitly given rights in any law. 

The actuall impact of RvW wasn't ""you're entitled to an abortion"", it was ""cops need a warrant to look at your medical records"". And since you neeed a warrant to violate your HIPAA rights, the cop needs reasonable evidence that a woman has already had an abortion before he can get a judge to OK a warrant, and then they investigate the medical records proving it. However, because asking someone ""are you pregnant"" is a violation of HIPAA, there is never any legally admissable evidence of actually having an abortion - any attempt to find out if you (a) already are pregnant or (b) are intending to abort are 'unreasonable search and seizure', just like demanding to see your ID on the street. Asking after the abortion is just as much a privacy violation as before, and you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done simply on heresay (at least, not without a judge risking his job on an unconstitutional warrant) 

RvW overturn means that you no longer have HIPPA protection. It means that any government offical or contractor can demand your medical records for any reason, not just abortion, not just 'reasonable suspicion'. And a medical record of ""i have an appointment to get an abortion"" means that, since there is no federal ruling on abortion itself, the state, county, or local government can make up any crimes they want about it. Hell, theres no federal ruling on the legality of cosmetic surgery; Oklahoma could arrest you for a facelift if they wanted. Right now any state could make a law criminalizing all non-emergency medical care because of this. Federal law only says that hospitals are required to 'stabilize' a paitent - that means only the ER and paramedics. No schedualed surgaries, no check ups, no broken bones casted, no X rays, no family doctors, no eyeglasses.

Is some of that an extreme example, sure. But you remeber 'pre existing medical conditions'? And sure this is extreme - but so is wholesale banning of otherwise-fatal abortions, and notably, Texas keeps doubling down on that.

the fact that every single anti abortion law wasnt immediately sent to a federal court to be ruled an obvious violation of the 4th Ammendment, nor has a single GOP or judge tried to make a fetus a citizen, is why this is ""legislating from the bench"" or ""a judicial coup"", and not just ""SeNdINg It BaCk to tHe StaTEs"" or ""because abortion isnt explicitly protected"" nor ""protecting the unborn"".",bowdown2q,t2_4w0i8,10,0,reddit1

The overturning of Roe also stripped us of other protections such as the right to privacy.

Given the current state of things you never know when simply being a feminist or even just being a woman may put one on a watchlist. And if any of these things may be retroactive. For example, research Senator Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities in the 1950's prosecuting Anericans for simply attending socialist meetings two decades prior in the 1930's.

I've very recently learned of a way to counter that. It's a long term strategy called ranked choice voting, and a few states have started using it in local races. Maine became the first state to use it for presidential elections.

Say a Democrat who has more progressive values wishes they could vote for Bernie Sanders but  they don't want their vote to have a spolier effect and inadvertently help elect a pro-forced-birther candidate. With ranked choice voting they would rank their votes 1, 2, 3 and 4. So, maybe they put 1-Bernie, 2-Biden, 3-Moderate Republican 4-Pro-forced-birther Republican. 

Then say their first choice candidate didn't receive enough votes to win a majority. Then their top vote now switches over to their second choice, in this example Biden. So they are still being productive with their vote, it's not a wasted vote, yet they get to vote their conscience, which is very important for people like progressives and it really increases the voter turnout so I think it can be a way to unify the party.

I am 40 and have PCOS. I take an androgen blocker, but I also take the pill because I still need estrogen. But every month during, or rather just after, my inactive week, I would have a flare up of PCOS issues (because no estrogen) and that in turn made my psoriasis go nuts (oh, and anemia says hi). Doc said to only take inactive every 3 months to limit all that mess. Switching up the schedule messed me up though because the inactive week stopped resulting in a period, so I was stopping and starting for no reason, and my body was swelling up and being terrible. Then my bleeding would happen a couple weeks later, and go for over 2 weeks. I was referred to a gyno. Gyno said I don't need a period. IF I start spotting, I can take a week off pills to allow a controlled period (that should stop when pills are restarted), but that could happen years from now, or six months, or never. I am just not producing enough lining to need to shed it, or need to shed it regularly/frequently. Gyno said this is not common medical knowledge, and that only gynos know this and can prescribe birth control pills in this manner; regular docs not so much.

I am glad I live in Oregon, and hate that women in other states are being threatened. Stick, my honest answer to last menstrual cycle would be, ""Uhhhhhhhhhhh, I don't know. A while back.""

Without those birth control pills, I would be seriously messed up on a metabolic level. PCOS messes with thyroid, insulin, and cholesterol - not just estrogen/testosterone. It's medical care, not just ""family planning.""",supergamernerd,t2_fkvy9,84,0,reddit1

This cycle is one of the mechanics of the glass ceiling. 

I think it's really important that when women receive feedback like this that they thank the person, but also open the discussion about the tightrope and it's consequences. The topic can be raised conversationally and in a non threatening way, and we can just ask if the person is concerned about the opposite personality trait and if they think a man would be interpreted differently.

No! If anything, seeing a noticeable change in how you manage yourself in group environments will show your boss (and whomever else complains about you) that you *can* take feedback, you *can* figure out what it means and you *can* adjust your behavior accordingly. 

If you can make these adjustments to make people enjoy being in your company more (look at it with that goal), you will also impress your management. 

/u/ColorCodedPanda gave absolutely excellent examples of exactly what small steps you could take to start seeing differences immediately! (say that last part in sales announcer's voice)

I recently started a new position and people LOOOOVVVEEE to be asked for their advice. Really makes them like you. You have to actually be interested in what they say though. Sometimes I just ask people to tell me about what they do so I can catch up. It helps build good relationships and also counters the ""she thinks she knows everything"" appearance. 

Right now in my role I've embarked on a Listening Tour (I got that from Hillary Clinton thanks) where I'm meeting with each of the head guys and asking them to tell me ALL ABOUT what they do how they do it who they work with what's important to their job, what their biggest challenges are, etc.

The ONLY time it is professional is when you work in the beauty industry. And even then, it depends on the shop, and how picky your clients are. Some clients judge a stylist by their looks - which sucks, but people are people - if you have make up on and your hair done neatly, clients assume you know what you're doing. Personally, I like to wear make-up and style my hair, but the stylist next to me is older, and she doesn't bother. Totally HER choice, and it doesn't affect the way she does her job. She's also very sweet, and I will throat punch anyone who bullies her over make-up.

deowps2,t1_deocyc1,2017-03-09 02:28:07,TwoXChromosomes,"Fair point. I'll clarify with this:

-The women actually had more direct experience and more degrees than the men. That was a big thing we brought to the table when speaking with the CEO/CFO. 
-The men had less experience (or zero experience) and some don't even have college degrees. This part kind of blew my mind. 
-We work the exact same positions (there's 8 of us). The big differences are that the 3 women have more employees under them AND a larger client list. Which by that alone - we should be getting paid more. 
-And the biggest one: some of the women started at lower salaries because we were brought on earlier in the startup's life (first month). The men came along 6-12 months later, once we had become extremely successful. So, they were offered higher salaries to begin with. Then, once they were promoted to our current positions, they received bigger raises. I tried to negotiate higher initially when I got promoted, but they said it was the best they could do. 

...then I was finally able to call bullshit when I found out the guys were making more and working less.  ",vodkaismymiddlename,t2_11k2iy,12,0,reddit4

Even in non public facing roles...when it involves customers attractive women are hired over qualified men routinely by consulting firms in the financial and tech industries.

Were the negotiators of equal experience/resume and work ethic? Was the base pay offered to both men and women equal, assuming the previous question is true?

This table doesnt really show anything else. both men and womens standard deviations overlap considerably and as such, form my understanding, that suggest a statistically insignificant difference. But im not 100% someone with more knowledge needs to verify.

‘Successful since joining’  does not tell us how much of the increase came from people who 'asked for pay rise’ or ‘asked for promotion’ or if the pay raise was just given to them without asking.

This survey wanted to debunk the idea that women dont ask for pay raises as much as their male counterparts and when they do they are rejected. And it did so, women do ask for raises as often as men with an insignificant difference between the two, but they also get rejected as often as men, not more and not less, but equally.

Sane companies pay only as much as they have to pay to hire and keep an employee based on what they're worth, and what they could reasonably get at other companies. They're not willingly dishing out $20000 male privilege bonuses because they feel like it. If they offered those women $20k less it's because they had reason to believe they were worth and would accept $20k less. That doesn't necessarily mean they weren't willing to pay more if negotiated. Nobody forced the women to accept that offer either. 

The only thing that could prove sexism may *potentially* be at play here is if she could demonstrate she had nearly identical merits, had the sameconnections, was hired at the same time, and was refused a higher salary after asking.

Obviously it's a good thing that the men and the women are getting paid equally now.

But the issue is that the original comment is someone with no knowledge of the situation basically saying ""well the men probably just negotiated more effectively""

It's just a strange argument to make because it makes assumptions about a scenario you have no knowledge of. In this case, those assumptions are that the men and women were offered the same starting salary, and that the men were better negotiators/earned the raises more.

Which basically translates to ""It couldn't have been sexism at the workplace, it must've been that the men were better at the task of getting a good salary"", which is hugely problematic

I do agree that ideally, women would be more empowered with regards to knowing their worth, and should feel comfortable asking for raises. But it's important to place that in a larger workplace culture where revealing how much you make is considered a faux pas, and workers are expected to put the company first. But to basically put the onus on women to get better at negotiating without creating the environment to do so is sort of admitting you recognize that there is a problem and telling someone else to fix it.

And I think it's **hugely** problematic to play the 'meritocracy game', where people imply that those in a position of more privilege than others are there because they deserve to be, instead of it being because they had an advantage due to their gender",,,1,0,reddit4

No, no, no! I didn't say that. I don't think most feminists preach female superiority.

If we can justify our rage and the ensuing physical actions if they occur, there is not a problem beyond the law, but we are accepted back into the patriarchy regardless. ""Outlaws"" are even given a ""badass"" status that increases thier desire to stick with the patriarchy. I am white so let me stress that societally, it was easier for me, but a ""badass dude"" of any color is accepted back into the patriarcal brotherhood. When i showed anger or violence toward another male, i was applauded. When i showed anger it was as easy as getting someone to think ""well, i understand why he was upset"" to be put back in the mix as a regular guy. Men are allowed to show anger, we are not allowed to show other emotions outside of this without being labeled with some sort of derogatorally feminine moniker meant to ""keep us in line"" with the patriarchy.

iy6dwsh,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-29 02:07:46,TwoXChromosomes,"There is a very common phrase about limited thinking, where I'm from, which goes ""if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail"".

It's not the having of emotions that's gendered. It's the having the emotional security and freedom to express them that is. Though it is just a masking emotion, biologically designed to protect a fragile sense of self by drawing attention away from its companion emotions, Anger is the only emotions western societies have deemed appropriate for men to voice.

For the purposes of this thread, it's not too important to dwell on that but merely use it to point out that it's not that ""all men have is a hammer"" but rather ""using any tool other than a hammer is forbidden"". So forbidden that a hammer is free with every purchase.

A lot of men recognize a problem that requires another tool when they see it, but do not have it on hand, and there is no ""emotional hardware store"" they can be seen shopping at in a way that squares with their self-identity (as influenced by societal programing). They use this central conceit to allow themselves to justify never picking up another tool, rather than just acknowledge the sense of self needs expanding.

^(Women have this too, btw, just in other areas. I'm not picking on men I'm just trying to stay on topic.)

Unfortunately, due to the sheer amount of work it would take to deprogram an entire lifetime of machismo bullshit, and how 100% of that is not your job, there isn't much advice I can give. The best thing I can think of is still very (emotionally) labor intensive. That's trying to recognize what companion emotion the anger is being presented with, and address it with little kid gloves.

In the example provided, the eagerness to provide assistance is likely rooted in the male necessity to be useful (optimistic take) or appear superior (pessimistic take). The former's utilitarian philosophy where usefulness defines value is quite popular in western societies, as a form of conditioning pliability into service, and is why men are encouraged to approach problems with a solution instead of just sharing in the venting experience. This post betrays my gender here, and as well trained as I am it's still not something I can wholly avoid.

In the example the objection to being delayed--being told not to interrupt--is that in their zeal they thought they were being thoughtful, when they weren't. The reality is they recognize having had this conversation in the past, and they betrayed them in the actually doing of that. It is common for anyone who catches themselves in hypocrisy to project, but more common when the action that proved hypocritical is perceived as well-intentioned.

In the very specific situation of people interrupting you, my TLDR advice is to do three things:

* Acknowledge they mean well
* Remind them that you've had this conversation in the past about interrupting.
* Tie the two together by conveying that being well-intentioned does not directly translate doing the right thing. While I many not go so far as to say ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"" this is exactly what that idiom means.

While this won't address the underlying problem, it can at least streamline the way you deal with (or how often you have to deal with) the same underlying problem.",The_Lucky_7,t2_z3418,3,0,reddit1

Women are socialized to explore their emotions and express themselves emotionally; more than men. Men are socialized to treat anger as a legitimate emotion, instead of a secondary emotion hiding deeper emotions. As a result, men exhibit anger and frustration more frequently and it’s normalized, but less so sadness / crying and other vulnerable emotions.

So if you're a man and you’ve accepted one common form of expression (anger) as acceptable and a less common form (crying, sadness, hurt) as unacceptable, then you start to see emotions as gendered, and see women as the “more” emotional.

Anecdotal experience: my wife cries at least once a day, sometimes more often. This was really hard for me at first. It's an emotion I associate with guilt, so I see her crying and I try and ""fix"" it, and if I can't it's tough. I'm much quicker to anger. So who's more emotional? She definitely is more emotionally expressive, and attuned.

""You made me mad, you made me angry"" etc. Putting the 1 way they are ""allowed"" to feel , out of their personal responsibility, so in their mind their anger is also a woman's emotion or at least, the fault of that woman.

iy6x3ff,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-29 04:47:12,TwoXChromosomes,"I think because in a lot of ways women are indeed more emotional (please read more emotionally developed). This is a generalization but one that I think holds true for a lot of western society. 

For much of post-industrialization, men have told women all the things ya'll can't or shouldn't do, so communication and group psychology (raising and managing family units) became the forced-upon-you professional skills needed. A woman's ability to navigate group dynamics and 'politic' became a kinda unspoken life skill. 

Men (and some women, looking at you Nazi Coco Chanel) throughout history have told women how they should look, eg. beautiful, youthful, thin, flat butt (now thicker butt), light skin, light eyes, straight hair, etc it's nebulous and ever changing. 

BUT! History has also been telling men to be less emotional (don't be a pu××y, boys don't cry, 'but did you die', etc) but this doesn't mean that men don't have emotions rather that men are just *reaaaally* bad at recognizing and navigating them. The tantrum thing is real I think mainly because mental health for men is so much less emphasized than it should have been throughout history. As a result, you have masses of emotionally insecure men you are trying to express themselves emotionally with varying degrees of success. 

I don't think men and women are anymore or less emotional than each other, I agree with you there. I think of it like a fire, some people have been trained how to approach and handle a fire calmly while others try their best but often panic. Women, again this is a generalization, have the training for this ""fire"" and men not so much usually.

Take that shit to the grave, as it were.

Anger is different. It can be settled very, very quickly by getting into a fight, whether the fight is physical, verbal, etc. The direct confrontation leading to a quick resolution is what guys are used to, so we just explode and let the dust settle.

We're also taught that women should be held to a standard different from men. To be cared for, and to be gentle with. However, since we can't process our own emotions other than happiness or anger, the moment something like sadness comes up, we kinda don't know what to do. How do we comfort them? Do we reframe their problem and convince them it's not that bad so they can muster the strength to move on? That's how we do it, because we don't really have the option of doing anything else ourselves if we can see that exploding and letting the dust settle as a very risky option.

iy7ffua,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-29 08:25:44,TwoXChromosomes,"Hm, I think it depends on how you define emotional, because everyone has their own points that trigger a certain emotion more easily than others. And I do feel like men and women often express and process their emotions differently, maybe partially due to our different hormonal makeup (I've heard of so many reports from trans women who noticed they were getting emotional and tearing up much more easily once they started taking hormones), but also due to social conditioning.

I wouldn't say that one sex is more emotional than the other one, though, if we define ""being emotional"" as having feelings. We're humans, we all have feelings, but some are better at giving them a name or expressing and processing them than others.

And I have to say, I actually like that about being a woman. I'm glad that I'm a woman and that I didn't learn that being angry is the only emotion I'm allowed to feel if I want to act accordingly to my gender (big keyword toxic masculinity). I see it as a great ability that a lot of people lack.

OP, you should never feel bad for having feelings and being able to express them. Being more emotional and having feelings, being able to figure out how you're feeling or how others are feeling is a sign of emotional intelligence and a wonderful thing. You feeling bad about it is a result of our world that is usually operating on a masculine default, while being feminine is automatically associated with something negative.

And yet look at what our past President was like, feeding into the craziness of his fan base, going on unhinged Twitter rants for the entire planet to see, and pissing off basically every other world leader he came into contact with.

iy5ofsl,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-28 22:55:07,TwoXChromosomes,"I think women will more bring more emotions to the forefront, and blend them in to what would present more factually-styled from guys, but that guys strategically hide what the emotions are guiding their decisions behind a front of ""rationality"". At the end of the day, I think emotions drive most human decisions. It's just that the style of communication is often different and the posturing is different.

Also, some men can be stuck in the male communication style if they don't talk to women a lot. It may be they aren't accustomed to stopping for someone who is sensitive, they wait to be confronted by someone _tougher than them_. Or higher up the hierarchy, i.e. their boss. So from their purely male-styled perspective, being asked to stop for someone _because they are sensitive_ sounds to them like someone misunderstanding how communication works, not someone with a valid point who should be accommodated. The more men learn how women tend to communicate, deliberately fostering more input from any valued stakeholders (including the vulnerable or sensitive), the more they can learn to accommodate women in conversation.

From guys, there can still be the instinct to talk over and be forceful, since it is our native way. And we have a hefty amount of cultural bias telling us women are the less-forceful person, even when they are pushing back pretty hard. So a lot of it is cultural teachings/bias, to be sure. Some of it is communication difficulties. But IMO it can be overcome if the guy wants to, and has enough exposure to how women usually communicate.

Also: People are often pretty bad at accommodating very small minorities' needs, but if the balance is more even it becomes a lot easier. So I really hope they can hire more women soon at your company. That way you're not the only one, and it comes up naturally more often and directly benefits more people and slows down fewer people, proportionally speaking, in any given interaction.

Sorry to hear it's going badly so far. I can see how it would be draining to be talked over and misunderstood and basically disrespected.",myalt08831,t2_yu6h3,2,0,reddit1

During the busy season, it is not uncommon for female employees to come to the back office and break down in tears.

These outbursts can be caused by shitty customers, employee infighting, trouble at home, ect.

Some managers (men and women) get annoyed. Really buying into the “don’t cry at work” mentality as crying is considered a sign of weakness. I am fine with them coming to the office though. That way they can deal with their emotions away from passengers and not just bottle it up until they explode in an unprofessional manner.

If women act out in the work place, there is much more criticism. Imagine if you had called one of your coworkers emotional. You would be resented. Men, however, get to laugh it off or be given a pass. ""He had a tough day"", ""His wife has him in the doghouse"", ""He lost a horse race"". Women are expected to control themselves at a higher level than men are, and due to this men have less emotional control - men are more emotional.

I say this because I have observed it myself. Men get away with a lot more bullshit, and if women try to replicate it however slightly, they risk reprimands. It is unfair.

I like talking about how emotional I am. I mean, when has emotion NOT been manly? Look at Shakespeare! He has extremely emotional men in his plays. Men make art, too. Where do these pieces come from? Of course men are emotional. We are human, after all.

Having an outburst is one thing but expressing emotion is a natural human response. I really can't get my head around why we are expected to be emotionless at work. Emotions are the building block of more complex feelings like compassion, empathy, morale, willpower. All these things are imbued with emotion. 

I am a physician, a job which one would assume would naturally illicit many strong emotions. It is expected that I temper those emotions appropriately in order to best perform my work but if I'm not feeling something about a patient on an emotional level, I just can't imagine how I would muster the sense of urgency that is required to perform my tasks. Of course that emotion is balanced by the need to perform certain tasks that require focus and impassive calm but without the emotion, there's no drive to collect myself and do what must be done to care for patients. I feel emotions every time I do something that I know is painful for my patient and that emotion allows me to focus my energy in such a way as to minimize discomfort. Anyone can learn how to place a central line, but to be a person who can recognize that they feel scared, that they feel sadness for their patient despite knowing that this procedure is necessary for them, that's the person who makes a good doctor. A good doctor feels emotions deeply and uses that to the work that must be done. My father is an emotional person who is also a doctor.

They seem to assume that if they don't straight-up explain, using words, ""hey I am upset"", nobody around them notices that they're yelling, stomping around, mean mugging everybody or just brooding away quietly in some dark corner. 

This seems to be the case no matter how they're feeling. Sexually desperate men are bewildered that women tend to steer clear. Over-excited men are totally unaware that everybody can see them bouncing off the walls. Depressed men assume nobody will notice their flat affect and one-word interactions.

I think men perceive women as ""over-emotional"" because we tend to actually say how we feel, using words, instead of just acting out and pretending nobody can tell how we feel. Speaking about feelings is hella taboo in the world of men. A shock. A splash of cold water. Or worse, a problem that needs solving.

I think you're dead on, but men suppress their emotions way more. Except for anger, which I'm starting to think is the way many men express all of the emotions they are suppressing. Whereas women feel the same emotions but express them instead of bottling them up until anger comes out. 

I remember reading something about how women have had a cultural revolution of sorts that helped redefine what it means to be a woman. Like, women can actually work and be women. They don't have to be stay at home moms, they don't have to be subservient to their spouses. Men haven't had the same sort of redefining(?) of what it means to be a man and so they are stuck in the old-timey view. It doesn't help anything that the alt-right assholes are intentionally trying to reinforce that role for men.

 When I talk about my day and tell a story and get excited or upset about the days events it's viewed as emotional.  If I say something was a negative experience I'm being emotional.

Talk about my friends and relationships and work.  

But men never seem to think they are emotional. They don't like to talk about relationships and don't like to go to therapy and they hide their tears so that makes them devoid of all feelings right?  Nope, not when deciding to speed up and endanger everyone in the vehicle to at yell a bad driver rather than simply avoiding them.  No, it's emotional when a man raises his voice to take over a conversation.  It's emotional when they make jokes that poke at people to build themselves up.  It's emotional when they punch holes in walls, drink endlessly, break things.  It's emotional when you lose at a game and then refuse to play it again.  Anger and aggression are emotions even when they come from men.  No, women are called emotional because when we are that's usually all we are.

This is my observation so take it for nothing because it doesn't mean i think im right. I always thought this meant that (in general but not a rule) men and women process information and make decisions differently. 

There is no ""one way is better than the other"". Just different ways of processing the world around us and making decisions. As a man...my way of looking at things is usually simple...logical and makes sense to me...or so I think. But being married to my amazing wife and seeing her perspective and realizing that a lot of the time i have blinders on. It's not that I can't see things from her decision making perspective, more that it's not my first instinct. Sometimes this is a benefit....other times it's not. 

Let's take the old ""what should we do for dinner"" conversation. From a guys perspective right....""I'm hungry, these places have food, I will go eat their food"". Having had this conversation many...many times, my wife would approach it more like ""how am I going to feel after I eat this? Will they have healthy options? What do I feel like eating?"" All meaningful and valid points that get us no closer to choosing food. 

But this sort of ""this, this then that"" mentality is not so great for other things. Like, dealing with childrennot acting stupid in public and saying dumb shit. There are any more areas in life that suit a style of thought that brings emotion into the equation rather than simple flawed logic.

iy94s3c,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-29 17:59:45,TwoXChromosomes,"I would say that it is related to a less-than-healthy tendency for men to be taught that showing ""emotion"" is a weakness (anger is not considered an ""emotion"" in this context, for some reason). Women are thankfully not as frequently raised this way. The result is that in an environment where one feels safe to do so, women are *more likely* to allow themselves to show their emotions outwardly. Men in the same situation are *more likely* to show only anger-related emotions outwardly, and feel embarrassed when showing anything else. Men are also thusly more likely to call someone out on it; a social defense mechanism, perhaps.

How this relates to your situation, however? I'd chalk that up to each individual's anecdotal experiences.

iy9ctwv,t3_z76wdn,2022-11-29 18:52:03,TwoXChromosomes,"Men think women are more emotional because toxic masculinity suggests expressing emotion is a femine quality, and igornes the fact that men have emotions too, and the reason we express emotion is to digest it and work through it so it doesn't become toxic. So men bottle their emotions and never learn to express or talk about them in a healthy or constructive manner, and then they see us doing just that with ours and project their emotional insecurities on us in order to feel superior and maintain that perception of what makes a man a man.


Then they finally snap and become a family annihilator, or murder suicide, or what have you.


Human beings are emotional, and it will vary from person to person in terms of how much they express it. Some of us process a lot of that internally really well and don't need to express it so heavily in order to do that processing, while others absolutely do. Either way, failing to acknowledge emotions doesn't make them go away.


All it does is make someone emotionally immature and they have no way to express and work through them in a healthy manner, so in the cases of men, it often builds into so much pressure that when they crack and it lets loose, it's explosive and raw as fuck. Which is bad bad not good.

As if other emotions are not reactionary? He was adamant that my saying that anger was an emotion was incorrect at best, dangerous at worst. He spoke very similarly to this guy:

""Would it surprise you to hear that anger is not an emotion? The reason most approaches towards anger management are ineffective is because they teach that anger is an emotion. If, for example, anger is an emotion, how am I to manage it? How does one manage love? How does one manage sadness? How does one manage happiness? I have three college degrees, I have been working as a therapist for 20 + years, and I have lived life to my current age and I have no idea how to manage an emotion. I can modify both my thinking and behavior but if someone told me I needed to manage, let's say, my sadness. I would have no idea how to do that. I mean, I just feel sad, right? Ever heard of a sadness management class?""

Like, yes? You can manage your emotions? Managing them doesn't mean they go away or you stop being able to feel them, you just learn tactics to cope, better dynamics, and how to recognize your own boundaries and limitations.",Illustrious_Sea_5654,t2_d7i3t0s6,2,0,reddit1

](https://www.getbullish.com/bullish-life-when-men-are-too-emotional-to-have-a-rational-argument/)

Longish essay, but here's my favorite part:

>**Women's Emotions are ""Emotions,"" Men's Emotions are ""How People Talk""**

>What I want to talk about is how emotional outbursts typically more associated with men (shouting, expressing anger openly) are given a pass in public discourse in a way that emotional outbursts typically more associated with women (crying, ""getting upset"") are stigmatized.

>I wish to dispel the notion that women are ""more emotional."" I don't think we are. **I think that the emotions women stereotypically express are what men call ""emotions,"" and the emotions that men typically express are somehow considered by men to be something else.**

>This is incorrect. Anger? EMOTION. Hate? EMOTION. Resorting to violence? EMOTIONAL OUTBURST. An irrational need to be correct when all the evidence is against you? Pretty sure that's an emotion. Resorting to shouting really loudly when you don't like the other person's point of view? That’s called *""being too emotional to engage in a rational discussion.""*

>Not only do I think men are at least as emotional as women, I think that these stereotypically male emotions are more damaging to rational dialogue than are stereotypically female emotions. A hurt, crying person can still listen, think, and speak. A shouting, angry person? That person is crapping all over meaningful discourse.

&nbsp;

iy7asgk,t1_iy5omc1,2022-11-29 07:21:39,TwoXChromosomes,"I think it also has a lot to do with how boys are raised. As a little boy, my father would count down to 5 whenever I cried and would spank me if I didn't stop crying by the end of the countdown. I learned to stop crying rather quickly because of that.

I know that telling little boys that crying is not something boys do was prevalent in my generation (kid of the 90s). I really feel that the problem is an educational one, boys (at least in my generation, I do think it has gotten better lately) have not been taught to properly communicate emotions or value emotions. Men were taught that the only emotion that was valid as kids was anger so that's why they resort to this and why they don't classify anger/shouting/throwing a tantrum as being emotional. Having a big percentage of men emotionally stunted creates an environment where they are unable to properly navigate emotion or behave rationally whenever they have big feelings. And when men call women emotional, it's really a blind spot from their upbringing.

I've worked hard over time to try and get rid of that toxic thinking I've been brought up with.

All the casual misogyny, often even to the point of completely objectifying good people to only the physical attributes which they found sexually arousing, the way that they would sometimes sit around in large groups and describe in detail the ways they would violate girls who had no desire or consent to being in that situation...  I hated it.  And even if I had had the confidence at the time to stand up and say ""this is wrong, we shouldn't be doing this"", they'd just tell me not to be so serious about it and continue right on with it, to just shut up and go away, or maybe even give me a black eye for my trouble.

Nail, head. Our society is basically an abuser. Follow the rules and you won't get punished. Sometimes that is very explicit. We've definitely seen a lot of recently in the US. But the more subtle stuff easily gets normalized just like an abuse victim will come to accept their situation as normal and blame themselves. Of course there is individual agency. People survive abuse and thrive. But most of us follow the rules. 

A lot of people don't know how to express their emotions in a healthy way. And that is almost entirely the fault of men since men controlled all the major socialization institutions that taught this bullshit for so long and still mostly do. Even with early education where most teachers have been women, men ran the schools, wrote the curriculum, wrote the textbooks, and so on. And many women also bought into the whole thing too because socialization is powerful. You usually don't even notice it. We grow up being gaslighted in many ways.

The dumbest (but not worst) part is men inflict this toxic bullshit on ourselves. We literally make our lives worse so I guess we can make it even worse for women? It's insane. It's cutting off your nose to spite your face. And all the incel types are screaming, ""society is the problem"" which is true, they just have it completely backwards.

iy6sv1k,t1_iy5keth,2022-11-29 04:08:01,TwoXChromosomes,"TL;DR: Your boyfriend might be expressing some unchallenged assumptions resulting from patriarchy. I explore the same assumptions in myself by writing the stuff below in the guise of offering advice? I reach the stunning and insightful conclusion that patriarchy=bad.

I see myself in what your boyfriend has said to you. It sounds like something I could say, possibly with a different inflection (at least I'd hope so). If I were to say that emotions are gendered, I would also be saying that that sucks because patriarchy made it so. Here's my maximum charity take on what your boyfriend said:

If we're looking at society as a whole, certain expressions of emotion are absolutely gendered. But I don't think it's even in a binary sense, like certain expressions of sorrow or affection are 'unmasculine' instead of 'feminine' and I personally would feel unsafe or uncomfortable expressing them in public. Anger is the 'safe' option for men, and it's easy to transfer almost any negative emotion into anger, releasing it in a socially accepted, if unhealthy, way. Expressing genuine disappointment or sorrow or frustration that leaves you in a crying mess is something that's not 'allowed' or socially 'safe' to do as a male within patriarchy. Throwing a mantrum is (bizarrely). For another example, I only express joy at seeing something cute when I know that I'm around people who won't judge me for it. 

Therefore, from a male perspective, it is easy to (mis)characterise emotions that women can express in public (without the same social censure that you would expect as a man) as being 'feminine' emotions. Of course the concept that emotions themselves are gendered is daft, but I'm continuously aware that there are expressions of emotion that will affect how others perceive my gender identity (masculinity is fragile). This *might* be where your boyfriend is coming from.

Now, I dunno how 'pettiness' gets coded feminine, your boyfriend might just have a dumbass take there, I'm not sure of his logic. It's up to you how much charity you want to give him. You know the tone and inflection of how he made that statement to you. My impression is that it was a bit of a throwaway comment and might not have the most consideration or emotional literacy behind it. I've personally had to seek out and work on my understanding in this area, it's not something I was taught as a matter of course growing up.

What u/cantretrievepassword said in their comment also applies, though. I've just done a manlogic^TM and framed the situation in a way that I fundamentally understand to assist you in *framing it his way*, and I don't like what that says about me and my communication skills. It shouldn't be on you to have to understand where he's coming from all the time, he needs to also work for your perspective.

Is he teachable? Then helping him understand ~~his dumbassery~~ that he's picked up some messed up ideas somewhere might be an option. Does he resist correction in this, resist the idea that framing emotions as gendered is misogynistic and therefore should be challenged? Then definitely protect yourself. 

I really hope my framing of emotional expression being restricted or permitted based on patriarchal gender norms isn't also misogynistic. If I'm honest, I don't *really* understand why the concept of emotions being gendered is upsetting to you. I understand *that* this idea upsets you, but I actually had to write all this out to get an appreciation of *why*. I also felt a bit surprised that this was something you weren't aware of. Gendering emotions is a massive part of male socialisation, or at least it was for me. You being upset at this concept initially struck me as being upset the sky is blue. Doesn't everybody know that boys aren't allowed certain feelings?

I learned emotional repression at an all-boys high school as a survival skill, and am spending many more years taking that apart. That's how patriarchy got me, and I assume that patriarchy gets women by slightly different methods like taking those expressions of emotion forbidden to men and using them to frame women as irrational, like how a woman's anger is too often reframed as hysteria and 'safely' ignored. Therefore patriarchy has no reason to systematically teach women that emotions are gendered, because whatever emotions women express can be used by patriarchal society to discredit them in the eyes of men (because women use the forbidden 'girl' feelings, how can you trust them. Real men only cry over the soccer). The consequence of this is a bunch of emotionally stunted men who are easy to control via dominance hierarchies common to patriarchy and the systematic erasure of women's voices and influence over said men.

I feel like that's far too simple a model (so much more going on) but it seems to fit, and explains to my dumb ass why you're upset (because this is yet another pile of bullshit keeping women down, there's mountains of it, and it sounds exhausting and depressing, and I can imagine that it feels like an extra betrayal when it comes from an intimate partner that you felt safe in trusting), my surprise at you being upset (I had assumed female socialisation was the inverse of male socialisation), and as a bonus, how totally fucked patriarchy is and why men's liberation is only through feminism.",MiscWanderer,t2_3p96ntbq,2,0,reddit1

iy5xi2y,t1_iy5jvma,2022-11-29 00:02:05,TwoXChromosomes,"I think the way to talk to him is to acknowledge that he isn't strictly speaking wrong. Emotions are gendered in that they are societally perceived to be more common in one gender or another, and importantly, the display of said emotions implies the gender of the displayer. Men who cry or are emotionally vulnerable are seen as feminine, women who show too much anger or emotional repression are, well I hesitate to say they are perceived as manly, because media and society tends to frame them more as bitchy or frigid, but suffice it to say, they are seen as less feminine than women who might appear to be more passive. You find these tropes in all of the media we consume, in the vast majority of books, movies, television, radio, fine art, video games, advertisements, etc. 

So he is sort of right. But he is also wrong, dangerously wrong even. The vast majority of people on Earth have similar enough capacities for emotions that it is a common experience. Everyone can feel angry, petty, upset, grief, fear, etc. It may manifest in different ways, due to socialization, it may be interpreted different ways through a societal lens which is heavily patriarchal, but it is fundementally the same for everyone. 

Press him on this. He acknowledges that all people have the capacity for so called feminine or masculine emotions. So where did the gender come from in the first place. If you're lucky, you might prompt introspection, and he might be swayed to your point of view, which is that emotions as a human experience are not gendered, and should not be gendered. If you aren't lucky, well, you may find out his rationale for his beliefs and argue accordingly. I would hazard a guess that he holds a misguided belief that the different genders experience emotions at different proportions, and that men are more predisposed to anger whereas women are more predisposed to compassion.

If my wife returns home from a challenging day or I come home to her, the issues we discuss need to be listened to and recognized before any kind of advice or thoughts can be brought up. 
If she is agitated about something and I have the exact solution, communicating that to her while she is on floor 10 emotionally speaking does no good if I'm not there with her. Even talking about tasks that she ""needs to do"" WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DONE, I can't say they are done without letting her finish speaking FIRST.
 
I can pontificate all day about 'only wanting to help', but unless we are both on the same floor with our emotions, there is no real communication, all I may do is support and listen.

I wanted to rush too the end when it was already resolved instead of realizing life is a journey and the moments we spend LISTENING are just as important as every moment together.

I, on the other hand, do not, at all, speak about the same MANNER of things. This is where the confusion most men have is.  As you said, once again(very good observations too), men just want to be validated in their emotions. True. 100% 

Men are emotional cripples. Myself being the most hobbled of any on the planet. Anything that gives me the slightest upset at all needs to be purged and burned away. I need to be told I'm a good boy and mommy loves me even though daddy beat me with a two inch belt.

I digress, putting on a strong front of ""I've got it handled"" is a very man thing to do, because nothing bothers us at all.... right? I'm okay aren't I? Please agree so the fragile shell of my identity can protect me for the crushing self loathing that was beaten into me during my formative years..... but... ""I've got it handled"" 

I'll just self harm a little to numb away these emotions. If I was being solution oriented I'd just walk myself into the bush without a bag.

We all build up these sensitive identities within ourselves; if we can listen to our wives and husbands without being so defensive and thinking it is all about us somehow, then real communication can start. 

If we can extend ourselves to see someone as a child who deserves love, even when they've pissed their pants instead of beating them with a belt.... maybe we'll handle things better.

No my story isn't everyone, and not all people have emotional disorders like PTSD, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or Borderline Personality Disorder; Or any other of the varied comorbidities which effect my wife an I. Some people are normal... (whatever that is)? ...and it seems so easy to snap out a blanket of catchall situations -and it feels good to do it- If we are being honest with ourselves and others....?

I think everyone could do with a little more attention to the details, and if not, at minimum a little compassion for the little girls who got their hair pulled, the boys who got a race car for Christmas instead of a doll or the child that just needed a little love from daddy that never came.

Communicating isn't always a deep affair. I don't strike up a conversation with the guy taking a shit on the street across from the local Wendy's; 
I'm not even that interested in talking to my own kid about about his Pokémon cards, though for him I can rummage up a ""that's good buddy...""

I'm never going to be a good man. I'm not a good husband. I'm not a great father. I certainly will never really know if I was a good son or not. I'll likely never experience emotions correctly (whatever that means) but right now; 'I've got it handled' 

PS(I've got it handled because you listened. Which is what really mattered and made the difference) We're just people, and after everything is said and done? ... maybe not even that. Maybe more?",BooFFarr,t2_8i38vbrt,1,0,reddit1
iy7rv94,t1_iy65m16,2022-11-29 11:25:49,TwoXChromosomes,"Toxicity applies to both genders that is true. 

I don’t know how to word this properly but if my friends are angry or sad, they aren’t really angry or sad, they just want to act like they are and get it off their chest. Unless it’s something serious. 
But everyone defines serious differently. Is it seriously aggravating that your favourite soccer club is losing right now? Or is it seriously aggravating that you crashed your car? 
I think that men and women often define the seriousness of something differently. 
Whereas I’d say “peanuts”, somebody different freaks out.
And from my experience dudes get angry easily and women get disappointed or sad more easily than the other gender. 

But you have to distinguish between real emotions and emotions that are shown to vent and are not “serious”. 

And in the case of my ex gf she took many things very seriously to the point I stopped feeling myself and overthink every word I’d say. I know this doesn’t apply to every woman. And I hope it doesn’t",Youngestmark,t2_zw3j9,-1,0,reddit1

That’s not strictly true: we know that experience shapes the development of the brain. We know that regions of the brain develop at different paces, some develop until we are 25yo and beyond. After that, our brains still change when we learn, react, and experience life.

All that is to say…. Even if one study demonstrated that women are better at identifying their emotions, it does NOT mean women’s brains are designed for this outcome. It can very well be explained by socialization and the fact that girls are expected to manage their own AND other peoples’ emotions. The boy child is not expected to do the same. Therefore the brain is shaped accordingly and places attention on what society deems to be important according to their role.

But in my experience, and from what I've heard from others who have healthy relationships with their emotions, anger is a healthy emotion that has its time and place like any other emotion. It's when we tell ourselves that anger is bad or off-limits and do our best to avoid expressing it at any cost that it erupts dangerously. Anger can embolden us to right injustices at a societal level, or just speak up when someone says something to us that isn't right. It definitely takes practice depending on how you were raised, but anger is a useful emotion, and it can alert us to when we aren't being treated well, or when we are sensitive and maybe other emotions are at play too in the background.",the_queens_speech,t2_dsguv,25,0,reddit1

Life sucks in MANY ways but when it comes to people being horrible and disrespectful? You can always set boundaries, communicate, and if all fails remove yourself from a toxic situation that no longer serves you.


I’m sorry you feel that this is just how life is but you should communicate as an adult when you’re disrespected and people cross lines with you.

And this definitely isn't an ""all men are this way"" thing.  There are plenty of good, caring, supportive men who will call out this bullshit the moment it starts, but often they aren't the loud ones making their voices heard to the suggestible people in earshot.  It's more about the fact that there are men (and boys) who will say this sort of shit out in the open like it's okay.  That being ""one of the guys"" means that when the women are out of the room, you'll get guys like this who will start spewing the quiet part out loud and it is grotesque and upsetting, and will treat you like a freak if you try and shut them down.  I'd almost like to find some of those boys now, grown up with kids of their own, and ask how they'd feel about some kid who doesn't know anything talking that way about their daughters.

Really though, I don't think there's any innate qualities that say that one gender is better/worse than the other in terms of character.  People are people, and I believe all people are inherently good.  But I also believe people are incredibly good at adapting to any situation, mentally and socially, and kids internalize what they hear, more than most realize.  Parents are a huge part of it, but it takes a village to raise a child.  And crap like this is self-perpetuating, because it keeps getting passed down from awful people to the kids in their midst.  Fixing this problem is going to take a long time, but even little things like the shows you mention help.

Yeah, there's definitely some people I'm ashamed to share a gender with.  But sincerely, thank you for your kind words.  I hope that I can be worthy of the change I want to see in the world.  And even beyond this, I'm so glad I didn't get caught up in that mentality, because it would have meant missing out on some absolutely amazing, wonderful friends who just happen to lack a Y chromosome.

It's NOT a neutral slur, because men do it to other men on purpose on the grounds that it is insulting to be compared to women, to feminity. It is misogynistic because to be referenced as emotional, which is seen everywhere by every society as feminine is an insult. And you insult men by calling them emotional which is a feminine trait. You're willfully being dense about it. 

I was trying to be subtle in asking you to listen, but instead you double down and reaffirm your reasoning disregarding the experiences of women.

You're trying to mansplain something that happens to us on the daily and regard it as a neutral insult when it is in fact inherently misogynistic, and by doing so, being dismissive of our collective experiences.

To cut it short, Francesco I(sorry im using the italian name because I'm Italian😅) were always tempted by Italy, in an arrange marriage he was able to make his child(Enrico II) the husband of Caterina de medici. Francesco I always tried to have Italy, he did but for short period of time, then he died and his child became the king. After they loose the territory of Italy for another time Enrico, due to other factor, were very reluctant to start the war and today historic are very tended to think that, without the pushing of caterina(she wanted Italy back because she was from florence) he would have never started another war. Prstically she started the war(she also said in one of her last letter that she always wanted Italy back and that she would have done aniything).
The point that I wanted to do was that we know that in history a lot of king considered the idea and thought of their queen. It's storically incorrect to say that was always the queen who started the wa, but as well as is saying that queen never started or agreed to war. 

Also I think that bringing up history is not fair, we don't really know what seriously happened in the past or the true reason behind wars, of course a lot of them were made because Kings were petty(I just think of caligola in the roman empire) but I think that the majority pf what we think were started because of pettiness had, in reality, a lot of connection that we can't even imagine.",EmbarrassedMall6365,t2_9wewx55l,3,0,reddit1

iy8u9zb,t1_iy8q7wj,2022-11-29 16:50:34,TwoXChromosomes,"You misunderstand me or you simply don’t wish to read what I stated. Our meetings have time slots where each employee has a chance for 2 minutes to pitch their plan for the project they have been assigned. He could not stay composed for two minutes. I was not frustrated, I was distracted. I got frustrated when he said I would get emotional about interruptions and he’s referencing a time where he interrupted me and I told him we each have our time to speak. This is a structured meeting with time slots for each individual and an open panel discussion at the end. 
Perhaps your need to defend him comes from a flaw you have and you feel this strong urge to defend a situation you were not in but perhaps relate to being on the opposite end. I can assure you interrupting people in professional meetings when it is their turn to speak is not appropriate and is in fact disrespectful.
I understand accidentally interrupting one another in casual conversations or open ended discussions. However, this was not the case. 

You have the luxury as a man to not think about the role your gender plays in corporate politics/ work environments and general country laws, I don’t have the same luxury. Unfortunately, I live in a small and close minded country that still has gender discriminatory laws. 

I can see where you stand and I can see that I will never change your mind. You did not enter this discussion with an open mind but rather a fixed perspective on the situation at hand. You do not read my messages with an intention to understand, you read them to form replies and let’s be real you don’t read them fully. You reject the idea that people might have found your interruptions rude and perhaps see yourself in my coworker. 

I don’t wish to sound like a broken record but setting boundaries and communicating emotions is not weak nor is it distracting from work if anything it truly builds a team spirit when you speak to one another with compassion and respect. Being a horrible person and doing something horrible are not always mutually exclusive. I did not suggest he’s a terrible person but rather behaved in a disrespectful manner. I disagree with the act and not the person.

Since we’re giving each other our 2 cents; I would highly recommend you bring up the need to defend male strangers interrupting a female colleague in your next therapy session. I would also recommend you note how uncomfortable regular human emotions have made you through out this conversation. If you do not have a therapist I highly recommend you go see one. Society has raised men to believe their emotions are a weakness and in result men do not process their emotions in a healthy way. They end up bottling it up until they explode which either hurts them or other people. Men are less likely to seek mental health help and are more likely to commit suicide and violent acts. 

I hope you do not see this in a passive-aggressive way as going to therapy will only help you understand yourself, prejudices and emotions better.

ize2nkn,t1_iy8vm52,2022-12-08 12:54:00,TwoXChromosomes,"It baffles me how people like you, with an inability to wait ""a minute"" before speaking, can put blame on the individual who is being interrupted during a 2 minute pitch. What if she wasn't allowed to finish her pitch because her 2 minutes were up? These things add up. How is it that you can justify this man's impatience when there is an open panel discussion at the end? If we define a professional environment as a social code you follow while at work, then he broke it. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean that a breach of professional etiquette has no consequence. There are very few places where you can behave at work the way you do at home. It isn't unnatural to want to finish the pitch you worked on. If you're are accustomed to interrupting people then that's fine, but you you shouldn't be upset or surprised when it isn't appreciated. ""...buck the fuck up, stop annoying"" people with your poor impulse control or complete disregard for their time. If you are making the conscious decision to interrupt, then you're telling people your interjection is SO much more important than what they're saying that you can't wait for them to finish. That's rude.

“'You have the luxury as a man' is such a cop out, if it was a female interrupting you would you be as mad or have written this post? Probably not..""

That makes no sense. If it was a *woman*, the cause of her interruption would less likely be about her gender, and they probably wouldn't have tacked on the comment about her being emotional. You conveniently left out the rest of that section. ""You have the luxury as a man to not think about the role your gender plays in corporate politics/ work environments and general country laws, I don’t have the same luxury. Unfortunately, I live in a small and close minded country that still has gender discriminatory laws."" Are you trying to ignore the effect one's gender might have on their experiences in society?

""he said I would get emotional about interruptions and he’s referencing a time where he interrupted me and I told him we each have our time to speak.""

Where in any of her posts or comment has she stated that she responded to him emotionally in either scenario? He has done this to her before and I highly doubt that all of her coworkers are subjected to this behavior. There is nothing to suggest otherwise here.

""You’re an employee, not a woman at work.""

Are you kidding? She's both. Do you also not see color? Considering that you never addressed her boyfriend assigning emotions genders, I bet the problem here is that you agree with her coworkers and/or boyfriend. 

""I talk over and get talked over all the time, it’s literally how natural conversation has happened my whole life, there’s no turns in real life. There’s no hall pass to hold and say 'it’s my turn'""

This isn't natural conversation. It's a 2 minute pitch.

""People want to talk when they have thoughts to add and it’s just a part of life that you won’t always get to get your thoughts out cleanly without being interrupted""

Unless you're given a two minute pitch with time for questions and comments at the end. Then you should be able to present what you've prepared cleanly sans interruption.

""I’d be willing to bet this is going to cause strife within your team and you talking at them about what you need is only gonna make them judge you and not respect you as much anymore""

I don't see why talking at them would be a problem, seeing as that's what a presentation is, barring the presenters request for audience participation and/or input.

""Again. You’re at work. No one cares if you’re in the minority. You’re an employee, not a woman at work. Everyone else is employees too. Just because you feel like you deserve time and attention from your colleagues doesn’t mean they owe it to you. And that’s just a fact of life""

Well I'd argue they do owe you time and attention, if someone set aside time in a conference room for each employee to present their 2 minute pitches. This isn't a water cooler chat.

And someone excitedly waving their hand like a small child in a room with <10 people in it is definitely an interruption. When it's done passive-aggressively to interrupt a coworker while maintaining plausible deniability, it's disrespectful. That's how little children behave when searching for a loophole. If we really walk it back, he could've ""bucked the fuck up"" and waited, but he didn't.

And there's nothing wrong with a thesis. It's her life so it's normal for her to care about it this much. Going by your logic, the amount you commented on this post shows you care way too much about this stranger's life. 

Not that I believe that. As long as you aren't obsessed with reddit, I see nothing wrong with a thesis. And as a sidenote: I think her update edit further proves how calmly and rationally she has approached this situation and work and home. The whole ""emotional"" argument finds no footing here.",jlojiggle,t2_158vyy,1,0,reddit1

I did this at work once because a guy told me he was going to find me outside of work and beat me up and that I was a ""faggot"". This was because I told him to stop joking around so we could finish a team project. He was the type of guy who tried to flirt with every pretty girl in nasty ways and talked crap all the time.   


I did the routine and he just got more quiet and red in the face. And then I did it for a couple more days until management called me in to tell me I was harassing him. I agreed and told them when he had said to me. And that opened a can of worms, witnesses called, security tapes reviewed, and he ended up fired. I was just asked not to do that again.

Most of us cant up and quit these days and dont want to be fired.  


Another thing to consider is why someone might be telling the sexist or bigoted joke. In my office it would be to single that we feel that shit is awful, but I have worked at places where it signals being bigoted. Any sexist joke at my place of work is generally going to come from women mocking sexist men we encounter. One of our best network engineers is a woman. Well organized, ex military, star player. She makes the sexist jokes often after having to deal with idiotic customers who just need to listen to her.

But we look like hypocrites sometimes since we'll speak in a gay voice and say goofy shit. These gay people are also in our social circle though. So they have been part of or witness conversations where venom is directed at groups or people who have issues with LGBTs.   


New NOC manager is hired at a place. They are going over shit and new noc manager, who some of us know from other ventures, keeps droping the 'that's gay'. The guy who hired him is gay, but the new noc manager doesnt know this. The guy is getting a bit red in the face and calls an end to the meeting. I had to clue the guy in that the manager was gay.... he had an oh shit moment... stopped using gay for lame... The gay manager wasnt really out to everyone. He was to his parents, and a few people. That was pretty much the month he came out. We're all drinking after work in the bar in the build we work at and I start busting the noc managers balls and next thing we know the gay manager is openly out.

My social station at most of the places I have worked at allow me to be direct like that.  I once told the owner of the company I was working at that some might not find that funny at an xmas party. I could say that because I'd worked for him at another venture and was known, and appreciated, as the guy who doesnt hold back. He also listened once when I said 'yeah, that stupid, can we not do that.' I had to explain, but he agreed and we avoided some suffering. *I* am a feather ruffeler. 

Not every has that social capital to spend, especially women unfortunately. The more they do speak up the better for all of us, but it comes with risk for the individual.

As far as tactics go, I like the more direct, can you not do that approach -vs- the ruse of 'i dont understand, can you explain it'. The only reason I dont completely poopoo in the later is that I understand being direct is not always an option. But it needed some poopooing on as one needs to read the room as it were and feel out the repercussions. We all want to be brave and always speak up... but the reality is if we do so we might screw ourselves bad. At will work states... general blow back that has people treated like lepers at the work place, and so on. You know; the unfair sexist or bigoted garbage that women often have to navigate.

I mean, fuck... lets just consider the internet for a moment... a woman, or man, can speak up about sexism and the internet hate machine goes right to work with insults, rape and death threats. Upset some random dude by being snarky while calling them out on their sexism? That random dudes social station has people on his side, not yours.

Women sexist against women boils my blood. When women slut/whore shame they feel like they have the right because they are women. it's not always so they wont be targets... it will be because that is the way they think. They have bought into that reality. Often they feel these ideas dont apply to them, they are different. I recall several women I know saying 'I wish he would grab me by the pussy' rejecting the idea anything was wrong with what trump said. Implic bias... the social narrative sells ideas about who you are and you buy into them even if they are negative and apply to you... this really fucks up black people as they believe the garbage narratives put before them.

One has to feel this out like one would feel out if someone smokes pot, is an atheist, being gay or any of the other shit people keep secret.

A story I have... two network engineers decided to store their chatlogs on a sever that all of the noc, systems, engineering, and provisioning had access to. Someone in the noc was trying to hunt down some file issue and ran across these logs. The logs were read, and were found to contain crazy sexually explicit conversations about one of the girls who worked at the noc. She was beautiful. These guys left very little unsaid in this chat. These two guys are also shit heads imo. Their views on a great number of things need lead pipes taken to them. So the noc worker reported these logs to his manager. All three people get fired. The person who spoke up? He was fired for creating a hostile work place. He could have fought it but decided to just accept the 50+ weeks of unemployment. The girl stayed there for a while and then quit. She was really smart and good at what she did, but the job didnt pay much, had shit hours.

While studies do indeed have varied results, one of the better ones found that men and women both apologize when they feel something is wrong enough that and apology is needed. Men, as it turns out, simply don’t feel it necessary as often than women. A theory on why this is states that women are more concerned with social harmony and thus, more readily identify events as potentially offensive.
 
Which is fine until you are thrown into a world that is dominated by people who do not communicate the same way. And indeed, as soon as many women assert themselves, they are dismissed as being a bitch or being overly emotional. I’ve fought this for decades at this point, finding it necessary to come into any discussion with far more evidence than is necessary to make my point and still being brushed off as being a pearl clutching mother, a bitch, pushy, and overly emotional about the subject at hand - and that’s just when I point out, in writing, that specific rules aren’t being followed.

I was visiting Chicago for a work conference, Ubering everywhere as I was staying with family and was in and out at odd times. The conference had a metric ton of people at it and it was at a huge convention center where everyone gathered at the same place to get picked up. My second Uber on my first day picked me up so I could go get lunch on the lake, and this for all intents and purposes was a typical Uber ride, a nicer than average car, a more talkative driver as well...so after about 20 minutes on Lakeshore the driver asks me if he can have lunch with me and I don't even know how to answer so I say I'm meeting someone, okay guy seems unphased and he asks how long I'll be in Chicago, I say about 8 days and he says ""How would you feel if I was your Uber the whole time?"" I was so fucking confused, nothing about this interaction said I was a good tipper or even someone who cared about this person's interests and he attempts giving me his number as we pull up to the spot. I get lunch, go to my brothers apartment, work for a bit and forget about it, until later when I bring it up again to my brother and his fiance and they are kind of mortified, supposedly that's been a gateway to some ""issues"" recently in the area and yeah, fuck that.

Let me spell it out for you: it is always wrong to hit on customers. In a professional situation, people are paying for a particular service. That's it. In some situations, the customer is particularly vulnerable, such as, when they are a doctor's patient or a lawyer's client--or a driver's rider. But it is always wrong. A person has already paid. They owe nothing more (attention, invitations, sex) and should not be put in a position to have to defend against it",Charakada,t2_zgb8e,49,0,reddit3

One day a new guy showed up, and he also had a blue truck. They were about the same size, and Andrew got along well with him. Trying to bond over similar masculine vehicles or something. Someone told the new guy his truck should have a name, and Andrew said ""You can't call it Big Blue, that's my truck.""

I said ""You should call it Bigger Blue.""

Y'all. The look of sheer horror on his face at this nickname. You could tell Andrew was terrified of it, and of the thought that people would start calling it ""Bigger Blue."" 

Years later I realised he was probably treating his truck as a metaphorical cock, which is why his had to be the biggest.

What monitor is 5k? Like 55"" curved widescreens are $3k. Even 32"" 8k screens are only $4k. Anything pricier, like for medical imaging would likely be provided by the employer. For work, I found big screens to be too much of a problem, as my neck hurt from constantly looking to the side.

You “can’t” use a handicapped parking space, accessible bathroom, or wheelchair ramp? You really believe that if paralyzed people had to regularly leave their electric wheelchairs unattended in public, they would never get stolen?

Ergonomically designed office equipment puts much less strain on backs, eyes, etc. things that most people appreciate, but aren’t willing to shell out for bc they can do just fine with the normal version. 

I don’t know the specific disabilities here, and I don’t have or use a $5k monitor because I don’t need one, and that’s a lot of money. But I do have a sister-in-law who had to get a used BMW bc it was the least expensive car she could find that had the kind of seat controls that would allow her to drive for more than 5 minutes due to the neuropathy that impacts her neck muscles.

I know how it was for her before she got the car. How she tried different cushions and supports. I know how frustrating it was for her to not be able to drive. The things she missed out on. I know what it was like when she test drove the car, and what it did to her family finances as they scrimped and saved for it. And I know how much freedom that car allows her. That freedom is worth every penny. 

Your lack of empathy is astounding. You really think that you have to personally understand the value of something in order for it to have a value?  Person pays lots of money for something that they say is needed to work. And other people steal it, and act like it’s not a big deal. And you pile on because you don’t personally understand what it’s like to not be able to use the “normal” version.

I commented on a separate comment, but here’s my story:

My husband and I were both working before we had children. His salary far eclipsed mine, so when we found out we were having twins (double the daycare), it made sense (or I thought it did) to be a SAHM. 

He’s my ex husband now (we separated before my kids were even six months old because he could not deal with being a father at all). I ended up with full custody for the first 5.5 years of my sons’ lives.

He’s had various issues throughout the years but is still employable for large amounts of dollars. I WAS a solid graphic designer, but technology went wild while I was parenting. Now I can’t even figure out how to make a website on Wordpress so there’s no way to offer services or show my work.

I spent money I didn’t have trying to figure it out and I ended up with nothing to show for it. I can’t even get my email that’s linked to my domain working and even though he works in tech, he’s always too busy to help. 

I do not regret raising my children or being a SAHM, but the memories are mostly my own because my kids were too young to remember a lot. I do however, wish I’d magically had the energy to keep up with Insta, etc.

I’m 50+ and it’s probably too late to turn things around. I enjoy an OK (not poverty lifestyle), but that’s going to change as the kids get older and move out. I’m also incredibly dependent on a man who was absolutely garbage to me and his children.

If I had a do-over I might have chosen the childcare option even if it meant I’d be missing out on memories only I remember anyway. I was good enough in my chosen career I made a living freelancing once.

What does broken household mean? Like divorce? He’s blaming divorce on working moms? If so. He’s not entirely wrong. No fault divorce and financial liberty has led to a rise in divorce. That’s a good thing for women... They no longer need to stay in unhappy and abusive relationships. Are they the root cause of these divorces. No. But still. It’s best not to engage when people screech about broken families. Because that’s a way for them to say they wish women were chained in slavery to the men they married.

Then we’re jumping into the topic of raising children. Is something going on with children that they’re now broken. I’m confused by his thread and whatever dots he seems to be randomly connecting. Are they becoming terrible because they’re not being raised by their parents. Like what’s his point? 

Then we’re jumping into the subject of capitalism. Which is a whole other issue and not exactly relevant. Because as much as it would be good for families to receive support (because it’s kinda fucked up the way we treat people who aren’t part of the elite in this country) the reality is that even with paid maternity leave and social supports, women will still continue to work because the alternative is to rely on men and we’ve learned through history that’s a very bad idea.

As far as men stepping up. I agree. Lots of women would still be married if their partners stepped up. But unfortunately the trend at the moment seems to be on blaming women for being too picky. 🤷🏽‍♀️ I’m not sure why. It’s not convincing anyone to be less picky. It’s just pissing women off more.

In my opinion it isn't that women are working that is causing the majority of issues but rather the parents working so hard and long that they don't get a chance to actually be a parent to their children.  This wasn't really an issue before women started working because the women could take up the slack of the man working too much but when women started needing to work as well to make the household financially viable the issues started to pop up.  The requirement from more higher income jobs to work more than 40 hours a week and long commute times also doesn't help.

The fix isn't to stop women from working but rather adjusting the workload so that parents have enough time and energy to focus on being a parent for their kids when they get home after work on weekdays and the weekends.",Emu1981,t2_nm4b8,2,0,reddit2

1. Fathers should step up.
2. Women continuing to work is so that they can have some independence. Also, not all households can afford a single income family. When the children are old enough to be home solo, a woman who left work for a number of years to raise children will find it hard to get back into the workforce. She will also have less superannuation to depend on when she is old and (presumably) her husband dies (assuming he earns the median income in any country, which isn't enough). Women working is GOOD for society. Also, working class women and peasants have always worked no matter their gender. They would not afford to not work. They may not have been paid fairly, but they still worked. They were washer women, seamstresses, mantua makers, milliners, cooks, bakers, cleaners, secretaries, they were lamp lighters, nurses, teachers, au pairs, professional housekeepers, shop keepers, nuns, farmers, and they rung the morning bell in cities to wake people up... etc... . And this is just in Europe. In other places, women also worked. Anyone who says they wish things would go back to ""traditional"" ways and women stay at home is deluded and has no real concept of women's history.
3. The man who posted that tiktok is probably very disrespectful of childcare workers and teachers. He will also be disrespectful of nurses when he gets older and needs them. I don't think you should take anyone seriously if they are disrespectful of the people doing some of the most important, and often difficult, work in any country. 
4. Some people are dismissive of the difficulty of childcare work and also say that teachers (including high school teachers) get holidays, so they should not be respected because holidays = easy job. But in many countries teachers are not paid for those holidays and need to get 2nd or 3rd part-time jobs to make ends meet. They also have to complete their professional development during that time (so they always refreshing their knowledge)... and if you think teaching or childcare is easy, YOU go and do it and see how easy it is to control a class of 30 kids who would all rather be somewhere else or on  their phones all day.

Years ago my daughter told her teacher that she got locked in the basement when she was in kindergarten. I had protective services come to my house while I was working in the field and it messed me up. It was especially extremely triggering because being Indigenous and watching my family live in care, cousins get taken into care and on and on I was convinced I’d lose my daughter even though I know I did nothing wrong. The house we were living in was over 100 years old and had shifted, making the basement door stick. She was never locked down there but she wasn’t strong enough to open the door from the stairs when she went into the basement. We took the whole door off in front of the worker and never heard about it again. It was a very scary and low moment for me. 

That trauma is partly why I do what I do. I want Indigenous representation for the families we work with who are over represented in Indigenous communities. I want someone who’s an Indigenous parent to be the one coming to my house to assess a call in. For a long while my job focused strictly on reunifying kids back to their parents care because it was the least traumatic position I could take.

The ""absolute pay gap"" argument just dismisses what this controls for.

But this in reverse just dismisses the possibility that maybe men end up at better higher paying jobs and positions because thy get promoted more. Apart from that deserves to be mentioned for completeness it is entirely possible that women are just worse and there is a preferential treatment for promoting women that offsets but not completely this. Unlikely but should be mentioned that none of those researches can account for any of that.

The only way to account for that is to some-how test how people are promoted while the promoter is unaware of the gender of the employee some-how which obviously is not how companies work.

Also note that this is Britain, France and Germany where unlike in the US people rarely negotiate their salary; everyone at the same position just gets the same. ""Negotiating your salary"" and a confidentiality agreement for your salary is a very US thing. The salary is just advertised when you apply for the most part in Europe unless it's highly subjective like in art forms.

The highest paying jobs often require a specific personality type which most people would say is mildly crazy and men are more likely to suffer from this type of personality.

I remember listening to a clinical psychologist who consulted for high power law firms who described this phenomena. Often in the law firms there were equal numbers of men and women lawyers in the lower ranks. But as they got to the higher ranks (partners in the law firm) few women wanted to stay... The reason for this is that to become a partner you need to work 80 hours a week and be available when your client calls you at 3am on a Sunday and be prepared to solve whatever problem they are having. Who the hell wants to do that? The answer is crazy dudes who get their self worth and happiness from having a bigger bonus than their Co worker. Even though the extra $50,000 doesn't make your life any better considering your $250,000+ salary.

I've seen US studies that show it anywhere from 5-8% even after accounting for everything which is, coincidentally, the same gap Asian Americans face. 

I'd say any gap is a problem. I'd say any man who's told they'll be taking a 3% or even 1% paycut for *no good reason* would be quite upset. That's to say nothing of the 5-8% that you might see in the US which could be well over 100k throughout your working life. That's the difference between a couple new cars, paying for your kids' college. And the fact that these studies consistently show that the gap always favors men is telling. If it were statistically insignificant and random, I'd just figure that about half the time it would show the gap the other way, but it doesn't.

One factor is how women are restricted socially. Women have a harder time being advanced in many fields because the qualities we want/need are more acceptable in men.

Or his straight talk is her bitchyness.

dl26vfw,t1_dl22pc8,2017-08-02 14:15:52,TwoXChromosomes,"I work in the construction industry. The company I work for has no problem at all with hiring women workers. 

But our applicants are skewed probably 95% men. From the experience we've had with women who have applied, interviewed and been hired. We haven't had one stay more than two days. This is due to the hard physical labor that is our line of work. We expect the same work from a woman that we do a man. We don't expect the women to know how to do everything thing, the same way we don't expect the men to know everything. It takes time to learn the job. 

Just a few days ago another part of the company hired a female operator. She has the licensing for running the equipment but said in her interview that no company would let her work to get any experience. I think that's a shame. She's hired and if she did not start today she starts soon. I hope she kicks ass and is leading a crew in six months. Which is what any male operator would be doing in six months if he kicked ass too.

I will say it's likely if you equalized the amount of male to female applicants and then looked at the amount of hired vs. the amount that either show up at all or stay for more than 2 weeks, you'd probably see similar numbers in both men and women.

That's just to say in an industry that's been dominated by men for decades, it's still level in that equal work gets equal pay regardless of gender. It simply remains mostly men working because it's mostly men applying.",CupolaDaze,t2_yatmv,297,0,reddit3

dl2423j,t1_dl227ri,2017-08-02 13:16:36,TwoXChromosomes,"Three things going on here. 

1. Stats. How you spin a stat can totally change it, and the 77 cents on the dollar is somewhat misleading, or at least over simplified. That adding all male and all female earnings together and dividing out. This has some obvious lack of nuance, and reflects some factors that are time sensitive, in that CEO pay is massive, and most CEOs are men, for now, but that trend is starting to change. So the straight answer is that its an over simplified stat.

2. Narrative. Everyone has one, and I won't say who's right and who's wrong, but everyone is trying to convince you of something. Just because someone says your wrong doesn't mean they know what they are talking about, it just means they think you're wrong. Who knows what kind of facts they use to support their conclusion. People will tell you you're wrong if you say we landed on the moon. 

3. So what about the actual gap? It does exist, but its not as bad as portrayed. When we account for factors like comparing doctors to doctors, lawyers to lawyers, store clerks to store clerks, the gap drop to 88 cent on the dollar, I believe, not looking up the citation, but it is significant. This tells us women are in lower paid job fields on aggregate. Why are they there? Beyond the scope of the data, we have to get into sociology. So what about the other 12 cents? A good portion goes away when we account for hours worked and career decisions. Why those decisions were made falls outside the realm of the data again, and depending who you ask, its either personal choice or oppressive gender roles. That's not an issue I care to tackle.

So when you take a more nuanced view, IIRC the gap is between 3-10 cents on the dollar depending who you ask and what data you use. So yes there is a wage gap, no it isn't 23 cents on the dollar really. 

Edit: I know my stats don't match the article, but for above stated reasons, depending where you look you will get wildly different numbers, so this is a good approximation.",edm_ostrich,t2_46gpz8m,62,0,reddit3

Actually the pay gap between male and female doctors is [notoriously bad](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/women-doctors-salaries-pay-gap.html)...

> This tells us women are in lower paid job fields on aggregate.

[Interestingly, it's the lower paid fields that have more balanced wage gaps](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2015/04/14/110959/how-the-gender-wage-gap-differs-by-occupation/): Stockroom workers, for example,  tend to have basically gender pay parity. There are some exceptions to that rule, like teachers: male teachers get paid about 30% more than female teachers, for example. 

And most of the studies I've seen that compare members of the same profession tend to control for hours worked and ""career decisions"" and they still come up with a discernible gap, so I'm not sure where you're coming up with your information. 

The higher earning fields and/or positions is where we begin to see major discrepancies, even when occupants have similar positions. The pay gap between male and female financial advisers is between 56-61% depending on the study. 

So when you take the more nuanced view, what you end up seeing is a wide discrepancy in the value of women's work depending on the occupation. And that's without doing an analysis on racial discrepancies (the pay gap tends to widen for black and latino women) in wages within the same jobs as well. 

Saying that the pay gap narrows if you look at it more closely not only belies the facts but is also demonstrative of a narrative that seeks to minimize a very real workplace compensation issue. ",buriedinthyeyes,t2_d8wvc,28,0,reddit3

Every job has pros and cons. Some pay high, but have high stress or poor work/life balance attached.

Some pay high but require years of education (eg lawyer).

Some pay low, but you can get involved immediately and start earning.

There is one thing that's a good general rule though. High pay is used ot draw people to the role, lower pay when it isn't needed. A lot of female orientated jobs are generally more emotionally intensive jobs because women, in general, are more caring. Same way men are more spatially aware, it's not sexist, it's just a statistical fact.

Well, some jobs need you to be more caring for the job itself as well as for someone to be drawn to it. What kind of selfish person would work as a care worker for example, instead of a shelf stacker?

As such, many lower paying jobs, such as care workers, nurses etc (which require the human, empathetic aspect), attract women.

However, climbing the ladder in any industry requires some skills. If you have all the same skills, but have 0 problem throwing someone under the bus unethically, you have an edge. If you are more empathetic, then you will not be as inclined to throw said person under the bus, putting you at a disadvantage effectively.

I can't talk about american standards for accountants, but I am an accountancy graduate. I have maximum exemptions from ACCA pretty sizeable ones from ACA and CIMA, amongst others. For ACCA I still need three further years of stuff to be qualified. During those 3 years I'm not only going to be working full time, but I need to take exams as well.

You already worked for that manager and received top performance scores.  Well I've worked in environments where basically everyone receives the top score because they don't wanna hurt people's feel feels.  Not saying your job is like this, but it could be.  Maybe since that manager has worked with you they didn't want you on their team?  As a former supervisor I can attest that they aren't looking at just job performance.  Did you play well with others?  Did you go out of your way to ensure it was successful?  Did you do the bare minimum requirements instead of trying to over achieve?  Were you afraid to make difficult decisions?  Did you ""bend"" rules instead of following them strictly?

This isn't borne out by the data. If you'd taken a look at the article I linked to you'd see that the pay gap exists within specialties (ie. Cardiologist to cardiologist). The study described in the article even goes so far as to account for number of patients seen and works published.

To me this says that the top business people are men, and leans slightly toward implicitly implying there is an intrinsic reason for it. 

>statistical facts about dedication to jobs play into who ends up in high-profile business roles.  

To me this hits on why any facts about which type of person is more highly represented at the top may not be useful for determining who is best, a positive feedback loop reinforcing the same type of person being given opportunities. 

If you use statistics to reinforce sexism, you'll end up unfairly skipping over any exceptional women who are interested and create an artificial impression that women cannot do the job. I'm also not super sure it's been proven that men exist in more extremes on both sides of the bell curve for dedication to work, I know that has been said about intelligence which isn't the same.

They're speaking in generalities, you're going specific case. Their argument makes sense in the context of all jobs available. I can do that too:

You can find the same conflicts within the same gender: Do you hire a 4'11 guy to be a security guard, or the 6'3 guy who weighs almost 300 pounds?

To deny that the 6'3 guy isn't at an advantage would be no more asinine than ignoring the discrepancy between men and women in certain physical labour positions (Over 90% of physical labour jobs women are capable of doing if they felt so inclined).

Sure, you can give them a hard time for generalizing instead of speaking to the specific case, but it's really not as absurd as you're making it out to be. Obviously the OP and jobs that require intellect should be an even playing field. But you can't ignore preferences.

Don't quit. Let them fire you, so you won't be denied unemployment. It also makes for a better legal case.

Don't change your employment contract or status, either. Not only may the terms may be worse, but they can use that new contract to change the terms of your employment and the duties of your position and patch up holes in the old contract. You shouldn't sign or change any contracts unless there's a very real, sizable and tangible benefit to you that outweighs any detriments. If that means they fire you, great. That's more evidence for workplace discrimination.

Also, you deserve those benefits. You were hired with them in place, and they were part of the compensation that the company offered to you. You're owed the opportunity to use them, so don't let her guilt trip you into waiving them. If she talks about the company having a tight budget, what she really means is that she wants to reduce your compensation so that she'll get a better bonus.

Document everything (what happened and *when*). Write down the bits you remember that already happened, and be more thorough on new parts. Respond to things via email as part of the documentation. This includes typing up your verbal conversation points as a ""confirmation"" so that it gets into timestamped emails. That way they know exactly what you understood and they can't claim they said something different.

Any time she says ""this is the list of things you were supposed to do,"" tell her that if it's important and critical enough to complete a list of things, why couldn't she fulfill her management job duties properly and type them up *before* assigning them to you. Tell her *each time* that her inability to properly communicate tasks before the due date is setting you up for failure. And definitely state via email that these tasks were not in the list. Demand all future tasks be communicated via writing, because she's shown a pattern of not communicating all items properly. Throw all shade in proper corporate speak.

It's important to note that your job duties now include calling her out on this shit in writing so it's on record in company emails. Depending on your company's setup, I'd either save all emails/screenshots of them on a flash drive that I always carry with me or BCC them to myself depending on what wouldn't get me in trouble. It sounds like your company is relatively small, which means they probably don't have strong IT controls in place preventing any of this. They may claim that it's made up and delete the evidence, but the lack of a paper trail on their end would corroborate your story. Especially if there's parts of it hidden in the email quote section.

Also, ask some of your coworkers that you trust to write up statements on what's going on. This is all standard CYA stuff when you've got someone doing shady stuff at work.

Additionally, check the state you live in. If you're in a 1-party consent state for recording, record your phone calls. Some 2-party consent states also may not have it be illegal to record - only that what's recorded can't be used as evidence in court. I'd still record in that case.

Lawyer's ideal to have. Some potential suggestions for how to turn the tide when you've got some evidence built up:

I would also publicly call her out in team meetings for workplace bullying, that your work duties don't include tolerating a toxic work environment, and you won't be maligned by her deliberately setting you up for failure, and that if she's unable of performing her management duties competently then she should step aside and hand them to someone more capable of being objective. Having multiple people hear it will prevent her from building a narrative by shit-talking you behind your back.

I'd also invite an exec or HR person to meetings so they can hear how she's treating you. Once again, after you've built up evidence, because HR/execs don't care about you or your needs. They just care about not getting the company sued. And stopping the bad behavior doesn't mean they won't quietly fire you in 6 months for a bullshit reason after they've hid the evidence and crafted a narrative to offset the harassment.",zcatshit,t2_y2g5v,19,0,reddit1

I told them all the documentation I had been gathering, and told them their action plan would eventually come out in discovery anyway, as would this conversation. HR, the regional HR manager they called when I refused to sign anything, said that we were all friends and didn't need lawyers. 

HR is not your friend. They only have one job. To keep the company out of trouble. If the company fucks up and gets sued their job is to minimize it. If they fire someone their job is to minimize the amount of benefits they have to pay out.

d6rvdbl,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-22 14:28:32,TwoXChromosomes,"I wrote alot here - I just seriously related to your post and this is stuff I struggled with and contemplated for a long time.

I worked at a firm as a legal assistant for 3 years while going to law school at night, I had the exact same feeling.  I'm currently in my last semester of school and started a new job at a different firm 4 months ago and here's what I found:

The former firm was larger, 75-100 employees.  Most of my coworkers were younger and around my age, were great people, had a great social life with them outside of work, but the work was absolutely brutal.  I was nothing more than a cog in the machine, paper hits the desk -- I do some bullshit menial task -- paper leaves the desk.  Every 6 minutes had to be accounted for and billed, it was absolutely soul sucking and it was compounded when things were stressful at school as I started questioning not only my career choice but my decision to bury myself in debt and go to law school in the first place.  Some real dark times.

The new firm is under 10 ""employees"".  4 partners and 6 assistants.  It's basically just myself and a partner who work on cases.  The work is much more meaningful, much more diverse, I handle cases from intake to completion and the work I do is real, I'm close to it, and I can see its impact.  The partner I work for is a great person and we get along well, so even though I completely lost the social aspects of my old job I'm no longer a nameless, faceless, replaceable legal robot, completing utterly meaningless tasks for 40 hours a week.  I am much happier.  

So, if you're going to remain a legal assistant, try to find a smaller firm where you will have a bigger role.  

And finally, as lame as it sounds, most of it is what you make of it.  I'm 28, been working constantly since 14, and I think my generation (myself included, but I'm working on it) is too preoccupied with the ""do what you love"" stuff.  For most people, work is work.  You should always be taking whatever little steps you can towards doing what you ""really want"" to do but its more important to have a positive attitude about where you are right now.  And that attitude takes work.  Most of the joy I've experienced as an adult comes from pride in reflecting on times I've grinded out tough situations and come out the other side in one piece.  The joy is fewer and farther between then as a kid but that's life, there's 9 billion other people out there going through the same general process, and most people who make it look and sound like its all rainbows and flowers instead of a constant grind are lying and overcompensating (looking at you, everybody's social media feed).  They're almost always doing it to pump themselves up.

We're lucky to live where we do, where we can survive by punching a clock at a job we might not like rather than actually fighting for survival every day.  I try to be happy with what little I have and do a little work every day to set myself up for something better in the future.

I graduate in December, take the bar in February, will be 150K in debt and still am not convinced I'm in the right field or on the right path.  It's daunting.  I still can go through huge stretches of time where I'm just miserable, it comes out of nowhere and its hard to shake.  But after 3 years of this insane schedule of work/school I've realized the only difference between a shitty 15 hour day and a pretty good 15 hour day is my approach to it.  

It might all pay off one day and I'll have my storybook ending or a piano might fall on me tomorrow rendering my last 3 years working all day and in class all night a complete waste of my life and time.  Its all random and its all crazy and I just try to give the middle finger to it all and enjoy what I can enjoy.",ktmurphy16,t2_4wkrc,166,0,reddit2
d6rvl3v,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-22 14:34:06,TwoXChromosomes,"It's normal, but maybe not to the extent that you are describing it.  People often expect to have an amazing job that pays well, that they enjoy and contributes to an overall sense of meaning.  Unfortunately this is not always realistic.  Prior to the babyboom, people were satisfied with ""well, it's a job and I'm not starving"".  They found life satisfaction elsewhere, like in their families or hobbies.  During the babyboom people thought they could have everything, but now the population is being forced to come back to earth. 

That doesn't mean you necessarily have to settle if you feel like your job is killing you.  But I do caution to think hard about what your options are before making big changes and understand that you probably can't have it all (so you're going to have to decide what's really important). 

1. What is it about your job that you dislike?  Is it that you feel like there's no meaning to your work?  Is it the lack of opportunity for advancement? Do you feel like you don't have any strong working relationships?

2. What is it that you do like?  A steady job is nothing to sneeze at, especially in this economy.  Is that enough for you? 

3. What do you think WOULD make you happy?  What do you see yourself doing? Are you in totally the wrong field?

4. What are your priorities right now? Are you trying to save money, establish yourself in your career? What are your goals?

5.  What's going on outside of work (this is HUGE).  You mentioned you don't have the energy to do stuff outside of work so you just go home and watch TV.  This is a big problem.  If you don't have anything else to look forward to, you're going to get burned out.  Work life balance is super important to not totally losing your mind.  You need to invest in your life. 

6. If this keeps up, you might want to talk to a therapist/your doctor to see if you are depressed.  The fact that you feel happy when you don't have to go to work suggests it might not be depression, but that's not something I'm comfortable saying definitevly over the internet.  Even if it's not depression, talking to a therapist might be helpful. 

For a little perspective, I consider myself REALLY fucking lucky (like 'outlier' level of fortunate) to have the job I have but it's not perfect either.  My job has a lot of meaning and that I feel good about doing.  I enjoy the actual work about 70% of the time (the rest is some variation of ""are you fucking kidding me?"" and wanting to go cry in a closet).  The work itself is super challenging, which is both a blessing and a curse (keeps me interested but sometimes it's crying in closets).  It pays pretty well for my field (which is notoriously low paying), but nothing to write home about.  It's long hours, hard work, and not always a lot of recognition.  There is a lot of opportunity for upwards mobility to other jobs though.  Where I had to compromise was location.  I'm living out in a rural area, close to family but far away from friends and having a hard time having a social life.  But these are my hustle years and I'm ok putting my social life on the back burner at the expense of my career. During my time off I do not want to do anything but lie in bed and watch netflix, but I make myself because I know if I don't I will burn out.  So I do things like volunteer at the humane society, work out, and make the 2 hour drive to go visit friends.

I worked three office jobs back to back to back, about eight months at each place. The last was at a law firm like yours. But it got to the point where my life felt like I was living in a void. Everyone at work was nice, but it didn't matter, because sitting at a computer all day and dealing with spreadsheets and phone calls, it was horrible. Maybe a lot of people can get through life like this, but I could not. I eventually quit and got a job waiting tables. My parents were pissed, but the work was fun and I stopped feeling horrible.

d6s3urm,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-22 17:39:18,TwoXChromosomes,"I had a really hard time when I got my first full-time desk job and had lots of similar feelings. I had even worked full time in more active settings (retail, camp, etc) and it didn't compare to the major shock of going to work every day at the same time and staying at the same desk basically all day. It wasn't a great job for other reasons, but just the general shock of having less time freedom was a big adjustment in and of itself. In college I worked part time at one or sometimes two jobs, and I was definitely busy, but there's that odd morning to yourself or weekday with nothing to do and school vacations to keep things changing all the time and I missed that. I think there's also the general sense that your ""real life"" hasn't started yet in that phase, so the stakes are lower. Once you settle into a routine, you can look around and suddenly go ""oh shit, is this what life is really like?! forever?!"" Your mom is right, sure, but she's also somewhat removed from your experience because she's used to it, and also because if you decide to have a family and that sort of thing, those responsibilities sometimes crowd out the kind of feelings you're having because they are very all-consuming, for better or worse.

What eventually helped (partly, I also left the job which I'll come back to) was investing a lot more in my personal life--doing fun things after work that I didn't have time or money to do as a student, and cultivating friendships and personal interests. I went to writing classes at a community center, tried new exercise classes, read books and joined a book club, worked on rehabbing furniture for my apartment, just whatever sparked my interest. I dated, which was sometimes fun and sometimes not. I went on weekend trips to cities I had never been to by myself (on the cheap!) It really helped a lot, and I started really enjoying the different kind of freedom I had in my post-school life. (Namely, having a little bit of money and no homework to do, haha). I ended up leaving that very first job as most people do because it sucked for reasons unrelated to this bit of advice, but I totally got used to the 9-5 thing and have had several jobs since then where I've been anywhere from moderately to very happy and not too overwhelmed by the routine.

Maybe it's this job itself? Someone below listed some questions to ask yourself to help suss out if you're just feeling unhappy at your particular job and if another one might be better. This is a great idea. You might be repressing some of your feelings about it because it doesn't seem ""that bad,"" and if you've never had much to compare it to, you might not know your situation could be a lot better. Everyone might be really nice, but are you getting enough social interaction? Some people go nuts not talking to anyone else all day or doing very heads-down, solitary work. Other people live in a nightmare of meetings. Both archetypes might be thrilled to switch places and find themselves satisfied with no other changes. At that first bad job I referenced above, I didn't realize for a while that my boss was weirdly manipulative and that I was given too many divergent tasks to ever feel satisfied that I was productive and competent at any one thing. I just knew I felt like crap and vaguely angry every Sunday night before the work week started, and that during the day I felt kind of ""off"" and bored. But if someone asked, I would have said I had a good job, because nothing was acutely, obviously wrong.

Some people make sacrifices (make less money and be happy with less stuff) or make lifestyle changes to work less or work jobs with more flexibility or less routine. One of these paths could be right for you, too. Maybe you need to work outside, or maybe you need to do work that requires travel. For me the desk job routine is fine, I just needed to find a particular kind of work that I could enjoy enough during the day to not dread it (having money is nice, after all) and then proceed to build a life I love to come home to.

One thing just for due diligence: although you say you feel different on the weekends, it may be worth getting checked for symptoms of depression. You could just be going through something chemical that is less pronounced when there are no expectations on you. I certainly think a little therapy might help dig into what's happening right now if you have reasonably good health insurance. A great therapist helped me through my own bad first job malaise, and I think I would have been okay without her, but it certainly can't hurt to have some objective input and someone to work through all the feelings with.

My problem was I never gained motivation from self improvement. Like I don't care about bettering myself really. Some people can pull themselves through tough periods in their careers by self administering the carrot of promotion. In other words ""work sucks right now but once I get that corner office it'll get better"". 

I switched careers to special needs teaching. This way my motivators are external (helping people) rather than internal (achieving promotion). I don't hate getting out of bed because I'm doing it for others (this sounds so self righteous but I don't mean it like that). I can also really get behind the organisations (the schools) goal of education. Different than my old company's goal of profit.

d6sqczc,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 02:23:18,TwoXChromosomes,"You hear that ""this is what being an adult is"" ..... Actually I think it's quite the opposite. Taking a position of helplessness and non action in the face of depression and real feelings of despair in regards to your own life is to me the utmost example of childish behavior. 

As an adult you have the ability to understand what is happening in your own life, and the ability to change things. What is more grown up than facing the problems in your life head on and taking real actions toward solutions. 

Your feelings aren't there to ignore . They tell you when you need to make changes. Listen to what they tell you and trust your gut. Also part of growing up is forming your own opinions and not just taking your parents word. 

No ones suppose to have jobs from 9 to 5 , or make money, or live in peace and harmony ....Weren't not suppose to do anything necessarily.....there's no God of work who is accounting for all our lives and making sure we follow some predestined career path that's guaranteed .

We all find ourselves alive within the given circumstances of today....you can proceed forward anyway you like....and my advice would be to listen to your heart...it seems to be telling some things. 

Don't be afraid to rock the boat, or feel you should conform to others expectations ....this is what being an adult is.....facing those fears and challenges because it's for you and your well being...In turn living that way benefits those around you because of the energy and passion you can bring to the world when you follow your own interests. 

Who knows maybe you will find a path no one has taken yet, and inspire others to do the same. Life is about discovery I think...but that is challenging too and asks for your courage and strength to really take take action and make your own decision and choices. So I guess you can take this advice or leave it lol. But I hope some of it resonates  and I hope your find a way to reconcile what your going through now.

There are plenty of examples of things in life worth doing that you just need to grin and bear it through the tough parts to get to the good stuff ....finishing goals etc. So maybe your going through that with this job , and it will get better and you will love it down the line. You will have to figure that out . Trial and error is the best teacher in life.....maybe stick it out and see if it improves, or just start the process of change now and start applying elsewhere. Either way I think like most of us do in this society ...You need to start bridging that gap in your personal life of your feelings and your actions. So many of us watch our feelings go by like passing cars and just tend to ignore them . Start breaking that habit and find out how to use all of those tough feelings as fuel for change and discovery where you really want to be in life. Get in touch and listen .

Wish you luck

I cannot stress her point #5 (What's going on outside of work) enough.  I had the same kind of depression going on six months into my first job.  The job was decently challenging, the coworkers were awesome and I was treated well, but I was constantly sad and felt low energy.   I had no close friends in the immediate area, no hobby, no support system, nothing to do after work.  I felt very isolated.  This actually became a slow transition to self destructive behaviors - Everyday I drank myself to sleep after work; I made fake friends and went to fake parties; I entered and stayed in bad relationships for too long; I was acting out and being a jerk to others.  I was pretty unhappy although everything was fine at work and I was performing beyond expectations.  I knew something had to change.


Fast forward to now, I moved to an area that I like much more, I have made good group of friends (and counting), and I am constantly busy trying new things and doing my own projects (very slowly) after work.  I fall into good relationships with good people.  I cannot believe how happy and fulfilled I feel although my work right now is a bit of drab due to delayed promotion.  Another thing I figured out as I got older is to be comfortable in my own skin.  I stopped living by other people's rules and their visions of how I should be.  Also, if you feel like your life sucks because it is not what you expected it to be, you only have two choices: 1) Make changes  2) Adjust your expectations.   I did both and I have not felt more content in my life even though I (objectively) achieve far less than I ever have.


I feel sorry for the OP because her mom was not very supportive.  No, being an adult does not have to be all sad and depressing.  It is what you make out of it.  What being an adult is trying to figure out ways to find your own happiness - and it could be an extremely bumpy road.  I cannot even guaranty how long my current state would last - I am sure there will be rough times ahead and I am trying to ride on the good times as long as possible.  But you have to make efforts to get over your current ""down"" state so that you can be ready for the next hard time.  It is really true when they say life has its ups and downs, and a wise man once told me, that the quality of your life will depend on how you deal with the down time.",guacguac,t2_jyb0e,3,0,reddit2

You should only be stuck and staying in a job that depresses you if you can't afford to change and get the hell out.  There are *absolutely* fun jobs out there, though what they are depend on you and what you want.

Also, I worked in a high-end litigation boutique for a while.  The best thing I can say about it was that my hate for the job drove my creativity through the roof.

The lawyers were making hand-over-fist and stiffing support staff they couldn't live without - including 20+ year veterans they considered essential to the survival of the firm.

The long-term support staff all seemed like zombies.  The work consumed their souls but they needed jobs and life had locked them in.  I was hired as a temp, with a full-time counterpart doing the same the job.  The day I left remember her crying because of the job, her boss laughing about it, and me feeling so fucking relieved I was headed elsewhere (gaming industry - which paid worse initially, but far better after 2-3 years of experience).

And yes, when I found a job I loved I woke up genuinely happy to go to work, and I loved being there - work was, if anything, energizing!  I ended my day with *more* energy than I started with because of it.

Because capitalism is a shitshow. 

8 hours a day, 5 days a week, doing shit you don't like for the rest of your life. If you're lucky, you may get something you can stand. 

But even so, work is horrible. Nobody should ever work. Especially in a high tech society.

[Workers of the World - Relax!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie5zO-mF31M)  An abridged reading of 'The Abolition of Work' by Bob Black.

That said, try to go to bed a bit earlier. Being rested at least makes you not start the day hating the very idea of getting out of bed. 

Plus, there are still things you can do. For instance, re-evaluating what you want to do. You don't have to be a legal assistant. Sure, the job market is fucked up in addition to being an idiotic wage slavery time sink, but it's still kind of possible to find something to do that you care for.

It is, however, a bit problematic that we humans aren't suited to doing the same damned shit day in and day out. We should be doing all kinds of fun shit that differs, but that's not compatible with capitalism unless you're rich and therefore free to do what you want. So then even an interesting task - like yours used to be - becomes a monotonous hell hole after a while. Because that's how we're wired.

 I used to be like this about work, school too, which is why I eventually dropped out. It was to the point where I was suicidal because I couldn't stand the thought that *this* was all that life amounted to, that every single day for the rest of my life I'd have to wake up and feel this feeling of dread and misery before work.

I had a few jobs, working with kids, working in kitchens, I hated them all. My whole life I had thought about being a stripper, so one day I just did it. I've never been happier in a job. I think a big part of the reason is because I choose when I go to work, and choose how hard I work. I could come in once a week for three hours, but I'd be broke. Or I could work 8 hour shifts 7 days a week and have lots of cash, but be over worked. Finding my own balance is really important for me. Knowing that if something happened, I'm able to miss work with no bullshit is a massive relief.

 Not only that, but I know if I keep at it and am smart with my money,  I'll be in a really great place financially in a few years. For the first time in my life I'm actually able to make a pretty viable five year plan (strip and do webcam porn to put myself through college and university, then start taking jobs in the field in interested in).

For me having a plan is important, too. I can't just start working at a place thinking that it's going to be forever, it makes me feel tired and trapped. Try making a 5 year plan, it helps to put things into perspective. 

Also, you might be the mind if person, like me, who simple cannot work a 9-5 job their while life. Don't fight it. Make it work for you. If your interested in law, maybe your final goal is to have your own practice, so you can be your item boss. The knowledge that one day you won't have to answer to anyone one day could be enough to keep you going.

I'm a firm believer that no one should be a slave to their job. If you need to quit your current job and take a job as a janitor to clear your head, just do it. You've got your whole life, no need to rush into something now if it's not going to make you happy.

 I'm not afraid of working hard, I don't regularly take work, and when I'm at work, I get more than my fair share done.

I personally have felt this work dreading feeling for a few different reasons at different times but in the back of my mind there is always the thought that working 40 hours a week just sucks. It's soul sucking.

I wake up Monday thru Friday at 6 am. I know people get up earlier than that and I say kudos to them! I couldn't do it. I have done it and now I don't do that.

Our expectations, loss of predictability and being part of anything that does not reinforce what you are. Expectations = a man is depressed after 45 years of work because he has nothing to show. (What did he expect to have after 45 years?). Predictability = person of faith ( I m a good person who does the right things, why don't things work out for me?).  Living in a society that does not reflect us = having technology nealry 100 years old we can't afford to use, machines having more value then the people that operate them. Most people have jobs because thier efforts are cheaper then the techinolgy. ( lights out manufacturing ) = factory's that run 24h in the dark, no workers. Thier is a triple bypass heart surgery machine with 100% successes rate in Huston Texas that never gets used because no one can afford it. technology= a pencil, the shirt on your back. Technology was made to free us, not Inslave us. Society that does not reinforce what we believe = the monetary system = profit. Money has no value, the things we purchase with money have value. We have technology to make an abundance of resources. A machine that can transform urine in to drinking water. the point is no man or women today should have a job only a career. we have machines to do 90% of our jobs. We have the technology to change our world nearly over night. Just in one year during World War Two we used enough resources to build a hospital and university every 100 miles on the planet.

I have absolutely felt like this several times in my life, and it's always frustrating and very unpleasant. The thing is, it's nothing you've done, or your colleagues have done. You are simply not in the right job for you. A new job always feels exciting at first, but once the lustre wears off and you've been there a while, you get a feel for what the job will be like long term. It might even be a job you thought would be perfect for you. I studied for years to be a programmer, but after two years in my current job, I'm really questioning whether this was really what I thought it would be. That doesn't mean I should give up on being a programmer altogether, it just means that I'm not in the right company for me. The company is 90% female (I'm a guy) and of that 90%, 80% are 15+ years older than me. There's nothing wrong with the people who work there, but I just don't have a lot in common with them. Doubly so since the IT department is only three people out of a company of 75+, so I'm not really around people with my own interests. It's not a bad company, the people there are lovely, but it's just not right for me right now. How does this relate to you? Well, it seems like you're facing very similar issues: Not having a lot in common with your colleagues, not finding pleasure in the job, feeling like you're stuck in a cycle. I know exactly how that feels, but some people are hit harder by it, and it sounds like you're having a particularly rough time of it. This absolutely isn't just ""what being an adult is"". Your mind is telling you something important and you need to listen. You're not happy, and it will only get worse if you leave it alone. You're simply in the wrong job. You're not necessarily in the wrong field or profession, but something needs to change. People need variation and stimulation. Without it, your mental health will deteriorate. 

It's time to find something else. The motivation is that when you're in the right job for you, the feeling is amazing. Most days, waking up and heading to work is an exciting prospect. Don't get disheartened if you go through a chain of jobs that don't work out, there IS something that will work for you. You just have to keep looking until you find it. Jobs are a lot like relationships. You should try a lot of different things, but you shouldn't settle until you find the right one. You will know when you find it. Trust me. I'm still looking for it myself, but I've been close a few times, and I've gotten a taste of how good it feels to have a job you love.

>I had a generic retail job at a department store
>I was pretty excited at first because a: it wasn't retail like all my previous jobs
>I feel terrible today just thinking about wasting my life in this office

To me, it sounds like you've been led along a linear path for a while, now you're not liking where it leads.  When you were in college there was always an end in sight (even if it was far off) so you didn't mind working bland retail jobs.

Now that college is out, you're essentially free to decide what you do... but you've been strung along following your SO's plan (not that this is a bad thing).  You continued looking for menial work in the mean time (for your SO to finish graduate school) but realizing that there is no direct end in sight, only repetition, it's creating a new stress that's making you feel hopeless.  You don't have anything to look forward to; life doesn't hold any opportunity or engagement, only ""just get through the day"".

For most people that's not really that big of a thing.  Like most people posting in the comments, they don't really love or hate their jobs.  For some people though, it can be soul crushing and crippling.

If I could make a suggestion I would say try and take a couple of weeks off (or weekends at least), go somewhere away from your job, friends, social life, and SO and really do some introspection trying to figure out *what you want to do with your life*.

It sounds corny and new-agey but perhaps you might surprise yourself.  It's possible you want to go back to school, maybe you have an idea of something you've always wanted to do but there are too many other voices (and obligations) in your daily life that's choking that out.

Bottom line, we only get one life.  If you're a happy person, don't waste it or throw it away for anything or anyone.  Maybe you're just depressed from living in a new area and it will pass (consult a physician maybe) but maybe you would be happier finding a hobby or pursuit that actually excites you.

Long answer... Yes, it is absolutely normal.  50% of humans will be working minimum wage jobs in 10 years.  Surely, you've worked a minimum wage job.  Not only is it not enough to live individually anymore (and the stress of that echoes through your mind like a jackhammer 24/7, turning even the most stable human into a nervous wreck), but minimum wage jobs serve as ""meat grinders"" for the population, because minimum wage jobs cater to the unskilled and the least brightest, therefore, there is always a new worker ready to take your place once your meat grinds too thin (granted, only temporarily, but that's all the companies need to keep the cogs grinding).  

So, you are essentially being told for 40 hours a week - if you're lucky enough, and oh how much it makes me RAGE inside to say that, to gag on a dick that won't give you enough sperm to sustain life in your belly, just keep your throat moisturized, and to do it with a big ole smile or else out into the societally demonized UNEMPLOYMENT category you go!  :)",Satyromaniac,t2_bs0mr,3,0,reddit2

I think when your job becomes the main source of your stress/unhappiness in life it's time for a change. Either change jobs or careers. Find something that you care even a little bit about, for me a decent job either needs to motivate me mentally or feel meaningful. And that evolves over time, when I first changed from a warehouse job to an office job I was super happy that I was being mentally challenged now, but now I feel 8-5 sitting in front of a PC is not great and I wish I could have a job where I can move around and do some manual work. I know if I stay here for 2 more years I'll be feeling like you feel now, so I'm already planning a change.

There's a negative stigma attached to seeking professional help but trust me, it can be life changing. The last thing i'll say is that you need to utilize self care. You need to take care of yourself, and if that's watching tv for you then so be it.

I had a really high paying job for a fresher. The company is a big brand name and there were lots of amenities, perks etc for the employees. Coworkers and manager were awesome people. Still, every morning I used to wake up feeling cranky and irritated. I didn't feel like getting out of bed or doing any work at all. 

Finally, as a new year resolution this year, I decided to change my life. I figured there were two sources of my unhappiness:
1. I didn't like the nature of my job, i.e. I am qualified to do it and I am able to do it, and it pays a lot but I am not really interested in doing that. 
2. I missed my SO and my own family terribly (both were in the same city, I had moved away) 

So this January, I quit my job, got married, moved close to my family and took a job which I like (it pays less comparatively, but I like doing it).  It was really scary. When I quit the first job, I didn't have a job for three months. But my parents and husband have been really supportive. I am not earning as much as before but I am really happy with my life right now.

instead, you spent a third of your time at a place you don't like particularly doing something that's not particularly exciting. saying that it sucks would be a euphemism.

to feel better, try to be more generous, selfless with your time and money. accept to live with less money and work part-time. learn some crafts (cooking, sewing, etc, the usual) to stay active while keeping your mind fresh. remember to go out and walk, bring your boyfriend, a friend, a pet, or go alone. let go of the tyranny of ""stuff"".",TortueGeniale666,t2_z6qrb,1,0,reddit2
d6s1x7f,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-22 16:58:18,TwoXChromosomes,"Before ditching the job, you need to do some serious reflection on what exactly it is that's making you unhappy. This will help avoid cycling through jobs that don't help at all.

Try periodic mood check-in the day (use something like random alarm so you're not just doing this when you think of it, because thats probably when you're bored). This will provide data on how often you're really feeling discouraged at work, with the side benefit of making you also notice when you're feeling pretty good.

This data should help you figure out what the problem is. If you're generally happy with work but when you're there, then the problem may be that you don't like where your career is going or other more longer term aspects. If this is the case, focus on what your goals are long term and then how to achieve them. If there are specific parts of your job that make you miserable, think about if you can change them in your current job, if they would change with a new employer, or what you can do to make them less painful if they're inevitable.

Take tabs of other factors in well-being. Sleep is huge, as is eating well - how are those going? 

You mentioned hobbies would help. The first couple times doing somehting can be stressful, but after that it can be really rewarding. If it's not, stop doing it. (After a commitment to doing it 3-5 times.)

Moving to a new city can really really suck. I moved for my boyfriend a year ago and the first few months were really rough. Things got better when I met new friends (joined a rec softball league) and got through a stressful period career future-wise. (Got accepted to grad school, phew!) 

In the meantime, my attitude was pretty much ""There are a lot of things in my life that suck right now and I'm not in a position to change, let's focus on what I can change."" For me, that meant losing weight. For you, maybe it's learning a new language or brewing beer or learning to sew. Whatever the case, focusing on something where you can see progress does wonders for mental health.

Clearly if you're actually clinically depressed, seek professional help. These are just strategies that can help you think about what to change to better your life.

Her day to day work life had nothing to motivate her, she didn't care at all for what she was doing.  And looking ahead into the future was just as grim.  She saw no options in her career path to make her happy.  Life was pretty sad.  Until she switched careers.




Now she works corporate HR.  She deals with the human element rather than billable hours.  And while some days are hard, overall, her life is pretty happy.  She cares about the work she does daily.  And if she ever gets down, she can think about the future and her career path.

Also: you need to branch out and invest your time in things you are interested in. If it's a side business then it's a side business. If it's a martial art then so be it. Writing a book. Practicing an instrument. 

Whatever it is, you must find joy in the work you do (nothing will make you happy about it, it's the tiny things in comparison to other shit jobs that will help), and you must find other goals in life and things to work towards so as to maintain some sense of morale. ",,,1,0,reddit2

Most people don't find their life's meaning or purpose or joy in their job, and expecting to do so can be frustrating and discouraging, possibly leading to depression. But even though you've given a really good explanation of how you're feeling, I don't think I know enough to say whether or not you're going through an adjustment period, and once you realize that work exists to finance your non-work pursuits you'll feel better.

The other option is that this really isn't the work you should be doing. Some jobs are really much better than others, depending on your interesting, your coworkers, etc. If being a legal assistant isn't your thing, perhaps there is a better job out there for you, and if you can find it, that would help.

You mentioned your coworkers being there for 15+ years, so it's also possible that you feel like an outsider, and also that you worry that working there leaves you with no options, that you'll also be ""stuck"" there for 15+ years. If that thought horrifies you, maybe it's the wrong job for you. I worked at a company for 12 years once, and was sad to leave it. That was a good job. I worked at a company for two years to the day, and was relieved and excited to leave it. That was a bad job. ",ocelotsandlots,t2_kmyoz,1,0,reddit2

A lot of people look at life with sunk-cost playing a much bigger role in their decision making than it needs to. People graduate with a degree in X and then once they start actually *doing* X, they find out they don't like it. Instead of switching to Y or Z, they just keep doing X because that's what their degree is in and that's what they're qualified for.

I can say that experimenting with a variety of jobs after graduating from college was an immense help in allowing me to find out what I *actually* like doing and find meaning in vs. what I thought I wanted to do before I went to school. My work incorporates some of what I went to school for, but I'm mainly qualified for it because of my work experience in the field and with the organization, not because of my degree.

I guess my main point is that you don't need to feel locked in. Open yourself up to whatever interests you, and don't write yourself off from exploring something just because you might not feel qualified. I've had jobs that felt like they were sucking the life-force out of me, and it's a hard way to live. Then I've had jobs that added to my life.

Stay at your job at least 1-2 years to save money and work on an exit strategy. 

Try to discover which elements of your job you like and hate. Use that to consider another career. In the meantime, work towards possible ways of making money.

Seriously though, most everyone has been there. In my experience, the first year is usually pretty tough at a job and more so when you are entry level. The jobs available at this point in your career typically aren't very fulfilling. I agree with others in encouraging you to stick it out awhile. I've seen many people work through this phase, myself certainly included, and things get MUCH better. More fulfilling, more money, more options, etc. I've also seen many people bail in this phase, only to trap themselves forever in it. It's a time to work through, not avoid. 

Try and focus on what skills you are developing and what skills you can develop, and work to get the absolute most out of that. You'll be surprised how far ahead that will get you. MOST people don't do this. You can outpace so many and get where you want to be so much faster by doing this. Also, look amd ask around about future positions in the industry you may want, and spend your energy and time obtaining those skills. That in itself gives your current position purpose, making your job immediately more fulfilling, plus more fulfilling because you have an idea where you are going and why you are doing whatever it is you currently doing.

That's the same kind of ""advice"" my mom gave me when I talked to her some years ago about work-anxiety etc. 

Personally, I don't think it's normal to feel that way. Something easy you could try that helped me was to put fun things on my calendar. It doesn't have to be anything expensive, just something to look forward to. 

For instance, go get ice cream on Thursday after work. Put it in your calendar, and invite a friend or your SO. Plan something a little bigger for the weekend, like going to some cool attraction or garden or easy hike that is in your city. Put it on the calendar and invite a friend or your SO. Try to put 2 - 3 things on your calendar per week, and always something on a weekend day. 

I know that that advice isn't work-related, but it did help me to be happier in general in my life. 

Another non-work-related change would be to spend time doing something that has a lot of meaning in your life. Maybe you could volunteer with an organization that is meaningful to you. Helping animals, the homeless, hospital patients...there are lots of people in the world that need help. You could become a little league coach or help kids read at an elementary school.  

If you try enriching your life in these other ways, and you still feel the same way about your job, I would consider changing careers. 

I have often felt this way as well, where the work I do doesn't matter and everything is just bullshit. I think it's important to remember though that your job isn't everything and it won't ""make you"" as a person. It can't be the only thing in your life that you use to fulfill your needs.

You mentioned this is your first job outside of retail, but is it at all in the field you were hoping to work in after college? If not, just because it's a well paying job with pleasant people doesn't mean it's going to satisfy you or make you feel fulfilled. For example at my job before I moved my coworkers were amazing, but my boss was an absolute nightmare! Most importantly, to me anyway, it was in a field that I really loved and felt passionate about. Compare that to now where I'm at a well paying job and the coworkers and my boss are lovely, but I basically feel the same way you do most days. Anyway if this isn't the field for you it can't hurt to look for something you think you'd enjoy more! I wouldn't quit this one right away, just look and see what's out there. Like you said though this is your first job out of retail so it might be good to try and hang on a little longer so you have some experience to use on your resume.
If this is the field you'd like to be in I think the same advice applies, you can always look around if you think it might have something to do with the environment of this office (your coworkers are nice, but do you have much in common? You can still feel lonely with nice coworkers.). 
In any case if you stay the advice to find something to make you feel fulfilled is great! Try to make friends in your new town, find a hobby, volunteer, start a side business for yourself, anything that would make give you something to work towards and look forward to.",salad-daze,t2_uo6gh,1,0,reddit2

Perhaps you should sit down and really think about what you want to do in life and find a job like that. Maybe study for a degree.

Can you think more specifically about what is wrong? Is the work itself the issue, is the workload too much?  If your boss really is great, you might have some flexibility.  Be careful with this until you've proven yourself. 

Are you burning yourself out? It's fairly common for young people to not know how to manage their energy level and pace themselves. 

Do you worry about how you're doing at work and not feel like you're getting enough feedback? Going from a school environment with clear grades to a workforce where no one is taking the time to score you on a rubric can be a big adjustment and cause a lot of stress and worry. 

You could have some kind of endocrine or adrenal issue that makes working fulltime difficult. Thyroid issues, pituitary problems, issues with cortisol production, poly-cystic ovarian syndrome come to mind.  You could also be depressed.

It sounds like you don't have a lot going on outside of work.  Taking time to find something, even just a once-a-week club, could be really helpful. It would give you new people to talk to, something different to think about.  People need social time to chat with other humans, that's perfectly normal, and your current routine may not give you enough of that.  Check out libraries and community centers, local service organizations and churches, non profits and shelters - these are all good places to start for finding regular social activities and motivation that is about people and not survival.

I ended up quitting that job without having another one lined up (which I don't recommend) and ended up being unemployed for 3 months before finding my current job which is in a completely different field, doing something completely different.

d6s8803,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-22 19:12:50,TwoXChromosomes,"I have a few points to discuss after reading your post. Food for thought, if you will.

First, is this job related to your degree or area of interest? There can be a difference if it's a job for the sake of having income or if it's a job in your field. If it is in your field and you're unhappy, then maybe you should consider what other direction you'd like to branch off into. Also, you don't have to stay there until you're retired. I was in secretarial/accounting jobs until I was in my 30s. I went back to school to get my psychology degree and I'm working on a masters. You can change jobs, careers, fields, etc. if you are unhappy.

Second, you don't mention any social ties aside from your SO. A social support network can have a huge effect on your outlook and mental state. Have you made friends in this new city since you moved? Have you thought about finding a volunteer opportunity where you can make a connection to your community? 

Third, are you sure it's just the job and not the whole ball of wax? You graduated college. You moved far away from home. You moved in with your SO (I'm assuming you weren't living together previously). You got a job in an arena you haven't worked in previously (retail vs. legal office). That is all stressful! And the effects of stress don't always show up immediately. Part of being stressed out can be depression. 

Sure, part of being an adult is doing things we don't want to or like to because we have responsibilities. But you shouldn't feel like you're dragging yourself to work and back home every day, wasting your life, and being hopeless.  ",,,1,0,reddit2

That's because you are. My two pieces of advice in such situations are always (a) see if you can scale back your living expenses so you don't have to work full time and sacrifice so much of your daily time and energy to a meaningless job and (b) whether or not you can do that, find something else to get passionate about and do it when you're not at work. That way this job isn't your life. Whether it just be a really interesting or fun hobby, or something that is more along the lines of a ""calling"", you can do plenty that isn't related to your paying job that will make it easier for you to see the job as just the ""means to an end"" - i.e., paying for your food and shelter so you can do something better with the rest of your time.

I quit them pretty often, and now that I've found my passion and what I want to pursue in life, it makes sense why I was always so restless. 

I've been a graphic designer for eight years and only in the last six months did I discover an element of design that I want to do more than anything. I study it and work on it in my spare time, I am applying for jobs in the field. I've never done that with work before, I've never cared to. This is the thing and it's changed the way I think about working, or will hopefully when I get a job doing it. 

It's entirely possible that this restless ennui you're feeling is because you're simply in the wrong field or doing the wrong thing. Can you take some classes or pick up a hobby?

That's the other thing. Sometimes people don't discover a passionate love for a job (much like they don't discover The One Right Person) because the world tells us we should/will and the adult truth is...that's not always the case. If you can do your job well and afford what you need to in life, supplement with a hobby. Odds are, most of us won't get joy and satisfaction from our work (just like some don't find all their needs answered by The One Perfect Person).

It happens to most people.  A job is repetitive, and takes up most of our usable weekday hours. Even a job we love, surrounded by good people.

When I feel the stress or a rut coming up, I make sure to set aside a day (even a weekday) for myself. I figure out what I want to do - be it stay in bed all day, watch movies, play games, go for a long walk, drive somewhere, do a bunch of chores I've put off, cook gourmet meals... whatever. It clears out the cobwebs a bit and centers me.

If it's really bad, take vacation. You don't necessarily have to go anywhere, but time away can be refreshing.

If you still dread going to work - talk to your boss. See if there are other projects you can work on, or a goal you can work towards to mix things up.

You become so passionate about the job that you don't even notice the time fly by because you're enjoying yourself and have your own spun off ideas that you entertain at home(like freelance consulting).

So in short, being passionate about a field means tireless work without a second thought. Sometimes I'll work on something for years before realizing I don't want to do it anymore. But doing so brings me closer to what I do want to do. Does that make sense? And naturally with that hard work comes obstacles, but also those amazing ah-HA moments when you overcome them and make progress.

Another aspect is just your mental state. Understand that change is the only constant. You'd be very surprised what some regular meditation can do for anxiety or depression, even a few minutes a day. Learning to sit with your thoughts and honor them, or any meditation in general is proven to reduce stress, by a huge margin for some people. a lot of self starter literature, and I mean A LOT talk about how important belief in yourself and what you're doing is. Believing in your ability to learn and grow, it sounds corny and its true.

Be introspective. If you have crazy waves of terrible emotion keep digging. Maybe it's the job, or maybe its something deeper. Maybe you're afraid to persue what you really enjoy because you think people won't take you seriously? Maybe you're afraid of trying your hardest and failing so you sabotage yourself? Life is so raw and in your face sometimes that you can't understand what's going on until you take a real hard look at things you've been neglecting. Check your health, your diet, whatever you feel is significant.

I manage a retail store, and the stress level can be astronomical even though some of my employees are my best friends and not every day is super busy.

If I work a few days then have a day off, I'm totally fine. If I work 4+ days without a day or two off inbetween, life feels like it sucks.

My suggestion is to take a vacation, even if it's only for a weekend or a few days. You might just need to get the hell away from life for a little bit to get yourself back on track.

I was in your same position. So I quit and I'm pursuing a job in the wine industry. It's really exciting because the job is never the same. In the fall is harvest and when wine is made. Then you have to keep up the wine while it ages in the months after that. Then there is bottling. And if you're the type of winemaker where you work in the vineyard too, you get a very diversified day/week/month/year which is really exciting to me. And there are so many different jobs in the wine industry that I'm hoping to hit all of them eventually (from working in the vineyard to working in a tasting room to doing lab tech). 

I had the same dread as you, the ""I am going to be doing this for 40 hours a day for 45 years"" and I got majorly depressed. It was a great job too.

Getting that ruled out (or diagnosed) first should be your primary concern. Most likely it is not depression, but whether it is or not a counsellor will be able to help you figure out what the problem is and how you can deal with it. Edit: If you find one and are not happy with his or her counsel, you can and should find a new one, don't just follow his or her proclamations like the word of god handed down from on high.

I don't know what sort of lawyer you work for, but dealing with people's problems and the accompanying drama can be extraordinarily draining.  I've worked in large and small firms, and they all carry their own stresses and danger of burnout.   

Look at these factors:  

Are you managing your time well?  Are you organized and on task or frequently struggling to meet a deadline? Maybe you are putting unneeded stress on yourself with poor time management practices. Or poor attorney time management.  They can be absolute bears about deadlines.  

Prioritize and make to do lists every day.  Check with your boss every day to make sure you both are on track to meet your deadlines or contact clients.  

 Are you trying to do too much?  Just because you CAN do it, doesn't mean you have to.    Again, your priority is 1) Boss and 2) Client.  If a client is making unreasonable demands or taking up too much time, you must set or reset boundaries.  

Make sure your job responsibilities are clearly defined.  Some people have a tendency to pawn distasteful or routine tasks off on new people.   


Don't be afraid to say ""No."" and set your own deadline.  If it MUST be done for court, your deadline is that day or sooner.  If it is a special project someone wants done (making a corporate Xmas card list, meeting minutes, etc) ask when it has to be done or tell your supervisor you will have it done by a specific date or time.  Like if you can reasonably get it done by 3, tell your boss you'll have it done in the morning and then surprise them by delivering it ""early.""
You look good to the boss and you've given yourself plenty of time to complete your task.  

Don't let your emotions overwhelm you.  Clients are needy people.  Their problems are not yours.  You don't have to invest any of your emotions into them.  If you do, they will break your heart.  Every. Time.  They all have issues and there isn't a darn thing you can do to solve them.  I've gone above and beyond for people who have turned around and lied to my face, thrown me under a bus, and worse.  If you find someone (this applies to co-workers too) who overburden you with sob stories, drama or demands for attention, limit your availability for your own well-being.


Along with that, learn to ""Let it go.""  Leave the stress of the day at your desk.  I do this by tearing up my to do list at the end of the day.  It's a symbol to me that the day's issues are gone.  I practice yoga (very helpful), and exercise.  Take a 10 minute walk at your lunch or break, or before work to get your energy level up.

1) Your mom is kind of right.

2) One year of experience in your first ""career"" job out of college is far too small of a sample size to make any drastic decisions.

I think the thing that's getting you down is the ""grind,"" basically doing the same thing every day, for months and months. Childhood, high school, and college all have natural break points every few months. New semester, summer vacation, new grade level, etc. Those breaks keep things fresh, and if something sucks, it will change one way or another in a few months anyway. 

Unfortunately (or not, depending on perspective), adulthood isn't like that. In most careers, there are no more natural breaks; they are more self-determined and individual. You get hired, you quit, you get promoted, you get fired, you get transferred, life moves on.

Why are you upset with yourself? 

You don't like your job. That's okay. 

You're allowed to not like your job.

Other people will tell you that hating your job is just part of being an adult. They are wrong. What's happened here is that you put expectations that your new ""real"" job would somehow be different, or change your life, or what-have-you, and it hasn't. You're disappointed that it hasn't lived up to your expectations. Realizing THAT, is growing up. 

Repeat after me, and then Google it. ""Expectations Management"" 

To put it simply, life often sucks, and it's best not to invest too much of yourself into any particular thing. I know that sounds callous, but it's realistic. 

Look, if your job is important to you, and you want a job that makes you feel happy and fulfilled, then you really should go for it. Find that job (don't leave the current one while you search) and go for it. If that's what will make you happy, then rock on. 

Is that what you really want? 

Like a whole bunch of other stuff in life, it really boils down to; ""What do you want?""

tldr: All jobs suck. If that's important to you, then change it. If not, figure out what is. ",Donavenn,t2_bvn7b,1,0,reddit2

I going job to job, always in the field because it was the only thing I was qualified for, hoping the next would be better. I was making such good money, had a partner not settled into a field yet, so there was no escape. 

About 6 months ago my job forced to make a decision which would either commit me to this field for many years or I could get out now. It was a hard decision. Part of me wondered if I'd be just as unhappy doing something else. I couldn't give them that kid of commitment though and I left. I've never been happier. I do odd jobs, much much less money but my quality of life has drastically improved. I can't go out often, go shopping or take holidays right now but because I'm not under that stress anymore I don't really need those things. I've never regretted it. Obviously you should have a plan before making a decision like this. I had good savings and found some independent contract work pretty quickly.

The tasks would only take a few hours, but I always find ways to BS people into thinking that I ran into snags or need to hunt people down ""to find info"" about the project.

I get grand annual reviews (easy to work with, completes work on time, thorough work ethic, always willing to take on new tasks, etc), and I get incredible raises (when some people don't get any in this company).  I feel like I'm abusing the system, but then again, I'm super depressed when I'm here.  I offer to travel, but they always send others, and I'm stuck in this corner cube that no one bothers me at.  

I go home, and I'm happy.  I do my side jobs, and I'm happy.  If I could make a living off my side jobs, I would quit this office in a heartbeat.  But I can't.  Not yet at least.  I'm trying to build those up, but it's a long slow process.

So I know how you feel.  When I'm doing my other ""jobs"" (I don't even call them that because I have so much fun doing them), I'm so happy and excited to be doing something I love.

I'm 40, and a factory worker.  My job pays reasonably well, allowing me to support my family and children, but not well enough to get ahead or afford anything outside of necessities.  

Sadly, school and training isn't an option because I work rotating shift work and couldn't afford to earn less even for a short time.  

My job is destroying my body, but I'll probably make it either to retirement or close enough.  

What's sad is that I'm a tech geek, love programming and electronics, particularly embedded systems. I respect that jobs are jobs, but it helps to at least enjoy the basic tenets of your job.  I *hate* every aspect of mine, end to end.  But, zero work experience in anything in interested in, no formal education, and agree combine to ensure I have zero chance of being hired, particularly not at a wages that would allow me to continue supporting my family.

But, depression. This would be a fair reason to be depressed, but I accepted it as I can't change it, and I know my sacrifice here will allow my children a better opportunity in their lives.  So, that makes it bearable.


TLDR: most people hate their jobs, that's normal.  Find ways to make it work for you, focus on that parts of your life that are better, that matter.  If you can't, then do something else.  Depression is no joke.

The depression got so bad, I eventually went to a psychiatrist. She put me on zoloft.

""Normal"" simply means it's accepted by everyone not that it is the way you should go about it. I worked for about a while and whilst the job payed decently and was not to challenging for me, I never woke up going ""YES! LET's GET THIS DONE!"". There was no passion no drive nothing. So you have two choices - either go the easy route and do the ""normal"" thing or be proactive and find that thing which drives you. Like you said THIS WILL BE YOUR LIFE FOR 45 YEARS!! Do you want to spend it like all the ""normal"" people do? Being ""meh"" about it and waiting for the weekends? Cause that's literally what you're trained to accept from school. Wait for weekends with your free time to enjoy life. And it's tough after work. For a while I go home dead and just went into hibernation. Watch series and don't think about tomorrow. I realised I was in a rut and (I wasn't very active at the time) instead of coming home and plopping my ass on a couch I got out and went for a daily run. No music or anything just listening to the thoughts in my head and what was driving me. After a month and a half I walked in and handed in my weeks notice. Up and left to do my masters and I've found it to be extremely fulfilling not just in terms of work but in terms of my own personal growth. Never before have I had the opportunity to do things on my time and when I want. I don't have the answers but I know that getting out of that rut has stopped me from landing in that mediocre rut that you (and a ton of my graduate working friends)are in. My story isn't some hero story. I still will have to work at some point (admittedly going into research though). But I feel I've made the right choice. Live your life for you. It's your time.

You cannot ever get time back, you can never relive your life. If you are unhappy with your job, you don't need to justify it. It's how you feel about it later, end of story. 

I would consider doing two things. Fist talk to your boss/es about this. They sound pretty accommodating, so they may not have a problem with you telling them you're unhappy. Secondly, I would encourage you to seek out a therapist or some other mental health professional. Some of the feelings that you described sounded like a depressive episode (source: I'm a therapist getting a doctorate in clinical psych). If you are dissatisfied with your job then they may be able to give you perspective, if it's a mental illness then they can help you with that too.

Most perle think depression is Dinting that happens when you're stressed.  Mine gets me the worst when in NOT stressed. When there's nothing to force myself out of my own head, I start stewing and fall into depression quickly.

You need to find something outside work that makes you get out of the house. Preferably something you nominally at least, enjoy.

I graduated college in May 2006 with a history degree. It was my quickest way out after learning I couldn't do the trig require for chemistry. So I decided I'd get a big boy job (40 hours/week) while I figured out what I wanted. I got hired in August at a luxury car dealer. They paid more than I'd ever seen and thought $8.50/hour was a gold mine. Drive/park fancy cars and get paid? Sign me up. 6 months later, I get promoted to Product specialist with a $12k pay raise. I teach people how the cars work; the tech guru of the dealership. Fast forward, the economy hits and I get laid off. They hire me back for a few months and repeat. Finally I had enough and wouldn't go back. 

Downside is I had a new car (Mazdaspeed 3) and apartment to pay for. So I took what I could get. I got hired selling dog food at a local chain. 

This. Job. Sucked. I hated everything of my being. I rolled out of bed with such fever and hatred for life. Every waking minute I knew I was going to be in that store I dreaded. I was part time. I worked anywhere from 10 hours to 37 hours a week. Just enough to not call me full time. It got the point where I didn't even want to have sex with my girlfriend. I was so unhappy at that job it boiled over into my personal life without me knowing. I thought it was my fault. Why shouldn't I be happy? I have a *job*.. No it doesn't work that way. 

Then finally the straw broke. Someone got fired at my prior job at the dealership. It was a guaranteed 40 hours and a $1 more an hour that I was making slinging dog food to over-entitled rich housewives. I took the offer immediately. 

And overnight, my hate for breathing and waking every day vanished. Life returned to normal. Yes the dealer sucked and I eventually left shortly after. But nothing is worth waking up pissed at the world for. ",hillbilly_bears,t2_i9j1b,1,0,reddit2

The thing is, you have to identify what the problem is before you can deal with it. Would a different job make you feel more satisfied? Or perhaps working at a different time? Do you not get any intrinsic value from your job? Or have you accomplished you goal and not set another new one to strive towards in the future? Perhaps work is too easy for you and the boredom is getting to you. Even something as simple as having plants at your desk or putting up pictures of friends and family can help change your work life. Also, maybe taking on something challenging in the evening like a hobby or online classes instead of watching TV will help you feel more satisfied and give you a sense of accomplishment.

d6sl84h,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 00:12:47,TwoXChromosomes,"TLDR; Discover reasons to appreciate the things you have/do in life, or you'll hate them and just dream about something better. If this means taking some risky ventures, then go ahead and do it. Don't give a fuck about what people say you can and can't do. If people *do* offer annoying options over and over again; ignore the person, and look into the idea anyway (don't *consider* it, actually look into what would be needed to pursue that idea, because you never know when your direction will change, and being ahead of the game will help).


So it feels like you're wasting your life? You really have two options to alleviate this issue;

1) Chase down that idea of what your life could be, and see if it works for you.

2) Start asking yourself what you need in life to be happy and satisfied. Do you *have* to have that dream job that society says will make everything alright? Or is a job with good people and decent pay good, because it allows you to do what you want (if you take advantage of this fact)? Basically, come to terms with your life and don't get caught chasing your shadow endlessly.



Now, for that personal insight. I'm currently working three jobs. I love the bakery because it teaches me things, it feels like I'm accomplishing useful tasks, and there's nothing that is mentally taxing, just physically. My other two jobs are more mentally taxing because of the fellow employees, the lack of feeling accomplished, and in one case, the owners' inability to manage very well. These jobs don't bother me because I know exactly what I am expecting to get from them, and so there are no unfulfilled expectations/hopes.


Five months ago I felt the idea of people working their butts off at three jobs was horrid and that they were chasing down the 'wrong' kind of life. Now? Well, ironically for the timing of that thought, I am five months pregnant. My partner and I have tried our hand at travelling Canada. We've worked on farms, at orchards, and at seasonal jobs. I went to school to study glass art and ran the arts circuit for a year, even getting my work into a show in France. We have never paid more than $300 for rent. We put our money into things we think matter; organic food, pursuing hobbies, our rescue pup. 


When we found out we were expecting (iud failure) we said, ""Hey *fuck* what everyone is telling us to do, we're going to raise this child in the way we always planned!"" Well, we searched all over Ontario for a farm to partner with, and we found out that there's some pretty nasty people out there looking to take advantage of you, and that *most* people (we met) think you're absolutely useless if you're pregnant. In fact, only *one* lady allowed me to do any work on her farm. This search took a lot out of us, especially the bad run ins we had. We decided to look at land, trailers; anything alternative that would allow us to keep a garden, stay out of the city, save money, and pursue our ideal-life. We rethought ourselves again, with the cost of land in southern Ontario being what it is, would it be worth it to just purchase a house, even though we'd always felt that was ridiculous as well? 


Travelling got tiring. Van-dwelling was/is troublesome and expensive (at least without a proper kitchen set-up). We had exhausted every idea we had that would jump us to that ideal life we wanted. So we looked at our expectations of life, and reworked them. What did we need to be happy *right now*? A kitchen. Somewhere to settle, keep our things in a way where we could actually use them. Rethink ourselves again, maybe an apartment isn't the end of the world. It will be hard as hell to save for a down payment, but for the kitchen, the feeling of being settled, a place to ourselves, it's damn worth it. 


**The key thing**: Had we gotten an apartment and regular jobs when everyone told us to, would we have appreciated/enjoyed it? *Fuck no*. We would have hated every minute of it. So we took the long route, we checked out the feasibility of all our options, and we eventually found value in renting, owning, and working minimum wage jobs. ",ParsnipParadise,t2_ug6m6,1,0,reddit2

d6sm86p,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 00:37:26,TwoXChromosomes,"No. But. 

Personal opinion (not a therapist), here is what I wish people told me when I moved for a new job.

1.  It's easy to underestimate the amount of stress you're enduring when you graduate (finally), move to another place, leave family and friends behind, and get a new job. Damn, that's a lot. It can add up and makes small burdens seem great. Give yourself credit. 

2.  Every time I have moved for a job, no matter how great the job, it has been a lonely experience. And not just because you left family and friends. Routine stuff, like knowing where the grocery is or who to call to get the cable fixed -- everything is a problem. Hell, at the office, I had to figure out where the toilet was ... Something I hadn't thought about much before. 

3. People are nice, but they aren't your friends yet. It takes time to build a deep connection. And in the meantime, you don't have shared experiences to build on or talk about. They're telling stories about the wacky former co-worker or what the jerk boss did at one time, and you can only listen. That's a drag. But it does change.

4. When you're stressed, in the dumps, don't have energy, you're not going to be doing anything you don't have to. Well, that just makes it worse. You have to do things other than work. Go out with co-workers in the evening. Organize a poker night with neighbors. Start working out. Re-engage on your hobby. Pick up the travel and tourism brochure and start visiting those locations around town. Check out the local restaurants. Do something. And the experience in the new community will give you common experiences with your new co-workers. 

5. Be the welcome wagon for any new coworkers who join the company. You're not the new person to them! 

6.  That job you have won't be your last. Or your best. Don't borrow worries from the future by fretting how you can endure 45 years of this. It's a starter job. There are greater roles in your future, but this one will likely open those doors. 

7. If you're depressed, don't do depressing things. Like drink or smoke weed. They're depressants. And maybe you can do that when you're otherwise okay, but they stack on you when you're down. And that short term relief just gets worse. 

I don't know if any of this is relevant to you, but it has been for me. Congratulations on the new job and adventure. I'm sure it will work out.

The people were all great and the work was okay itself but I still would dread going to work. The hours were shit and I couldn't do anything with my other friends or family because I was working nights and weird hours.  When I had my days off I just slept to catch up and get back on a normal routine. I quit that and now I'm in a job that I really like. It's not like I bounce up out of bed every day super excited to go to work but when I'm there I quite like it and I feel good when I go home. 
The point is that I felt as though I couldn't change it at the time but now looking back on it I can see how different I feel. I'm much happier and generally much better to be around.  And I don't agree with that whole, you're supposed to hate your job.  That's what people who hate their job say and how they manage to put up with it. Keep this job for the time being and try to figure out what you want to do. It doesn't have to be a life changing decision right away but just pick something you like doing. Identify what exactly it is about your job you don't like so you know what not to look for. Then take small steps towards a role that you do like. And slowly but surely you'll get there. You only get one chance at life, do you want to spend the majority of it doing something you hate, dancing to the beat of someone else's drum? You can change it. And only you. But you have to be proactive about it. No one is going to come along and say ""hey, you know that dream job you want, I have it for you."" You gotta go out and grab it by the balls. And don't be afraid of failing. We all fail. You gotta pick yourself up and go another round. And even that is better than all the sorry sacks of shit who don't have have balls to go out and get it. They hate their jobs but they're comfortable. But they're also numb to life and they'll wake up one day and do some thinking on their own and realise they wasted their one shot! Don't do that!!!!

d6smn7v,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 00:48:15,TwoXChromosomes,"I wanna ask the same thing but I think I already know the answer. The reason I've been hating my job as a speech therapist is because I don't love my job at all. 

I was forced to choose a degree where I could earn decent money. And in my parents' head there are only 4 to choose from- business, law, healthcare, and engineering. My choice to go in tourism wasn't even accounted for because there's no money there, they say. And I bloody well couldn't say otherwise because they were gonna pay for my education.

So for 5 years of studying in the university, I tried to like what I was getting into and I did. I tried to love it but I couldn't. Maybe it's a very immature idealism to believe that everyone who love their jobs live a happy, happy life and those who only like their jobs live a ""meh"" kind of life. But that's me. I want that happy, happy life.

I've only been working for about 2 months and technically worked without pay for 11 months (internship). I think I should know if I really want to stay in this career for the rest of my life or not.

1]  Try changing up your alarm tone, as I played my long standing alarm tone once when awake and felt SO ANGRY.  I was training my body to hate it unknowingly.  

2]  Try a sleep tracker app (I use ""Sleep as Android"", first app I ever paid for).  The smooth wakeup made mornings MUCH easier.  I'd suggest getting the light attachment as well if you aren't a morning person.  Just having the light on your skin makes transitioning to ""awake"" much easier.  

3]  Insulate yourself from office energy.  A lot of people have to ""fake it"" a little (or a lot!) at work to not punch people in the face for annoying you.  Try to find a ""switch"" to become your real self again after work.  I turn into a grump the moment my tires hit the parking lot at work, but the moment they leave, I'm mentally back to me.  When me, I don't answer work calls, I don't talk to co-workers, etc. 

4]  Plan a vacation, even if it's a long weekend in a few months.  Half of the value of a vacation is thinking about it and looking forward to it.

Last December i turned 21, and in that same month my father kicked me out of his house, i had no car, no home, no money saved and almost no one to go to for help, i lost everything but i still had my job, so i did what i had to do, i worked, i sold what little i had, and i survived, i reconnected with my mother whom i haven't seen in 8 years and she let me stay with her,    

Now i have a car i make payments on, and a few other bills,

Add to that people are healthier longer, when I was a kid 60 year olds looked like shit... They were train wrecks. These days it seems the majority of 69 year olds are in fine shape.

I've been in my field (oil and gas geophysics) for 10 years so this isn't a case of me having unrealistic expectations of what the working world is like. I work long hours, I'm overworked and stressed out, and my job actually bores me because it's entry level and my company refuses to recognise my past experience. When I wake up in the morning, I stay in bed as long as I can get away with and then rush around because the thought of accepting reality - that I have to go into work - is tough to cope with. And then when I do get up, my cats are also underfoot and drive me crazy.

If I can recommend anything, it would be seeing a doctor about maybe getting antidepressants because they've helped me so much. Also, I find that being active in the evenings helps too. I'm studying coding in my spare time, I go to the gym and I try to be social (I go to a pottery class). So while I hate being at work, I do at least have something to look forward to that helps me feel less empty. Being proud of my accomplishments, no matter how small, gives me a pick me up.

I'm also career changing (just to be clear, I'm only career changing because oil and gas is so dead otherwise I would just find another job in my field). I've thought long and hard about what I want out of life, what it is about this job I hate and why I loved my previous jobs so much. That really helped me realise what direction to head next. I'll be quitting my job at either the end of October or end of November, going home to my parents for some R&R because I'm burned out, and then come January my life changes with going back to school for 12 weeks.

For five years after that any job I found lasted a few months (3 weeks at one job) before layoffs. Or there was a glass ceiling and I was making just enough to survive. Now I lead a crew making baked goods for Walmart. On the one hand, it's long hours, hot as fuck, way too many brain dead employees, rotating shifts that could change in a day. This place almost seems to operate outside the law in terms of human rights.

But ya know what? They kept their word and my efforts paid off. I'm making more money than I ever had in my life. My place is pretty awesome. My wife's family in Cambodia gets lots of this money. My nieces are spoiled when I get time. My dad is well looked after. To me, work is work. I do dislike my job. Ya, it is shaving years off my life. But, I'm not homeless anymore. Plus the world seems to be getting worse by the day.  

It's hard to tell someone who is depressed snap out of it, or turn that frown upside down. Work sucks, life is hard, and I drag my ass to the gym too. What worked for me is separating how I feel at the moment, with what I should do long term. Even if I zombie my way through it. Small example is dishes in a sink. Large example is taking my nieces to the zoo. I imagine what a productive useful version of myself would be doing and I glide through it.

Thinking about how you moved away from home to be with your partner while you find a ""real job"", these all sort of seem to point at root issues. You didn't leave for you. You sort of had to find a grown up job, because well, you had to. 

Ask yourself a couple questions. 
Why did you move? Was it for you or someone else?
What do you want to do? Do you want to work in law? Is that why you chose this job or was it the job you got? If you don't want to work in law find entry level work in the field you want, and ONLY apply to that. 
Is part of it homesickness? Would you still feel the same way at this job if you had access to family and friends from home? Do you have many friends in the town you're in now? Can you spend more time with them? 
If the shoe was on the other foot would Partner move to another city with you?

d6srqmz,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 02:59:33,TwoXChromosomes,"First six months of any job are what I call the 'honeymoon' period.  Everything is new, there's new relationship energy all over the place, it's interesting, you're learning new things, doing new things.

After you're oriented, things sink into routine.  You start to spot things that could be improved, attempt to do so, and get slapped down HARD by those with a vested interested in keeping things the same (perhaps lazy, don't care, it's extra work in the short run but is far better over the long haul, etc.) so the frustration sets in.

Then, you yourself become vested in things staying the same so you can be hassled as little as possible before going home to soak your brain in alcohol to recover.  You become one of THEM.

Eventually, you wear out.  You're either laid off, fired, or quit because of some shit or other.  If you're smart you won't quit until you find another job.

At the new job, the whole cycle repeats.

The moral is, you need to transfer regularly to keep the new relationship energy going.  If you find you can't move around and do different things (once you've mastered your main job) then YOU need to move yourself around.  One or two years is fine before actively looking for better jobs.  This is especially important if you find you can't make a difference where you are.

You are responsible for developing your own career.  If you don't do this, nobody will do it for you.  It's your own personal rut.

I stayed in my rut at my previous job for 9 years.  The first 3 years were great!  Then the shit started.  If it hadn't been for the stock options I would have bailed at 4 years.  I quit about 10 months ago, and things are terrific at my new job.  My boss actually gives a shit about me, about the work I do, and I'm regularly finding new ways to help out and improve things.

If any of this changes and the place stops being a good place to work, I'll start looking for a new job.  I generally won't consider looking until I've been someplace at least a year; I do it as much for them as for myself - it takes about a year to really start to get to know the people and the system, less if it's a small company, more if there are gazillions of layers involved.

So see if you can stick it out for the next 6 months.  While you're there, try and find out what things you would need to know to get a better job - specialized knowledge?  Specific experience?  Classes?  Make that your goal - let it drive you.  After a year, start quietly looking around.  You may have to move away and take some chances.  Some will work out, some won't.  But don't stay in your rut and quietly rot away for the rest of your life.  You owe it to yourself to work towards your full potential.",supershinythings,t2_fzdei,1,0,reddit2

I am currently in the same situation due to a large number of things happening simultaneously. I used to live in a urban area with a good job and active dating life as well as a strong support network of friends. However, I had to move across the country for a new job. Then, a couple of things happened.

The new place was not only very suburban but also very exclusive, and most people here are either middle-aged families with kids, or senior folk after retirement (I'm a young adult). My new workplace pays a lot of money and has great security (unlike the last one), but at the same time, quite demanding. 

I do have friends, but any activity or meeting up means a 2 hour drive to a very specific location, and thus, everything has to be scheduled in a calendar. I've also had issues with my tenant and I am new to using a car for everything. I had a breakup and also need to move as my tenant and neighbors are hostile. I dread getting up in the morning, and feel the more I try to ""fix"" something, the worse it gets.

It's been a year, and initially the change in pace was good, but now, the dread is setting in for me. I feel really suffocated. But having said that, my old workplace has gotten shut down and most of my old friends moved out of there. So there is nothing to go back to either. I also have a couple of debts for me as well as my family, so I have to save money for at least 5 years, and just cannot ""throw everything and make a life-changing trip around the world"".

For example, I have a friend that has a creative type job and is all #ilovemyjob, but you know what? She works weekends, doesn't get sick pay, and can't get health insurance through her company. Those are all things she doesn't like but puts up with while most of us wouldn't.  

I'm one of those people that works to live, not lives to work. I do my job and do it well, but my time off is mine. And it's okay to be like that. You will meet people that breathe and live their job and will give you the side eye for not doing the same. To hell with them. 

 You sound like me from a month ago. Funny enough I was working at a law Office too.  it sucked, hands down the worst job I've ever had. Their turn over was high, half the staff was shitty, 2 mangers were micromanagers with serious control issues, I got treated like an office bitch, I felt depressed, there wasn't any training, and there was zero culture. I stuck it out and finally found something new and although I'm still new at my new job, I am much happier. For one, it's a huge company, which I think is a good fit for me, we have strong management, a great culture, and incredible training, and room for growth! All of those things my job was lacking. Are there things I don't like about my new job? Of course, but they aren't that big of a deal and I no longer dread going to work. 

My advice is to stick it out for a year and keep those relationships with your colleagues as good as they seem. Don't burn bridges! You never know what direction one person can take your career to.

I'm posting this so long after your original post, so you may not get the chance to sift through and find it. But I'll phrase quickly my advice (and how it helped me through the slump and that horrible feeling when your alarm goes off at 7.15am and you feel angry).

**Make your morning about you again**

* Try to go to bed an hour earlier, and set your alarm for that hour earlier
* Use that time for **you**. Whether that's by making a kick ass breakfast, spending time making a nice brewed coffee and watching the news or even just doing something productive for an hour like cleaning up a little. Do something that you can say you've productively managed already. 
* This means you've woken up at 6am for *yourself* not waking up solely to get up, dress and go to work. 
* Suddenly your morning is yours. You'll feel calmer (more you time) and more accomplished (you can't climb a mountain in one big step).

so my advice is to make sure you're getting the most out of the time you aren't at work.  start some new hobbies, explore parks near you, find a group of people you like.

it's always a good idea to make sure you are exercising enough... current recommendation by DHHS is 2.5 hours per week!  if you're only exercising in 30 minute chunks, that means 5 days per week!  exercise is (from my experience) the single best way to elevate your mood and fight off depression.

>During the work week, I alternate between feeling numb and hopeless  

could be clinical depression!  make sure you eat right, sleep enough, exercise enough (see above) and consider some counseling or psychiatry if you continue to feel numb and hopeless, as this is not normal!

Has anyone else felt like this? I feel terrible today just thinking about wasting my life in this office.

EFF...THAT...NOISE. Seriously. I'm going to run a great risk of oversimplifying this issue, but I hope you can find something motivational in it..even if it doesn't accurately apply to your specific situation.

After college..I also worked a retail job for two years. Could have easily been the worst two years of my life. I hated every second of it. I'm in a unique situation and won't go into all the details, but basically..I as a now-grown-man would cry every so often because of how much I didn't want this to be my life. I talked to people I trusted and expressed my concern about just having a job and paying bills for the rest of my life...and I got the same response you did ""Well, sweetie, that's just part of it.""

You know what I decided? No it isn't. 

Yes I have to pay bills. Yes I have to have a job to be able to do that. But I WILL NOT let that be my life.  I refuse to be a routine-based machine that hates his job. I've got one physical life on earth and I am absolutely not about to *literally* **waste** it on doing things I hate doing...and doing those things the majority of the time.

So you know what I did? I saved my money and now, thanks to my unique situation, I am dedicating at least the next year to full time art training. I realized one day at my trash job..that I can be the best at whatever I want as long I work REALLY FREAKING HARD at it. I love art...almost always have. I'm not going to waste away in a trash job and let that go to waste. I don't care how much it pays...I'm not going to succumb to the easy road and just find a job that I'm simply ok with and drone away the rest of my years. No. I'm going to spend every day doing something that I love doing and I'm going to make a living at it. Period. I don't care how long it takes or how many temporary jobs I have to be in for it to work...I'm not going to be told that I just have to accept that as being a part of adult life and just force myself to live with it. I'm going to take the hard road..but it's a road that I'm sure to love more than the lifelessness that awaits me elsewhere.


***MORAL OF THE STORY:*** No, it doesn't have to be that way. Making it NOT that way will likely take more work and be harder. But just find something you love and do it until you're good enough to be paid for it. If that's art...great. If that's accounting...awesome. If that's construction work...sweet. Just find something you love...and make it work. It might be hard...but the sense of hopelessness that people like you and me feel when we hear that response ""That's just...how it is"" is far worse than the difficulties you might face in striving after doing something you love.


Sorry for the rant...might come off as a bit cheesy-motivational in some parts...but really. I know that feeling you described first hand. And we don't have to accept that as our fate.",gray_rain,t2_iy86z,1,0,reddit2

d6st9xl,t3_4z0d8j,2016-08-23 03:42:57,TwoXChromosomes,"I really get you. I had work depression for as long as I remember working in ""real jobs"". Which makes me think about how necessary those quote marks really are. I've also had several short-term ""unreal jobs"" which paid me and provided me with some form of satisfaction higher than the ""real"" ones ever did. 

But anyway, the point is: don't keep going or wait in hope that it will get better in your current job. I believe, as somebody already mentioned, this might have to do with the size of the firm you work for and how replaceable this makes you feel. Not only that, but low impact, hardly any possibility of choosing how/when/what to do etc. I think any job that gives you creative/initiative freedom (which no doubt comes with more accountability and responsability) is key to work-happiness. It might feel like you have responsibilities in you current post but do those emanate from a task that you had little decision in creating / analysing / planning?

It's a little hard to explain but I worked in a big firm in a field that I thought was the best for me (in terms of expected satisfaction of curiosity / meaning etc) years ago. It was so huge, half of your hr / admin questions had to cross the world twice before you got some sort of answer. I had big responsibilty not in terms of managing people, being high up, but in terms of my work could fuck people / companies up big time. Let's say my work had impact. But why it was done the way we did it / why we did it in the first place was never up for questioning. It just had to be done. That left me depressed but mostly extremely stressed to have to bear this responsibility without understanding / agreeing with the practices. 

I believe a smaller firm would give you more chances to question practices and have a possibility of reforming things you don't believe are right / could be improved. And this is key to me.

Also, I know we all have rent, bills etc but PART-TIME! Come on! How does anyone expect to give up that much time to anyone / anything every week and be happy? First, we need to rest, sleep, relax for that to happen. We also need idleness - lots of it. Just being able to reach boredom from time to time can really fuel creativity, help you take action towards what you want. I know it's harder to make ends meet but if anything can be scrapped out of your expenses to retrieve a day of your week, don't even think twice! That and working form home. Even just one day a week (Wednesday being the obvious choice) if that can be arranged with your work. Most of us can do that with our computer/Internet-based jobs. Just having that one day to stay under the blankets a while longer, not go into public transport/traffic madness. Those little adjustments can make a huge difference. 

Also if travelling is in your interests, you could stick with it for a bit longer and gather enough to go travel for a while or get a WHV somewhere and do those small ""unreal"" jobs. Take your time to find what you want out of or work / life, it's never instant and takes tons of fails before you can say: that's it, that works for me.

Also, all of your income does not have to come from one source. You can work part-time at a ""real"" job and get a couple of shifts a week / month at some cafe / bar / museum / trapeze school / whatever it is that you enjoy. Also, giving lessons in whatever you're good at once a week can bring in a little extra. Keeping it varied and fun. I know I make it sound easy and when you're in that state, all you want is for your office to catch fire just so you can rest at home a few days but talk to your boss about cutting hours / working from home one day a week for a start. Then think about all your other options. And one other thing that helped me at the time was to dismiss that idea of failure. It's not a failure to realise what you studied / thought you'd enjoy isn't that. It takes courage to accept it and move on or accomodate it in a way you might enjoy. We're all such complex people with different needs at different times and our interests / needs keep evolving so don't do things for your future self. Do it for yourself now.",,,1,0,reddit2

Eventually, I realized that something that contributes to this for me is not having interests or activities outside work. Watching TV or movies after work just doesn't do it for me- I need some sort of active stimulation. 

At various times over the last ten years, this has meant having an active, busy social life during the week (basically, I'd leave work and go to a bar or club to meet up with friends-- yes, on a Tuesday!), going to yoga after work daily, or keeping busy with classes and volunteer work, which is what I've been up to for the last year or so. I've found that maintaining a healthy work-life balance just keeps me feeling more positive about work in general, and paradoxically helps me perform better on the job. 

I think that in this country (I'm assuming you're in the US), we tell ourselves that we're supposed to go home, make dinner, watch TV, and call it a day, but that's just a recipe for isolation and depression. Get out, meet like minded people, and have some fun you'll never tell your coworkers about-- trust me, it's better this way!

The job was full of drama and stress and it seemed like every day was a crisis or catastrophe. Someone was *always* thrown under the bus for what had gone wrong and all I could do is hope they didn't pick me that day. But it just seemed to happen at random. 

It all came to a head when I had my youngest daughter and ended up having postpartum psychosis. They fired me because I was, admittedly, being pretty unstable. I was also extremely demoralized and demotivated. I stopped really drug testing new hires and became a lot more lax on who I hired just because I didn't really care anymore. They said I was shit talking the company to other people. I don't remember doing that, but I don't remember a lot of what I did or said from that time period. 

I've been staying home and taking care of my kids ever since.

On my first day of a full-time job after grad school, I was told to make a bunch of copies of packets in the copy room. A few copies in I just started crying. I already knew this was in no way how I wanted to spend my working life. I kept on but worked on creative projects on the side. I eventually changed jobs but still found myself at odds with the standard elements of a FTJ--wake up early, report to typically lazy/incompetent supervisors, work hard on projects I don't really care about in any meaningful way. After 4-5 years of this, I realized I was deeply, deeply depressed, was drinking way too much at home by myself after woRk, and had put on extra weight. I decided to take the plunge, just a few weeks ago, to start my own creative business. Granted time will tell how this will play out but I can tell you now that I have never in my adult life been excited about working my ass off, until now.

All that to say, I think the cliché about finding work you love is definitely true, for some more than others.

If I were doing the same thing every day, I would have a terrible time working. However, my job lets me learn and grow and take on more responsibilities over time.  I'm usually challenged, and when I'm not, I start to feel like you do.

So, my questions are:

* Is your job intrinsically interesting to you, or are you there purely for the money?
* If it's somewhat interesting, is there a way to learn more, or take on more responsibilities until you feel like you're challenged?
* Do you feel like you make a valuable contribution to your workplace?
* What do you like about your job (aside from the pay)?  Is that aspect you enjoy something that you can get from a different job?

No, things are not hopeless, but if you want to enjoy your work you have to actively manage your career.  That means figuring out what you like, and what you don't like.  It means deciding on goals (""I want to learn this skill, which will help me land a job doing X""), and sometimes changing those goals as you learn more about what is available.  This is really important for you to do throughout your career!  The world is changing over time, and no particular job is ""safe"" forever.

I had a retail job for quite a while and absolutely hated it.  I dreaded going to work I dreaded waking up and I dreaded going to sleep, only to wake up and start it all again in a few hours.

I recently got a job doing something entirely different from what I studied in college, and entirely different from what I've done before.  It's an office job working as a kind of IT Support but not really.  Anyway, had never done this stuff before, but I love it.  I can't wait to get to work, and it kills me that I'm still a couple of months away from a salaried position and that I have to go home after 8 hours.

I honestly cannot tell you what it is.  The job itself is okay, the managers and co-workers are amazing, but they were amazing at my retail job as well.  But for some reason this job clicked, and I adore it.

I guess if I were to give you any advice, it would be to feel around other jobs, but also look at your home life.  I made drastic changes to my life outside of work.  None of them were particularly better or worse, but it was a change, and some combination of things has made me far happier.

Although really I expect more than half are generally in the dissatisfied zone - maybe 75%?

Anyway, for me the utter loathing shifted somewhat in my late 30's to hopeless resignation. Once I gave up on the dreams of my youth, my previously-unbearable job moved into the emotionally-dead ""meh"" zone - a vast improvement.

When I was younger I had a number of jobs, and in most I too experienced a six-month ""honeymoon"" period. During that phase I found myself eager to learn, then master my assigned tasks. Once I achieved proficiency, for most jobs the routine became mind-numbing.

I realize that throwing myself into my work is not the perfect way to deal with depression, but my therapist is on vacation, and I can't see her everyday anyway. 

With that being said, I have had jobs that I've hated before. One in particular led to a 10+ month struggle with depression. It manifested itself in the form of a nice little eating disorder. I quit that job and the fog started to clear. I got a new job and things got a lot better.

1. A job that fits your personal life

But then I thought ""I have been through this and I know how awful it is and this person deserves feedback"", so here goes:

When I graduated college and got my first ""real job"" I was miserable. I felt just like you. It took a while but I realized that I felt that way because I was crushingly bored. I had no autonomy, no agency, and therefore I felt no personal investment in the job and I felt no pride or fulfillment from my work. I ended up being able to talk to my boss about it and found ways to alleviate the problem-- however I had an unusually empathetic boss who was really invested in helping me to have a good first job experience. This will not be the case for every person. 

I suggest thinking a lot about what elements of your job are driving you to depression. Are you bored, do you feel unchallenged? Do you feel that the job is pointless? Do you feel like there is no potential for advancement or growth? 

Once you have created a tangible list of issues, then consider whether these things can be fixed in your current workplace, or if you  should consider switching jobs or careers. You are young and you have options. You don't need to feel like doing cartwheels on your way to the office every day, but you should feel more or less okay about it. You should not feel depressed about it. 

I have a lot of friends who have rejected the 9-5 grind on the premise that the added income from conventional ""white collar"" work does not contribute enough to their quality of life to make the kind of job worth it. Sitting behind a desk all day can feel soul crushing. These friends have gone on to do things like work on farms (one friend manages an organic farm in California!), work for parks, work for non-profits etc.

The first real job you have (not student job) it suddenly hits you: is this what life really is like, day in and day out? Over time, you realize that knowing how to adult means accepting that you just have to keep turning the money crank if you want to keep food and a roof. It's a part of life. And there's a certain satisfaction that comes from having your shit together. (Try going jobless and watching your debts mount up, and see how you feel compared to having a job.)

So, with the realization that some amount of daily grind is a part of life, you can start working on your metagame. Optimize your life for effective use of your leisure time. Put out feelers for a better job, if the one you have is so terrible. Note: your first job or two are bound to suck, because you don't know how to tell a good job from a bad one yet. When you have some years in the real workforce under your belt, you'll learn.

I came to understand that I was selfish and spoiled in a way, I didn't come from money, not an only child, and I had nothing to worry about. Food in the fridge, love in my life, money in my pocket. But I was so comfortable that I sucked at life.

I complained to one of my friends every time something upset me, every time I felt depressed, dull, bored, numb. One day he said ""Well, you gotta quit this shit. Your life isn't that bad, everybody has shit days. Your shit day isn't any better or worse than most peoples.""

I was pretty angry, I wanted to bite back and say some mean shit. I choked on my own words and hurriedly ended the call, I had to take a few days and really think on it.

I sat around doing nothing new, working, eating, sleeping, doing the same ""hobbies"" every day. My life was a product of my own poor planning.

So, I started by calling my friend back and thanking him for giving me a kick in the ass. Then I started trying out different things, I stopped my routine and I searched for things that would help me feel complete.

Years have gone by and I have tasted life more than some people, I have tried things simply to try them. Learning new instruments, tried making jewellery, pulled apart electronics to see how they work a bit better, video editing, programming, game building, web development, writing, voice acting (really love voice stuff!), carpentry / wood work, and metal work. And a whole load of other things too!

I started to think of my life as a food, and you have to add your own spice to it, otherwise it gets bland and boring.

From what you've said it really sounds like there is a lack of self motivated interest in your own life that's dragging you down. If I were you I would get my hands into something different, start simple with a little volunteer work, or a new hobby. I would recommend archery.

d6s2ods,t1_d6rvl3v,2016-08-22 17:14:26,TwoXChromosomes,"One thing someone told me years (and years and years) ago is to get a hobby with a clear beginning, middle and end.  The transition from 20 years of school years starting, there being subjects that are new to us, clear markers (in the way of tests) that indicate progress and end-of-term grades conditions us for something similar at work. 

And you won't find it there. Often, while on one project you're starting the next and never experience the satisfaction of one ending before you're consumed with the next ... And especially not where you'll get praise and a feeling of accomplishment and mastery that a good grade in a class can give you. That in itself can be emotionally taxing - we've been conditioned for it and suddenly it's gone without warning. 

For me, I took up sewing and quilting in my 20s, and gardening in my late 30s. These hobbies have clearly defined ""seasons"" for me - newness, learning, mastery, completion and occasionally appreciation outside myself (if I give an item as a gift, show it to a friend, or neighbors or people walking by noticing the garden). Hell, pulling weeds can be incredibly satisfying after a frustrating week because there's clearly a before and after, and I have tangible proof that the area is better specifically because of the effort I put in. 

Some people do find roles in jobs where these things are fulfilled by their day-to-day but for many, their jobs leave them wanting without knowing what they're missing. This advice has really helped me over the years. ",skeetbuddy,t2_ub065,142,0,reddit2

I'm lucky that I have a job I mostly like, with coworkers I mostly love, and I have a nice place and a nice dude to go home to. And I do like going out. But after going out, whether it's out to dinner or a show or even just taking my time and walking to the market to putter around while I buy stuff I may or may not need, I need time to recharge just from that. Sometimes it's more recharging for me just to go to work and look at my social calendar and be intensely glad that I have nothing planned for weeks or even months at a stretch. That said, I do have a lot of at-home hobbies that I enjoy, from reading to crafting to gaming, that balance out my work life with my ""me"" life. So for a certain type of person who is already ""worn out"" from work, whether physically or emotionally, sometimes having an active life outside of work can be equally, if not more, exhausting, even if all of those events are simple, enjoyable, go off without a hitch, or all three.

I finally got what I thought was my dream job. Three months in, the partner (my line manager) was fired and I was left to run that entire department on my own... with three months' experience. The owner of the company earnestly tried to help, but knew little about that particular area himself so there was no real direction.

Needless to say, it was fucking stressful. I was constantly sweating, I kept having to duck into the bathrooms to sob in a cubicle, I felt dizzy and sick all the time. I was having night sweats and sleep paralysis at night. I gained weight because I comfort-ate and was too tired to prepare meals at home, so I hated how I looked as well. I was thinking about jumping in front of a train whenever it pulled up at my stop in the morning.

I was so frustrated with myself - could I just not handle adult life? Was this the wrong career path for me and, if so, WTF was I going to do and when would I feel ready to do it (as I was feeling like a total wreck, and not ready for *anything*)?

By this point, my employers were clearly getting annoyed with me for losing my marbles and I began to suspect they wanted to get rid of me but couldn't due to employment laws on mental health. The business manager said I could confide in her about what was going on, but when I told her she remarked ""is it a case of 'I can't' or a case of 'I won't?'"" She seemed to think I was just being lazy.

I went on statutory sick leave, which gave me some time away from the office to regather my thoughts. I finally realised it was the working environment and the lifestyle that were bad for me, and I handed in my notice a couple of weeks later.

A couple of months passed and a competitor company called me up. I told them I didn't want to do that kind of work any more, but they asked me to please give it a chance. I joined them over a year ago and haven't looked back: different surroundings, a secure workplace where people aren't being hired/fired every 5 minutes, not constantly feeling like I could be in trouble at any moment, and I'm getting some sort of result from my hard work instead of slaving away into the small hours for little return on investment. In my last job I was off sick all the time, but not once have I had to take time off from this place for mental health reasons (and I have a lifelong mental health condition.)

I had to get up at 5:30am today to travel for a client. Sure, I thought ""fuck this"" when trying to pull myself out of bed... but I didn't have a panic attack. I didn't spend the entire day wanting to hide in the bathroom and cry. That's not healthy or normal, and you shouldn't have to put up with that.

I'm definitely going to look into mindfulness training. I do some meditation already, but it's mostly just being aware of my breathing. I'm pretty sure I have PTSD (I was a passenger in a really bad car accident last year, I only had minor/moderate injuries but I was trapped in the car and I saw someone in another car die in front of me, I came so close to either dying or being really seriously injured). I sometimes have flashbacks that make me feel like I can't breathe, but being aware of the feeling of my lungs filling with air reminds me that I am in fact breathing.


Also, my job makes me feel prematurely old. the next youngest person in the office is in her 40s and the rest are in their 50s to 60s while I am 23. I'm really afraid (in an existential way) of getting old/dying and the job makes me feel like I'll be trapped in monotony until I die.

d6sxfgs,t1_d6s7m5b,2016-08-23 06:13:49,TwoXChromosomes,"Yes. Please this. The job may be a contributing factor, but it sounds like more than anything you are dealing with depression and that can have many causes. Feeling better on the weekends does not necessarily mean it is solely your job causing you to feel this way, it also does not mean you aren't dealing with depression.  

You have experienced a great deal of changes in the last year and one of them being the biggest change that young adults experience which is no longer being a student (after spending 13+ years having that identity and having the future be something you are working towards not something you are living-if that makes sense).  Many, many people experience depression out of college. Going to a counselor/therapist can help. However, remember that the most important thing in therapy is the therapeutic relationship. If you don't feel like your therapist is a good fit you can tell them and they must help you find a different one. Too often, people think therapy cannot help after a few visits because they don't click with their therapist. ",3dayslate,t2_8r3ma,1,0,reddit2

I just can't get my head out of the mindset that it feels like ""adulthood"" is ultimately about drastically lowering your standards until the happiness you can scrape out of what little time you're not working or sleeping is sufficient for your psyche.

Why the hell is this ok? Typing it out is the most depressing thing I can think of, but I don't think this frame of mind, either mine or OP's is really wrong. I don't feel like this has to be depression, it seems almost a logical judgement: even the jobs with the best work-life balance possible (8 hours/day, short commute, no interference off hours) just takes so much.

I don't care how cool or fulfilling things are at work I care that there's just no time to explore life anymore. And I think that's where the motivation goes... why bother learning new things only to find out there's not enough time to fit them into your life?

I noticed earlier than most I think because i have some health problems compressing my schedule more than usual, but even once those are fixed I've more or less figured out unless you love not sleeping : there's about time for a relationship and 1-2 large hobbies at best (exchangeable for 1-3 small hobbies if that's your thing. Terms and conditions may apply. Establishing a long term relationship may temporarily use up all your hobby tokens.)

Globally, to be in the top 10% in terms of income, you need to make $25,000/year.  Would you support a general policy of giving a third of everything you make above that level to the 90% of people who are below $25,000 threshold?

Eg if you make $45k a year, then your 20k over the threshold to be in the top 10% worldwide, and so you would give a third of that 20k to the super-poor globally.  That 6.5k you would be giving away is enough to drastically reduce poverty in many countries, and while it would require sacrifices on your part, it would be completely life changing to the recipient(s).

I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't demand more of the rich and powerful in our countries.  I'm pointing out that a person of average income in the western world is immensely powerful compared to almost everyone else, to the point where small sacrifices on our parts can make a life changing difference somewhere else in the world.  

We look to those we perceive as being rich and powerful, and see it as unfair that they don't use their accumulated riches to benefit the masses.  Yet we feign powerlessness, sacrificing nothing when it comes to helping those with significantly less power and wealth then ourselves.

If redistribution is a moral duty - which I believe is your position - then any sane and consistent way of applying that is going to distribute from those making more then 25,000/year - the richest 10% - to those making less then $10 a day - the poorest 71%.

edit: I've probably assumed too much about what your actual position is, and for that I'm sorry.

edit2:  The thing that I didn't really get across very well was that if you think it's a moral duty, then it's a moral duty regardless of whatever government policy is in place, and you should be donating life saving amounts already (presuming you make $25k or more, putting you in the top 10% globally).

If you want more money, gain an education and do something profitable.  If you want to live passionately and do what you love or be lazy and do as little as possible, you will likely not be profitable.

And thats right, technology has created higher efficiency.  The fact is that much of the point of technology is to make the jobs of people obsolete, or at least, to make those jobs so easy that anyone could do them.  Nobody is going to pay a riveter $90,000 of union wages for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week when they can buy a 5 million dollar robot that works 23 hours a day, 7 days a week and never complains.

The market dictates the value of your profession.  30 years ago people didnt pay more because they wanted to.  They paid more because skilled labor was difficult to find.  It took years to gain experience in a mine, or factory and to become a skilled laborer.  Now it takes a 3 week training course and knowing how to key in a few sequences.  

What companies do you think are making these windfall profits that aren't paying their employees enough?  For every wal-mart with 30 billion in profits there are dozens of huge companies that are just trying to stay afloat.  their biggest liabilities are taxes, wages and insurance.  Walmart makes 22 billion a year.  That is a lot, no doubt.  But they operate at a 3-5% profit margin.  If you took all of walmarts profits and split them up evenly among its 2 million employees it would get everyone in the company an additional $5.0 per hour.  OH and btw the entire stock would plummet once the investors who made places like that possible pull out as fast as possible.

Wealth distribution does not work.  Cannot work.  You could tax the wealthy a bit more, sure.  But redistribution of wealth would just result in the exact same thing that happened the first time.  A select few would find a way to get most of it.  

I feel that people, especially in the US, have this notion that just getting by is not ok.  That if you don't have a big house, a yard, and 2 weeks of vacation a year that you've somehow failed at life.  At no time before now in history have people felt that they were entitled to be happy, and have what everyone else had.  

People are always complaining that the game is rigged, the fix is in.  THe rich control everything and keep the poor down because its fun.  But ever day another 1000 people become millionaires.

When you work your fingers to the bones 50+ hours a week to save up for school so you can perhaps make a slight bit more, and you get 1/4 of your paycheck taken out by the government for programs that they do not oversee or regulate well enough, it is infuriating.

Then add the concept of giving everyone ""living wages"" for being alive...you think you get taxed a bit now? I'm poor as shit and it hurts to cut my paycheck 1/4 ""just because"". You increase that? I will barely have the ability to live month to month and save for school, the only alternative would be indentured slavery by debt lol, I'd have to take out a massive loan and have that loom over me the rest of my life so that people can: ""get a living wage for being alive"". 

I don't like identifying as a specific political base, but I am the furthest thing from Republican, and even I reflexively gag at the socialist concept of every single person getting something for nothing, and that I must foot the bill for this humanitarian effort.

You have great famines in India, China, North Korea, and the USSR when they try to control the means of production in a more ""fair"" way. Economies in Africa and South America have stagnated, and inflation blown out of control due to failed economic redistribution and subsidies.

Conversely, capitalism in China and India in the last few decades have raised hundreds of millions out of poverty. Wages have kept pace with growth, because their growth is inclusive and highly labor intensive. In the US and Europe, you have a standard of living and technological growth that has never been seen before in human history, not even close. Unfortunately, growth has been exclusive, in that it has been concentrated on the most skilled workers and those with the largest amount of investment capital. But that has more to do with the way the economy is growing rather then any structurally built system. Because of the productivity multiplying effects of our new technology, those who are most able to take advantage of these technologies far outpace those who cannot in terms of productivity.

Smart government policies can fix this, but railing against ""the 1%"" will not. The wealth of the 1% is not incomprehensible. If you taxed every dollar made over $1 million a year, it would increase government revenue about $700 billion a year (for the first year only, there would be a massive capital flight and the US economy would collapse, but let's pretend it won't). The deficit alone is $500 billion. An NIHS style public healthcare system would cost almost $700 billion a year, so yeah you might be able to get universal healthcare, but that's it. You won't really increase people's incomes by a significant amount. Redistribution and spending will not fix this problem.",,,1,0,reddit2

I've written out several responses to your postulation that 'wealth redistribution won't happen for inexplicable reasons' and can't really decide on the best one, so this is my last attempt:

In capitalism, currency is an artificial construct that represents wealth and replaces bartering. Even by redistributing quantities of currency, it is very difficult to redistribute actual wealth. Wealth in this sense can be a beautiful beachfront property, or a factory making high-tech equipment, or an amazing one-of-a-kind piece of art... the point is that there are rare items that everyone cannot posses at the same time, or that there are highly valuable services/professions that not everyone can perform or hold. Not everyone can be a genius inventor, or a highly skilled life-saving doctor, or an awe-inspiring artist or musician, etc. There will always be people whose skills and services will be more sought-out, and thus will be able to command a higher ""price"" (if not with money, than with other goods, services or favors - ie: bartering). At the opposite end of the spectrum, there will always be people who are very clever at cheating others or getting by without doing anything.

Humanity has tried many different ways of structuring our society and therefor economy, and unfortunately we always come across the same pitfalls of limited resources (skills and time are resources) and bad apples taking advantage of others. Capitalism has many, many flaws, but so far it is the ""fairest"" system we've stumbled across so-far. By relying on people to be greedy and look out for their own-self interest, we've made an inherently fair and stable system. Different countries have different social welfare systems in place to account for those who are unlucky in life, but for the most part it is unwise to take from the rich to give to the poor in large margins, for at some point we cross the line from being charitable, to stifling investment and innovation by discouraging people from working hard and applying their talents.",KapitanWalnut,t2_6ti5m,-1,0,reddit2

In developed countries, people are able to get what they need to survive, not work or barely work from the government if they want to live that lifestyle, and I know quite a few. Some even live quite lavishly.

Just by being on the internet, able to complain after a meal, use a smartphone, you are in the World's top 1%. Why are you not donating half of your earnings to the people that are really struggling? how greedy of you to not share for the people who are starving, the children made to fight each other, the babies being abandoned, those dying of diseases that the developed world beat 300 years ago? 

It seems like you haven't studied economics in depth, but please do the research on how long taxing 90% of the wealthiest 1% would last, and why it didn't work in the 60's?

Then compare it the actual tax receipts the government received from the same period over time adjusted for inflation. 

So yes, if you'd like to go back to the 60's and relive a ""golden age"", you know when everything was so much better, please go ahead.

I always have a smile on my face with a great attitude and have been nicknamed ""smiley"" by random ppl who don't know my name. (Neighbors,mailman,customers etc)

The thing is... I hate life in the morning, I dread every  single workday..but it gets better the closer I get to finishing my day. When I get off work I feel like I can finally breathe and am truly happy. As much as I love,Love,LOVE!!! sleep, I dread actually going to sleep because I know what I'm waking up to. Unless it's my day off tomorrow ;)  Which in that case I'll wake up all pleasant and shit; like I'm Eddie Murphy in Coming to America.

I work 80+hours a week, going on 15+ years now. I'm  immune to being burnt out,completely numb to it,never had a vacation in my life.I live in the few hours a day I'm not working/sleeping.I Hate to break it to ya but Moms is right on this one. ""That's life...""

There are people out there that love what they do. I am so genuinely ecstatic for them.And I always advise people to try to do something they are truly passionate about.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation

>The theoretic basis of alienation, within the capitalist mode of production, is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny, when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. 

You are forced by economic necessity to spend nearly all your time doing something you would otherwise never do, and this makes you feel bad. That's normal. Fortunately, it's not the only way for things to be. The ""workforce participation rate"" is a measure of how many people in a given population are employed. If you include all people in the population, in the US it's less than 50%. That means half the people alive here don't have any kind of job at all. Retired people, children, people who are disabled, or in prison, or just stay-at-home spouses. Most people don't work. There's no reason, really, that people have to work, apart from social pressure. There's more than enough for everyone already.

If the team is supportive as you describe it, and the pay is okay and the task is okay, resolving the car accident impact on you first might prevent you from giving up a job that's actually good for you at this time.

d6sn40r,t1_d6rwr4p,2016-08-23 01:00:20,TwoXChromosomes,"It may be that there are a number of other things happening in your life that are more the root cause of your feelings about work than the actual job.  You mentioned that you moved to a new city and your SO just started graduate school.  Do you have any old friends in this city?  If not, this could be an added stress on your transition from a student to an employee.  Also, as a graduate student myself, graduate school can sometimes be very consuming.  I don't know anything about your relationship, but it might be worth examining if you both have had a hard time transitioning to the hours your SO now has there.  

Because of the trauma you've experience from the car accident, I would recommend making a doctor's appointment, and perhaps an appointment with some sort of therapist/psychologist.  You may only need to go a couple of times (it's always best to stick it out for a few sessions), but it could help you come to terms with not only the car accident, but the immense amount of change you've experienced lately.  

As someone else mentioned, it might be good for you to go out and meet friends in other places.  Try to challenge yourself to do one activity where you could meet people a week.  For example, as others have suggested mindfulness meditation can be helpful, but a nice way to practice it on the side is yoga classes, as they typically end with some meditation.  If you played an instrument in band classes or sung in a choir, look for a community band or choir to join, or if you like sports, look for rec teams in your area.  It can be hard to do, but it would definitely be worth it.

Another thing to think about is your exercise habits.  I don't think you've mentioned them, but there are a few studies that show exercise can help decrease depression symptoms.  It can be tough, but try some activities if you don't already have something you like.  It just might help.

It sounds that other than be the youngest at your work place, it's a great job for now.  I'd try to stick with it and look at some of the other stressors in your life before deciding to move on.  If nothing else seems to be the issue, then think about what you would like to be doing instead.

d6sqs9d,t1_d6rwr4p,2016-08-23 02:34:03,TwoXChromosomes,"Hey there. Depression and other mental health problems run in my family too. Just because your parents didn't seek help doesn't mean you shouldn't. I'm 27, not too much older than you, and my mom recently confessed that she wishes she had the mental health opportunities that I have now in her day. Often times it just wasn't accessible unless you had disposable income, and now that they're older, they don't see the ""need"" to.

I have been in therapy on and off for the past ten years because of my depression and anxiety. It is only in the past *year* that I got through that feeling of ""job depression"". The most upsetting part for me was feeling that I was ungrateful, because on paper, my life was *awesome*: loving husband, decent friends, nice job with nice pay. But I just wasn't happy, and it felt wrong to feel that way because there wasn't a clear reason for me to be since the job had decent pay, the people were nice, I had steady hours and wasn't overworked. For me, I struggled with treating my job as my identity, and finding my self worth lacking because the job I had wasn't the ""identity"" I had set for myself years ago, ESPECIALLY as a college graduate who was always destined to ""go places"" according to my extended family. It didn't help that my husband was always a driven person who was top of his class, accepted in prestigious positions, a hard worker, always knows what he wants...I couldn't stop comparing myself.

The most effective way of finally working through that existential dread was acknowledging myself as a complete person, a human being with multiple facets in my life, not just defined by my ""career"". 

I don't have all the answers as I am still working through this day by day, but I am *so* much better after finding a therapist that was right for me. Keep in mind that therapy is often very similar to a relationship -- it's ok if you don't click with your first few, keep trying, don't give up. If you live near a university, they often offer low cost to free therapists if you're worried about cost (my absolute favorite therapist was a grad student, don't discount them).

Sorry if I'm rambling, I just want so badly for you to know that you are not alone, and feeling like crying every day...that struggle to get out of bed...that resonates so much with my depression. Please don't discount it as ""just how adulthood is"". It will eat you alive if you do.

d6sxdad,t1_d6rwr4p,2016-08-23 06:11:03,TwoXChromosomes,"Hi, OP. I was reading through this thread for a while; it interested me because I recently left a profession that made me feel a lot of the same things you're describing. I had tried different jobs and environments within that field but ultimately I think it just wasn't for me -- so I took a leap into something else and even though I'm not making any real money yet, I am so relieved (and lucky) that I was able to make the switch.

Anyway, what prompted me to finally comment was your mention of PTSD. I was in a traumatic accident just a couple of years ago and while I was hospitalized and in and out of surgery and whatnot, it never occurred to me to get my mental health checked out too. I finally went to a professional and not only did he diagnose me with PTSD, the diagnosis actually explained SO MUCH of what I'd been going through emotionally. Turns out it was the perfect storm of being in the wrong job and having crippling mental health issues that I didn't even realize until much later.

My therapist explained to me that although PTSD is different for everyone, the basic component of it is that after you've been in mortal danger like that, the part of your brain that is responsible for your survival instinct will go into overdrive, thinking it needs to protect you from literally everything. And so any tiny thing that causes you any stress at all is exponentially magnified to the point where you feel like it's threatening your very existence. For me, this resulted in panic attacks, anxiety, and depression, among other things. Add to that a job that was stressful by its very nature... It was a recipe for disaster.

It sounds like you're not in the right job right now. Remember that everything in life is temporary and you don't have to be stuck in this job forever. In the meantime, do whatever you can to get yourself somewhere you really want to be. It's ok if you don't know where that is. Try anyway. 

I'm not a doctor but I just wanted to share this with you: the PTSD could be playing a part in all this. It could be compounding the frustration you're already feeling from work, and who knows what else. I really, really recommend going to a professional for a mental health checkup and therapy, if you haven't done so already. It was revelatory for me and it really did help me get better. I hope it would do the same for you. Please know that you're not alone!",,,1,0,reddit2

2. Client/boss: HOLY SHIT PANIC LOOK AT THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW!!1
3. Me: FFS…
4. Me: Well, it's not a bug in **our** code, must be the ancient fnordlib version they're using, the changelog indicates they fixed a bug related to something like this two years ago
5. They: BUILD A WORKAROUND! WE CAN'T UPGRADE THE LIB! UNPOSSIBLE! WE HAVE CUSTOM CODE THAT RELIES ON ITS BUGS THAT CAN NEVER BE REPLACED!
6. Me: Wastes three hours of my day trying to hack up an ugly un-maintanable hack of a solution. Finally I manage to create something which is incompatible with the newer version of the lib but which does work with the ancient lib they're insisting on using
7. They: You're done? Good, anyway here's this other thing that's on fire, please take a look at it, will you?
8. They, two weeks later: We upgraded the lib and now your code doesn't work! THIS MUST BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!

It usually takes an initial investment of some kind, which is the main barrier, and it always takes major lifestyle changes, which is the secondary barrier.

The more you share, the less you need to buy, and the less you need to buy, the less you need to work. Human connection and collaboration is the antidote we need.

There are more and more urban and suburban intentional communities sprouting up that are based around sharing resources and responsibilities. Many do communal meal preparation and childcare, and some of the suburban ones do a fair amount of food production, too. Some do skill shares where people teach each other what they know, and some have residents that provide professional services to people within the community for free or for barter. 

I think the website for the Fellowship for Intentional Community is [ic.org](IC.org) but I could be wrong. They have a search function.

That has its own problems, though. There aren't always flexible work options that allow people to consume less. If you can't find a job that will allow you to work part-time, you have no choice but to spend money on conveniences. 

The only solution to that is to either drastically change careers (often with a steep downgrade in pay) or find an employer who respects people as much as they respect profit. THAT is the hard part - making sourdough and mending clothes is easy. This is why I work for myself (though that's tough when you've got a kid).

That is management. They're not leeching off of us. If it wasn't for them, most under them would have no clue what to do. 
**This is where you all really hate my wording. Alright, what I mean by this:
Perspective, oversight. Imagine there's 3 divisions that all meet up every day to discuss how those divsions are doing numbers wise. They all strategise and work together to figure out that oh Division A is falling behind a bit, how can we make sure A doesn't go under. A begins working with B and C to come up with long term plans that would help each division that they can give to their uppers. So then they go back to the workers at A's building, mainly product managers. There are 4 products at A's store. ""okay we have to move people around from these projects and drop a product and focus on these other projects or else we'll lose this section entirely if we can't keep numbers up by focusing on less products-losing20 people version losing 200 people for example""

Say A doesn't meet numbers even after the reorganization. Well say goodbye to a few more workers and a project. But also guess who gets fired, head of Division A. And guess who's never getting hired somewhere again.. head of Division A. The reason upper level workers do make more, (not talking about high elites), is that, the decisions they make affect A LOT of people. It may seem like they do less at times because they're not always on a 40 hour clock card, but they also take more of the responsibility for entire business units, etc. Guess who are likely going to be able to get hired again by another company, those who were let go.


Yes they tell many what to do, but it is their job because there's much perspective one must have to do that job, that a lower classed worker who focuses on the grind would not be able to attain, because simply put, not enough hours in the day, or whatever reason. Management exists for a reason. They plan to make sure their units, their works don't get fired. And if they don't, leave your job. 


**Perspective. So managing a huge company, requires pyramid like structures, at this point in time. Start ups are an exception, small companies are an exception. Because they are small.
This is capitalism. There is a better way out there. IMO, it's a mix of capitalism and having a basic universal income and maybe some sort of nutrition food delivered monthly or weekly or something( not living wage).

My issue is property ownership is rewarded more than hard work. We have no such thing as a functioning meritocracy in the United States anymore because property owners (factories, business, stocks, cash, etc.) are effectively rent-seeking and using their property to get preferential treatment or deals no average person would be able to get. 

For example, Warren Buffet can buy a toll bridge with guaranteed returns. If the tolls don't pay him back then the tax payers do. He gets a guaranteed return at someone else's expense just because he had the liquid capital to buy the bridge? That's absurd! If the bridge is that distressed, why not offer a bunch of bonds to the masses at X dollars a pop or something that pays out a share of toll bridge revenue for the life of it. Let the average person in on it.

Anyway, the number one predictor of your success is how much property your parents own.

The worker doesn't get a fair share of what they produce anymore. When the economy grows our salaries stay roughly the same. The reason being that economic growth is captured by the upper classes through their ownership of property and favorable treatment by economic/tax/etc. regulation.

It's more complex than that. Money is an abstract representation of the perceived value of your work. You mentioned growing fruit, but that's a limited resource. So what happens when there are more people who want fruit than the amount of fruit that's available? Without some medium of exchange, things start to fall apart.

[Seattle, USA vs Chennai, IN](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=India&city1=Seattle%2C+WA&city2=Chennai): $1,216.89 = $5,400.00

That 5:1 would probably balloon significantly if we looked at rural areas in India instead of urban areas, but I don't think anyone is going to seriously argue that people in rural india are as well off as Americans making $25k/year.  

Further, those numbers don't take into account things that we receive but don't directly pay for.  Parents with kids going to school are probably going to receive much better schooling for free in America then they would in India, and whiel that's valuable, those numbers don't reflect the extra value received in the USA.

d7vczow,t1_d7rnjys,2016-09-21 00:17:03,TwoXChromosomes,"> I think the threshold (in the U.S.) should be 75,000$, as a study has shown that that's the point until which emotional wellbeing (i.e. happiness) increases

So the study pretty clearly doesn't show that, and it boggles my mind how the media in general has reported this story.  The chart in the actual study link you sent has 3 dotted lines reporting percentage of people who answered yes or no to certain questions, as well as a solid 'ladder' line, representing what number people gave on a scale of 1 to 10.  It's plainly clear that the ladder line is still steadily increasing well past the $160,000 mark, so I guess the conclusion here is that journalists are idiots (alternatively, that journalists think their readers are idiots).

Beyond that though, even if we take it as a given that happiness isn't increased beyond that $83,000 threshold, to make that assumption is basically to say that redistribution is only obligatory if it's literally costless.

In my mind, if a person holds the position that redistribution is obligatory in the situation where one group is dramatically wealthier, and has significantly more resources then everyone else (eg: the gap between the 1% in America and everyone else in America), then that exact same argument should hold when comparing the 1% worldwide to everyone else worldwide.  

Further, if it's a moral duty, then you should be doing it regardless of if it's law or not.  If it isn't a moral duty, then you don't have much ground for trying to force the rich to pay more in taxes.

To be in the top 1% worldwide, you need to make $34,000 a year.  If you make $34,000, your more powerful then 99 of every 100 human beings.  Do the rich and powerful have a moral obligation to help those in need?  

edit: A quick note on the study.  The 'ladder' measure references refers to people's answers to the question, ""Imagine a 10 is the best life you could be living, while a 0 is the worst life.  Where are you on this scale?"".  I think it's justifiable to say that higher ladder scores justify stating that people are happier, even if the percentage of people reporting being 'happy' remains constant.  Some percentage of people are always going to be unhappy due to idiosyncratic life circumstances (death in the family, recent divorce, etc), and that could easily explain the leveling off when it comes to people reporting unhappy vs happy.  But there is still a difference between being kind of sort of happy, and best day of your life happy, and the 3 binary measures used in the study can't capture any of that difference.  If the only measure that CAN capture the difference increases with income, then it seems pretty shifty to me to state 'above a certain income, there were no increases in happiness', rather then 'above a certain income, there were no increases in probability of happiness'.",Khaos1125,t2_a3xgd,1,0,reddit2

I've worked some jobs that operate this way but, thankfully, I've worked at several places over the years that don't discipline you for being sick or having to call in for some other reason.  Many of those jobs would even ask, upon return to work, if you want to apply your accrued PTO toward your missed day so that you get a full check.

d6tdv3b,t1_d6sgkl2,2016-08-23 16:09:06,TwoXChromosomes,"I just had a professor at my school pass away, who was unlucky enough to be teaching a core required lecture in his department for like 12 years. I was unfortunately one of those little shits who totally didn't care about the class. Tell your BIL that students notice. Tell him that his enthusiasm and devotion is noted and appreciated, even by students who couldn't give less of a shit about what he's teaching them. But there *will* be students who love his class, if he makes it as engaging as possible, and they will find him and let him know.

My three suggestions:

1) If he's teaching a big lecture, it's all about his showmanship and personality, not about the content he's teaching. He needs to find a way to surprise and amuse his students, be it by calling some of them up to the front for a light-hearted demonstration, or by a certain level of irreverence and/or fun/play in the way he delivers his lectures and interacts with students. If he makes it fun for himself especially, the students who respond to that and to his sense of humor will self-select. At the very least, the jaded seniors will roll their eyes, but everyone will suffer through the class a little less and enjoy their time a little more.

1a) He needs to make it very clear that he's available for office hours, or by some other method if he's not teaching college. This part is for him, not for the students. If he's available for office hours, or to the student population outside of class time, the students who enjoy the class or their time in it will seek him out.

2) If he's teaching a smaller class or seminar, he needs to be willing to call people out for an answer and for participation. And again, it's all about his personality. He needs to put the pressure on his students to have an answer, and he needs to foster an environment of peer pressure to not fail. If it's college, he may need to foster more intra class discussion. If it's HS or lower...The best high school teachers I had were memorable for their huge personalities - which they backed up with excellent teaching abilities. If the kids don't do their work or don't have an answer, there needs to be a tangible consequence *in that room* (separate from their grades and an office visit), be it a little humiliation via light-hearted lecture, or the kids all having to reorganize and shift desks so the non participatory student sits right at front. But make it easy to admit they don't know the answer, and if they actually volunteer that, it's a teaching moment, don't squash it.

3) My last suggestion is that he needs to get involved with the students in some way outside of class, in something that's meaningful to him. Can he be the faculty advisor for any clubs? Can he *start* an after school club? Can he direct plays? Can he assistant coach a sport? If kids see him as approachable and worth their time and respect outside of class, those kids will start bringing that respect into class.

I guess the theme here is if he makes it more  fun/amusing/enjoyable/silly to be around him in class and outside of it, the kids will respond to that.",BadBalloons,t2_g3fd8,2,0,reddit2

That's the thing about capitalism: the owners keep, for their own personal income, a share of your labor's value. They can go on vacation 12 months of the year and earn the largest income in the entire firm. 

These are the people who choose not to pay their workers a wage they can survive on. Then, they expect the middle class to shoulder the tax burden for food stamps for the folks who are malnourished working 40 hours a week. Those people take their food stamp dollars and deliver them right to the ownership class when the profits from selling that food is extracted to the top.

Corporate profits have never been higher in history, worker productivity has never been higher in history. 

Despite this, middle class and lower class incomes have not been lower relative to inflation in the last several decades.

This is the result of the wealthiest within the ownership class extracting the lion's share of the new wealth. They leave the workers, the people who actually created that wealth, without enough to meet their needs.

Capitalism does not reward hard work, it rewards exploiting the hard work of others.

Capitalism is forced inequality. It is like feudalism, but with a minimally better chance to rise up to the rank of robber baron.

Socialism would not force everyone to have an equal income. The basic needs would be met, but from there one earns an income proportional to the actual value of their labor. Compare this to wage/salaried labor which is just selling one's time to capital.",SlothsAreCoolGuys,t2_wibtz,10,0,reddit2

However, to say that all high class employees are evil and corrupt and want to watch everyone below them suffer with minimum wages is well, silly.

The point is, he is a skilled worker. Just like a programmer programs. Each position, usually, has their own skillsets that come with that position. Hence my point, there's a reason for those positions.

And yeah it was a silly example to show about vacation, but my point is that while skilled laborers do go home at the end of the day, just like management does. your argument though doesn't take into account the year's management has put into working towards that position, the loyalty to a company, working your way up from nothing. Which is fine. Not every industry is the same. And that's something that not everyone is taught growing up. ""if you go into x industry you won't have any room to grow, but if you go into y industry there's tons of room for growth""


should they make more? It depends on what that labor is. Blanket statements don't help anything get better as well.
My point is is that many in management also spend time outside of their workday as well, long weekends, long nights, just as the lower class do as well preparing for their weeks and days and performing their own homework. The only difference, as you have noted is 1) pay, and 2) the ""perceived"" level of difficulty for the tasks. The problem with the ""super high level elite"" is that it becomes about being in a club that you have to earn your way into in a business. Whether that be sacrificing whatever.

To be honest, I haven't read the article. Just parts of the study. And in the abstract of the study it says:
> *Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000.* ***Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone.***  We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.

So ""life evaluation rises steadily"", but not happiness.

---

> if we take it as a given that happiness isn't increased beyond that $83,000 threshold, to make that assumption is basically to say that redistribution is only obligatory if it's literally costless.

I don't understand how and why you come to that conclusion.


> Further, if it's a moral duty, then you should be doing it regardless of if it's law or not. If it isn't a moral duty, then you don't have much ground for trying to force the rich to pay more in taxes.

Morality is a hard thing. I agree with Sam Harris that there are objective truths to be known about morality and that there are many ways of making the world more fair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgnqkY6Fba4

So, yes I think the rich should help those in need. The fact is they don't always do this on their own, and rarely to the extend necessary. (Great exceptions are Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.)


> To be in the top 1% worldwide, you need to make $34,000 a year. If you make $34,000, your more powerful then 99 of every 100 human beings. Do the rich and powerful have a moral obligation to help those in need? 

Yes. People will agree or disagree with this, depending and what's in their favor. (I'd love to see statistics of who is in favor of redistribution vs their income.) Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I can't help but think that you're more or less well-off, for example.. On the other hand, there are also some very rich people that want much higher taxes for people with high income: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett_Rule

 Of course, how much money you need depends on where you live. 


>  If the only measure that CAN capture the difference increases with income, then it seems pretty shifty to me to state 'above a certain income, there were no increases in happiness', rather then 'above a certain income, there were no increases in probability of happiness'.

d6swerj,t1_d6sgm82,2016-08-23 05:29:30,TwoXChromosomes,"Here is the real distinction. What you are talking about: CEOs, VPs, high-level managers is very different from what I think the others are really referring to: the elite class of individuals whose wealth is so vast, they make their income purely on interest accrued on that wealth.

I think you've got the idea down, and we probably agree, ideologically, on a lot. If we simply were to tax capital gains like regular income (instead of it's current flat rate of 15%) and if we were to put logical limits on managers, we would be doing much better. For instance, we could say that no one who works for a company can make more than 30x what the lowest paid worker makes. So if this is like a Chipotle where the lowest paid worker makes a $20k salary, the CEO is limited to a $600k salary (Chipotle's current CEOs -- 2 of them -- each make $29M salary currently which is insane). But if it's a tech firm where workers make a lot more money, say the lowest paid is a $50k salary, then the CEO can make upwards of $1.5M. Obviously, this is just one rule that can help with improving wealth distribution, and it's simplified cause it doesn't take into account part-time workers, etc.

Anyways, we do have to, at some point, come to the realization that we will need to do some wealth redistribution to get the country back on track, economically. Because the wealthy (and I'm generalizing, because not all wealthy individuals are evil) have been redistributing middle class wealth to themselves for 40+ years, and we have to bring that back into balance.",thefragfest,t2_ndq0x,5,0,reddit2

While I don't claim to have made nothing but perfect decisions in my life (because who has?), I also didn't have the same start as, say, the children of wealthy executives. I was born poor. I was largely neglected by my parents for various reasons. I had to pay for college myself and have only been able to afford community college.

My parents, being emotionally distant and mentally unstable, never taught me how to be a responsible adult. I had to figure it out on my own. 

A lot of what you are able to accomplish in life can be immensely impacted by your socioeconomic status at birth. And I think that's a big part of what people are talking about when they say ""the system is keeping us down, it's horrible"". They aren't just talking about themselves, but also their children and their children's children. Because as much as we love stories about people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and rising from adversity, statistically people who are born in poverty are less likely to receive adequate primary education or to receive higher education at all. They are more likely to become involved in crime which can further impact their ability to climb out of poverty.

Because they stand to make profit. At the cost of the income of workers they would otherwise hire in the original country. 

Sure, I'll concede the point that some wealth are being distributed to the developing country, but those wealth comes from the working class of the developed country and only a small portion of it. The majority of the portion goes to the profit the company stands to make thanks to this move, which then filters to the pocket of the wealthy company owners.

And who's to say that they give decent wage to those people on the developing countries? Companies goals are to make as big a profit as possible. It's plausible that the wage they offer are lower than the market standard in the developing country and people are just so desperate for job that they will take whatever is available. I used to live in Indonesia. The rate of employment there is through the roof that I would be surprise if that isn't the case.

You mentioned how China moved from being a poor country to middle income country due to increase in their income. I think that's not so much through companies moving their production to China but more as a result of Chinese companies being able to copy  and reproduce technologies at much lower cost, thus undercutting the price of these technologies and giving them a fair chunk of the market. This means profits that the big companies from the developed countries would otherwise make are going to Chinese companies, which some then filtered through to their workers. I think companies moving their production overseas is the response to this (so they can cut down on their price) and the distribution of wealth is just an (un)happy coincidence.

d7wlcrn,t1_d7vsm76,2016-09-21 21:17:55,TwoXChromosomes,"I think part of the situation here is that happiness is a bit of a fuzzy concept.  

Who's happier?  A student who occasionally faces moments of high stress around exam time, who is frequently hung over after partying until 3 in the morning, but who otherwise feels like they're conquering the world?  Or an office worker in a low stress work environment who describes themselves as having 'nothing to complain about', although they sometimes worry they aren't really doing anything meaningful?

This study uses a very specific definition of happiness, skewed pretty heavily towards 'not experiencing immediate suffering' while explicitly removing the 'life satisfaction' measure, in order to claim more money doesn't make you happy beyond a certain point.

My personal stance on that is that people might have different definitions of happiness.  Given my personal conception of happiness is tied pretty strongly to that 'life satisfaction' number, it seems completely nuts to me to say, 'if you ignore life satisfaction, happiness doesn't change'.

That said, different people are going to have wildly different ways of looking at their own personal happiness, so I think it's most reasonable to be very careful when presenting this specific data.

More income, up until $70k ($83k post inflation), reduces the influence of many potential stressors. (Roughly 55% stress free rate at $35k vs 62% above $70k)

More income, up until $70k ($83k post inflation), reduces the chance of 'feeling blue'. (Roughly 68% not blue at $35k, vs 80% above $70k)

More income, up until $70k ($83k post inflation), increases the percentage chance a person will report 'happiness, smiling, or enjoyment'. (Roughly 82% at $35k vs 88% above $70k)

More income, well beyond $70k, increases the average 'life satisfaction' score. (Roughly 6.2/10 at $35k, vs 7.0 at $80k, 7.4 at $160k)

Those 4 pieces of info just doesn't sound like 'income doesn't have a meaningful effect on happiness above 70k' in my mind.  I can sort of see it if I squint, but presenting it as a solid absolute fact rather then one possible conclusion of the data seems like it's simplifying a lot of important nuance.

> Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I can't help but think that you're more or less well-off, for example..

I'm student level poor right now, with a reasonable expectation of being reasonably well off in the future.  I'd certainly benefit from more redistribution today, and I'm pretty certain I'd be on the other side of the redistribution 3-5 years from now.

Politically, I'm generally for higher taxes, generally against higher regulation, I believe foreign aid spending should be significantly higher, and I see looser regulations on international migration as by far the highest impact thing when it comes to 'worldwide happiness + wellbeing' and thus pretty important.  

Beyond that, I believe the absolutely perfect political leader would be an extremely smart and unbiased person who leans heavily to the left.  The worst leader would be an incompetent or biased person who leans heavily to the left.  The political right is safer because it's less likely* to try something drastic and break things (*Trump Excepted).

That is decided by their ability to leverage the scarcity of their talent against the market place.  I don't really understand why people dont get this. 

if one company pays burger flippers 7 an hour and the next pays them 10..nobody will work for the 7.  that is why wages stabilize.  A higher quality company may pay higher skilled laborers more, but for the most part these rates fall within a predictable range and within 15% of a median.

Try not to look for solutions online, but maybe just descriptions of the problems.

The funny thing is that just about every computer science major is more-or-less self-taught when it comes to actual programming. It surprises a lot of people, but Computer science is more the study of math and theory behind programming. It's entirely possible to take entire computer science courses with 0 lines of code in them. You kind of learn the basics of programming in first year, but otherwise you're expected to learn how to program and get better at programming on your own time.

**Point being:** don't feel like you need a degree to program or get a job doing it. Only certain types of programming make real use of a CS or software engineering degree. I'm nearly done getting my degree, but I plan on actually doing said types of programming which benefit from the knowledge.

To get to a level where you actually get hired? That depends entirely how much you work at it. Could be as little as 2 years if you treat it like your main hobby and work at it 4+ times per week. If you're interested in webdev, just start building a website. Projects are the best thing to get you learning.",soundslikeponies,t2_63g3l,1,0,reddit2
d6t3rlk,t1_d6sda3k,2016-08-23 11:51:14,TwoXChromosomes,"Sorry for the delayed response. Other commenters have posted most of what you need to know, but since you asked, my story in brief: 

I've been programming as a hobby since I was about 7, when I was lucky enough to have a teacher who introduced me to Logo. Did something else in college, but then got a graduate degree in information science (which isn't actually about programming, even though most people think it is). What helped me get hired the most, I suspect, is that while I was in grad school, I worked as a research assistant, and I told the professors I was working for that I knew how to program, so they had me write some data-analysis code for them. This let me put a programming gig on my resume. 

So to answer your question of ""how much self-teaching,"" it was about 18 years in my case, but I wouldn't read too much into that. 

I'll echo what other people said: make stuff. Make websites or other programs. That's the best way to learn to program (imo), and it's also going to help your chances of getting an interview or getting a client to consider you for a freelance job. ",eliah,t2_328t9,1,0,reddit2

People lose faith. You know what, I'm all for it, restructuring. But to blame just the general system and the rich and elite when all they've done is intelligently made the system work for them... I don't know if that's right to. Ya know? At this point all everyone does is point and blame... For example.. I've had my candid and harsh conversations with my dad about why he would never vote democrat or consider a more socialistic view. He says ""because in that system your roofs are much lower for more people than they are in this system where I want my kids to be able to have everything"" - this is the ideal behind why they do what they do. A legacy. It's old fashioned, and will not last once they are gone.

Honestly, I propose education. In another thread we were discussing that education is the damn near most important thing to invest in. Logic, economics, programming, technology, math, art. That's how we overcome this commonality of those who are weaker not able to put themselves up. For example, if I hadn't been born into the family I was born into, ii'd likely be on my own doing stupid shit. I got lucky I had the support I did. I had a chance because I was put in classes that kept my mind busy. If We at least give people the tools, and a chance. then we can probably find a better way. But as it is now, both sides yelling at each other now for their extreme to be the only accepted way.. Nothing will be accomplished.

d6u476r,t1_d6u2oyx,2016-08-24 01:49:13,TwoXChromosomes,">Right, so why do companies ""move factories thousands of miles across an ocean"" and use ""untested workers"" instead of keeping everything the way it was? Because they stand to make profit. At the cost of the income of workers they would otherwise hire in the original country. 

It's to get a competitive advantage. If you can make a similar item to your competitors but charge significantly less due to labor savings, you win. That ends up meaning higher profits, but also the consumer wins with cheaper goods.

>Sure, I'll concede the point that some wealth are being distributed to the developing country, but those wealth comes from the working class of the developed country and only a small portion of it. The majority of the portion goes to the profit the company stands to make thanks to this move, which then filters to the pocket of the wealthy company owners.

Right, most of the money is staying in Western multi-nationals, with higher wages going to their engineers, developers, management, sales teams, marketers, and other high skilled Western workers whose wages have grown considerably. It's not just the 1%, it's more like the upper 21%.

>And who's to say that they give decent wage to those people on the developing countries? Companies goals are to make as big a profit as possible. It's plausible that the wage they offer are lower than the market standard in the developing country and people are just so desperate for job that they will take whatever is available. I used to live in Indonesia. The rate of employment there is through the roof that I would be surprise if that isn't the case.

The wages are higher because average incomes have grown quickly and steadily. Indonesia is still a low income country, but more because of socialist style government then ""greedy corporations"". Indonesia has massive fuel and electricity subsidies which wreck the budget. Indonesia has tons of red tape when it comes to starting small businesses, but luckily it's new market oriented government has cut back on them. The economy is still riddled with inefficiencies, making it one of the slowlest growing economies in the region.

>You mentioned how China moved from being a poor country to middle income country due to increase in their income. I think that's not so much through companies moving their production to China but more as a result of Chinese companies being able to copy and reproduce technologies at much lower cost, thus undercutting the price of these technologies and giving them a fair chunk of the market. This means profits that the big companies from the developed countries would otherwise make are going to Chinese companies, which some then filtered through to their workers. I think companies moving their production overseas is the response to this (so they can cut down on their price) and the distribution of wealth is just an (un)happy coincidence. Plus, as I've mentioned above, a big portion of the distribution goes to the already wealthy anyway...

[Economic data on China](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/china/wages). In the last 10 years, the average wage has tripled. You cannot handwave away those gains, they are real. China went from a small time manufacturer of cheap plastics and clothing to a major manufacturer of advanced electronics and an internet giant in my short life time. This is all because the government loosened up the reigns on the free market, focused on building infrastructure and educating the masses, and let them trade internationally. When China was focused on income redistribution and sticking it to the 1%, blood ran in the streets and people starved. I implore you, learn about recent history, and all the harm economic justice and socialism have caused in the world, and all the good capitalism and free markets have made. They aren't perfect, and many people fall behind, but the good has greatly outweighed the bad.",,,1,0,reddit2

To suggest that in the entire world, the talent to be CEO is so scarce that you have to compensate them so generously and no one else but they could do it is ridiculous. Also, CEO performance is very hard to monitor and if anything, the company's success is largely due to it's workforce, not a single person at the very top. With this being said, CEOs are hardly worth the millions paid every year. Do you think if a CEO job paid 1 million that no one would want it?

d6sdhi9,t1_d6scqm5,2016-08-22 21:05:13,TwoXChromosomes,"Reclaims would I suppose refer to offshore tax avoidance shelters. Arguably, though, most corporations are paying less taxes than the intent of the law would require, so in some sense at least a portion of that money is owed to the government. 

These companies can all afford to pay higher tax rates and the benefits of government investment are real. These companies are already not investing that money into vehicles that create jobs, and even with a few-percent-higher corporate tax rate, there would still be huge profit incentive. 

You really think a company like Apple, when faced with the prospect of losing $3/ unit to taxes on iPhones, is going to stop selling iPhones? That if Exxon had to pay an extra 3% in taxes out of their hundreds of billions of profit that they would go out of business? That oil would stop being profitable if we closed tax loopholes? 

I'm not saying the government takes the $800B sitting on Apple's balance sheet. I'm saying that taxes could be raised to the point where the increased revenue for the government would be significant without eliminating profit motive for these companies. If big business isn't going to invest in American jobs or infrastructure (which by and large they aren't), then the government should be doing it, and taxes on the most profitable corporations and most wealthy individuals (plus, imo, cuts to the DoD) should be what pays for it. 

Taxes are lower and profits higher than ever before. If, back when taxes were higher and profits lower, these companies still existed and made money, why would we assume that they would all shut down en masse just because taxes were raised? ",like_a_robot_in_heat,t2_y2wha,1,0,reddit2

Education is extraordinarily important and only serves to benefit society as a whole. It doesn't have to be traditional school +college/grad school/etc. Though that is great too. Learning a skill can be extremely rewarding on both a personal and professional level. 

I'm at a sort of crossroads right now where I need to decide *soon* what it is that I am going to try to do with my life. I had one career lined up that I went to school for and was prepared to spend a very long time doing- then my health happened and I'm no longer able to do it.

How will I afford it and who will take care of my kids while I go off to classes/training? 

There are already some resources in place for people like me. But it's possible to fall between the cracks right now when it comes to financial aid for education and childcare. You can be pretty poor and still not poor enough to qualify for government assistance, as I have learned the hard way in the past. 

I see a lot of people around me, a lot of my friends from when I was a kid, who are stuck the same way. But they have an even lower skill set than I do and they seem to have no idea how to fix it or what they would even want to do with themselves.

>That ends up meaning higher profits, but also the consumer wins with cheaper goods.

Cheaper goods are great but not if you're one of the unlucky people whose job just went overseas. You can't buy goods if you don't have an income.

>Right, most of the money is staying in Western multi-nationals, with higher wages going to their engineers, developers, management, sales teams, marketers, and other high skilled Western workers whose wages have grown considerably. It's not just the 1%, it's more like the upper 21%.

What about the lower 79% then? Too bad for them? They're probably the ones that need that wealth distribution more than the top 21%. And that's still a minority profiting while the majority goes without.

>The wages are higher because average incomes have grown quickly and steadily.

This could be due to other economic factors. Doesn't mean the big Western companies are the ones driving the wage up. Also doesn't mean that these Western companies aren't paying below average for their workers either.

>Indonesia is still a low income country, but more because of socialist style government then ""greedy corporations"".

What do you mean by socialist style government? I thought Indonesia is a republic and has adopted capitalist ideology since Soeharto came into power back in 1966. And ""greedy corporation""? Everyone is greedy in Indonesia! You can't get anywhere without having to grease someone there. The level of corruption is freaking insane! KKN - Korupsi, Kolusi, Nepotisme. And racism!!! But that's a rant for another day.

>Indonesia has tons of red tape when it comes to starting small businesses

What do you mean by small business? I saw a lot of small shops/food stands on sidewalk everywhere back when I was living there. My grandparents raised funds for their two children to go to University by selling noodles on the street when the school they were teaching at were closed down by the government.

Also, my comment on Indonesia was with regards to how unemployment rate is so high in some of these developing countries that big companies can pay their workers really low and they will still find people who takes the job anyway. According to that link you posted, there are still thousands of unemployed people in China who would take these low paying jobs.

I'll take your word and point that free market is a good thing for China's economy. But my point is that the increase in economy is probably more due to the changes and decisions made by Chinese companies following the free market agreement and the market they gain by selling cheaper goods in developed countries, and less by the jobs created by big Western companies that moved their production to China. Therefore, the wealth distribution in the developed countries have probably gone more to the top 21% than to the people in the developing countries.

Maybe the solution is to prohibit outsourcing work to other countries while still opening the market for import and export of goods?

I want everyone to realize that I believe the current bonus and pay structure of top level executives is insane.  But what you guys dont realize is that its not about paying someone who is actually good at something, its all about paying someone who is perceived to be great at being a CEO.  That makes the company's stock price jump 3% which could be a $300,000,000 spike in value or more.  That makes paying someone $20,000,000 not seem so crazy, at least financially.

The workers do nothing without leadership.  Without the leadership they have no factory, no design shop, no IT department.  1 missing worker everything still gets done.  1 missing CEO and everything may get done for awhile, but eventually it will all fall apart.  Decisions need to be made somewhere.  I assure you no CEO makes more than the entirety of his work force.  Thats where the value comes in.  1 worker might up efficiency of a factory by .001% but a CEO could, in theory, up efficiency but 10% just by bringing new knowledge of a new philosophy to the game.

>Cheaper goods are great but not if you're one of the unlucky people whose job just went overseas. You can't buy goods if you don't have an income.

That's true, competition hurts. But I think outsourcing is caused by economic reality. In the same way a wolf eating a deer is not ""greedy"" or ""evil"", just nature, jobs move to overseas to better business environments, leaving some people behind.

>What about the lower 79% then? Too bad for them? They're probably the ones that need that wealth distribution more than the top 21%. And that's still a minority profiting while the majority goes without.

So in the US, much like the rest of the West, you have roughly a bottom 30% working/lower class, about 50% middle class, and 20% or so upper/professional class. The middle class is shrinking, but you actually have more people moving up then down. Those in the middle class are generally fine but stagnant, the upper class is doing great, and the lower class is struggling.

So, the people doing really well are a pretty small minority, and yes that's a problem. But the cause is fairly complicated. Because of all the new technologies that have become mainstream in the last 20 or so years, those whose jobs are complimented by technology have had enormous productivity growth. That's made these jobs incredibly valuable, so almost all of wage growth has gone to these people, and in economics it's called ""exclusive growth"", in that growth is focused on a small part of society. So, along with outsourcing/automation of lower skilled jobs, you have middle class and lower class wages squeezed from both the bottom and the top. It ends up being a really sticky problem, but if the solution is to punish corporations and the most productive members of society, all that really does is crush growth and cause recessions and depressions, which hurt everybody.

They make noises that they are going towards capitalism but the reality is there isn't much movement. You have big subsidies of electricity and fuel, which hold down free markets and gut the federal budget. There is also a lot of government bureaucracy that makes it really hard to start businesses and invest in the country without paying bribes and so on.

>What do you mean by small business? I saw a lot of small shops/food stands on sidewalk everywhere back when I was living there. My grandparents raised funds for their two children to go to University by selling noodles on the street when the school they were teaching at were closed down by the government.

So you have really tiny shops that are under the radar, but to start a small business that is bigger then one or two employees you need to pay a lot of bribes to get the paper work processed.

>Also, my comment on Indonesia was with regards to how unemployment rate is so high in some of these developing countries that big companies can pay their workers really low and they will still find people who takes the job anyway. According to that link you posted, there are still thousands of unemployed people in China who would take these low paying jobs.

Yeah, the same thing happens every where in the world, but the job market is a just like any other market. If a job is paying almost nothing, another company can easily scalp their best employees by offering a little more money. As the economy gets better, companies have to pay more money if they want to keep their employees, and that's evident in China. A lot of Western nations also have minimum wages set fairly high, which also helps protect lower class workers.

>I'll take your word and point that free market is a good thing for China's economy. But my point is that the increase in economy is probably more due to the changes and decisions made by Chinese companies following the free market agreement and the market they gain by selling cheaper goods in developed countries, and less by the jobs created by big Western companies that moved their production to China. Therefore, the wealth distribution in the developed countries have probably gone more to the top 21% than to the people in the developing countries.

Most production in China is for Western companies, but the country has gone so far in it's development that they actually have a pretty unique consumer market with some really cool internet apps and retail websites. Has more money gone to the top 21% of the West then the developing world? I don't really know the answer to that, I don't think so since the Chinese economy has grown so much more quickly then the economies of Europe and North America, but maybe it's possible.

>Maybe the solution is to prohibit outsourcing work to other countries while still opening the market for import and export of goods? I think, until the cost of living across every country around the world is the same, doing otherwise could really hurt the working class people in the countries with higher cost of living.

That would be kind of impossible to keep track of I think. So going back to my example of Apple; they closed down their factories in the US and started paying a Chinese company, Foxconn, to build their devices. Would the US government refuse to allow them to close the factory? What if that caused the company to go out of business, would they be allowed to close their factories if they went bankrupt? What if companies declared bankruptcy, closed their factories, then started a new company doing the exact same thing but with factories overseas? Would you block that somehow?

The devil is in the details, and it's why government is so bad at micro managing economies.

Economics is a lot like Evolution; the strong are successful, the weak go out of business. It is really uncomfortable to look at it that way because then the working class are ""the weak"", the way to fight that is to increase social mobility. The government needs to fund a strong safety net and good education programs, from preschool all the way to university. Everyone at least needs a fair shot to get ahead in life. But still, people need to earn it. If you just take money from those who worked really hard and became successful and give it to those who are not successful because they are upset or angry, the system doesn't really make sense anymore.

While I agree that outsourcing is an economic reality, I disagree with your comparison of wolf eating a deer. Wolf eats a deer because it needs to survive. The companies that outsourced to developing countries are big companies who are already surviving well and don't really need to make the move. 

A lot of companies sell their product at higher rate and are still successful due to their branding and the higher quality goods they produce. For example, fashion brands, such as Prada, could make a bag that other 'lower' brand, such as Michael Kors, could emulate at much cheaper price. People with money would still buy the Prada version due to its branding. I think Apple, for example, would also have people who buy their products because of their branding. So I don't think the decision to move overseas is all about survival, which is why it can be viewed as greedy.

This seems to assume that people who are in the working & middle class are not as productive as those in the upper class. But I've read that some people in the US could hold multiple full-time jobs, work incredibly long hours and still wouldn't be able to make ends meet. Aren't these people as productive as those in the upper class? Why is it ok to punish these people by giving their job and source of income away?

Also, I don't know what exact punishment you mean for the corporations & upper class that would cause recession and depression. I'm assuming (and correct me if I'm wrong) that you're referring to taxation? I did a quick read/search on US personal income taxation history and looks like the tax was a lot lower (24%) when the Great Depression happened and jumped up to 63% all the way to 94% afterwards, which is when an economic growth occurred.

A lot of businesses are privately owned and not controlled by the government, big and small. My uncle owns a very successful wig making business that exports overseas to Germany, my aunt worked for a privately owned cement mixture company and my dad worked for another privately owned real estate/construction company. Those are big businesses that are not owned by the government. If you're referring to how the fuel and electricity are controlled by the government as being the reason that Indonesia has a socialist government then, I don't know what to say. Those are necessities of life that, should they be given to private companies to manage, could become even more expensive than it currently is. Maybe even to the point that the poorer member of society won't even be able to afford them. And then we'll have a repeat of the May 1998 riot...

Also, what about Australian government then with Medicare and other social services that the government operates. Would that make Australian government a socialist government? And even with those thing subsidised by the government, Australian economy is holding up quite well.

If a job is paying almost nothing, another company can easily scalp their best employees by offering a little more money. As the economy gets better, companies have to pay more money if they want to keep their employees, and that's evident in China. A lot of Western nations also have minimum wages set fairly high, which also helps protect lower class workers.

When we're talking about the jobs being taken by the unemployed in developing country, I was thinking of low skill jobs that needs very little training and/or education. I'm not thinking of managerial job or anything that requires career progression, skills or experience to do. I can't imagine being head hunted as factory workers. And if other factories are offering higher salary then, sure, the workers could move there but there will be other people desperate enough to take your lower paying job anyway. And those other factories will be losing on the market for having to have their products priced higher to compensate for the higher salary anyway, right?

Regarding the minimum wage, well, looks like this minimum wage is part of the reason why working class people on Western countries are losing their job overseas, so, I don't know how well protected the working class are...

>Has more money gone to the top 21% of the West then the developing world? I don't really know the answer to that, I don't think so since the Chinese economy has grown so much more quickly then the economies of Europe and North America, but maybe it's possible.

I think Chinese economy has grown more quickly because it wasn't much to begin with. If you were to spend $100,000 to renovate a house that's worth $150,000, you'd see a massive improvement. Versus spending the same amount in a $1M house, you'd probably won't see a thing. A huge exaggeration, I know, but you get my point.

>That would be kind of impossible to keep track of I think. So going back to my example of Apple; they closed down their factories in the US and started paying a Chinese company, Foxconn, to build their devices. Would the US government refuse to allow them to close the factory? What if that caused the company to go out of business, would they be allowed to close their factories if they went bankrupt? What if companies declared bankruptcy, closed their factories, then started a new company doing the exact same thing but with factories overseas? Would you block that somehow?
The devil is in the details, and it's why government is so bad at micro managing economies.

I agree that this is definitely not an easy thing to regulate. Which is why I'm not in government! Hahah And, really, if the cost of living around the world are the same, then this wouldn't even be a problem...

>Economics is a lot like Evolution; the strong are successful, the weak go out of business. It is really uncomfortable to look at it that way because then the working class are ""the weak"", the way to fight that is to increase social mobility. The government needs to fund a strong safety net and good education programs, from preschool all the way to university. Everyone at least needs a fair shot to get ahead in life. But still, people need to earn it. If you just take money from those who worked really hard and became successful and give it to those who are not successful because they are upset or angry, the system doesn't really make sense anymore.

I don't think it's a matter of just getting educated though. I know a lot of companies have outsourced jobs that requires a degree to do, such as accounting. In that case, it wouldn't matter if you have studied and gained a degree in accounting if all the accounting jobs are moved overseas =/ I know that, at the moment, majority of jobs that have been outsourced are more menial, factory jobs but what's stopping these big corporations from outsourcing other higher up jobs overseas until only the Directors are still situated in the original country? I don't think it's as easy as a matter of working/studying to earn a better life either. I have a friend with a Civil Engineering degree that's working as a cashier at a supermarket. He has been looking for years and the longer he looked and not succeed, the worse his resume looks... 

Also, working class people aren't necessarily lazy but if the jobs they could apply for are being given overseas then it doesn't give them a chance to work in the first place, no? Maybe some are really hard working but are simply not able to work due to the lack of available jobs. And when these people are jobless and homeless and angry at the system that seems designed to keep them from living, well... I was living in Jakarta during the May 1998 riot.

>This seems to assume that people who are in the working & middle class are not as productive as those in the upper class. But I've read that some people in the US could hold multiple full-time jobs, work incredibly long hours and still wouldn't be able to make ends meet. Aren't these people as productive as those in the upper class? Why is it ok to punish these people by giving their job and source of income away?

Productivity is how much wealth you create, not how hard you work. Compare a subsistence farmer in Indonesia to an industrial farmer in the US. The subsistence farmer has a tiny plot of land, worked by hand. They work extremely hard, but only produce a tiny amount of food. The farmer in the US will mostly work on the business end; they will monitor their machines, look at spreadsheets to analyze productivity, and talk to customers. The US farmer isn't really working harder, and may actually have a much easier job. However, they will produce thousands or even millions of times the amount of food for their work, so they are more productive.

Low wage workers are less productive, that is simply how it is. Should a farmer who produces only 100 lbs of corn make the same money as the one who produces 1 million lbs of corn simply because they worked very hard?

>what about Australian government then with Medicare and other social services that the government operates. Would that make Australian government a socialist government? And even with those thing subsidised by the government, Australian economy is holding up quite well.

All countries have a mix of free markets and government control. North Korea, the most socialist country, has a pretty large and complicated black market trade that operates like a completely free market. The most free countries tend to have lots of government control, like in the US for example you have social security, taxes, minimum wage, millions of business regulations, and so on. I'm not saying that government control is necessarily bad, but I am saying that letting people be free with their own property generally works better and is more fair then taking property away from people and redistributing it in the way that the government thinks is fair.

In all reality, that is essentially what taxes are. The government requires you to hand over some of your property to pay for common goods. If it's something like police forces, a military, education, roads, and so on this makes sense. If it simply that people feel that the rich are ""too greedy"" then it becomes less fair.

>I don't think it's a matter of just getting educated though. I know a lot of companies have outsourced jobs that requires a degree to do, such as accounting.

He has been looking for years and the longer he looked and not succeed, the worse his resume looks... 

What kind of grades did he have? Did he get an internship in college? Was he looking at jobs that required moving? I'm not in the loop when it comes to civil engineering, but I have a lot of friends in other engineering disciplines and they got jobs very easily after college. I studied Math and History and found work very easily. I never had an internship but my grades were good.

The reality is, the US does not have a shortage of jobs. There may be a shortage in the area where you live, but the great thing about living in a free, huge, and open country is you can move wherever the jobs are.

Race riots are horrible, and so often people fight over race when problems are economic. Just look at Trump, he's blaming the Chinese and Mexicans on so many of our problems. I don't think working class people are lazy, I grew up working class in a very poor family and I saw how hard my mom had to work to stay afloat. Usually the problems in working class families are bad parenting, bad schools, and just an all around bad environment. It's 100% not their fault, they were just born in a bad spot. That's why I think the least the government can do is make sure that everyone has a good school to go to when they are kids.",,,1,0,reddit2

noun
a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.
""capitalism and democracy are ascendant in the third world""
synonyms:	representative government, elective government; More
a state governed by a democracy.
plural noun: democracies
""a multiparty democracy""
control of an organization or group by the majority of its members.
""the intended extension of industrial democracy""

you need to learn that democracy means that the government is elected by the people.  Not that there is no private property and that the means of production are owned by the state.  Socialism and democracy can go hand in hand, but one is not inherently required for the other to exist.

You made zero valid points.  and you still havent.  Economies and governments can be mixed and matched, but only some work in the long run.  Socialist governments do not last, they become overly corrupt because the people do not believe in socialism.  The people desire the fruits of their labor, not to support strangers who they perceive as not producing the same quality or amount of work as they produce themselves.  People want to make their lives better than those around them.  They compete, they strive and they sometimes fail and none of that is compatible with pure socialism.

I messed my neck up last March, and after a bunch of health insurance garbage I finally had surgery in November. Other than the 2 weeks directly following surgery, my 3 year old has been staying home everyday with me. 
We’ve potty trained, learned the alphabet (can say without singing the song even!) painted an entire room in our basement with her art, can count to 59 (sixty gives her trouble for some reason) and countless other things. 

I say all of that for two reasons. First, you can not control when a health issue or illness will force one parent or another to step up as the “primary” for a day or a year, shit happens. Second, I FUCKING LOVE staying home with my daughter. She is learning far more from me than daycare, we do all kinds of cool activities and adventures, we tell stories (imagination, not the same old books) and lots of other things. It does not matter whether you are the dad or mom, your 1 of 2 parents. Anyone that tries to tell you that a mom is the primary caregiver is a fucking moron. If it works for you, and the kid is well taken care of, then you are doing your duty as a parent. I seriously want to fight your coworker, but I’m a male and wouldn’t lay a hand on a female. Introduce me to her husband and i bet we can figure out why she thinks men shouldn’t parent... (he’s either beaten down mentally by a tough woman, or he’s worthless.)

Either way, fuck her, good for you husband for being a dad, and good for you!!

Edit - to dispel a few other sexist worn out tropes - I do 90% of the cooking, even when working (I love cooking) I clean because I know my wife gets anxious if my kid and I make a mess and I don’t like her being stressed out. I also do most of the grocery shopping, again even when I am healthy and working, and I will be doing most of the activities as she grows up. I have wanted to be a husband and dad for as long as I can remember. I love my wife, and I love my kid. Any couple who can find a balance for that is great.

I raised my son & daughter for all but 2-years fo their life.

Those 2-years my ex got involve with an ex-con who had beaten a kid to death for tossing a handful of gravel at him. He'd spent 14-years in prison, she took my kids on the run with her.

Now understand I was the caregiver, we had them while I was in the Army.  I got up @ 5AM, I was the NCOIC of the YPG Calibration Lab, it was 5-miles to work, I rode a bike most days.  I did  it in 18-min once, iirc, because of coyotes. anyway I went into work early because ia unlock all the buildings in our set.  I also got up with our kids in the night toe feed & cloth.

I hadn't owned a TV before I was married, she had me get one, at YPG she did nothing but watch TV.

2-week after leaving the army & getting home she left me for a former boyfriend, it was my 1st shift back at the glass plant I had left when I went into the army.

She would come home early in the morning to tell me she loved the other guy & was leaving. we went to sleep. When we woke up, I immediate took her downstairs to talk to her parents.

I explained the situation to her parents, she interrupt me to say she hadn't said she was leaving me, and I told her she said that when she stated she loved the other guy.

When we separated, she left the kids with me.  She wanted to ""get her head together"", that was fine with me.

I live in Indiana and at that time it took 60-days to get a divorce, she took 8-months and then it was only because I said you need to file or I am and for the kids as well. she filed within a short time, taking the kids.  All of this time her, turning into someone I had literally never met.

Then she took the kids & went on the run with kids & him whom local, state & federal authorities considered armed & dangerous,.

I was a pallbearer at her mother's funeral, she was told not to come  if she was with him, yes, they were on the run then, she came, with him but he stay at a good distance.

Her family kept me informed, they kept me abreast of things & they reported her movement to law enforcement.

She would finally call me up asking me to come & pick p the kids, she'd seen armed officers search close to their location.  I was in Bloomington, IN, she was in Jacksonville, FL

I sold everything I owned & electronic equipment a friend had bought me to try to give me a leg up in my own business. My 400 albums, outside of my kids, music being the love of my life.

So I sold it all & bought tickets to meet her and pick up my kids at the Jacksonville Airport.  She didn't know I was going to have her sight custody papers & she was shocked that I did.

I would give her 6-months of not paying any support for the, I think 200 but it could have  been as high as 600. I'd asked for time when she dumped all of our debt on me at the divorce.

I had no intention of ever pressing the issue if she just loved the kids and we all went down our roads.  Nope, too much to wish for.

I had set it up so she only had to pay $15/child x2 /week, #30/wk for 2-kids, no other considerations, medical, dental, I kept all of that. She would to fall $7,000 behind, when she died in 2018, she still owed me \~4,000 of it. Somewhere along there I did buck it up to 17.50/child & half the peripheral med, etc cost.

I had my daughter's 5th grade teacher call me in to talk to me after class w/o my daughter.

She had one of my daughters notebooks with her.  She said something I forget due to the shock of opening it and page after page was my daughter writing ""I love my mommy, my mommy loves me"" repeatedly line after line, page after page.

She used to write to her, telling her how pretty she looked and then would go on to say, if you lived with me, you'd be pretty all the time.

another told her she knew she was happy with me but she'd be happier if she lived with her.

Several more along that line.

Eventually she would return home, try to get back with me, i told her to get a job , a place and learn who she was.  Must have been too much as a few days later she called to say she was engaged.

I had her held in contempt for non payment 4x & they never showed her what a jail cell even looked like.

I'm a very passionate and emotionally so when I speak of something i really care about and I've never really gotten a handle on it.  It is from a childhood with a brother who was a compulsive liar, why  lying is my hot button issue, and parents who believe, firmly that children should be seen & not heard which include any questions. A father who dotted on his 1st born son and only attended to me when it made him look good. I was the one to be ridiculed as he taught my brother whatever, and never spoke to me about his skills, despite my watching him to try to pick them up, I've learned moves that I know on my own.

this all went on for \~12-years, \~2X a year.

I would be charged with every despicable crime you can imagine a day with a son & daughter doing, 2x having CPS remove them from me, then chagrined & embarrassed would profusely apologise to me, always the ""our hand are tied"" etc..

She did this while telling everyone I was doing a good job.

During a continuance of one of the contempt proceedings she sued me for custody, I couldn't afford us a phone at time time so I used my phone card at a payphone while it snowed.  I asked her why, why when she is knows I take good care of the kids she is doing it.

While never admitting it, on all lives I hold dear she said

It was the only thing I could do to stop from paying you support.

When I asked how she expected to raise them if she couldn't afford $30/wk she said I could pay her support then she could afford to do that. Never been a rich guy folks, just a working slob. I worked for an office supply store as a copier repairman at that time.

This was in the late 90s/early 00s. His ex wife walked and didn’t even contact them for six months. 

He used to hate women treating him like a leper at school pick up, generally being made to feel like a creep if he made light conversation. 

The kids eventually wanted to live with their mother- she bribed them with cash, and other things he couldn’t afford at the time. 

He was still an active co parent and more likely to take the day off when they were sick. 

He’s the most nurturing person I know. He’s more empathetic when we’re sick, he likes to clean more than I do, and does it well. 

He’s also this muscular, fit 50 something dude. 

He gets so angry when people discount the father’s role in their kid’s lives. He cared for his kids solo many times before she left because of her work. He’s more than capable. 

Sweetly enough, I see that he’s passed on a lot of these traits to my own son, and I couldn’t be more proud.",InadmissibleHug,t2_jybip8i,4,0,reddit3

It's something I don't like about any of these conversations when it comes up. ""As a [demographic],"" as if it gives you authority on the matter. Yes, it may indicate some experience, but experience doesn't mean anything unless you can make something of it. 

The best example to provide a counterargument to using ""As a [demographic]"" in a discussion is how you would respond if a scientist tried to sell you the same schtick. ""As a scientist, I can tell you that [X,Y,Z]"".

Do we know what it is that makes scientists generally reliable sources of information?

Evidence.

I don't listen to a woman's perspective more because they're a woman, and I don't take a man's views on misogyny or sexual harassment less because they're a male. A lot of the time, as on this subreddit, there is relevant anecdotal *evidence* that can help a lot with explaining why someone's views are the way they are.

But if I'm doing things 'correctly', I can adopt someone else's viewpoint or understanding or perspective somewhat effectively, and then it doesn't matter who *I* am. I am learning from other people's experiences.

But a lot of people really, *really* don't like my logic with this at all. Kinda understandably, considering it basically says ""You as a person do not matter in this conversation."" Which is, basically, pretty accurate. If it's a debate, anyway, I care much more for the facts, logic, and reason behind something. Who you are has no bearing on it. You're not ""more right"" just because you're of a certain nationality, skin colour, gender, or sexual orientation.

With that said, about your friend:

> I had a former friend who used to make sexist and sex jokes when she was the only woman around in order to fit with the boys.

Is there more to her behaviour that indicates sexism? Because offensive jokes are not what I use as a generally effective qualifier to deem someone -ist or -phobic. Dark and ""naughty"" humour can be really fun, and if she does it around the boys, maybe she's just being socially aware so as to not offend other ladies?

I'm not trying to say that you're wrong about her. Just that based off of what you said alone I would struggle to call her misogynistic.",Sita093016,t2_15o4v3,-2,0,reddit3

She always told me to be a medical transcriptionist so I could work from home and have flexible hours. You know, so I could still take care of the home and children. I’m glad I didn’t take her advice because I’m in my 30s now and childfree. So good thing I didn’t plan my entire life around my non-existent babies. My sister on the other hand does have kids. And she doesn’t talk to our mom anymore because she got tired of the mom shaming over sending her kids to one of the best daycares in the city while she works as a CPA. And her kids are turning out great. They’re currently learning Spanish and Chinese, and the oldest is now in kindergarten.

I can’t be too mad because my sister and I are both successful in large part to spite our mom. We learned from an early age that we would have to fight for what we wanted, so we were ready to work hard and compete to earn our place.

But he’s just stuck backwards and violent, so for a very long time she had to both have a career and take care of his sorry ass and us 4 kids. He was basically just a giant violent child that couldn’t be disciplined like the rest of us. But eventually something clicked and things changed a bit. She’d rather him be out all night bothering other women than bothering her... why won’t she just divorce him already? He’s not even home often. He barely lives there. 

So I strived to have the relationship my mom wanted but couldn’t get. I learned to be stubborn and work hard and not take shit from others from her, after she started standing up for herself and setting boundaries. With my husband, I got it made in the shade. He’s very supportive, does chores and cares for the baby while I focus on establishing myself in my new career. He says he’d much rather be a stay at home dad, we’re just not there yet financially. 

And this kid I married was the kind who was never taught how to mop or do laundry. Turns out, after he learned how (unwilling at first, but encouraged with lots of bacon and steak) he likes it. I’m sure the bacon and steak must have made the memories of cleaning pleasant, encouraging happy feeling with doing chores by association. I might have brainwashed him...

fggp4eo,t1_fggjp7z,2020-02-03 21:48:24,TwoXChromosomes,"> I wouldnt let the burden of supplying for the household fall on her.

What if she was worn out of the 24 hour burden of running the household, taking care of the kids, keeping the house clean, etc? What if she wanted to go back part time, even if the childcare cancelled it out monetarily, for her sanity? It sounds like (from the limited info here of course) you are gone half the week working crazy hours, but then you aren't helping with the household when you are there. When is her weekend? If you did need money wouldn't it make more sense to let her get a part time job and interact with other actual adults instead of you working on your days off, the only time your kids get to see you?

The hours and mental strain of staying at home are much higher than people think. Relationships absolutely are predicated on the expectations of the partners, but people change, and the relationship should be open to change as well. You say you didn't marry her so she could work and if she were to work many hours outside the home, you would divorce her, even though she worked a job she enjoyed in the past. What if you were to become disabled? What if she were?

I can understand why you don't see this as sexist. But the way you express your arrangement comes off as very problematic.

One thing that isnt being considered fairly here is that people may be assuming i live in America or even in a town , when i dont. I live in on a semi remote island. Childcare isnt an option but it ia not required either. Neihbours come and go as they please any day of the week and all our township works together with child raising. So my wife has plenty contact with adults and help with the kids. The house also has very little work for her to do day to day. Cleaned once a week , dishes and cooking and some laundry.  The main job is keeping  the fires lit and coal in the skuttles as we dont have a boiler or heating system. And some of the crofter neihbours are always availble for help moving coal and fire wood and often drop off meat and fish.

As to if i get injured or worse , disabled , which of course is somewhat likely as my jobs are exceedingly dangerous, i am very very well insured for all eventualities , tempory illness resulting in lossed earnings , permenant disability and death. 

Of course the divorce comment was an exaggeration,  but the truth of the matter is that i know as fact she wouldnt ever work those hours and i knew so when i married her , and in fact those hour's would be completly illegal to be asked to do as an employee so its irelevant. 40 would be her maximum. Also it would never make sense for her to take a job to make money as i can make a month of her old full time wages in a couple days.

fgh3d0j,t1_fgh24q6,2020-02-04 00:22:05,TwoXChromosomes,"Nope. It's called context and knowing your audience. There are times when it is okay to and times when it's inappropriate. Just like many things in life.

You don't have to be fragile to disapprove or dislike a naughty joke, especially if it is somehow specifically relevant to you, like targeting age, gender, or anything else. But I would say you are being fragile if you associate every telling of a naughty joke as being a real example of reprehensible behaviour.

Some tellings are, but definitely not all. I'm not sexist for taking the piss out of male lust.

Heck, just look at anyone who makes self-deprecating jokes. I'm short, taking the mick out of that doesn't mean I actually dislike short people or something. Neither does jokingly identifying as a sheep shagger because I'm Welsh.

Someone who has already demonstrated irrational prejudice or bigotry is someone whose naughty jokes I'd find a lot more suspect of being actually malicious. But a few people having lighthearted banter and *knowing* that none of them mean it? Nothing wrong with that.

Especially with your job; i misread/remembered your schedule, and that makes a big difference too. My ex was a long haul trucker living in a tiny town. My friend live in the country and he had to do two 2 weeks in another state and then a weekend off. So I have at least an idea of how That affects things. That lifestyle makes individual jobs more important because there is no option. You can't just let the fire for heat go out and let your partner deal with it layer. You can't help with the household because you literally aren't there.

Congrats on the boat!! That will really change things! 

I have no problem with traditionally gendered relationship situations, though I know a lot of people who do. The important thing is communication and respect. I learned about a thing called a relationship agreement. You basically outline together how you both agree the relationship will work. Money, chores, religion, parenting styles, etc. Print and sign. Then you revisit when someone wants to, there's a majorlife change, or every few years. My husband and I need to update ours, but it will always include that he can't put pepper in my eggs and I can't tickle him. 

Also, to avoid being misunderstood I would recommend to not say that you won't let your wife do something as that sounds like her input is not needed or wanted. And the way you discussed why you married her makes it sound like you were hiring rather than marrying.",JillStinkEye,t2_wohlv,1,0,reddit3

Remember, in order to be the best mom, you have to take care of yourself first, so you can be at your best to take care of your kid(s). If that means getting a job, so be it. Your kid will learn valuable socialization skills in daycare!

I'm not a mom yet, but this sounds like me too. I cannot imagine ""only"" being a mom, the SAHM life just isn't for me. But I was raised by a SAHM and am a bit lacking in resources/role models for how to make the career + kids work (especially because my commute is 1:30 min via train; if I drive its 60 min in the morning, 1:15-1:45 in the evening depending on traffic and how early I leave)

You can be a working mom and STILL be a fantastic mom.  You can also be a stay at home mom and STILL be a fantastic mom.

It isn’t having a paid job or not that matters.  It’s being HAPPY and having that spill over into all other aspects of your life.

My mom would NEVER have been happy as a stay at home mom.  My mother in law was a stay at home mom because that’s what women of her class and generation did.  But she was deeply unhappy because she was (and is) a deeply artistic, intelligent woman who enjoys social interaction, and she didn’t get that from being a stay at home mom.  And she became very depressed and now is an alcoholic (though she is in denial about that). 

Don’t let anyone tell you that you have to be a stay at home OR a working mom to be a good mom.  Be a happy mom.  That’s what makes good moms.",Courin,t2_cewdq,0,0,reddit4

I was hanging out with a couple of my cousins and their mother my aunt. I was over there to help get the house ready for a party as well as help build the bonfire out back but after we set up it was still a couple hours until people arrived so I started drinking early. I was reading a magazine that was talking about how important family is and I made a joke to my aunt and cousin that family is important because no one else is going to wipe your ass for you when you are sick or something.

Sure enough later that night I sat down on a log the wrong way and slipped and a big splinter managed to stick my left butt cheek pretty good. My aunt saw it happen and walked in with me to find a Band-Aid and some tweezers. After cleaning up I was using the mirrors to help try and prop my butt up on her counter (she cuts hair at her house) while looking in the mirror to pick out the splinter. Her and her drunk best friend got a huge kick out of this when they walked back in to grab some more drinks. 

I finally gave up and asked if she could use the tweezers and a safety pin to get the splinter out. I pull down my underwear and leaned over the edge of her big couch well she was able to get it. It was when she stuck the safety pin in me that my mind flashed back to what I had said earlier that night about family being important for situations just like this :)",opiburner,t2_14cepx,31,0,reddit4

That said, I've thought a lot about makeup/attire/looks, etc when it comes to work. My thoughts, as a manager, is it should be up to the employee to decide what is appropriate. The only time a company should interfere is if any of that is specifically required for the job function. Actors wearing specific makeup, airline pilots wearing uniforms to project professionalism, or security guards identifying themselves as security. Outside of those specific types of job requirements, I'd recommend you wear what makes you most comfortable. If makeup makes you uncomfortable, please do not wear it. 

As far as ""looking nice for whoever,"" Ex: the ""pretty"" receptionist. I find that ""role"" extremely unprofessional and extremely objectifying and extremely offensive. Not that I have a problem with someone who does their makeup or wears cloths that make them look/feel pretty. I have a problem with that being their role. A receptionists role is to get people where they need to go. Not to be objectified.

Back when my husband was in uni, there was a degree you could get in computers that combined programming and psych. I think it focuses on human-computer interactions.

My husband didn't end up doing that program because it was a BA and not BComp but the point is that there is potential there for a niche career that could be very valuable with the way the world is going. Do a bit of research on work prospects and salaries. It might be a worthwhile direction for you.

Psych is a brutal major for joining the workforce after school. I knew plenty of people, both sexes, who made that choice. I wasn't in psych but after everything I've been through, and seeing my husband's success as a programmer, I often wondered how life would turn out if I went into computers. I still might one day.

Anyhow, I know you're feeling jaded. But do see if you can make use of some of those credits or ""strategically pivot"". And keep up the coding. I wish you best of luck! This could end very lucratively for you if you open the right doors.",dontshootthemsngr,t2_1130vqch,177,0,reddit2

hpbn2tz,t1_hpbg3n8,2021-12-20 18:22:10,TwoXChromosomes,"I think that is rather dismissive. Research won’t tell you everything, and priorities change. 

I did research and talk to many teachers - but unfortunately I spoke to older teachers with years of experience on old pay scales. THEY get paid well and have a great WLB, that isn’t true for most of us. 

It’s also pretty hush hush that there’s salary freezes, lack of any year to year raises (including COL), or meaningful stipends. People will tell you “just coach” or “teach summer school” but no one tells you those are also terribly underpaid. I coached my first year and said never again after I only got $1000 pre-tax for the entire season. 

I was fine with the pay at first, I really was. I said hey I’ll never be rich but I can make it work because I love this job. But as inflation goes crazy and housing becomes more unaffordable - this isn’t sustainable. I have also found that all my extra work and effort (like completely changing and creating huge programs for my school and district) has resulted in nothing tangible for me, which is a terrible feeling.  

It wasn’t a big deal when I was 23 and had a bunch of passion for teaching. But after 4 years, working my tail off, and the way this pandemic has changed education - it isn’t worth it anymore. Which is why I am putting myself in the position to leave.",,,3,0,reddit2

hp5e11e,t1_hp59px8,2021-12-19 08:49:13,TwoXChromosomes,"*Some things you probably already know,* And some you might not:

* *HTML CSS and JavaScript are mostly for web development.* Usually the front end. Don't spend too much time with these if you don't want to do that kind of work, because the skills are not particularly transferable, especially for HTML and CSS.
* JavaScript jobs usually want you to also know some kind of library or 'framework' such as jQuery, React, Node, or Angular. Some with a steeper learning curve than others. Probably want to add at least one of these to your list if you're looking at going into webdev. React (via react native) is actually one good way to use JavaScript outside of webdev, because you can use it for multiplatform app development.
* *Python is good because it's quite forgiving, easy to learn, and has a lot of functionality for relatively little work.* For example, you can write an entire webserver in about 30 lines of code. It's also somewhat of a bad first language for these reasons. If you learn other languages first, then Python is easy. If you learn Python first, then other languages are harder. It also doesn't help that Python has some fairly strange syntax that's not usually transferrable to other languages, and can definitely leave you with bad habits.
* If you want to add a language to your list that's still pretty easy to learn, will give you a lot of transferable skills, and which has a long list of job opportunities when you're done, you can't go wring with Java. There's a reason it's one of the most common first languages in universities, and also the language the college board chose for the AP computer science curriculum.
* If you want to challenge yourself, learn a lot of good, transferrable skills, and also have great job prospects, you'll want to make C++ your first language. It's on the harder end of the spectrum, but will make learning other languages, including Java, significantly easier. I usually hang out in r/cpp_questions, and it's a very friendly place for newcomers.
* I'd suggest learning several languages, but it's definitely not a requirement. I know several software engineers at my work who only know a language or two. It's useful for the extra job opportunities, and also for talking to other people you may be working with who are writing a different part of a project. Architect talking to the bricklayer kind of thing.
* *I'd suggest looking up what languages are most popular in the kind of work you want to do (if you know that already ofc.).* There are tons of articles online with this kind of information.
* Stack Overflow is your friend. There's absolutely nothing wrong with needing to google something about your language. It's definitely a source of imposter syndrome, but people who have been in the industry 30+ years still do it on a daily basis. It's important to develop skills for formulating google search terms, and reading documentation though.
* If you can find some, get good at reading other peoples' code. A lot of software engineering is reading code you didn't write, especially if it needs bug fixing. You'll almost never start on a project from scratch, but that's how it's usually taught in classes.",mineNombies,t2_14xa30,16,0,reddit2
hp71erk,t1_hp59px8,2021-12-19 18:22:11,TwoXChromosomes,"I successfully pivoted my career from leaving school with an arts major to working full time as a software engineer. The biggest thing I had to overcome was a real lack of self confidence in my ability to ""think like an engineer"". I struggled with math all through my traditional school track. It wasn't until I was an adult and working in digital media doing layouts and 2D art that I realized I actually have quite a knack for numbers. 

I did online courses, they're ok. What actually helped in hindsight was the following:


- mentors (#1 thing, there were very key people who _believed in me_ and I started believing in myself. Keep telling people this is what you want to do and you'll be surprised how doors will open that you didn't know were there)


- ""A Mind For Numbers"" by Barbara Oakley


- going back to complete high school courses in math that I'd never attempted; not necessary but for me it was a big confidence boost and the courses were free


- working with senior developers who were passionate about instilling good best practices and building up collaborative project teams


The second Bachelor's degree is a personal choice, imo I spent enough money on my first degree and even though I considered going back to become a computer engineer ""officially"" the cost put me right off it. Post secondary institutions are big business. It might take you more years without the degree to work your way up, but in my experience there are plenty of companies that will take you on and train you to code how they want (you just gotta prove you have the passion and the core skills, which you can get without school) and once you have a couple years in a particular language you are set. 

I don't regret doing my arts degree. But I loved every minute of it. I am still passionate about film & philosophy. I feel I am a much more well-rounded developer because of it. Perhaps you will continue to regret the fact that you felt obligated to complete the psych undergrad, but just know that it will never hinder you from what you want to do next. You'll always have what you took from it to leverage, should you desire to.

Two other close friends and their backgrounds for perspective: one is a philosophy major, went back for mechanical engineering, completed the second degree but ended up switching to programming and is now a senior developer; the other did journalism as the first major, went back for a second degree in math, also completed the second degree and ended up switching to programming and is now a consultant making bank. Both learned outside of school, on the job and with personal projects.

In the 1970s, my mom was told by her father she could choose four occupations: airline attendant, teacher, nurse, or admin assistant. And at that time especially, the idea that there were only certain fields a woman could aspire to was especially endorsed. How can any person with a lick of sense say these social factors don't limit imagination? If women are inundated from the time we're born with messaging about how we're naturally bad at math, more suited to nurturing roles, whatever, of course that's going to have an impact on our choices. And to say otherwise is naive.

One time one of his female staff called him upset. She had gotten gas; at the same time a dude from the sheriff office  was also getting gas. She drove off; a minute down the road, she got pulled over by the sheriff dude. Who proceeded to ask her out.

My mild-mannered dad was pissed as all hell, stormed over to the sheriff's office, and got the dude put on desk duty. Some of my dad's coworkers were like ""aww, that's overkill, what he did was kinda cute."" and my dad was just... ""WTF IS WRONG WITH Y'ALL HE ABUSED HIS AUTHORITY TO SEXUALLY HARASS SOMEONE.""

He was married had kids and the whole thing, he would even do it in front of his family. It was like he had no control. It was really awkward at best but often felt pretty disgusting because if you were standing next to him you would be looked at with guilt by association.

There was no point in reporting it, he did it in front of everyone, often. I would even tell him sometimes that was not cool and he would laugh at me and brush me off.

The boss of our company died and his daughter took over, and it took just one time and he was gone, no warnings, just gone that same day, and we all got a new sexual harassment policy at work.

I am not defending it but it really did look like some kind of mental switch was flipped and he had no control. It reminded me of a dog with a strong prey drive, that sees a bird or cat.

We are constantly bombarded with messages telling us to take responsibility for other people's behaviour, particularly men's, to downplay the impact to ourselves and prioritize their comfort over our own. It's bullshit and it's got to stop. 

If a man does something that hurts you or makes you uncomfortable, *you are not responsible for the consequences of his actions*. 

Reporting his actions to the appropriate authority or to people whose relationships he values doesn't make you responsible for however they decide to respond to that information. 

If someone behaves in a way that hurts or makes you uncomfortable and that behaviour results in them getting fired, losing a relationship, suffering social consequences or facing legal consequences, that's not YOUR fault, it's theirs.

OP - you need to understand that it's not up to you whether he loses his job over this or not. His employer has every right to decide that they are not comfortable having him represent them anymore. 

*You* aren't responsible for what they decide to do with the information you were right to share with them. You have nothing to feel bad about. He made you uncomfortable while representing his company. That's 100% on *him* and any consequences that come of that behaviour are his fault, not yours. 

I see women say stuff like this all the time - ""oh I didn't mean to get him fired! I just wanted him to stop asking me out / bothering me / making me feel gross"", as if it was them *reporting it* that caused the guy to get fired. But you *didn't* get him fired. He did.

My uncle came. We all ended up at the police station and he tells me I need to worry about his future. If I press charges it will ruin his future. He is “just” angry right now. I was fucking pregnant. He was my uncle and he was worried about his future. In the meanwhile he was screaming in the back that he would do it again. Guess what? I didn’t press charges.

One time when we went out, my mum had to go to the women's only room while my step dad took me out to play. I remember her being very upset that she could not watch her own daughter play. I remember seeing the room, there were a few women just sitting silently fully covered. She had to sit in there while we got to have fun. 

Thankfully? Western women weren't expected to be fully covered. Some of the time she had to cover her hair, I think it helped that she was a brunette. She had to dress in black from the neck down, but she could show her hands. 

There were many other disgusting and weird things about that place. Don't get me started on child brides / wives. 

When mum asked me if I wanted to stay, it was an immediate 'no' on my part. I wasn't even a 'woman' yet and I was very miserable. I can't even fathom 10 years, it's not a life.

jeqp3e2,t3_129ymh3,2023-04-03 02:49:28,TwoXChromosomes,"This reminds me of the season 1 finale of American Dad with a dash of the book/movie “Not Without My Daughter”.  While AD is a comedic show (and this post is *not* funny/comedic), it does tell the tale of Stan, who works for the CIA, taking an assignment in Saudi Arabia.  When the family arrives, Stan is awestruck by the misogyny, and loves the idea that he can control his wife and kids, and be venerated as some sort of god just because he’s a man.  So he burns the family’s passports and refuses to return home, lying to his wife - Francine - about getting the “clear to return home” from his boss, and says that they will never leave Saudi Arabia.  He takes a second wife, who he puts in competition with Francine to determine “Number One Wife”.  The episode is one of the series’s best in my opinion, and Francine has a *very* risqué song and dance number in the middle of town that ends up with her arrested and set to be stoned to death for indecency.  (They of course end up getting away in a hilarious manner and return home.)

Not Without My Daughter is the true story of Betty Mahmoody, a U.S. woman who married an Iranian man Sayyed Mahmoody, and their daughter Mahtob.  He takes them to Tehran to visit his family for a two week vacation, where he then confiscates their passports and traps them in Iran.  Betty ends up having to have herself and her daughter smuggled out of the country to Turkey where they got refuge at the embassy.  I’ve never seen the movie (it stars Sally Field as Betty) but have read the book and it is amazing - I highly recommend it!  (Here’s an interview with Mahtob, who has written her own book, “My Name is Mahtob”, if anyone is interested: https://www.npr.org/2015/11/29/457756753/-not-without-my-daughter-subject-grows-up-tells-her-own-story)

So I wonder if that’s what happened to the husband; like Stan, he got to Saudi Arabia, loved the toxic male energy and the ability to force his wife to comply with subjugation, and didn’t want to leave.

A lot of the things you describe sound extremely familiar, from the compound, to Aramco women not having to cover hair or use gloves. 

My grandmother absolutely loved it. But!!! She was a 1950s American house wife. Her only dream in life was to marry my grandfather and have children for him. She never expected to work, or drive mostly due to the generation she lived in. 

She grew up dirt poor, no shoes, great depression, clothes made from flour sacks. In Saudi she got to meet glamorous foreign people, go to cocktail parties, and travel Europe for cheap by hitching a ride on Aramco supply planes.

She also found great satisfaction in the fact that her poor country housewife skills were suddenly in great demand. She knew how to make donuts from scratch, and the whole neighborhood of children, workers, and men would come over to beg for a donut. One (grown!!) man at the Aramco office cried because he didn't get a slice of the birthday cake she made. 

She and the other wives would pool together reusable American goods that were hand me downs like children's shoes to share around the compound. For once owning used shoes was not a mark of shame. 

But! She was a 1950s traditional wife. A Saudi once offered to buy her, since she gave my grandfather three strapping sons. It was one of her proudest stories that she retold for decades.",Epiphany31415,t2_h2ojm,2,0,reddit1

His company agreed to move him from his position back east to a similar position in Southern California.  A few years later for various reasons they moved to Florida and bought a 6 figure waterfront home;  would have required minimum 7 figures to do the same in Southern California.  His job moved his position to Florida and she would commute to her job in Southern California one month on one month off.  He promised the move was temporary.  When it became clear it was not temporary, that she was going to have to give up her lifelong dream of living in Southern California, they got divorced and she moved back to Southern California.  But they had kids, so ironically, she then moved again to Florida to be near the kids, and continues to commute to her Southern California job.  He has a new girlfriend, who with her kids has moved in with him and his kids (yes, absolutely a ""Brady Bunch"" for those of you old enough to know that reference).

Compounds have everything, some have more, some have less.

These developments are quite common, especially in desert/golf communities. Some have guards, some don't. Some have homes all over $1,000,000(US) and some have homes all under $500,000.

People making blanket statements without research here, it's kinda funny to me. Living in one isn't necessarily only about safety, but I will say that a majority criminals prefer to skip the neighborhoods where a quick get away is not guaranteed. No one has reported packages being stolen on my nextdoor app, so there's that, lol. 

It has nothing to do with removing ourselves from society, but rather it feels like a giant neighborhood. It's diverse and the price range of homes varies by as much as $200,000 in my current neighborhood. It's an ""affordable"" way to feel outside the bustling city, yet still within a community.

And it's not really 2nd class citizens all the time, I mean the rules apply to both sexes. Men also need to stand in another line and go to different classes. 
It's also important to note that for westen workers the rules are more ""lose"" for example gay couples and non-married couples that go to KSA / Emirates to work are ""allowed"", they just record it as friends I guess? while the locals can't co-live like that.

I'm not sure what exactly she wanted if she wanted to ""run free and see the world"". Travel more, live an adventurous live? In a compound is just as ordinary as elsewhere, you go to work, you eat, you sleep, you do maybe something fun in the weekend. 
Alcohol and mixed activities are allowed in the compound (incl swimming) and you can wear whatever there (short jeans, no head scarf etc) it's like living in a small town basically and if you get bored you go to Bahrein or holidays somewhere else. Just like people who live in whatever small village elsewhere in the world do that go for the weekend to a bigger city.

I think to be honest that she just found the lifestyle boring. Which is ok, it's not for everybody and she wanted maybe a more excident life. But she is blaiming a country while it sounds to me like it was the lifestyle she didn't like.

jetj4n7,t1_jet1e37,2023-04-03 18:50:57,TwoXChromosomes,"I think that that’s a common feeling among most who have read that ending. That Mikasa killing Eren just feels like it happens. Personally, I think that it’s a pacing issue, though I am lightly optimistic that Studio Wit will be able to fix this for the Anime, especially considering the great work they have put into the Rumbling in the last Episode (final season part 3 part 1). They’ve improved upon the Manga there.

I’ll also admit that at first I didn’t like the scene in the last chapter where Eren brakes down and starts crying to Armin that he doesn’t want Mikasa to love anyone but him after he dies. I felt like, he knew from the start that he was sacrificing a future with Mikasa, because there was something more important to do. Protect Paradis. Protect Armin and Mikasa. Create a future where at least they will be spared of future conflict, even if conflict overall is inevitable. Somehow I felt, because he knew what he was doing, he should’ve been more stoic about the matter. But now, having read it a second time, and also being in a different head space myself, I think I must admit - there’s something about it I do like. Eren, by his somewhat pathetic reaction, is showing his vulnerable side to Armin (and by proxy the reader). That he does love Mikasa. The he is a bit possessive of her. That he said the hurtful things he did, because he had to push them away from him. So that they would oppose him. And that its not like he doesn’t regret the outcome of his actions or isn’t  emotionally hurt by them either. It’s just, to protect them, he had to do it what he did. There was, as he saw it, no other way. By the end, he even acknowledges how pathetic he must seem, lying there in his puddle, and asks Armin not to tell Mikasa, because he doesn’t want her to know of this embarrassing conversation.",RpAno,t2_c0nfbsl4,1,0,reddit1

These were young women who wanted social reform and stronger government support networks for women and children, who also fervently believed that life began as conception and that an abortion was murdering an innocent child. They also couldn't conceive of the idea that a person could die from lack of access to an abortion, and were just in general very ignorant about pregnancy and reproductive health, including the idea that no person healthy enough to conceive could be in danger from getting pregnant.

They also refused to believe that a pregnancy can fail in such a way that leaves the fetus unviable, but with a heartbeat that prevents the pregnant person from getting an abortion. They didn't understand that even with the best medical technology, inducing labor and birth in a person who was seventeen weeks pregnant was an abortion because that fetus is so underdeveloped it's incompatible with life.

They refused to believe me when I said that the overturning of Roe v Wade would lead to miscarriages being criminalized, even as lawmakers in red states were drafting laws that would treat every miscarriage as a potential purposeful abortion, and investigate and prosecute accordingly.

I agree with you completely that it's not a zero sum game, and I think it's worth saying that sexist men come at that perspective from an angle that makes it extremely hard to convince them otherwise.  I've come to believe from my exposure to all kinds of bigotry that the real root of it is ego driven hierarchical thinking.  These guys won't care that it's better for the company to hire the most qualified candidates, or that it's better for the economy for women to have equal opportunities. It's not actually about what women are or aren't capable of.  It's about the fact that women were supposed to be lower than them.  Allowing a woman to succeed in a field means that a woman can succeed *more than them*.  That upsets the hierarchy.  I think supremacist views are about having designated losers. You'll always win at least a little because by virtue of your race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc, there will always be someone beneath you.  Why do the loudest sexists and bigots seem to be the least educated, or the most insecure?  The least talented, or the biggest jackasses? It's because they're fighting to make sure they still have someone to be better than.  If women are equals, the bottom drops out of their perceived social status.

hvu4cmc,t3_sly5jo,2022-02-06 17:49:22,TwoXChromosomes,"As a mentor and a manager, it gives me great pride to know the people (both men and women) are able to not only get promoted to my level but to surpass me and lead a successful career. I’ve mentored over 20 men and women so far and the vast majority of them have moved on to great things and about half have surpassed me in terms of hierarchy. 

My biggest point to everyone I mentor is, failure is just a stepping stone to success. Without the bitterness of failure, you won’t truly know the sweetness that is success when you finally get it. 

And if you’re not going anywhere in your life, take a step back and evaluate why that is. Is it your job? Your company? Your boss? Your habits? What is it that is a barrier to your own success in life? Then work to either lessen or break down that barrier. If it means quitting, quit and find something else to do. If it means letting yourself be fired, maybe it’s what you need to humble yourself to move forward. The road to success isn’t a straight line, it’s often full of twists, turns, loop-di-loops, and even backwards momentum. 

But don’t ever blame anybody else for your failures. Those are your failures to own and learn from. And certainly don’t take out your failures on others. Congratulate the person with success then ask them what they did, maybe you can learn something from it. 

But being embittered and telling someone off for seeing success is just wrong. Take your own life into your hands, figure out what you’re doing wrong and fix your shit.",Dfiggsmeister,t2_c5q65,17,0,reddit2

I'm also trying to find an excuse to shoehorn this in, Robert evans did a podcast called ""the woman's war"" about the Kurdish resistance in Syria.
 
A extreme example of how women can help us if they fight for themselves.
 
In syria, when isis rolls into town, the men are given a choice to die or join. 
 
If a hyper religious cult that promises you guns, cool trucks, money, and women seem attractive to you, I want you to remember that.
 
If not, I still want you to listen.
 
For the women, you basically don't get a choice. And if you are a kurd, the good news is that you are probably attractive, the bad news is that for isis you are fair game for rape.
 
The kurds always fought a resistance, it was always a little bit more progressive than the government regimes they fought.
 
But when the ""good"" guys are just corpses now, who steps up and picks up the gun?

Well the woman who was raped by isis, Or the other who lost their boyfriend fighting isis, maybe it's was the lesbian who wanted to love who she wanted to love in a hyper conservative area.
 
What is worse for isis is that if you get shot by one of these women, it is go to hell, do not pass go, do not collect 200$, welcome to hell. 
 
And the women are the ones who now push to move rojava to be the libertarian socialist country that it is, focused on feminism. 
 
Seriously, any women who have read this, look up ""Rojava"" you will probably think it's rad.
 
And if you are the kind of guy who thought joining a group to drive pickup trucks and fuck women was rad, well you just got shot from 500 yards by one of these women as that is an significant part of the ground forces of the Kurdish resistance.",BoytoyCowboy,t2_abjsol7a,24,0,reddit2

Because if we don't, if we block and shut them down without any discussion, they will fall RIGHT into the hands of the misogyny to alt right pipeline that is designed specifically to catch them and cater to their every whim as a disgruntled and angsty teen boy. And then those boys grow into awful, toxic, alt-right fueled angsty men.

I'd rather take the time to respond and engage and at least fight a little, so the lurkers see the other perspective, and hopefully catch them before they fall into the rabbit hole of hating women. 

It isn't our *job*, and we have to take our turns carrying the burden, and we can even just point to places that are healthier and can engage, but doing nothing and leaving those arguments unanswered just makes it easier for more of these boys to continue to dive into the radicalization that preys on their insecurities.",PurpleHooloovoo,t2_6fgh4,65,0,reddit2

If it weren't a woman being promoted, they'd blame race, or age or that the person promoted is friends with the powers that be, or maybe the Illuminati working against them. 

You know what, sometimes there are a lot of similarly qualified applicants for a position, and sometimes we make decisions based on representation because these things are important. Sometimes we make decisions on little more than a coin toss or gut feeling too. 

Even online worms like OP describe are not the majority. The majority just goes about their lives. But they will always be vocal because talking shit is simply easier than actually doing something with your life.

Without a doubt women and underrepresented folks get the brunt of this nonsense especially in mainstream forums , but especially online I hope more people simply realize it's not real life, your successs or concerns are just catnip to pathetic trolls.
