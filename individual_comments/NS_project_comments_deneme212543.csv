The documents the Democrats are seeking to be released are confidential papers from the top level of the Bush administration when he was the staff secretary. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would willingly release confidential presidential documents this soon after the end of their respective administrations.


It isn't like Kavanaugh has been hiding either. Not like he could take part in halting the release of the documents anyway. He was made available to meet with anyone who wanted to meet with him, not a single Democrat did. Some of those confidential documents were made available in supervised setting open 24/7 to every single Democratic Senator, not one showed up. This was never about documents or wanting to learn more about him, the loudest Dem Senators had already gone on record opposing him, this was about delaying the hearing until after mid-terms when they think they have a better chance at shutting him down.


What perjury? Also, any evidence at all that Kavanaugh is totally in Trump's pocket?


The clown show has almost exclusively been coming from the Left. Booker literally used his Day 1 line of questioning to help fundraise immediately after the hearing ended. Harris insinuated that Kavanaugh has had conversations about the Mueller investigation with a lawyer who works for the firm that represents Trump. As far as we know that was totally fabricated. Booker ""broke the rules"" by releasing confidential documents that he knew were actually cleared to be released the night before, but acted like he didn't know they were cleared in an attempt to be censured. Afterwards he said it made him feel like Spartacus, since that's the whole point of this shitshow.


Kavanaugh is a milquetoast pick, a Constitutionalist through and through. There were many on the Right disappointed with the pick bc Trump could have easily gone with a more clear right wing judge and had them been a shoo in. Please save the histrionics for the actual controversial things Trump does, there is plenty of it.

I refer you to this section of the article linked below. 

Health is not only about disease prevention, but also about well-being and the avoidance of harm. How harmful is routine non-therapeutic circumcision? The overall rate of immediate and long-term complications arising from newborn circumcision is a matter of debate and in truth unknown. The estimated rate of complication worldwide has been reported as lying between the extremes of 0.1% and 35%.27 Minor complications such as bleeding, infection and prolonged hospitalization are thought to occur in less than 5% of cases. Tragic partial or complete penile amputation, urethral injury and even the rare death have been reported. Meatal stenosis requiring intervention occurs in 5%–10% of males circumcised in the newborn period.28 This is believed to be secondary to dermatitis of the unprotected glans exposed to wet diapers. Circumcision revision under anesthetic for penile concealment, skin bridges or an unacceptable cosmetic result is probably the most common long-term complication prompting a urological referral: in one survey, fully one-third of pediatric urologists in the United States reported experience as an expert witness in circumcision litigation cases.29

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.

At best it's labor aimed at getting someone else to do something for you that you can't be bothered to do for yourself.

It's like a slave overseer complaining to slaves that they just don't understand what hard work it is having to whip them.

 ---------------------

What would legitimate ""emotional labor"" look like?

* Which sex commits suicide four times more often?  If women are supposed to be doing real emotional labor that feels like a fail to me.  Talking people off the ledge is hard work and emotional alright, but it feels like women are slacking on the job if that is to be considered their job.

* Emotional labor could mean romance and the small acts of love that keep a relationship together.  But it's men not women who do that stuff.  Saint Valentine's Day isn't about women giving men gifts.  Everyone knows Mother's Day is taken seriously and Father's Day is a joke.  Ladies are not as good as men at emotional labor is one conclusion from that.

* Men are constantly seeking to understand and mollify women.  That's why we have sayings like ""what do women want?"" but women's take on men is lazy and dismissive ""men only want one thing"" (something women are then encouraged to withhold as emotional manipulation). We say ""happy wife, happy life"" but nobody cares about the man's emotional needs.  People who would laugh at how awful a present for a wife a vacuum cleaner is would be just fine with buying tools for a man.

* When men get called to deal with a beetle or a spider isn't that emotional labor?

Against this stuff feminists argue women do emotional labor because they remember birthdays (do they?) and keep in touch with family friends.  That sounds a lot like they're just doing whatever they would have done anyway.  It's like arguing that playing video games is ""communications labor"".  If the woman is the one working to keep track of the man's friends who aren't her friends then you'd have a point, and that does sometimes happen.",DavidByron2,t2_gatel,157,0,reddit3

Hypoagency. If you need help, it's your responsibility to ask for help.

There's a lot of thing in her post that she's choosing to do, then she got overwhelmed and is now angry that her husband didn't ride up to her on a white horse as soon as she crossed the border from 'Things I'm Taking On' to 'Things I Need Help With'.

Also,

>he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

The husband very clearly stated why he doesn't get involved.

It's pretty clear that HE is doing a lot of emotional labour as she takes on too much, wants it all done 'the right way' (i.e., her way), and then gets upset when it overwhelms her and uses him as an emotional punching bag because it's HIS fault for not providing exactly what was needed in HER unknown, unspoken plan of action. 

It must be tiring going through that cycle.

To be fair, they both need to communicate their needs to the other.

It sounds like he wants to help but he wants also agency. He gets to do his tasks the way he sees fit. This would allow him to be more proactive.

It sounds like she wants ~~everything she doesn't have but needs, at the right moment and in the right way~~ more of his active involvement but she'll have to relinquish control and let go of the idea of perfection.

Finally, some people are just passive and will let cede power to whomever takes it. She must have known this before marrying this man but was perhaps too focused on the benefits to consider the negatives. A control freak can't have both a partner with passive personality that will allow the control freak the full measure of their power *and* the misandrist idealized version of a husband, who is competent and confident in all things, completely attuned to her emotions at all times and who will always shield her from reality by doing everything that needs doing in order to protect her from being overwhelmed.

>He says that he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

Oh, a self-admitted control freak has *also* henpecked her husband into being frozen, not knowing what to do. So she goes onto a feminist subreddit so people can enable her instead of working on her problem with her S/O. You can't make this shit up.

Her constant whining just makes her look like an exhausting person. In an 8-hour work day, I could completely plan an entire year worth of vacations, buy every type of insurance we need, do our taxes, do all of the holiday season shopping, meal prep for an entire week, clean our entire house from top to bottom, call special pickup for any old garbage we need to throw away, and even have time to clean out the rain gutters. The reason why I chose an 8-hour work day is because that's the average amount of time full-time working men spend working over full-time working women a week.

1. For some reason, pick a man who doesn’t put a lot of effort into anything.
2. Once you’ve picked this man, do not under any circumstances tell him that you think he should change his behavior. Instead, expect him to magically understand (although you knew he didn’t before you got into a relationship with him) what needs to be done even though everything suggests that he does not. 
3. If he actually tries to help - do not under any circumstances accept a learning curve. Additionally, do not accept any autonomy from him. You do things your way - and he should know what you mean by your way. You shouldn’t have to tell him what to do, even though you will yell at him if he does something wrong.
4. Don’t talk about any of this. Be passive aggressive instead. Blame “society” even though you’re fully aware that you did not vet for or prioritize the traits you’re now angry at him for lacking when you decided to be with him.

Then after which, she complains about him not just helping out instead of asking if and where she needs help. That is so stupid it's insane. Firstly: she says he's quite good at the chores around the house, and maintenance. This makes me assume, everytime theres been a maintenance problem or a physical labor job, it's been his ass out in the sun or standing on top of a rickety labor, meaning she sat on the couch scrolling reddit or just handing him tools. I'm sure the husband wouldn't appreciate if she climbed that same ladder with him on it to help out, without asking if and where he needed help. The important part about asking where someone needs help is it avoids further setbacks by avoiding misunderstandings. She's complaining about him not being able to detect what needs to be done, which is all in her mind. Also, mother's day doesnt entitle anyone to anything except saying ""happy mother's day"". Seriously, who else took part in the action of you becoming a mother aside from your immediate family, and who initially asked to make a child? More often than not, it's the mother herself. If it is, her choice makes me buy gifts for her? That's horseshit. I understand a grown up child getting a gift for his/her mother as a thanks. I dont understand anything else.

I mean I've never had a woman agree trade places with me.  Like not even factoring in a hypothetical job switch.  Just trading mowing and home maintenance and things like that for their share of the inside work (I already do quite a bit of the cooking and cleaning as it is).

As for gifts on holidays I do have a few observations there, but they mostly revolve around a lot of women thinking that kind of stuff is more important than it actually is, and taking control and bossing around the man they're with instead of letting him do things the way he wants to.

If I want to get something simple like a gift card to a nice restaurant and tell my mom in person how much I love her, and that's my style of doing things, why is that not valid?  Why do you automatically assume the consumerist, wasteful, frilly gift wrapped trinkets thing that she was doing is the correct way to do it?  And if he's leaving it to her it's only because she won't let him do it the way he wants to do it and he's leaned that mistake from previous years being with her.

Trust me I've been there done that with that exact type of woman and she, and every other woman like her, needs to take several steps back and give her man room to breath so that he can do things the way he wants to. Including for his own fucking mom on mother's day.  If she wants to do the wasteful, consumerist gift wrap bullshit with her own mom then she's more than welcome to. But it's his mom and if he wants to do something different he should be allowed to.  What you're looking at is an abusive, controlling relationship, and you are defending the abuser.  This type of shaming behavior is often what traps men like this into this type of bullshit.

In strictly hierarchical societies, yes, you had that dynamic at work but it was just as bad for lower class men. And really, it's not any different than what exists today where the wife of the highest standing man is second only to him.

But here we can see what's happened with the transition away from a patriarchical society: Women get the vote and immediately start voting perks for themselves with very little concern for society as a whole. Kooky ideas become the norm as ""experiements"" just to see what happens and society more or less starts breaking down with drug use and over-indulgence. Everything we've built more or less gets cashed in and used up because women as a group are terrible at planning for the future at a societal level.

Normally, I don't use the term 'equality' – in regards to romantic relationships – to refer to the balance of authority, but to the value of the persons. What people conflate quite easily in these conversations, is these two different kinds of equality.  


>Authority inherently implies there is a more powerful and a less powerful party in the dynamic, whether that be on the workfloor or in a personal relationship.

What you say here is true, and that's exactly what is so important as far as I'm concerned.

The reason there is a power dynamic in a company, is because the company is incapable of functioning properly without it. If there is no one consistently calling the shots on (important) decisions, you can forget earning a profit. It also has to be the case that the persons in these functions are suited for their positions. Different people have different skillsets; some people can be excellent project planners to carpenters, while they are horrible carpenters themselves.

None of this makes the people on the workfloor any less valuable than the manager, and it is similar in a romantic relationship.

The beautiful differences between men and women are designed by God to be complementary, not to be neglected. It's like switching the places of different cogs and gears in a perfectly designed machine.

h45rbi8,t1_h450dw4,2021-07-05 19:39:21,MensRights,"I think we agree more than we disagree. What you say is true; there are always going to be societal stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, which change over time. They will often line up with proper ideals of the two, but when that happens, it's a symptom and not a changing of the actual principles. We shouldn't line up to the expectations of society, but to that which is *good*.

One such stereotype that I horribly dislike, is the idea that an authoritative man deals with his wife harshly, and punishes her physically or mentally in a harsh way. As far as I'm concerned, a good husband deals with his wife patiently, in love, *much* *more* so with his wife – who he has committed himself to for the rest of his life – than with anyone else.

A man who is authoritative does not have to rule harshly, it's a big misunderstanding. While they coincide sometimes, they are *far* from the same thing. A proper leader *serves* the people he leads. He ought to do it for them and not himself. The same is true for a man and his wife; a man ought to lead his wife, but do so by serving her. If a man has an unhappy wife because of the way he treats her, he's doing just as bad a job as a manager with depressed employees.

As far as I'm concerned, assertively serving (who is yet to be) your woman – that would be chivalry – is right in line with the core of the design; it's an absolutely beautiful thing.

Societal ideas often flow from complementarian principles, but they *aren't* the principles themselves.

Things like women doing the cooking and men going out to work, are, more than anything, side-effects or symptoms of keeping to complementarian principles. So, a man staying home or a woman going out to work, doesn't necessarily make either less masculine or feminine.

Leading by serving is actually the best way to lead, but it's not one many people know is even possible, because they've (almost) never experienced it.

The most important thing in leading properly, is to talk to people individually. If I see that there is a better way to handle something in my relationship with my girlfriend, and my girlfriend disagrees, I sit down and talk to her. After all, if I have chosen the most sensible option, I can make a case through arguments that this is actually the best way to go about things.

So we sit down, I listen to her disagreements, and we talk through them. If she is wrong, she'll gladly admit it (not always in the moment, but she always does), so we can move on in unison. The reason we constantly talk about things, is because I can be wrong too. If she can explain to me by making a case that I'm wrong, then I'll have to admit it and we can move on in the same way.

That's leading by serving. A leader is just as human as the people/person he leads; he makes mistakes.

By leading this way, there is no room left for harshness, except for rare situations where it is necessary. I don't ""keep my girlfriend in line"", she stays ""in line"" because she loves me. She *wants* to take my advice, she *wants* to let me lead and she *wants* me to correct her when she's in an emotional mood. Not because I force these things upon her, but because she's experienced all that as very helpful and positive.

A good leader is one that people *want* to follow, because they know he can lead them well. As a Christian, Jesus is the perfect example of leading through serving. It is because he loved people that people came to listen to Him and to follow Him.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,1,0,reddit3

Sex Education on Netflix is insulting. The female characters are toxic, constantly putting down the straight, male characters, which is somehow supposed to be endearing. Even when they blatantly show their toxicity, they blame *their own behavior* on the mythical ""Patriarchy.""

Gillian Anderson's character is disgusting. She invades her son's privacy incessantly yet guards all information about herself like her life depends on it, and instead of calling her on this hypocrisy, it blames male characters and makes them look bad to divert focus and just forgets all the horrible stuff she does. How about when she actually starts a serious romantic relationship and goes out of her way to hide it and lie about it to her son, who lives in the same house and sees her every day? No, no, nevermind that, back to what the men are doing wrong. She even tries to publish a book about her son's deepest secrets, then says she was writing it to get closer to him. Then why did she try to have it published!?!? What did *that* have to do with getting closer to him? Really, it was just so she could prove what power she had over his private information, but the show completely forgets about that and lets her off the hook. When her gathering of the students'  secrets through her *confidential counseling sessions* with them leads to all the kids' private stuff becoming public, it also gets blamed on a man. No, no, pay no attention to the fact that she collected it at all in the first place so she could write a book about it. Quick, look what that bad man is doing!

And the Maeve character is ridiculous. The show continually tells you how super, incredibly smart she is. Why she's practically the greatest genius of all time! Well, it's a good thing they constantly tell you that because you would have no idea from anything she ever says or does. Her choices are endlessly stupid, but, no, really, she's just so underappreciated. And, also, she's totally oppressed by the ""Patriarchy."" That's why none of her behavior makes sense.

I don't even want to get into the ""struggle"" of the nonbinary characters. Gay men in real life have been violently attacked and even murdered for being gay. But the nonbinary people in this show are oh-so tragically persecuted because they're politely asked to adhere to the dress code of the school they chose to attend and because they're shown a sex education video that doesn't include them, though exactly what that means is unclear since they still have the same reproductive organs as the other students.

And that show is just one example. I can't stand Disney's Marvel shows. The superhero shows on the CW got real old real fast. They've become about representation and whining and not quality entertainment. I want good TV, regardless of the color or gender or sexuality of the characters. The new Queer as Folk is overly pluralist garbage with selfish, irresponsible characters who want recognition just because they're not heteronormative.

igfi9u9,t3_w0jwdi,2022-07-16 19:28:00,MensRights,"> Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

Top Gun: Maverick is telling a story that is not available to audiences right now, and therefore the movie is able to capitalize – with record-setting numbers – on that huge, unmet need in the marketplace. Considering how ""Maverick"" stands out among its contemporaries, isn't it strange how all these supposedly ""diverse"" shows are exactly the same? If you stop and consider the last few years, it's clear that this ""diversity"" push only gives us predictable and repetitive content (note: I feel it would be wrong to refer to such boring and lazy products as ""art""). Well, the reason for this is that Tinseltown is applying ""diversity"" at the wrong level, by trying to fit the concept into individual stories. Simply put, companies could employ the same racial mix of acting talent if they filmed Black Panther (all-black) and Peter Jackson's LOTR (all-white) as separate films, but instead they are idiots and choose to make two movies that have identical racially-mixed casts to try and achieve the same end result. There's actually a term – level confusion – for this common type of mistake in mathematics and statistics, because of how easy it is to do when dealing with groups of objects. Our brains and language naturally don't deal with multiple levels of things, so we get confused and believe things that are impossible. And speaking of impossibilities: ""diverse show"" is actually an impossible construct for the type of diversity they want to achieve (mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an average, or variation from a median/mean, when the sample size is ""1""). I mean, if you could have a ""diverse show"" – a contradiction in terms, but let's say for argument that such an impossible object could actually exist in reality – then all you would need to do is clone and repeat that show, and you would successfully create a ""diverse"" industry. It's madness. If your presuppositions lead to the conclusion that all shows must be identical to each other in order to achieve ""diversity"", then you're doing something terribly wrong.

Unfortunately, I doubt this problem will be fixed anytime soon. People in Hollyweird lack the intelligence and long-term thinking required to apply diversity properly at the **industry** level, like they should be doing. And even if they could see their mistake, the problem is that they aren't strategically applying these quotas – and monitoring/measuring to find out when they are no longer needed – to combat actual attitudes of prejudice and injustice across the vast realm of arts and culture. No, they are doing it out of blind cowardice and a selfish, personal fear of being labeled an ""istaphobe"" of some kind. Just look at the recent way the GoT and Friends creators are bending over backwards to apologize for the ethnic ""homogeneity"" in those shows.

The dilemma is that apologizing and showing weakness like that only leads to more attacks and shakedowns of their business. Mature, strong leadership at the industry level would result in a much different response to any such attempts to slander these existing properties (and by proxy to try and stain the entertainment business as a whole). Imagine this statement instead from some overarching body or group: ""The entertainment industry remains committed to telling a diverse range of individual stories, whether primarily white or black, male or female, straight or gay, and more, including mixed casts of those groups as well, whenever the particular narrative being represented means it is appropriate to do so. Telling good, genuine stories means confining the setting to a specific time, location, and group of people, and we know this will – in time – give us a wonderful, diverse range of individual shows that will be very different from each other. As an industry, we are dedicated to telling a story for *everyone*, whether that is based on identity, socioeconomic, politicial, religious, or other group traits. We support the individual stories told by *Friends* and *Game of Thrones*, in the same way we celebrate all the distinct and personal creations in our industry.""

If these ""adult pretenders"" fail to stand up to the bullying, and don't fix their ""diversity incentives"" to stop discriminating against white males like yourself (though I hear that black males do get largely similar treatment...unfortunately, having a black female allows a company to check *two* ""protected class"" boxes on the budget refund calculator), then the industry will eventually die and be replaced (see the recent rise of Japanese anime/manga, South Korean TV dramas, independent content creations from YouTube, etc, Bollywood films, and more, as the beginning of this long-term trend).",RoryTate,t2_ghli7,5,0,reddit4

One principal culprit would be BlackRock (which, ironically, I bet you haven’t heard leftists criticise), the single largest and most valuable entity in history, who owns Vanguard among other things. They use something called an ESG score to decide which companies to invest into - this score ranks companies based on their environmental consciousness, social issue awareness (read: diversity quotas) and governance. In other words, companies are literally being paid to discriminate against white men.

No number is ""acceptable"".            
It's not about quotas. If a story is good, people will respond to it. Then, those stories can be as diverse as it's *claimed* they should be. From genitalia, to freckles, skin color to eye color; heroes and anti-heroes. It's all at your public library, folks.

But that's not what they really want. They don't want to ""represent"" anyone- least of all the women they *don't* like. You won't be seeing any movies about female Hispanic Trump voters. No heroic Black conservatives fighting off gay villains.

You are not alone as a shift has been occurring with some people realizing we're being played, especially when they printed 80% of all money in existence within two years, bailed out their bank friends.

The truth is men are just far more interested in hacking.

It's infuriating in multiple ways. I could do a whole essay just on the insanely hypocritical, self-important, insipid, agenda-skewed, reductive, and manipulative sins of Good Trouble, which is a spin-off of The Fosters, which ended but was popular and almost as bad. But the biggest thing is how it does that thing I see under-represented groups do that I absolutely hate: attack their own allies. Or would-be allies. It blames and insults the very people they're simultaneously asking for sympathy and support from. It says ""you *have* to support me because you owe me, but, no, you're not supporting me *enough* and also it has to be in exactly the way I tell you to, and you have to flog yourself while doing it, and I'm not going to support you back because you suck, and don't you dare notice the people I hurt when I feel like it because I'm allowed to do that, and, by the way, you're welcome for my allowing you to do my bidding.""

It's the kind of thing that actually drives supporters away, and I can't stand how pleased it is with itself while being a terribly-written show. But my roommate watches a lot of stuff without noticing how awful it is. Some of it has been stuff we watch together, though.

Woke-ness ruined American Gods. And another adaptation of beloved Neil Gaiman material is clearly continuing the trend. I'm a huge fan of The Sandman comic, but I saw the trailer for the new Netflix series and said, nope, I'm out, before it even starts I'm out.

And it's not just American shows. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, from Australia, has a feminist bent, but the main character is mature and fairly well-balanced about it, and the rest of the show is fun enough without making woke tendencies too much of a thing. But the spin-off, Ms. Fisher's Modern Mysteries, set decades later with the niece of the previous show's mc, goes completely into ""men are dumb brutes and women need to do everything for them and are the only ones who know anything yet men have all the power while women are deprived and oppressed because Patriarchy"" territory.

If you read about it, you'll see the driver let two young women in the back while still locking him out of the front seat.

At the time I realized like everyone that the driver discriminated against him for his skin color. It didn't occur to me the driver discriminated against him for his sex too.

Here's the start of the New York Times article:

**Danny Glover Says Cabbies Discriminated Against Him**

By MONTE WILLIAMS
Published: November 4, 1999

The actor Danny Glover, of the ''Lethal Weapon'' series, ''Beloved,'' and other films, filed a complaint yesterday with the City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging a cabdriver with discrimination on Oct. 9 for refusing to allow him to ride in the front passenger seat.

Mr. Glover, who is black, said he was already angry because several hours earlier five yellow cabs had failed to stop for him, his daughter and her roommate at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue.

At a news conference yesterday in the lobby of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Glover, with his daughter, Mandisa, a senior at New York University, at his side, said he had been visiting her from San Francisco. When those cabs passed them by, Mr. Glover said: ''I was so angry. The fact that my daughter's here to go to school, it really upsets me that if she's standing on the corner waiting to get a cab, she can't get a cab. It happens to her, it happens to countless people every single day. The fact that I'm a celebrity, the fact that I'm visible, allows me to draw attention to this.''

tells you more about the fact women simply don't want the jobs, as opposed to any myth there's a ""patriarchy"".

Yet another example of the fact the ""Wage Gap"" is nothing but a myth in all but the minds of the delusionally persecuted and ignorant.

The fact is men work the dirty and dangerous jobs, as well as the more prolific and well-paid jobs. Women who say they want equality have no idea that men work more hours, including overtime, and that's why men earn more.

While i support the idea of women venturing into the realms where men historically dominate the fields, i can't help but think this is somehow going to be spun as the women failed because the men.

there will be some nonsense about ""barrier to entry"" and ""hostile environment"" to work etc, because it would else require the women admit they simply can't hack it doing some men's jobs.

the fact is women don't want these boring, dangerous, underpaid jobs. yet most women are totally fine letting their fellow men take-up the slack by doing dirty and dangerous jobs, while simultaneously complaining men aren't helping women achieve ""equality"" enough.

Then when women try to address the balance, they fail to support themselves to make the balance happen, proving their lip-service to such ""equality"" really is secondary to having the convenience of letting the men do all the work.

for all the hate against men for supposedly treating women like ""princesses"", the women certainly like to play the part well enough, right down to the entitlement and spoiled attitude of letting ""lesser"" men do the dirty work for them.﻿",p3ngwin,t2_3aa2m,3,0,reddit1

The females we did hire soon began asking for weekday/daytime only shifts, shorter shifts, more days off than other drivers and fully expected to be treated like drivers with years of seniority and to have extra calls thrown their way on slow nights - at the expense of other drivers. Most of these 'needs' were expressed before the first week was finished. I can't imagine pushing that hard anywhere as a new-hire.

It almost became a policy to avoid hiring them due to the extra hassles involved.

cn8gidj,t1_cn7ddka,2014-12-29 17:55:29,MensRights,"Ofcourse the demand is there. Doesn't mean it's right. The vast majority of women wouldn't want to date/fuck a taxi driver, so as far as they would be concern that guy is worth less than dirt. Better have a woman because, as the stereotype goes, she's safe and fun too! She's just another ""girlfriend"" with whom she can gossip with. It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that women are all safe and friendly kindred-spirits, and men are misogynistic assholes and potential rapists for even having a sexuality.

And men? Why wouldn't they want a woman driver? They would be fine with fucking/dating a female taxi driver, if the opportunity was there. So, what's the benefit of having a male driver when all other relevant factors would be equal?  It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that a woman can do everything a man can, and that they would be misogynistic assholes if they ever thought differently.

The problem isn't that the demand exists. The problem is the amount of sexism, ignorance and prejudice towards men to support that demand. If you went back a few decades in the US. There would most certainly have been a demand for ""whites-only"" taxi cabs, even if it was all rooted in prejudice, racism, ignorance.  Given that it is entirely socially acceptable to discriminate against men, the bigger money is with the majority that stands by that discrimination. The fact that there's money to be made by catering to bigots doesn't make it ethical to do so.  ",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit1

cn8fobl,t1_cn7loxt,2014-12-29 17:30:02,MensRights,"It's not that men and women are ""meant"" to follow strict gender roles. That's like saying that, because there are more Indian drivers, this is ""their roles in society"". Which is both wrong and pretty offensive. Men and women can do the same things, the problem is that we live in a world where women still behave and are treated like princesses. They still want special treatment and have very sexist ideals, but still want men to provide it for them. 

 Most women don't want to work those hours because that would mean losing out on all the other social opportunities that would be abundant to them because they are women. Most women don't want to work those extra hours because the money is not as necessity for them the way it would be for men(having money is not a crucial/mandatory aspect of their social/sexual value). Most women would prefer to be driven and have fun/no-care than have to drive and be responsible/accountable. Given the same opportunities and preferential treatment, men would want the same things too.

 This is not even anything new. There's a reason why, in virtually every family, the father/man tends to be the one who does most of the driving. Not only does society reinforce those roles but women favour/value men by those gender roles.  This is a very similar problem to the one you have in STEM fields, where you have a lot of opportunities for women to succeed in those fields but find that most women don't want to work those fields because they have so many other alternative opportunities and privileges available to them.",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit1

An equally credible theory/reason (which is also speculation) is that women don't feel confident and safe enough in New York (where this service is being launched at) to become drivers. A.k.a. they aren't willing to take the risk/burden. If we find out that SheTaxi is willing to pay anywhere between $10 to $25 per hour (lower and upper average payrates for different driving services), then it's less about ""bad business"" and more about females having different priorities & levels of risk than males.

Edit: my speculation is further strengthened when you look at the taxi industry as a whole -- ""Currently only 3% of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female"".

I mean, heck, lets contrast and compare. 

If I step into a car with a driver, I know, the chances are roughly 30 %. 

30 % I am going to get a tweaker. You know, someone with obvious heroin scars, that tries to tell me about the one time he saw buddah in church, and he told him his highschool was ran over by welsh people. That is why he had to eat all those magic mushrooms, you know, divine need...The one that you can tell has just been off the needle for 2 weeks, and that tries to get his shit back together , and the only place willing to hire is the taxi. 

30 % I am going to get habib. Yes, I am using the stereotypical asia Minor / middle eastern name, because it's a stereotypical situation and allways the stereotypical guy. Nice guy, funny accent, name with more vowels then I have ever seen in a plate, but ALLWAYS with a smile. They will tell you, with an unflinching smile, how their wive hates them, their kids no longer want to be recognised as his race, his friends back home  in the old country think he is a sellout, and his little dog got run over by a drunk driver, but like a dolphin, he is smiling. Yea, he may smell weird, or listen to weird music, but generally, if it is too obnoxious, he will turn it down, and if the smell bothrs you he opens a window. 

30 % are road ragers / east block true man . You know,. stereotypical tough guys, who will be tatooed, silent, and if pressured, will tell you how they tortured a guy once and try to forget how good it felt to crush his windpipe with their fingers. ALL, with out exception, have seen all the rambo movies, and can do chilling impressions. Someone that's ""connected"" got them the job. They will know the speed limit by heart, because they are the guys all the GTA players wish they could be, as they use anything on the road to their advantage, telling you how this is nothing, back in 95 in bosnien herzogowina, he already drove 2 ton jeeps like this through a warzone full of snipers, untill those damn serbs blasted away his buddies head with a machine gun, and he had to run them over, and now he can hear the screams, but he is not going to a doctor, oh no, doctors are for women and injuries that require more then the tools in his toolbelt. 

The remaining 10 %? Normal, everyday guys. Of whom about 3 % happen to be female. 

Yea. I hold a taxi driving male to the same status that I hold a restaurant waitress. It's the kind of job that hires you with minimal qualifications. The kind of job you can do even if you have nothing else. 

So, I do not mouth off, I only complain if it is extra heavy, and I try to take it up with the driver rather then mouth off to the bosses and try to get them fired. And you know what? 

The wildest tweaker, the most turban wearing habib, and the true men respect that. They thank me profusely, because fuck yea, they need the job, and more writeups, and they would have gotten fired. 

So, that Female only service? I support free business, I really do, but if all you have to offer is women only drivers, then feck, think about the following: 

Taxi driving is the most diverse job on the planet. you meet people of all ages and races there, and most of them are dirt poor, and are getting treated worse then fast food workers. 

So, of course, if someone wants to not get into a normal taxi, how about we check them for systemic racism? 
Oh, yea, you know, in the papers, I read how black guys want to rape the white women, and how indians allways do group rape, and russian guys, the even use tools....

Of course, they are not racist, of course they are not priviledged beyond belief, they just prefer to be driven by, you know, acceptable women, you know, non scary people, preferrably of their own race. ",Meistermalkav,t2_5mn5y,33,0,reddit1

>A __hackney__ or __hackney carriage__ (also called a *cab*, *black cab*, *hack* or *London taxi*) is a [carriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage) or [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile) for hire.  A hackney of a more expensive or high class was called a __remise__. 

>In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), the name *hackney carriage* today refers to a [taxicab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab) licensed by the [Public Carriage Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Hire) in [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) or by the local authority ([non-metropolitan district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-metropolitan_district) councils or [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authority)) in other parts of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain), or by the [Department of the Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_(Northern_Ireland\)) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).

>In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the police department of the city of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts) has a Hackney Carriage Unit, analogous to taxicab regulators in other cities, that issues *Hackney Carriage* medallions to its taxi operators.

On the other hand, however, there are men out there who are physically weaker than a toddler and there are women who are physically stronger than a 6'4, 210 pound man. There are exceptions to the rule, there always is, but it does not happen often.

My last comment, however, is about how our society, thanks to modern feminism, preaches that women have to be afraid of EVERYTHING under the sun when crime rates have been at the lowest they have ever been.

I think the simple truth behind modern feminism is, in virtue, a very good one: Feminists want a world where women are not the victims of anything.

Not really seeing a problem with this.

Look, I'm not one of those utopian capitalists who slobs the market's knob, but sometimes market solutions work, and this is one of those times. The idea that companies will refuse to hire competent women in ~~2014~~ 2015 simply because they're women is absurd.

So: HeBrokerage is artificially limiting its ability to hire competent brokers and will have to compensate with above-market compensation to attract talent and pass those costs on to its customers. Now, either there's a real competitive advantage to hiring men, or there isn't; if there isn't, then customers will see that HeBrokerage costs more but doesn't deliver results, and HeBrokerage will fail.

The feminist angle on this is that HeBrokerage will have an unfair competitive advantage _because of sexism_, and that advantage has to be artificially removed, but there's not much evidence to support the feminist position.",guywithaccount,t2_cpl35,2,0,reddit1

This implies that they are *losing money* by failing to do so.  Don't confuse your micro and macro economics.  A single firm can't realistically attract more drivers without also paying it's existing drivers more.  You seriously think that shrinking the profit margin on existing customers in order to shrink the overall pool of customers is a smart business decision?  Everything here depends on marginal cost and price elasticity.  Taxi service is an interchangeable good and there is no added utility in having a female driver.  It's nothing more than marketing.

You're confusing business strategy with profitability. The best business strategy will be the least unprofitable, yes, but that doesn't mean that it guarantees that they will get enough revenue from that to make up their costs and actually turn a profit. The piece of data you're missing is that they're not profitable on weekends at the moment because they have too many cars to run and not enough drivers to service their customers.

Raising prices will allow for improved supply and better enable them to match their supply to their customer's demand. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be able to service enough customers at that price to stay profitable as a business at that time. They might only have 5 cars on the road at the current price, and be able to get 10 cars on the road at the market clearing price, and that might still not be worth the cost of maintaining the fleet and support personnel during that time.

icxf3tz,t1_icx3eqq,2022-06-19 09:38:37,MensRights,"Oh I'm sorry, are we casting for worst case scenarios?

Then no. Mens fear with feminists is that they'll end up abused, assaulted, accused, and disbelieved that any of the above is possible. Probably in prison since incarceration rates are several times more than that for women.

Less fear of direct death, more fear of having the rest of your existence be a tortured Kafkaesque nightmare where everyone believes you're a monster by default. Kind of like what you apparently believe given your ""venomous snakes"" example.

Context: Have been in an abusive relationship. Yes that included physical abuse. No I'm not going to elaborate on the details to assuage your next dismissal (""how can a woman hurt a man, she's tiny compared to him"" was I believe what one said). It was bad. *Really* bad.

Of course, feminist theory maintains that such a thing isn't really possible doesn't it? At least not without it fundamentally still being the male's fault as instigator:

> DV is intimate authoritarianism & if people could begin to see abuse as that-- an expression of an ideology/values system rather than as a personal failure or tragic but inevitable deviance-- they would also see the dire necessity of survivor-centered approaches to challenging it.

> As Bell Hooks said, ""the more accurate term for domestic violence is patriarchal violence because it reminds us that violence in the home is directly connected to male domination""

That's from a thread on r/feminism by the way. And if you tell me that bell hooks isn't one of the most important figures in modern feminist theory and literature, I'd call you a liar. And it's not a mischaracterisation either, it's not exactly a surprise she was writing news articles condemning the Central Park 5 when everyone else was suspicious about what was going on (to her, it was innate to men. Racism couldn't possibly be a factor).

icxb15z,t1_icx91bq,2022-06-19 08:36:18,MensRights,"I'm guessing that's to the last point. So: 

If a couple have sex, and the woman doesn't want to be a parent, she has the following options (many of which can be done unilaterally without including the partner in the decision):
  
* caps or diaphragms
  
* combined pill
  
* condoms
  
* contraceptive implant
  
* contraceptive injection
  
* contraceptive patch
  
* female condoms
  
* IUD (intrauterine device or coil)
  
* IUS (intrauterine system or hormonal coil)
  
* natural family planning (fertility awareness)
  
* progestogen-only pill
  
* vaginal ring
  
If any of those fail, she (currently) has the right to abort up to a certain point in the pregnancy. If the doctors are anything like the ones in the UK, they'll remove the man from the room to make sure there's no undue influence on the decision when talking to the woman. 
  
If she forgoes the multiple contraceptive and abortion options, she is able to give the child up for adoption. In the US, she can even use ""safe haven abandonment"" laws  to abandon the child at a police or fire station, no questions asked. This can all be done without any consent of the father (who may want to be a parent). 
  
Now let's flip it: a couple have sex, and the man doesn't want to be a parent. His options are:
  
* condoms
  
* vasectomy
  
If either of those fail, he is on the hook for 18+ years of child support for a child he didn't want. [Even if the conception came about through statutory rape of the father](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/). 
  
If a man wants to be a parent (or not), he needs the woman's cooperation. If a woman wants a man to be a parent, she doesn't require his cooperation at all. That is what unequal reproductive rights looks like.",EmirikolWoker,t2_7ky1i,17,0,reddit2

These jobs are scarce for everyone, men included.

Men do not bully each other and fight to get these jobs; they use performance and merit to try to beat off their competition, they go for outperformance.

So the fact that even if we assume that patriarchy “somehow created the job scarcity” it doesn’t explain why women behave negatively in that environment because men do not do the same thing.

This is ignoring the fact there is zero evidence that somehow “more top jobs exist for men than do for women” because quotas for women exist whilst they don’t for men, so how is that even possible?

The fact more men occupy top positions is probably to do with more men setting up businesses and corporations than women, so they occupy the chief position of their own ventures.

I know, hand on heart, that I didn't cause or meaningfully contribute to any of this, in fact I've had a hell of a lot of shit and disadvantages to deal with myself, as a man, and I've never blamed women for it (even if I should've).

But the fact is, I'm not responsible for these supposed sexism-induced hardships that women complain about. I believe in the right person for the job, always. I've never been a handsy cigar-smoking 1960s CEO, I've never been a 19th century politician. It's not and will never be my responsibility to make up for that, even if *were* universally true that benevolent sexism is somehow negative discrimination (and not protection or benefit) or that women have always been oppressed, denied freedom, and kept as pets.

So I don't take kindly to suggestions that I should be blamed, punished, or further disadvantaged for it.

I'm a grown adult. I'm responsible for *my* actions. Not that I have a choice in the matter, because nobody listens even if I explain all of the ways I've had potential and decades of my life kicked out of me, that's still apparently exclusively on me to deal with. If I start a ruck at work and I get fired for it then *I* fucked up. I don't get a free pass because ""patriarchy made me do it"" (even if, by feminist logic, *it did*). That's what happens when you're granted a role: you also adopt the responsibilities which come with it, whether you like it or not. It comes as a package deal. You want paying? You want respect?

How many times have you seen a women go shoot an assualt rifle into a crowd of people compared to a “man?” You could be lying for all I know about the men dying due to harder working conditions, but fine. Women have a higher mortality rate than men in all domestic violence and sexual assault cases. Girls under the age of 15 have a higher homicide rate than boys under the age of 15. Don’t lie and say more men are victims of sexual assault when that’s a blatant lie. I can 100% guarantee all the women you know have been victims of sexual assault or harassment: your mom, your sisters, cousins, aunts, grandma, any female relative you have. You can go ahead and ask them but do you honestly think they’re gonna tell YOU the truth. Nope, they’ll lie and tell you no, a man has never sexually assaulted them and just feed into this delusion that MEN are victims of sexual assault. If you wanted to say children and young boys(in their youth, meaning when they’re under the age of consent) are big victims of sexual assault then you’d be right. But again, it’s not just women who are sexually assaulting them. Men are pedophiles, just like women can be, too.

It has even given some women an opportunity to play the victim in a case they are not and actually get away with it, which is very disappointing. This runs both ways obviously. What’s worse is that the people who actually are victims are now not taken seriously because of the people who’ve taken advantage of the movement to make false accusations. This is an issue with “Me too” movement. It was created for people to speak out but has now lost credibility. On the other hand, the actual feminists who are fighting for the original purpose of feminism are overshadowed by the extremists and people who are corrupting the term. Of course, both men and women who commit crimes like this should be punished and penalized.

So this is probably pointless but i'll try and articulate to this subs posters what the problem is by using two comparatives terms for the same phenomanae.

Toxic masculinity V Restrained masculinity.

Masculinity is viewed by men as an internal driving force, something akin to a soul though not particularly spiritual.

If a man cannot express emotions because of societal expectations, there's broad agreement this is a problem and bad. The objection people have to the term toxic masculinity to describe this is that it is ascribing the problem to the masculinity rather than the restrictions placed on it.

While the former term casts masculinity, even a subset of it, in a negative light, the latter places emphasis on the restrictions and casts masculinity in neutral or positive terms.

This is why people claim you are shittalking masculinity and/or men. Because that is in fact what you're doing by using the term.

It casts masculinity as something that has to be policed and changed rather than liberated.

&#x200B;

Comparing these two terms for the phenomena being discussed highlights the problems with the term toxic masculinity as well as why everyone other than members of your very particular movement finds it offensive and anti-male. Insisting people don't understand what you're discussing is missing the point, because you've clearly not understood their objection either, and that's because you're discussing masculinity differently. You're all viewing it as a set of gender norms, and they're viewing it as an internal driving force. This is where the ""And you're wrong"" comes in:

There is a wealth of literature for thousands of years on how masculinity is an internal driving force, and the mens movements of the past few decades adopt this view. It is not for a womens movement (feminism) to up and decide to use the term to describe this thing about men in a way that doesn't jive with mens understanding of it, and then expect men to conform to their new usage.

&#x200B;

So if you want to discuss toxic gender norms, use those words. But if you use the word ""Masculinity"", you're referring to an internal driving force, not gender norms. Everybody outside the feminist cult understands this. You're being misunderstood because you're divorced from the rest of the species on how this term is understood, and you're using it in a way that is alien to men. That in itself is pretty ridiculous and offensive, that you think you can just up and decide to change the meaning of a word quite important to men.The problem isn't that we don't know what you're saying. It's that YOU don't know what you're saying when you use the word ""Masculinity"".

As such, when you use the term ""toxic masculinity"", you are in fact referring to something internal to the man and how it causes their problems, not to societal expectations. You are in fact victim blaming. And it's a ridiculous and presumptuous kind of appropriation for you to think you can come along and redefine masculinity and what it means in order to cast it as societal rather than internal, despite almost no men liking your movement or how it behaves.The double standards have also been highlighted, as has how this term in effect demonizes masculinity (Again, rather than the restrictions on it).

All of this in conjunction convinces people you're a hate movement actively malicious against men. I don't take that view. I think you've behaved presumptuously, arrogantly, and with no self-awareness over the term masculinity, that you've not really grasped the nature of peoples objection to your usage of the word toxic in relation to it, and that you're convinced that people ""Aren't understanding"" and ""aren't listening"" rather than wondering ""Am I just being incoherent?"". If you'd wondered the latter, you might have looked into why and realized the problem.

&#x200B;

Again. If you wanted to discuss toxic gender norms, then you should have done that. If you wanted to discuss restrictions on masculinity, then you should have used terminology to reflect that. Instead we got this garbled mess. It's also worth noting (Again), that mens movements have discussed this for a while, so the arrogance and misandry involved in the terms history is there too. If you really gave a shit, you would have read up with mens movements before throwing this garbage around. As a comparison, it's like up and deciding you ""care about native americans"" and then running around spamming a bunch of ideas about them they disagree with and find objectionable, all while never having consulted any.

&#x200B;

fjl2qb8,t3_fduess,2020-03-05 20:06:27,MensRights,"Hate to say this but this chart is a bit misleading, and the title is inaccurate. (using 2019 data below, but shouldnt be too different)

Bottom line: hours worked only explains part of the wage gap. The difference between ""all income"" earned between men and women isn't 56 to 44 as the title suggests.

~~The full time labor force in the USA is 56% male and that is what the number on the chart is representing. That number does NOT account for differences in average hours worked.~~ The fact that men worked 56% of total hours does not account for the fact that there are more men in the work force, and that number includes all workers, not just full time workers.

The difference in hours worked among full time workers is 43.5 hours for full time working men vs 41.1 hours for full time working women. As a ratio this is 51.4% hours worked by the average full time male employee vs the average full time female employee. Full time working men work about 6% more than full time working women (your title suggests more like 27% more)

Among ALL (non agriculteral) workers men work on average 41 hours per week and women work on average 36.6 hours. This number is heavily skewed because of the large percentage of women who work part time. According to the BLS 20M women worked part time compared to 13M men. However, the ""wage gap"" only compares full time workers so these are not the correct hours to compare.

Simply put, you cannot explain away the wage gap with only hours worked, although it is certainly a factor. For a more detailed breakdown of some of the main factors that go into the wage gap here is a write up I did: [http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/](http://rollfordamage.net/index.php/2018/04/10/a-guide-to-equal-pay-day/)

Seriously. If you could pay women less to do the same work, men would be replaced with women. Its basic economics. The reality is men work longer hours, have fewer gaps in employment, negotiate more aggressively for salary and gravitate towards different competencies than women. All of those things are variables that the wage gap myth doesn't bother to control for and every one is a personal choice.

Also no one went around using their ""power"" to force anyone to hire a male plumber or engineer. It's not discrimination that men and women make personal choices to develop different competencies and its gor sure not discrimination to employ a workforce that is 60% male from a population of applicants that is also 60% male.

If you look at union jobs, they pay everyone exactly the same. But most union jobs are hourly, and women end up working less and therefore making less.

The earnings gap for union work is exactly the same as non-union work though.

You can blame this on child care to an extent but lots of times this is actually the mother's choice; she prefers that her husband works extra (and/or pays child support) so she can stay home and ~~watch Jerry Springer~~ ""take care of the kids"".

Before having kids women usually work fewer hours than men.  Which is fine. It would just be nice if a) people were honest about this, and b) men were allowed to do the same thing without being punished for it.

You're using statistics that include a different number of men and women, and driving them down to a number that really should be average per man or per women. It's extermely misleading.

The problem is the wage gap is the average for women and average for men. Women on average earn 77c for every dollar a man earns. Your numbers are aggregate (and not even true). You're saying women in aggregate earn 77c per every dollar that men in aggregate earn, but you're also not factoring in that men's hours are paid at a higher rate.

You're not understanding why your methodology is terrible. Let me give you an example. 

Let's say there are 10 men and 5 women in the labor force. Let's say the men work 40 hours a week and each are paid $100/hr. The women work 40 hrs/week and each are paid $50/hr. 

The wage gap is the average that women earn 50c for every $1 a man earns. 

Ok but lets use the lauded ""CFOI methodology""

Well the men work a total of 400 hrs per week and the women work a total of 200 hrs per week. NEVERMIND THAT THERE ARE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN

therefore the wage gap IS PREDICTED TO BE 50c per $1! dont even bother thinking about the fact that this data is comparing an average to an aggregate!

The data happens to match 77 hrs worked per 100 hrs worked by women in aggregate vs men in aggregate, but that's just coincidence and is an awful predictor of earnings of an average woman vs an average man.

canui33,t3_1gteil,2013-06-22 03:51:16,MensRights,"I never understood why this was a contentious issue.  It doesn't bother me when I come across a toilet seat that's down.  I take the .5 seconds required to move it to the desired position.   

Likewise, If a toilet seat is up and i'm doing a number two, again I will simply move it to the desired position with no fuss or need to be concerned.

Why a few women (not sure how many, but I don't think it's even most women) think that it's somehow this grevious barbaric offense to leave the seat up is entirely beyond my ability to comprehend.  

The rationale of falling in just strikes me as bizarre.  Don't people look?  I always look.  Even if I'm not sitting down I look to make sure the seat is up first.   These women who are constantly falling in must be backing up to the toilet like semi trucks with no rear-view mirrors or something.

Assuming everyone uses the toilet for number one and number two at a rate of 70% and 30%, respectively, by everyone leaving it the way they used it, men already do more work than women! This is also assuming putting it up and putting it down is equal amounts of work.

This, though, I am completely fine with, because what the fuck. At times I find myself reaching for the seat when it's already up and I have a moment of ""holy shit this is a thing I do all the time,"" because it's such a motor reflex to move the seat at this point. How often do you hear people complaining that they need to remove their pants? However, by asking men to always put it back down you're shifting the already discriminating male work load to a workload of ""2"" in 7/10 visits, while the female workload is reduced to 0 for all visits, which makes no sense.

This I have not done the maths on, though, but I assume everyone leaving it as they used it is the best distribution of work possible, while everyone putting it down is the most biased one possible. This would probably need to be graphed, though, also with respect to different rates of pissing (I have no idea how accurate 70/30 is).",WhipIash,t2_7egwu,42,0,reddit2

If all men suddenly *chose* to sit down, yes, but that's even more hypothetical than the question. It's downright absurd to think all men would suddenly get that thought - hence what you're asking is for men to accommodate you/women.

>More hygienic

Very, very slightly more hygienic. Arses don't tend to be the cleanest of body parts, and they still have to touch the seats. Urine is sterile in the bladder, and is only added bacteria from the urethra, so in terms of hygiene it doesn't really matter much - toilet seats are not dinner plates, no matter what.

>And about people not giving shit about what I think about stuff, I don't really care.

Exactly. So how does your suggestion in any way relate to the question of why men should put down the seat for women, while women shouldn't put it up? That's what I don't get.

>it's about order, or tidiness

No it isn't. Now you're referring to the *lid* of the toilet, and that's not what's being discussed *at all* - it's the seat.

Some people's natural instinct is to analyze the situation to see how and why it happened. Well, if you find something that the girl did/didn't do and point it out, it can be taken as victim blaming. 

For example, victim blaming: If you had locked your car, your laptop wouldn't have been stolen. It implies it is the victims fault that someone committed a crime against them because they didn't take precautionary measures. That it is their fault for ____ bad thing. 

This is often conflated by various people with the following;

One of the ways to prevent this from happening again is to take steps to prevent car break ins. Lock your car and don't leave anything of value in it. 

Which isn't victim blaming. Its advice for how you can prevent future thefts. The feminist narrative is that women shouldn't have to take precautions to prevent rape. Which simply isn't realistic in todays society. It is never the victims fault for a crime or bad thing happening to them, however, it is their responsibility to ensure their own safety. This is true for everyone about every type of crime. 

Some really don't like that reasoning, and try to ensure that anyone who does such is labeled a victim blamer, thus their opinion is invalid and can be ignored. ",,,21,0,reddit2

People in the developed world seem to have a fanatical obsession with avoiding bacteria at all costs. What they completely don't understand is that they NEED to be exposed to harmful bacteria on a regular basis or the risk of getting seriously ill increases. That doesn't mean pouring vials of anthrax down their throats or anything but it does mean that avoiding all germs at all costs is actually UNHEALTHY. Like muscles that don't get exercised , if your immune system doesn't adapt to what are otherwise fairly innocuous bacteria , eventually it can't fight the newest strains.

Whatever germs are present in the average toilet bowl are NOT going to affect anybody provided they aren't licking the damned thing. Even compromised immune systems are safe from whatever is floating around the water line. As long as it isn't typhoid or cholera etc. , there's virtually nothing to fear. Further , the fact is that that toilet seat isn't exactly a vacuum-sealed unit. If it's floating in the air , putting the seat down won't do much to stop if from floating further afield. Besides that , your main point of exposure is going to be from sitting on the seat and touching the handle as well as the the toilet paper roll itself. 

TL;DR -

1)Don't be so paranoid , people.

2)You NEED to be exposed to bacteria or it BECOMES dangerous.

3)Putting the lid down won't do a damned thing to stop the bacteria anyway.

Well, this would be the case if we were talking about what guys traditionally think ""rape"" is defined as.  However, with some women referring to sex they later regret as ""rape"", this gets completely muddled.  

I once made the mistake of talking to a ""rape"" victim who regretted sex she had.  She goes into a story about dressing up in her super flirty outfit, flirting with a guy, touching him, kissing, rubbing her hands on his crotch, taking him back to her place, undressing to tease him, ripping his shirt off and rubbing him, giving him oral, letting him do the same, rubbing his privates on hers and then ""regrettingly letting him violate her insides for the next 4 hours"" with his penis and then again in the morning when she woke him up with more oral.  At no point did she make any signal or communication that she didn't want to do that.  In fact, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume she wanted to have sex, given all of the earlier activity.  But, she somehow remembered her husband at the last moment and didn't want to go any further, but she did anyway.

The slightest suggestion that she alter her previous behavior in any way was met with aggressive ""victim blaming"" rhetoric.

I just don't know how to even talk about this now.  My brain tells me to not let her get away with calling herself a rape victim, but I fear feminists will consider me a misogynist.  I wish I could help someone not be in a negative situation, but any attempt to suggest different behavior is met with hostility.

The advice given is that there is a set of reasonable steps that anyone can take in order to prevent a crime; these steps differ from crime to crime. In some situations what you wear DOES make a difference.

We're not demanding that you cover up and don't wear what you like. But just acknowledge that sometimes it does draw undue attention, and in order to protect yourself from that, you MAY want to re-consider.

Women are bullies by reputation destruction. This is a highly robust and validated fact. Women arent angels. They're people. And people like to bully. When bullying is rewarded by the desired outcome, or at least not punsihed, it will happen again, and get worse. Its like when people look at a little bit of porn and then go deeper and deeper. And Im not arguing pro/con porn, just how it works for a lot of people.

If we had a system that was ""wise"", we'd probably have a system that seems monstrously unfair, like solomon cutting a baby in half. A system devised wherein any accuser is believed, but has to take 1/10th of the punishment of the acccused at conviction, might entirely eradicate false accusations.

It might even eradicate frivolous true accusations, the kind where the boy tries to kiss the girl on a date, he makes contact, she pulls away, and then calls the campus police for his sexual assault later on. He was supposed to make a move. She's punishing him for not being attractive enough.

if she receives a slight injury for it, she decides whether or not the harm to her was big enough and harmful enough to accept the punishment she'd also take.

That's the only way I see sexual assault/rape law truly working properly, because there's one critical thing everyone misses about this issue: Sex is an intrinsic and necessary function of humanity, and the only thing that distinguishes it from the horrific acts of violence known as rape are the mental state of both individuals.

That's literally all it is. When something is so common in people and when it looks almost identical to a massive criime, false positives are easy.",Burglingthebrownlog,t2_8uyyyup0,58,0,reddit3

The fact that universities enrol, and graduate these people based on nothing more than doing that is a ringing indictment of the status quo, and I guess the main reason why we're here, but I think if you go and do your bachelors' in, say, chemical engineering you might find it's less bad.

A nurse I worked with would constantly hit on me, call me “daddy” or “baby” and Inappropriately place her hands around my shoulders or waist; several times she came up behind me and did it. 

I even recorded her saying disgusting stuff to me and presented that as evidence too. Only to be told “you shouldn’t have had your phone on you during work hours” and “we spoke to her and she said she was only joking and being friendly with you” the recording wasn’t even seriously addressed. 

Well, I finally reached my tipping point a couple weeks ago and confronted her and this is *after* I’ve filed several complaints through HR and the chain of command— only to be ignored and told it’s not that big of a deal; just workplace “horseplay”....

But guess who was just told that by confronting her on my own and in front of my fellow nursing staff (and respectfully so I might add) that due to my behavior she filed a *single* complaint against me (which was immediately handled) saying... “she felt threatened by me” and “afraid for her safety due to my “rage filled outburst”.... 

All I said and calmly so... “was please stop touching me and speaking to me in the way you have. It’s inappropriate and makes me uncomfortable. I do not like it and it’s not a game” to which she cried and made a scene as if it was my fault for taking offense.... 

Smh, this is the world we live in now and I couldn’t imagine what it must feel like to not even see a stall for “men only” at your job... I guess it’s their way of telling you to... piss outside... if the restrooms are full.

I suspect they did this is for two reasons. First, women tend to frequent the restroom more than men. Second, the perception that women are cleaner than men. The first one I'm fine with, the second everyone knows is a complete falsehood. Both bathrooms get disgusting and I've heard from many the ladies restroom can be much worse.

NB: they are 3 cubical toilets (sometime a toilet is 2 urinals) with real walls and full doors (not US toilets) in a big room. And big rooms are segregated. So it's not really like OP because it wasn't think the same way.

But it's well thought, when you have 2 men toilets next to each other, the one below, above or both is for women. So whatever your gender you can find one nearby. And I think HR and secretaries (80% women HR and 100% in secretary) are trying to get openspaces near the women toilets.

I haven't heard anyone complained about this. I worked with a woman on the first floor, near men toilets (women's one are above, below is the reception) and before leaving, if she had to, rather than go up one level then down two, she used the men's one and I haven't heard any complaints either, she didn't come to the urinals to check.

if 4 men are waiting for the rest room, 1 of them would be waiting outside, where as if the gender was reversed, all 4 women can go w/o any problem.

>  
>[Air pollution linked to 3.2 million new diabetes cases in one year](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/health/air-pollution-diabetes-study/index.html)

It's interesting that on the same page is a link to an article about air pollution causing 3.2 million new cases of diabetes a year. I wonder if the study took account of this?

>Researchers looked at data from 7,065 Canadians who were tracked over 12 years. What they found was that women who consistently worked 45 hours or more a week had a 63&#37; greater risk of diabetes compared with those who worked between 35 and 40 hours a week.

If you follow the link to the study, what they propose is...

>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?   
>  
>► Promoting the regular workweek of 35–40 hours might be an effective strategy for preventing diabetes among women.

I normally would not have an issue with this as long as women get paid for the work they do, but with this *wage gap* horseshit being pushed as a major agenda item, I'm afraid I'll have to oppose this in principle.

Working more hours hasn’t been shown to **increase the risk of diabetes** any more than living in a crime-ridden neighborhood *increases the risk* you’ll commit a crime.




Working more hours is *correlated with* an increase in diabetes diagnoses. Just like living in a high crime area *is correlated with* crime, and living in a predominantly gay area *is correlated with people who engage in homosexual sex.*


But working long hours doesn’t increase your RISK. Just as living in a high crime hood doesn’t make you more likely to commit a crime (if you’re law abiding, you won’t) nor does living in a gay area make you more likely to engage in homosexual sex.

##The Facts about the Gender Wage Gap in Canada

The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between women and men in the workplace.

It is a widely recognized indicator of women’s economic equality, and it exists to some extent in every country in the world.

A 2015 UN Human Rights report raised concerns about “the persisting inequalities between women and men” in Canada, including the “high level of the pay gap” and its disproportionate effect on low-income women, racialized women, and Indigenous women.1

Out of 34 countries in the OECD, Canada had the 7th highest gender wage gap in 2014.2 To learn more about economic inequality in Canada, see",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,5,0,reddit1

It certainly *seems* like a problem that could be related to sexism or similar factors.

The answer, of course, is because women don't work in dangerous jobs as much as men, meaning they're rarely in a position to die due to a workplace accident, so it makes sense that a higher percentage of women's workplace deaths would be due to someone deliberately trying to kill them. It's just something that isn't immediately apparent just from the raw data.

To isolate for workplace shooting, you need to remove other causes of death from the equation. Total number of men murdered, total number of women murdered, and compare those % of total people murdered to the breakdown of hours worked by sex.

EDIT 2: I have drafted an email that all here may use to send in if they wish:

Dear Mr. Keating, 

I’m writing you to urge you to redress some false implications made in an article you recently authored titled: “Murder is the second most likely way for women to die at work”.

While the title (by itself) of your article is indeed correct, you implicitly state within the 2nd paragraph of the article that the issue of workplace murders “disproportionately affects women”. This is simply not true and is not supported by any honest statistical analysis. A correct interpretation of the stats (once you normalize the numbers and correct for total hours worked) suggests that men are 1.4 times more likely to be murdered at work than women, and more men are murdered at work each year than the total number of women workplace deaths.  

If you’re trying to draw readers attention to specific domestic violence issues facing women, or to the injustice of fellow journalist comrades being gunned down in their offices at the hands of violent fanatics, then your efforts are obscured by playing games of gender politics and pushing statistical misrepresentations. Readers deserve better than this.

Wrong. The problem with the article is false correlation and reversing causality. The rate of death does not influence the rate of murder, but the reverse is true. It doesn't matter how many men die on the job of non murder causes when trying to make a supporting statement of women's safety at work. You look at the total number of men murdered, the total number of women murdered and you compare that to the total number of men murdered at work to the total number of women at work. When you do that the authors assumed position falls apart.

What's even worse about this is women are at much more risk to be murdered outside the workplace. When taking all murders (on or off the job) into account, 66% are males, 33% are females. But when we look at the ratio of male to female murders it is roughly 80% male to 20% female. Now, male to female work ratio isn't equal. Of all hours worked approximately 60% are by men and 40% by women, so that increases a man's chance of being murdered at work some and lowers a woman's chance, but still doesn't explain the discrepancy.

To give an example, let's say that men have a .1% chance of dying, do to any reason, per hour worked. If you created a stacked bar chart, obviously .1% is to small to display. There's an easy fix though, simply omit the likely hood of not dying. Now, you have a bar chart that shows the percentage of a percentage (I.E. men have an 8% chance of 0.1% chance of dying due to murder every hour, or, 0.008%) All in all, this works.

Until you compare it to the odds of women dying. Let's say the odds of a woman dying is 0.01% per hour worked. Again, too small to represent, so you do it like you did the men's.

It's not. There is not a two way causality. Think of the correlation between ice cream sales and murder. Ice cream sales are higher at times when murder rates are higher. Increased ice cream sales don't cause higher murder rates. Higher murder rates don't cause higher ice cream sales. 

The same is true for the base murder rate. A higher murder rate does not increase the accident rate in jobs. A higher accident rate does not cause a higher murder rate in jobs.

I don't really care about the gender issue, I just think it's a misleading graph in it's own right.

- 2 women die at work: 1 murder, 1 choke on ham-sandwich. 50% death rate by murder. 

- 50,000 men die at work: 3,500 by murder, 15K accident, 15k autoerotic asphyxia, 16.5k bored to death.  7% murder rate.

In truth, the likelihood of being murdered at work could be equal across genders or even *greater* amongst men, but if women are *less likely* to die from other causes then that style of graph will make it appear that women are disproportionately murdered on the job.

For example, a workplace with 50 male employees and 50 female employees could have 2 male employees murdered on the job and 2 female employees murdered on the job. Equal numbers. If however male employees also saw 8 accidental deaths on the job while female employees only saw 2, a stacked graph like that will show that men only have a 20% chance of being murdered on the job while women have a whopping *50% chance!* Stripped of numerical context, this leads many people to assume that women are being murdered more than men on the job or that women have a greater chance of being murdered even though both men and women are *equally as likely* to be murdered at work.

Not relevant.

Jurisdiction in so far as who ""should"" be right does not matter.  Jurisdiction in so far as who as the most power, does.  I was too vague before.

> The German legal definition, for example

It's still not the word ""murder"" though.  It's German, with its own definitions, even if they are extremely similar and often used as in translations.  They may overlap at times, maybe even often, but your definition is not the same as the English word ""murder.""  Because in English, it has to be unlawful.  That's what it means now.  

> A term for a crime that is not concerned with justness? Colour me surprised. Can there be e.g. theft of something that's your own? Do firefighters kidnap babies out of burning buildings?

I think a better example would be corrupt cops that are acting with in the law when committing unjustified homicide.  They won't be labeled as murderers by the government.  The law has to draw lines about what is a crime and how to punish for those crimes.  The term is a specific label for type of homicide.  The law is supposed to make it just, but it turns out that humans can be corrupted by power and will act in unjust ways.  Is this all actually a surprise to you?  How old are you?

It was a fairly off topic thing to mention anything of insults.  I don't really think it's relevant at all.  It being an insult has *nothing* to do with what I was posting about.

Like 

> And the result was: ""Soldiers are murderers"" is not even fit to be considered an insult,

What the fuck does this have to do with anything?  Who cares?  

The point was that ""government approved murder"" is simply an oxymoron.  That's all my original post was stating, and you are wanting to get into it.  It's a simple concept though.  If it is government approved, it's not murder.  End of story.  German words can be defined differently, but they aren't the English word for ""murder.""  It turns out, words are not strictly bound to the same definition as the word they originated from.  

> But I guess we left good-faith interpretation behind us some time ago.

Are you kidding?  Did you see your own first post in this conversation?  Your point is wild.  ""If you use a different language and also consider war unjustified we can maybe make an argument that saying that soldiers are murderers is not an insult.""  You end with some quote and are like ""and he calls himself a murderer!!"" I don't give a fuck what who calls themselves.  ""government approved murder"" is an oxymoron.

... and then men _do everything else._ All of the physically demanding, _all of the skilled labor jobs_ (people are constantly forgetting those) AND... AND all of the most mentally challenging work. 

The easiest way to look at it is.. Men basically do everything. We invent, build, maintain and repair the entire fucking world while 95% of women CHOOSE.. very important.. CHOOSE to either work with children or are assistants of some kind (nurses and secretaries). And then a whole lot of seat warming government and non-profit jobs as well that produce nothing. Then a whole lot of housewives and single mothers on welfare.

Think about it.. 95% of women choose to be Secretaries, Low grade school teachers, nurses and accountants.. what does that sound like? _A wife._ Only today instead of women doing that for one man, i.e., a husband, they go do all of that for strangers and put their children into kiddie farms all day. Pretty fucking STUPID, HUH? HAHA Goddamn, that's fucking stupid. LOL",Ovendice,t2_bb6yt,13,0,reddit3

Well, children stop being cute when they constantly throw tantrums, throw food, color on your floors, and chase the cat around.

Here is the thing though.....most of that happens because mothers who stay at home ""mother"" their children...they do not RAISE them...i.e. they pander to them, try and be their best friend, etc.  

Being a stay-at-home mom is much easier today (in terms of work done) than it was 50 years ago, as stay at home moms no longer ""keep house.""

My wife does not stay at home, but the general lack of housekeeping still holds true. I watch my wife spend an hour playing games trying to fed my son, watching all his cartoons with him, turning bath-time into a 45 minute ordeal.  

If I have to run the show for the evening, the kid eats in 30 min or doesnt get fed. Bathtime is 15 minute tops. 1 cartoon, 1 book, and 3 songs and to bed.

I have no idea what I would do all day if I didn't work- it's especially hard to go do something when you _have no money because you're not working._ Women don't seem to need a real purpose in life though- they're perfectly content to live completely meaningless lives with no actual goals and happy to never achieve anything at all. 

In fact, work for them is something they're constantly trying to get _out_ of not do more of.. and then they wonder why they never accomplish anything in life. So bizarre, stupid and insane. What makes women miserable though is jealousy and entitlement- when some other female gets the guy who makes all the money and she gets to live like a queen and never has to work. 

Feminism was a complete and utter failure and the fact that 84% of women polled say they want to be housewives is the ultimate proof Feminism failed. And it was stupid from the very beginning. Except for the occasional terminator cunt who just has to prove she's a real man, the vast majority of women want nothing to do with actual work. Oh, they certainly want a _title_ though, a pedigree, which is why so many of them go to college, so they can hold that over everyone's head all day and never shut the fuck up about it.

You're not going to believe this, but women have an extremely difficult time just simply adhering to a set schedule, showing up on time, working all day and coming in everyday and being reliable. Women are insanely flaky and squirrely- exactly the same way they are in relationships- fickle, moody, unaccountable and great deal of that attitude comes from their spiteful nature like some kind of insolent teenager, ""You can't MAKE me do anything, I don't have to do what you say, na na na na na,"" extremely, extremely childish behavior. This notion that TV and movies try to push that it is men who are irresponsible and flaky is complete bullshit and it's the opposite. If men were are unreliable and spiteful and immature as women, the entire infrastructure would collapse.

Women just want STATUS- that is what they really, really want; to be able to say they are some title with some degree, thus making themselves 'better' than others. And of course to just prove that they can finish school and get a degree. But the actual day to day work they despise and see that as below them. That's why the few women who DO go to college and become something serious like doctors or engineers quit after just a few years. 

And it's also why in 50 years since they gained equal rights, 95% of  women have never just rolled up their sleeves and gotten to work competing with men in the workplace. 

They simply don't want to be at work and really 99% of them simply CAN'T work a full time job day after day for years. That's why the turnover is so dramatic with women and they leave the workforce at 3 times the rate as men. Women are just not suited for the workplace; too emotional, always sick, too moody, too volatile, too jealous, spiteful, petty and vindictive.

I agree with this TBH. My gf gets bad periods and always has to take leave for it. That said, not all women have it so bad they need the day off, and they'll now get an additional 12 days leave compared to their male co-workers, which is quite a lot (most places dont even have that much sick leave or annual leave). 

Also my problem with the thinking ""accept the biological differences"" is that it is not applied consistently. For example - feminists demand equal pay and other outcomes like 50% of executives or the board be women, after they cut their career short to be mothers (or now take period leave). So ignoring the fact men are biologically wired to work more and pursue higher job titles.

  Or demanding 50% of engineers/tech workers be women, completely ignoring the fact men are more likely to enter these jobs from a biological standpoint (men are more likely to be builders, creators, tinkerers). 

Basically it seems feminists only ""accept the biological differences"" when and only when it benefits women.

**TLDR** we should accept and celebrate our biological differences, but this line of thinking should be applied consistently.",,,3,0,reddit1

Ie, unless he complied with all the medical demand, he would have to pay the employee a full salary to do nothing.

You know what my uncle did ? He paid for the equipment, he paid for mandatory training for all employees so that they'd know what to do if the employee in question had a seizure or any other medical emergency at work.

Exactly. I had maybe one day last year where I experienced deliberating pain at work to the point I had to ask my employer to go to the pharmacy across the street and get some some painkillers. I took the painkillers, sat down in the office for 20 minutes and I was good to work again. 

If the day off a month was paid I'd probably take leave regardless of having my period or not, cause who doesn't want to get paid for not doing work? However, if the day off a month is an unpaid day, I probably wouldn't take it more than needed. 

I think unpaid leave is fine, but to pay women for not working one day a month every month is just incentivising them to not work whetter they have a period or not.

Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; however this would also mean if she did end up having a painful period she would've used her time (depending on how this policy works ).


By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

One thing I do agree with is that this policy unfoundedly assumes that all women have painful periods; that's not true, and it may become stigmatised to take leave on that basis.

With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive.

No they aren't. The day off is explicitly only for women and transgender persons, regardless if they experience period. There are no special day offs for other conditions as far as I'm aware. 

>And 'transgender' probably refers to female to male transgenders 

The policy expressively stated all women and transgender employees. 

>Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; 

As far as I know, female employees are not required to prove that they're on their period in order to apply for this leave. This is in line with some organisations that provide similar schemes. 

>By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

It's one day per month. I do not think a doctor's note is required as it is not categorised as a variant of sick leave. 

>With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? 

Because it's objectively unfair and recognising its unfairness and advocating for more conditions to be included aren't mutually exclusive. There has been some progress for Flipkart where they increase paid paternity leave from 10 to 15 days. That's a good sign but it's trivial when compared to their paid maternity leave scheme, which stands at 6 months with full pay. Mothers also have the option to choose 4 months of flexible work arrangement with full pay (3 months for fathers with no guarantee of full pay) and 1 year (only 3 months for fathers) of unpaid leave. The most blatant discrimination (other than the one in OP's topic) is that adoptive mothers (who do not experience postpartum recovery) get 6 months of paid leave whilst adoptive fathers only get 6 weeks, regardless of extent of caregiving. 

>And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive. I just find this all this outrage ridiculous and out of place, when there's more to be concerned with. 

All employees of Flipkart get 20 days of annual leave, 12 days of sick leave, 2 days of optional holidays and 1 day of special leave. They also get 5 days of marriage leave and unlimited bereavement (compassionate) leave. The introduction of this scheme effectively means female and transgender employees get 13 days of special leave, compared to the 1 day male employees get. 

Flipkart employs around 42145 employees. According to my knowledge, most technicians and delivery personnel are men, so no, I do not believe they have a substantially larger female employee base, not that it should matter anyway.",Solid-Perspective98,t2_8i5ikeia,1,0,reddit1

I'm a guy, so I have no idea how it actually feels, but I have a sister, I have a mother, I have female friends and not a single one of them ever was near fainting or actually has that amount of pain that's worse than like a slight headache.

I know that some women have it worse - but every time this topic comes up in a discussion at reddit where it's about getting extra free (and especially with paid) days off, all the females act like having your menstruation is a near-death experience. Makes me always wonder about the actual average feeling of women during that time.

All humans start with having a monthly hormone cycle function (I believe it’s hypothalamus that does it). in the uterus for those that get the androgen production signal (from SRY gene, commonly on Y chromosome), that cycle function turns off since testosterone production in males follows a daily cycle rather than monthly. 

The hypothesis around why taking estrogen as hrt for transgender women brings back a sort of monthly cyclical pattern is because that hypothalamus function like reactivates.

Actually, No. Equity is best defined as this- 

[https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509](https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509)

And I never saw this as a part of the ""feminist propaganda"".

There are things that I agree with on both sides and there are things on which I disagree with both sides. That does not say that I am tilted/with one side completely. 

In fact, my take on the whole gender issue is this-

If you look at the picture that I have linked above, you will see that one person has advantage and still is being given the same opportunity as the other, when they don't even need it.

I think that is the case on both sides. There are things and laws that women don't need but still they are being given more and also, there are things that men desperately require to achieve equal status in the society but they are STILL being denied those things. But, please understand when I say this, that this does NOT mean that there aren't things that women are disadvantaged at too, just like MEN are Disadvantaged in certain aspects of life!!! Both sides have certain disadvantages where they require some support to maintain equity!!! And while the feminists (the more public ones in my opinion) are only interested in gaining the required support for women, the MRAs (some of them, NOT the majority of them) are interested in gaining the required support for men. Notice that the ratio of people on both sides working ""only"" for the specific gender is different (for feminists, there is a majority like that: and for MRAs, there is minority for that- the rest of the members in both groups are striving for true equity, but sadly the disparity and disagreement between the two groups has not been able to help them achieve the said purpose).

As we know that a lot of ""feminazis"" have always fought for even more and more rights for women even though it may require them to Step on Men's rights to achieve it. They think- ""Hey!! How come Men get to do that!!!! We also want to do that!!!"" - even though the task at hand is something that they don't have a need to do. And that is exactly where we criticize them and distance ourselves from them. But doing the same thing that they are doing just makes us as petty as them!!

I never faced any criticism for my views on this subreddit before and I have always provided with gender-neutral views on anything. This is the first time that my gender neutral view has been soo criticized even though I am not completely disagreeing with you. I have my own opinion which I have formed after having seen both sides' point of view and I think I am happy with my opinion, even if other people may find it to be ""feminist propaganda""- which it isn't. 

I don't think that we should criticize giving them a day off, because periods can be a lot painful for some women. I always thought that a thing like this would always be appreciated in this subreddit because I have seen people in this subreddit being supportive to both genders, not just one, and that is what made me like this subreddit more, But alas, there will always be some people who will always see things from only one side of things and not both sides.

hzgx727,t1_hzgtqns,2022-03-05 16:57:52,MensRights,"the definition is different based on context. 

In procreation contexts it means what gametes one produces. female/male is a designation for plants too for example. if we are talking about procreation contexts for humans if can be done but we need to remember that is a very narrow section of human sexuality so isn’t absolute truth. it looks at a human from the perspective of just intercourse for procreation, assuming heterosexual and only having sex for procreation. 

In more society based contexts “female” is a phenotypic sex designation usually, so genitalia shape. That is how the F or M gender marker is assigned. When there is an intersex infant that has a penis that is considered too small for the doctor’s liking, they can perform surgery to turn the infant “female”. Even if it could have XY chromosomes and gonads were supposed to be producing sperm. (yes this is very common for intersex infants who have a penis too small for our society’s definition of male so they mutilate it for the sole reason of fitting into the sex dyad) 

woman is a gender identity and is not synonymous with female.

that average is not indicative of an individual man. grouping by gender isn’t useful in this case when the premise is you want larger and more stronger people to be accounted. There can be women and non-binary and intersex and female and whatever designation of human you want to be put there since it’s not all men or male humans. The premise is to consider humans that are in the larger and stronger end of the spectrum, which isn’t gendered. 

When you gender things it creates a lot of problems. Such as gendering sexual assault. Right now it’s marketed as a woman problem so men have to fight to get it acknowledged for them too. or we could have just not gendered it and it would have eliminated a lot of issues and people would have actually started to understand how sexual assault works. 

not all human female menstruate. women is a gender identity. if you don’t want to be transphobic and want to understand the full complexity around how people work you need to separate female and woman. because really those are different things. woman as human female is a very simplistic definition for those that don’t study human sexuality as a science.

Man and woman is not genetics. Notice how neither are the stereotypes you used are genetics. 

Man and woman are now words to describe gender identities that are on a spectrum. Just like non-binary. Eventually those labels will drop since they keep growing. You have bigender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer too. Usually when terms keep growing it’s because we are working on a spectrum but people don’t see it this way yet. Sexuality is a spectrum so labels will keep growing until people realize you can’t label every variation and there is no point. So people will just be allowed to date/have sex with whoever they feel like without labeling it. it is difficult to label human experiences into neat boxes. 

Like right now the terms “trans masculine” or “presenting femme” are getting used. Instead of gender identity like man or woman. 

A more higher approach to think of it is forget everything you know about gender. Stop gendering everything like bathrooms, pronouns, clothes, sleeping areas. Stop assuming things about people based off their body parts. You now are left with just humans with various genitals shape, various hormones, expressing themselves as they wish, dressing how they wish, no laws restricting anything by gender or genitals or bodily function. If someone wishes to adjust their gender expression with hormones or surgery then that is easily given to them. 

A world where the concept of gender becomes irrelevant is called gender inclusive which is what we are moving to. It is in essence the point of real feminism. Gender equity. Such that the concept of gender becomes as irrelevant as eye colour. It is possible to design systems such that body parts, hormones, gender expression, gender identity etc. doesn’t impact any part of a person’s life. 

Tip: you won’t see what I mean if you keep thinking in binary gender and that sex = gender. you won’t get it trying to rearrange two blocks. You need to throw out the 2 blocks and think higher.

I actually can imagine it a little better now: I had 2 herniated discs in my early 20s which were misdiagnosed for over half a year.

So I know that kind of pain where fetal position is the only thing you want to be. I mean, I had luck - it got so worse I lost feelings in my legs, called an ambulance and then it was discovered that it wasn't just some muscle-pain but... 2 herniated discs and got treated accordingly. But with menstruation... if it's so extreme that you cry because the pain can be soooo much and it happens every month: Isn't there anything you can do against it? IIRC there are quite some women who take the pill just for that instead of primarily as an contraceptive and that's also why there are so many kind of 'the pill'.

Even when talking about equity, there are some women who experience a low to moderate amount of pain and some who experience massive pain. It wasn’t equal to begin with. I’m sure women with pcos might need more than a day some months. It’s going to feel unfair to the woman that has to lay in bed for two days, taking an extra day off, compared to a woman who gets basically an extra vacation day.

Either every disease, condition, and issue is treated with the highest priority, or none of them are. You don’t get to decide what affects someone, to some women their mental health might be way more painful than periods. Why is that not being prioritized? This creates a system that’s chooses what ailments are worthy of sympathy.

I’m not saying pure equality is fair, it’s clearly not. Life isn’t fair to begin with. But it doesn’t create an artificial unfairness like equity does. If the least privilege person is given enough resources to succeed, it shouldn’t matter that the most privileged person is also given the same.

If you have some sexual orientation it has nothing to do with whether you are man or woman.

It's biology not psychology or social studies.

Definition of women is human female and definition of men is human male.

If you want to change definitions to fit your views then you are destroying the language. It's like this is the only true God.

Plus gender at first was to categorize things in genders.

There is a reason why in different languages they don't use translation for gender but go with the English word.

A lot of languages they have three genders masculine, feminine and neutral. For example Germany has Der die das.

English was gendered once too and you have up on that.

Now if you want to go by gender stereotypes. Like okay this woman doesn't fit the stereotype of a woman so it is a man is really weird.

And then once again how would you make sure the person is menstruating.

And even in sexual assault it is good to specify the gender. For example woman is more likely to be SA by a man and vice versa.

And even if it wouldn't be gendered it will be men perpetrator women victim.

Like in all the articles about women being raped in military. Yes tragedy but why it never stated who raped them. In cases of men it states that it is done by other men. In women cases where they are victims nothing. Nothing about the perpetrator. So people will go to default it is men.

If we want to fully acknowledge biological differences then we have to accept that men and women will have different rules, rights and responsibilities that all come with different advantages and disadvantages. Under this precondition it would be fine to give only women time off during their periods. It would also be fine to have male-only military service. But this also implies different social standings for women and men.

The other way to approach this - and this is what society currently wants - is to go full equality. The catch is that this only applies to women. Genuinely embracing this strategy would imply that if women get time off to deal with their periods, men also should get time off.

Sexuality is a complex field that draws from biology and sociology and psychology among other scientific fields. you can’t look at it in a vacuum of just biology. You won’t understand the full picture. 

Definition of woman being human female and definition of man being human male is your definition in context of I guess refusing to acknowledge that not everyone is cisgender? “Female” can mean “produces ova gametes” which apples to plants too. It can also mean a certain genitalia shape like for humans it’s vulva, “female” for humans is more about genital shape because that is how F or M is given on birth certificates. 

It’s not destroying language. It is adding more definitions to account for more complex concepts. we can call heterosexual normal and everyone else disorder, because we used to think that. We thought sodomy was just bad. Meaning “sex” actually just meant intercourse. But today there are more words to describe complexity around sex. Sex no longer just means intercourse. we have words like anal sex, instead of sodomy. And intercourse/coitus, oral sex etc. To explain things better. 

It makes sense to identify as non-binary in medicine. Doctors should be specific about what they need to know. “Do you have ovaries?” “are you a person that menstruates?” “are you testosterone-dominant?” “do you have a prostate?”. 

Gendering sexual assault shows people don’t understand the complexity around sexual assault.

Transgender men can ask to not have periods because they cause gender dysphoria. Anyone else regardless of gender identity can ask to not have periods, they aren’t necessary. Because there are currently methods to stop them by taking birth control non-stop. The placebo week is not mandatory. It was there to give periods so people verify they are not pregnant. If skipped then it can have the period not come ever while taking regularly. 

Taking Depo Provera, a shot every 3 months, and having IUD which is in the uterus for 5 years before changed also has the effect of stopping periods. There is no placebo week with Depo Provera or IUD.

Yes exactly. It’s education for “people with a cervix”. (Word “people” first is more respectful). a doctor can ask you if you have a cervix. If you don’t know they can check with an ultra sound if it’s relevant.

This would be great because then people who are XY with androgen insensitivity syndrome would be checked for if they have a uterus when it’s relevant and find out they don’t have it. then moving on doctors would know this person doesn’t have a uterus. That’s it, just a person without a uterus. No gender attached. 

Neovaginas don’t have a cervix. It would be important for a doctor to ask the patient with a neovagina if they have a cervix instead of assuming they do based on their gender marker or how they look. since that can be misleading. People can also just have their cervix removed for various reasons regardless of gender identity. 

There is no 1 definition of “female”. It changes based on context.

Sometimes science asks the wrong questions. 

Majority vs minority is actually what leads to these “oppressions” you guys hate talking about here. If we go off that majority is right handed and build the world around that, left handed will be oppressed. They get less “privilege” sort to speak. Like having to buy different scissors, being forced to use a right handed weapon or experience the shell casing go in their face, having to adapt to computers like switching the mouse location, hoping that in a setting with those chairs with a table attached there is one for left handed people, learning to write in a direction that may be less intuitive than for right handed and having writing smudge.  

These small things need to be accounted for to build an inclusive society where everyone feels welcome. So it’s important to account for complexity. It just requires extra learning. And then you can talk about things more complexly.

Nothing wrong with skipping placebo week. I already told you, Depo Provera, IUD, Naxplenon as a birth control method does not have a placebo week. So it’s a constant release of same hormones. It keep the body in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 
Having less menstrual cycles leads to a lower risk of reproductive organs cancer. Because the fluctuating hormones cause wearing out. There has been studies done that those that were on birth control more of their life or were pregnant for more parts of their life so had less cycles and less of those hormone fluctuations (since birth control keeps same hormone level and being pregnant stops period) has lower risk of cancer in those reproductive organs. 

Then your mom was using a method that didn’t work for her. She should have went and asked for a different method or had the dosage adjusted. The Mirena IUD has the highest dose so is best for stopping periods.

People before puberty don’t menstruate, people after menopause don’t menstruate, people who are pregnant don’t menstruate. Nothing terrible happens to the uterus. 
The uterus builds and sheds the endometrial lining in response to hormones. like infants with a uterus can experience a mini periods after the hormone drop from being in the womb and getting mother’s hormones. 

I know very well in-depth every part of the menstrual cycle. Gynaecologists know it is unnecessary if someone doesn’t want it. 

The hormones don’t mess with the body. They do what they are supposed to. Seems by your definition taking pain killers for a headache is also “messing with the body”

Birth control non-stop keeps the body from ovulating and along with this effect the endometrial lining doesn’t end up building up or shedding with a hormone drop. A small amount of the endometrial lining must stay to keep the capillaries closed (it bleeds because it’s like a wound, endometrial layer flakes off due to hormone drop so until a new layer builds on top the exposed capillaries have blood come out). If there is no cycling of hormones due to the constant birth control then the endometrial lining stays thin and intact. that’s all. 

Lot’s of people go on birth control to stop periods. 

lmao did you just claim that stopping periods will have a woman die???
Tell me again why that is, I missed this explanation. 

Trans men need hormone blockers only if they start transitioning pre-puberty. That stops the development of puberty we associate with women. They then need to take testosterone hrt to develop the puberty we associate with men. If the trans man went through the woman-associated puberty they just need to take testosterone to get the masculinizing effects. There isn’t like “cancelling out” for trans men that ovaries still produce estrogen. Trans women on the other hand do need hormone blockers at any stage (pre-puberty or post-puberty). Since testosterone effects can overpower feminizing hrt. [notice how since testosterone overpowers feminizing effects in transgender women taking estrogen, it is unnecessary to block estrogen in trans men. They just need the testosterone added on top]

Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal. 

That’s the original way birth control was invented but today we use it for other things. Originally Viagara was for regulating blood pressure. Today it’s used for something else because we found more use for this invention. 

There are no consequences to skipping placebo well. There have been many studies done to show this is okay. where are you getting your information from?

I was on depoprovera, the side effects were extreme for me. Depression, extreme anxiety to the point where I couldn't eat, painful acne that I couldn't get rid of no matter what and am still battling after being off of birth control, mood swings, irritability, constant headaches, constant bleeding, weight gain, extreme pain during sex, tearing and bleeding in my vagina, and complete lack sex drive which kind of defeats the point of being on birth control in the first place. I would bleed every two weeks for two weeks straight. I never had an irregularities in my period before. I switched for my physical and mental health.

I tried a different brand of bc pills, less side effects than Depo, but I still didn't feel like myself and it still made my life more difficult than necessary. 

I have been off birth control for a whole year now and I am finally in a good place, I can feel emotions again, I have a sex drive, my periods are regular and manageable, I'm not crying all the time, I'm back to my normal size, I feel good and life is really good for me. I'm not gonna go back on birth control just because some guy on the internet said I should to stop my periods (which bc doesn't even do for me in the first place actually just makes them worse). 

The point is, every person is different. SOME people are able to stop their period with bc and like it that way, but that IS NOT the case for every woman and it may be a good decision for some, but for others it's not what's in their best medical interest.

If you are against pain killers we can’t have a conversation much anymore. For you anything ingested into the body seems like a risk. You are probably against potato chips too or McD food I guess.

Since they take hormones into their body. You think they die from taking hormones. 

There are studies. Most are in paywall university articles. There are some good encyclopedias and textbooks on libgen you can download for free to read about it. Just a google search can give you some though be careful that they are recent and from reputable sources. I have read a lot about birth control being safe, I know they exist. 

Testosterone can act as a hormone blocker since it is deemed to shut down ovaries though not necessarily since some transgender men still menstruate on testosterone. Dosage and how the body accepts it matters. 
Transgender men can choose to take extra hormone blockers which is Lupron but it is not necessary since most of the time just testosterone is enough to get the masculinization effect. like a transgender woman must remove testicles or take hormone blockers while also taking estrogen hrt to get the desired effects but a transgender man can keep the ovaries and just take testosterone to give the masculinization effects and keep the body from reversing (stuff like body fat and body hair growth would change if a transgender man with ovaries stops taking testosterone)

The recent statistic from a gynaecologist I know for IUD success rate at stopping periods is 2/3. With Depo Provera it’s less than 5% have periods.

It’s not too many hormones. It’s a certain amount that is needed to get the desired effect. It would be the same amount as what your body produces itself during the luteal phase. Anything more would not be useful so doctors can regulate that to be the amount.

Any human can access transgender labeled care. But also in my country I already explained that just going through a gynaecologist can allow someone to get a hysterectomy. They just keep the ovaries in. While the transgender route can remove ovaries too. All those bad side effects you listed for hysterectomy is if ovaries are removed without hrt. So you would be missing a sex hormone. In itself not having a uterus doesn’t do anything. It’s just removing an organ that someone doesn’t need, like removing an appendix.

People have periods because it’s what a human body can have. But with current technology we can eliminate the inconvenience since it’s no longer a mandatory inconvenience. Just like humans can develop myopia, you can argue that “if we didn’t need myopia then we wouldn’t have it”. but with today’s technology we can remove the inconvenience with glasses. Some can choose to get laser eye surgery even which is also pretty safe now.

Pain killers can also kill you if you over take them as you are suggesting to do with birth control. You are not talking about a healthy ingest of vegetables, you are talking about syntectic hormones being pump into the body of women. Many will tell you how it wasnt a magical solution.

Share those studies that taking birth control non stop for long periods is healthy then. And trangender people dont over take hormones, they block the natural ones to take new ones.

It is too many hormones, that is why we have a placebook week or rest.

Appendix is remove only when it burst or has cancer, and I have talked to Canadian women and trans men, is not that easy.

Eliminate a body function and cause harm. Also, not all people with myopia can get laser surgery and you can comeback to having myopia after a couple of years. Besides, using glasses doesnt hurt the body. Messing with hormones does.

As a society we really need to step up more and help each other recognize when we are engaging in distorted thinking patterns, because these are unhealthy and unproductive.

https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/

Men in this sub and women in feminist subs - for the most part - have been traumatized by either the opposite sex or because someone they care about has been traumatized by a toxic member of the opposite sex.

That is is just logical. You would not have enough worker to enforce the law. On top of that, you would have no valuable money nor supplies to pay and motivate them. 

Yes, right now you cannot imagine being with a woman since you are not naturally attracted to them, but there is a difference between sexuality and sexual behaviour. A good example is how suddenly there is an increase of homosexual couple in prisons. No other gender, only one option. Another example is how sexual assault in prisons are just common especially cause it is barely to never punished, like if there was no law enforcement like in my example in my first comment. Except my example covers a whole country/world and not just a secluded place. Sex is not a primary need or desire? Then you would deny every major industry which profits out of the natural desire and all the prison relationships and or rapes (including women prison). What is a natural desire and without discussion is the desire for dominance. Which rape is primarly all-about. And in a country where there is no more laws and enforcement of those, people's brutality to satisfy their aforementioned desires will express itself. If it is so hard to believe that women will assault other women, look up the abuse rates of lesbian couples. This should prove my point. And this is what happens in peaceful countries with stability.

I really won't get much into the ""pointing fingers at the other gender"" arguments. But to just give you some counter-arguments: I am afraid I will be accuse of assault because a woman is with me in the elevator. I am afraid I will accused a pervert because I accidentally looked into the direction of a female colleague. I am afraid people will think I am a pedo because I go out with my niece or because I carry her home.  I am afraid people will accuse me of being a ""toxic man"" just because I give them a stern look for once. All of those fears and more are there because people judge me and my entire gender due a minority which is not even close to the majority of ""us"" doing those said crimes. All of that because ""we"" were forced to carry the sins of those that did shit 200 years ago. 0 of all men I and my wife know did any of these things you are afraid of. And I do not say it by any hyberbolic sense, I mean the coldhard fact that literally zero men we know ever did any assault on women especially. Your sexist stereotypes prove that I should be still afraid of being accused of nothing.

You wanna do any of the many many essential jobs. Then go for it. Every Western country is happy to do so. You are legally allowed to do any job and by all accords, any man would be glad if more workers, regardless of gender, would relief them of the daily back pain of their cracking bones. The truth is, most women do not want to even think to dirty their hands and not do an office job. Which is fine, as long as you don't hide it. Besides, you think that any of your current rights and I mean any, would not have been achieved when fathers, husbands, brothers, cousins etc. did never ever wanted their female acquintances that they care and love to have a good and fair life? Do you think ""we"" liked it that a bunch of fat and rich elites denied that? Keep believing that equal rights have not been achieved by equal amount of help. And keep believing that women are innocent of an crime. Even in a sytsem lf anarchy. You accuse us of ""blind rage"" yet here you are exploding on me in a theorotical scenario and give me a whole sexist paragraph when I was talking calm and rationally. But I guess women cannot have anger issues too and are always innocent.",Magical-Hummus,t2_c0uftei,1,0,reddit2

isyjiuv,t1_isy6sdm,2022-10-19 17:12:50,MensRights,"Can you become an electrician within 3 weeks with no training and just the internet? More than 90% of electricians are men. Same with sanitation workers, garbage men, and truck drivers. Even with actual teachers, it takes years to become a capable electrician. Without teachers, it would take much longer. Given that electricity and will go down  within the month, it will take much longer to become an electrician. That means Society would go without electricity for years even if they could learn to become an electrician somehow without accidentally shorting the entire power grid. Another thing is transportation. Without most of the people working on oil/gasoline refinement, and without truckers, after a month, just filling a car much less ships and planes would be basically impossible. Each continent would be completely isolated from each other. Even if the trucking part gets filled, it would also take years for anybody to learn how to work on oil rigs and refine gasoline. That skips the whole part of getting to the oil rigs. Even if they don't accidentally break the oil rig, it would take years to learn what to do and how to do it. Also, food. Around 70% of the farmers are men. so, most of the food you are dependent on is now gone. It takes years to learn to farm. Most mechanized farming equipment will not work anymore too, so the female farmers would be able to farm much lower areas and as such, food production would go down more than 70% again. More than 90% of construction workers are men too, so nobody will be able to fix the facilities that get destroyed. No sanitation workers means no clean water too. That job again, takes years to learn.

Summary: without men, even if women do learn to take up the jobs men have, the world will be without electricity, clean water, food, and gas for years. It would be a miracle if humanity could relearn everything without accidentally breaking stuff(shorting the power grid & breaking oil rigs). Before you argue ""those jobs would be easily filled"", You're right, they would easily be filled but that would be after 5 or more years of constant study and practice but would society still be standing at that point?

The suffragettes were from **extreme** wealth married to senators, and CEOs of plantation/slave trade and mining companies that exploited men at the bottom. They (suffragettes) wanted to inherit that wealth from their dead husbands and inherit the companies like mining, gold, construction, shipping etc.... When they inherit this wealth the call it 'feminism' but don't share the money back to working class families in mining or share with Africa as it was accumulated from slavery/oppression.  They essentially knew exactly what they were doing.

Women at the bottom have not felt that benefit either as they inherit debt from their dead poor husbands or don't start off at the same level as privileged women. 

**To highlight this as an example:** We see the massive changes in education when girls go to university more and do better in education, but working-class women and racial minority women in no way whatsoever have gone through those same changes of flooding into universities. It is exclusively privileged, privately educated white girls who have gone through this change. Then we look at who feminists are; privileged, privately educated, white women. So their DAUGHTERS are the primary beneficiaries of their MOTHERS'/GRANDMOTHERS' activism while minority girls are not really involved. Minority mother can't correct this either because they don't hold the reigns in women's organizations, white women hold the control of how a programme is set up in school. You don't need to be a genius to see through it. Feminism is for women and girls at the top. **Another example** is women's employment networks. Rich white corporate women (feminists) drain hundreds of millions of men's taxes and set up a women's network which pulls in other rich well-connected white women (their girlfriends), while again minority women are very much uninvolved in any of this.

We could then ask why there's so many white, privileged females in feminism, women's studies, sociology etc..? and so little Asian/Black women or working class women in feminism? It becomes obvious why white females love it so much and minority women seem less likely to go into professional feminism. Most likely because they've less to gain from it. White females in their 20s/30s are in absolute adoration of feminism and are the most hostile to critiques of feminism, moreso than minority women. Because it's run and designed by themselves, benefits themselves, and caters to themselves. Why wouldn't white, privately educated females be most interested in feminist studies more than minority women; they absolutely love all of this.

jsrnl4o,t1_jsr0gr2,2023-07-20 19:10:16,MensRights,"Sorry for the wall of text below, but its kind of a complex topic. Basically /u/Current_Finding_4066 is saying that for most of history, most men weren't allowed to be financially independent either.

Most men were bound to the land that they had to farm for their lord. Who used the food produced to pay taxes to the king,  and to provide a certain number of equipped military troops and afford their own lifestyles.  Serfs were allowed to build a home on the land, and grow a small garden to ensure that they didn't starve but it wasn't allowed to interfere with the production quotas. Their personal grain was normally limited to a single acre, as that was just enough to avoid starvation of a small household while being small enough to only take a single day to plant and single day to harvest per year.

If you wished to leave your land for more than a couple days, you needed permission from the lord, Who would likely give your house to someone who was willing to farm it. Over time a few regulations to the practice were added that prevented the very worst abuses by the worst of the lords, but only because mismanagement that caused serfs to starve, ultimately hit the king's bottom line. there was an improvement after the black death, because there weren't enough men  left alive to farm all the land.

 Serfdom was a way to keep a slave class, while giving them responsibility for managing their own production. (similar to wage slavery in a company town)  Prior to Feudalism, Farm owners might have slaves, or hire day labor. but the farm owners were a sort of middle management class.  They would have had to pay the taxes and the like, but they were directly involved in the day to day running of the farm. it gave many of the laborers a slightly better life in comparison to slavery, or day labor, They would be allowed homes, wives and children, but completely gutted the local level economies by concentrating the wealth at the lord level because the land usage restrictions placed upon the serfs meant that they never had any spare money.  Skip a few meals a week for a year to save up for a new farm animal, and then you hit a rock with your plow and need to pay the blacksmith to fix it.  It was a level of poverty where things like metal sewing needles were a luxury, even though the technology had already existed for thousands of years.

Keep in mind that  between 1 in 7 and 1 in 14 men reproduced historically. Many women died in childbirth, so wealthy men who didn't work risky jobs would regularly have multiple wives throughout their life time. but in the medieval period  97% of men were kept low without education, and literally bound to their land by law and religion. Their lord was their lord, not only because it was his job, but also because God put him there to order his serfs around, and therefore only he could determine what rights you needed.

In classical times, slavery was extremely popular, and between 30-60% of the population of most states were slaves.  But that meant that a significant portion of the population had rights, and the potential to get grievances aired in court. Feudalism was a ""step forward"" for slaves while also eliminating the middle class. And that middle class generally wanted their slaves to at least be provisioned to work effectively. As with most businesses efficiency is key to profit. Slaves had an actual resale value, so  masters generally cared if their slaves were wasting away. Which meant that although their food wasn't generally high quality, it also was generally guaranteed to be sufficient for the work completed by the slave.

on the other hand if your serf couldn't produce anymore, and he didn't have a son old enough to take over,  a lord would simply kick them off the land and replace him with the second or third son of another serf who had managed to get lucky enough to keep his farm in good repair and feed his family better.

Feudalism is where we get the idea of peasantry from. before feudalism, most of the poorest weren't expected to be responsible to figure out where the next meal was coming from, or what needed to be done next.  By ceding that responsibility to the lowest classes without educating them, and designing a system that keeps the lower class competing with itself to tread water, Grift was maximized while keeping social mobility low, preserving the social order for the next generation of Nobles.

I shouldn't have to say this, but given that it is reddit:People should not be possessed by other people. Slavery is wrong, and evil. But the move from slavery to serfdom, is very similar to what we've seen over the last 50 years  in America with Small businesses having difficulty competing with mega-corporations, and how these corporations are hiring fewer Full time employees, and more contractors. Technically a contractor has more personal rights than a Full Time Employee,  (technically they can set their own start times, and choose their own health insurance, etc.) But in reality it works that it simply removes the responsibility of the corporation to ensure that you can live off your wages, and ensure that you have the health coverage you need to live well.

This is also similar to how Pensions were replaced with 401k.  previously, your employer was responsible to ensure that those who worked for them for decades could survive once they could no longer work. Now its the employee's responsibility, but without an increase in pay, and the rich are allowed to use the same tax dodge that makes a 401k based retirement remotely possible.",RemCogito,t2_4jukf,13,0,reddit4

Presumably because she now has to take care of the home AND take care of work - like everyone in the fucking world... and her frustrations are dead on. The current 5 day work week was fought for **IN BLOOD** by labor unions at the turn of the century. 

It was a trail blazing policy at the time but it is outmoded and suitable for a different time and different needs.

We live in a time when production has sky rocketed, but salaries and labor free days have remained relatively unchanged in comparison to the production people bring to companies and employers. Mainly due to technology, education and all sorts of other things. 

So what's my point? My point isn't that this is necessarily a labor rights issue - more specifically it isn't a women's rights issue. The reason I advocate that it could be a labor rights issue is that something like a 4 day work week could help alleviate the kind of exhaustion she's describing.

I can hear your response already, ""If the workers can come up with a few billion, sure they can!"". Here's the thing. The company only has value because of the workers. Yeah, he provided the capital for the business to start, but without the workers, nothing would come of it. In our current system all power and value are ascribed to the owners of the machines, little if any to the people that actually make them work. That fundamental assumption needs to change. In a just system, the initial investors would be repaid their investment plus a reasonable percentage, then ownership would transfer to the people who have invested their labor.

Free Market Socialism. Workers own the workplace. Capital starts from a large group of Cooperative Banks, which compete trying to fund successful enterprises.

You're wrong. You have the definitions of capitalism and socialism wrong, which is not a coincidence. Oligarch peddlers have for decades obscured the meaning of these words.

Capitalism: CAPITAL owner takes profits due to being owner of the capital, not working. It's called CAPITAL-ism.

Socialism: the value created belongs to those that created it. In Coop Socialism, or Free Market Socialism, or many other flavors, this means the workers in each company.

> research shows that less than 5% of young women desire relationships with men who are unemployed or work part-time (Dernberger & Pepin, 2020)

So... of course, men could be homemakers or stay at home parents, thereby opening jobs for women (naturally, without the need for forced quotas to cram women into roles that are otherwise full), offering choice for men that women have but men often don't, and it could help rebalance the dating market too.

But apparently women don't care for that sort of thing, they don't like ""deadbeats"" who aren't ""bringing home the money"" (even if they too are making bank in their own jobs). We don't think that way about most women, do we? Especially if they choose to have children. No, we praise them as housewives and dedicated mothers. We actively provide them resources to be able to perform that role.

This! Their blatant hypocrisy is so fucking annoying as is the constant insult to our intelligence. How much longer are they gonna lie and say it's about equality when every move they make is to ensure female superiority?

Feminists wish to build a society where merit and personal ability don't matter. Where one sex gets given scholarships, financial aid, is hired and is promoted based off their gender alone while the other is repressed. They keep crowing on about their bullshit equality all while creating a society that is incredibly patronizing to women and favours them in every area. They want the power structure of a matriarchy while keeping the protections and benefits they obtain in a patriarchy by constantly portraying themselves as the victims that they no longer are.

>actually discriminated against until there weren't. Now that women vastly outnumber men? Well, it's just because women are better students. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with how we've stacked the system against men.

Experts believe this upward trend will continue and will accelerate, while the number of men in the workforce will be declining.

It is complicated and recently changed to pressure men into taking more leave. It used to be less for men and upto 3 for women. Now there's a system were both women and men get X amount of time and a party can give a portion of their time to the other party (can't remember if it was half or a third)

(Okay checked, so both get 160, days of full parental leave, and max 63 days can be given to the other partner, then after this period of time one can go to hoitovapaa ""caring leave"" which is different were one can be until the child turns 3 during these roughly two years the parent receives a government benefit, but no salary, this can be divided anyway the parents want, I didn't find the information on how it goes if the parens can't agree on it.)

So in theory yes, but I wouldn't necessarily call it equal since women are the ones who make the decision on reproduction, and men generally outearn their wives.

Women still do take way more parental leave than men for more or less obvious reasons

+ Women get 40 days of pregnancy leave which men do not get

I think I get where you're coming from now. Unfortunately, you're making an assumption that 'under normal conditions' everything is fair and everyone gets hired on merit. What if many of the men who were hired are there because even though there was a more qualified woman, the man above him who hired him believes (maybe even subconsciously) that men are more capable, more trustworthy to get the job done than a woman, less prone to emotion maybe?

No, I don't think a lot of the people believe that, especially in western countries. Maybe a minority of people.

But it doesn't matter. If the women are really qualified, then the sexist company will lose value by not hiring them and their competition will win out. I don't think that this is true but even if all the companies were sexist, the women are free to build their own companies from the ground up. Most of the men have built their companies from the ground. So, if the women are really qualified, they should be able to beat the sexist men in the market place.

Same thing applies to conscription, nothing is stopping the legislators from creating a conscription law in the time of war.

And BTW a Supreme Court ruling is the next best thing to a constitutional amendment. Congress changes every 4 years, Supreme Court judges are for the lifetime. So it not ""so easy"" to abrogate RvW.
