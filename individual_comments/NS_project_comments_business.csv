Things were going great, I was being trained by the then manager to take on more responsibilities at our buildings, I got to know the tenants and befriended many of them.  Then suddenly the VP of the company (who seemed to have it out for me for something someone else did that she blamed on me) came in and switched everything around.  She brought in a new manager and moved our manager to a completely different site.  

The new manager managed hotels, he had zero experience in residential property management.  He decided that all of the finely tuned systems we had in place needed to be shaken up for no reason and he wanted to start bringing in his own people (and yes that’s with racial undertones).

14,jbrxvpe,t3_11o5bgv,2023-03-11,Economics,"I’d like to share a personal anecdote involving the topic: 

I work in sales and I’d say I’ve been quite successful by most standards. 

Several years ago I was recruited and relocated for a job, six months into the new job I started feeling quite ill; foggy headed, falling asleep at work, unfocused, irritable… just generally unwell.

My performance suffered and I started missing my quotas. My boss met with me to figure out what was going wrong. He had been very impressed with my CV and initial performance, but now he had to document that I was not meeting expectations and would be receiving a formal warning. I let him know that I was feeling very unwell and had been seeing multiple doctors to try to figure out what was wrong with me. 

I could immediately tell that was probably the worst thing I could have told him. Everybody in management was avoiding me and about a week later I was summoned to a meeting with the HR director and was placed on some kind of “action plan”. If I didn’t hit my next quota, they would be terminating my employment. I asked if my boss had told him about how I had been feeling unwell and that I believed that is why my performance was subpar. He basically asked what my diagnosis was and told me that I would need to provide medical documentation for any of it to be relevant. I explained that there was no positive diagnosis yet and I was waiting on appointments with various specialists.

Three weeks later, I was terminated.

Two months after that, I finally got my medical diagnosis, basically I had a benign hormone-producing brain tumor which could be treated with various medications and hormone therapy. I felt back to my old self, and I took the same type of job with a competing company.

I filed a disability discrimination complaint and there was an “investigation”. Like most complaints, no determination was made and I was given a “right to sue”. I contacted attorneys about filing a lawsuit. I was told by most of the attorneys that my damages were too small for them to want my case because I found a *better* paying job so soon after my termination. I was also told that the way I filed my complaint made the case more complicated and less likely to succeed. 


If I could “do it over” I would get an employment lawyer involved much sooner and not be so open with my employer. Or, just move on and not bother with filing a complaint.

40,fffhhjt,t3_etbjqv,2020-01-24,Economics,"There’s a ton of people here making a ‘legal tender argument.’ Everything I’ve read so far is pretty wrong. 

Here is a free financial history lesson: The gist of that language on a $1 bill is that the ‘the US Dollar’ - in the abstract - must be accepted as legal tender in all debts public and private. It does not mean that you must accept a specific bill (eg a $100 bill) as currency. 

That language came about in the late 1800s/early 1900s when it was common for local banks to issue their own currency. This practice was largely a ~100 year rolling financial disaster bc if you were accepting the currency (for example you ran a store) you had to guess if the bank issuing the currency was stable or even existed. These bank notes were generally gold/silver redeemable, but what are you supposed to do if the issuing bank was 4 weeks of travel from your store?

It was a *massive* drag on trade, which was a big problem as the expansion of rail networks meant trade was now regularly occurring over thousands of miles (as opposed to locally, where you knew the local bank and could have a better sense of how stable the local bank was). Imagine being a retailer in Chicago; would you accept a $5 bill issued by a bank in Buffalo NY? Probably not. And I’m not even getting into all the local recession/depressions that would occur if a local bank collapsed, which happened all the time. 

When the federal govt created our modern financial system (namely creating the Fed and greatly expanding the role of the US Treasury) one of the first things they did was to monopolize the financial system by soft-banning all non-USD currency. The ‘all debts public and private’ language is essentially the enforcement mechanism for that monopoly. It was a soft-ban bc the Fed/UST knew that the USD would be the currency that held the most public confidence. So if the USD was mandated to be accepted, it would naturally force out other currencies - which is what happened. 

To the more modern issue: I’m on mobile so I’m not linking the specific cases, but this issue has gone to court before. I’m going from memory, but there was an old case where someone sued bc a gas station bc they wouldn’t accept bills larger than $5 (this was a long time ago), and the court ruled that the refusal to accept a $10 was legal because the *transaction* (the debt) was still settled in USD, which was the point of the law. 

A retailer going to credit-only would still be legal because the transaction is still settled in USD, as stipulated by the law - the credit card is just a convenience. If you go to LasVegas, you can kinda see where this blends into a weird grey area, where you can use chips at a table, but you cannot buy dinner with chips. In this case, the casino and the restaurant are operated by two separate companies, and settling a cross-transaction is too close to accepting a non-USD currency.  But there is obviously a grey area in the middle. 

This topic is going to come up again in the near future involving crypto coins. Eventually there will be a ‘Bitcoin only’ store that will get stepped on by the US Treasury. Honestly, that case won’t be interesting - the Treasury is within its rights to enforce that. To me, the interesting case will be when some retailer opens a store that only accepts a USD-backed stable coin. The UST will say ‘no way bro’ but the retailer will argue that a stable-coin is USD backed and arguably no different than a credit card transaction. *THAT* will be an interesting - and potentially extremely important - court case.",Laminar_flo,t2_7gmyn,39,0

When a service reaches that level of universal usage and requirement, it becomes a utility. Unless we're willing to have the government provide financial services for everyone *yikes*, I don't see how this is a good idea.
 
At worst, huge parts of the population can get completely shut out of buying any goods or services because of computer errors, or intentional by the bank. At best, you're forced to have every single transaction you make timestamped, with your name and location recorded and tracked by a bank. Whose ability and altruism you must count on to get things right 100% of the time with 100% of their customers.
 
Using the excuse of convenience is how we got the Patriot Act. Yes, there are some benefits that business owners will see like less employee theft, less time spent counting money. Small issues that do not affect overall business function. More like added benefits. The problems created by going cashless far outweigh any benefits to be found from this.

My dad worked in restaurants all his life and was robbed at gunpoint twice, had several employees robbed too. A manager in of his locations was murdered for something like $2500. He's told me before it would've been amazing to have the  ability to go cashless back in those days.

I personally think this is a dumb decision. Seems like they're trying to fix a non-existent issue here.

Also, I distinctly remember dealing with the shitty city water service in college, and having a random fee they wouldn't let me pay in cash or with card - they needed a check. I wonder how many unforeseen issues like this that this law is going to create in New York.",widespreadhammock,t2_mxcoe,7,0

I’m ambivalent about letting a place outright refuse cash. It certainly is an issue for economically vulnerable people. Some people don’t have credit cards and would be excluded from those stores.

63,ffg6ulm,t3_etbjqv,2020-01-24,Economics,"I agree. And while having a public bank seems like a good way to solve this problem without regulation, it costs way more for the government and is essentially putting the burden of solving the problem on consumers and taxpayers rather than on businesses. 

Essentially the options seem to be:

A.) Require private businesses to shoulder the one time expense of installing cash drawers and a safe, in addition to ongoing cash management expenses. 

B.) Go through the coordination headache of trying to get thousands of poor people to open a bank account, the infrastructure headache of setting up a bank, and the regulatory headache associated with obeying bank regulations. And since this is supposed to be in the public interest, you'd probably want the bank to have a decent sized branch network in order to serve people who don't have computers or smartphones, and those branches are expensive, so the taxpayers would likely have to pay for this.

A lot of places do not accept cash. The street vendors are legitimate very poor population- their incomes are very low and competition is fierce. If you walk up to a breakfast stand in China, you just yell at them “give me an egg”, they will prepare and take it over, you will do mobile payments without them looking (a lot of times), then there will be a beep sound indicating paid. This would reduce one labor (no cashier now) and there is no cash safety concerns. So for a small vendor, it is easy to setup (a barcode in some cases and a speaker), cheaper (less labor), efficient (reduced customer waiting time). 

Now, what happened to US? Credit cards. The transaction cost is too high (5%+?) for those tiny transaction. In China, I heard that it is 0.9% (my memory could be wrong, I believe it is 0.5-1%) and it is directly taking out of your cash account.

I haven't finished it yet, but here is the abstract:

>Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.",,,13,0

**Theoretical Overview**

Does a free market prevent wage gaps from forming, due to competition?

Let's assume perfectly competitive labor markets which have the following important properties.

- Free Entry/Exit – No barriers to entry/exit (including entry/exit costs)

- Homogeneous work environments (so firms only compete on wages offered)

- Perfect information- All parties have the same information

- A large amount of buyers and sellers- no one can have a monopoly or significant market share

Under these conditions, 'taste based' discrimination cannot cause a wage gap. If marginalized workers work for discriminatory firms, nondiscriminatory firms will hire them away. This will put pressure to equalize wages between these groups, potentially running discriminatory firms out of business, though not necessarily. If discriminatory firms can hire enough of their preferred workers without causing a wage gap, they will stay in business. This is the argument that free markets prevent discrimination, first formulated by Becker (1957)

- What happens if we relax these perfectly competitive assumptions? For instance:

- What if there are not enough nondiscriminatory firms to employ marginalized groups?

- What if search costs are higher for marginalized groups?

- There are significant barriers to entry or exit?

Then wage gaps due to taste-based discrimination are fully possible. For example, if we allow for job search then marginalized groups will face harsher job search costs and their employers will know they have lesser outside options. This giving firms financial incentives to create a wage gap, even if they have no taste for discrimination.
The important takeaway is that cannot assume economic outcomes from a deductive approach alone - the assumptions we make could change our results. Instead, we need to look at empirical data. We also need to be clear about what assumptions we are making, because they matter quite a bit. By tweaking a single assumption (for instance, the cost of job search), we go from a model where discriminators suffer competitive disadvantages, to one where firms face financial incentives to discriminate. The need to look at data bring us to the most common way to do that, looking at the ""raw"" gender wage gap or the ""controlled"" gender wage gap, which is the next section.

**Bad Controls**

(or ""Being Paid 77 cents on the Dollar and Controlling for Education: The Omitted Variable's Edition"")
Many of the gender wage gap arguments on reddit boil down to one side asserting that the 77 cents to the dollar wage gap is pure discrimination and the other asserting that other things like education, hours worked, etc. have to be controlled for as they cause earnings to be higher. They are arguing that the 77 cents on a dollar claim isn’t looking at all relevant variables, and that the gender wage gap mostly disappears when you control for these relevant variables.
Both of these two views paint too simplistic a picture. It's true that the raw gap is roughly 77 cents to the dollar. It's also true that the gap shrinks significantly when controlling for hours worked, education, etc. What we don't know is which way the causation goes. Do women earn less because they choose lower earning majors and shorter work hours, or does the existence of discrimination cause women to alter their choices of majors and alter their working hours? Education, working hours and other 'controls' are not necessarily appropriate controls, as they could also be dependent variables which are outcomes of discrimination. For further discussion of this point, see the /r/economics Bureau Member Chat.

In addition, as [**Goldin (2014)**](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf) notes the gender wage gap has shrunk across time.

> The mantra of the women’s movement in the 1970s was “59 cents on the dollar” and a more recent crusade for pay equality has adopted “77 cents on the dollar.”

Then notes some potential reasons why.

> As women have increased their productivity enhancing characteristics and as they “look” more like men, the human capital part of the wage difference has been squeezed out.


Something caused women to change their human capital decisions (educational attainment, etc.) shrinking the gender wage gap. These factors motivating these human capital decisions could very much matter too! For instance, increased work ethic would affect on the job performance and increase educational attainment. However, this type of omitted variable problem is very difficult to control for.

Once you realize that you do not have every variable controlled for, your analysis does not have a causal interpretation. It is possible that leaving out a control variable puts you closer to the unknown “true” effect. On the other hand, it is possible that the control variable is really an outcome of discrimination, or that leaving out an important variable puts you further away from the “true” effect. Both of these arguments suffer serious methodological problems.
There are two basic strategies to deal with this. One method is to find a way to run experiments. An advantage of this approach is that there is no doubt you have gotten cause and effect right. A downside of this approach is you do not know how sensitive your findings are or if they scale to outside situations - is your experimental set up valid in the wider market? You also might not know exactly how or why your cause and effect happens. These make it hard to know what policy to use. This is discussed in the Audit Studies section below.

Another option is to build a model and see how well the model explains the data. This is very handy because it lets you easily know what to do from a policy perspective. You can easily see where factors are important and where they are not. The downside is that you could have assumed the wrong model. These models are testable because they ASSUME what variables are relevant and what ones aren't, so they limit the amount of variables you need to look at. However, there is a risk of incorrect modeling or omitting relevant variables. An example of this approach is Claudia Goldin’s work, which is discussed below.

edit: Since even this sub is misognyst, read the damn article people!!

- When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. But a gender pay gap soon appears, and it grows significantly over the next two decades.

- So what changes? The answer can be found by looking at when the pay gap widens most sharply. It’s the late 20s to mid-30s, according to two new studies — in other words, when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do.

So the article clearly states that women make pretty close to men until women start having children. Trying to argue that it's because women just don't like to work the same hours as men is lie -- that pay gap is far smaller in women without children.

The paper has now been peer-reviewed and published in *Econometrica* - [here](http://klenow.com/HHJK.pdf) is an open-access link to the published version. There may be minor differences between the earlier version and the published version, but the methodology is the same. The text of my explanation is copied below.

_____________

That's the conclusion of [a working paper by Chang-Tai Hsieh, Erik Hurst, Charles Jones and Pete Klenow](http://klenow.com/HHJK.pdf), which was drawn to my attention by [Atif Mian posting it on Twitter yesterday](https://twitter.com/AtifRMian/status/1063428273215021056). (EDIT: the figure refers to all per capita growth, not total growth). The basic reason is simple: discrimination in 1960 meant that lots of women and black people did not pursue careers even when they would have had a great natural talent for those careers, and instead worked in jobs that they were less suited for. This mismatch between their talent and the jobs that they worked in meant they were less economically productive than they would have otherwise been and the economy suffered as a result. As discrimination has reduced over the subsequent 50 years, talented women and black people could go into careers that made better use of their talents, and the economy grew as a result. 

This isn't too surprising - what's perhaps more surprising is the size of the effect. A quarter of all growth from 1960 to 2010 is a very substantial effect. In this post, I'll try to explain how the authors' model works and, roughly speaking, how they came to that number.

The model in the paper focuses on three main types of discrimination. The first is wage discrimination between black and white people and/or between men and women. In the model, employers prefer to hire white men relative to women or black people, and so they will only be willing to hire the latter groups if they can pay them lower wages in a given occupation. This acts like a tax on the wage that women/black people can receive. The second is educational discrimination, which is modelled as women and black people having to pay a higher cost for a given level of education - this is ""a shorthand for complex forces such as discrimination against blacks or women in admission to universities, or differential allocation of resources to public schools attended by black vs. white children, or differential parental investments made toward building up math and science skills in boys relative to girls"". The third is preferences or social norms that make women or black people less willing to choose certain occupations, even if they have a talent for them. 

Based on this framework, the authors then use data on wages and occupations for black and white men and women from 1960 to 2010 to estimate the size of each of these three discriminatory forces, and how that changed over time. The main assumption they make is that the innate talent of women and black people for each occupation, *relative* to white men's talent in that occupation, has not changed over time. So there may be some occupations that men are naturally better at than women, for instance, but their assumption is that the *natural* ability of women to do that job has not *increased* relative to men's ability to do it since 1960. If that assumption is true, then all the changes we see in the occupations chosen by white and black men and women between 1960 and 2010 must be due to changes in these three discriminatory forces. Then it's reasonably straightforward to use the changes in the distribution of occupations over time to estimate how much the combination of these three discriminatory forces has changed.

To answer the question of how much this affects economic growth, they set up a model of the whole economy. There are lots of workers of different genders and races; each individual worker chooses the level of education and the occupation that will be best for them (maximise their expected lifetime utility), based on their own talents, the wages in each occupation, the education required for each occupation, and the level of discrimination that they might or might not face when working in an occupation or choosing their education. Employers choose the amount of people to hire in each occupation so as to maximise profits, but they may be willing to pay some cost to hire fewer women or black people (even if those people are well suited to the job) because they may be racist or sexist. The optimal decisions of the firms and workers produce labour demand and supply curves for each occupation, and the wage in each occupation is set by the equilibrium of labour supply and demand. The equilibrium number of people working in each occupation and their talent for that occupation then determines the economy's total output. Discrimination lowers total output because it prevents some people who have a talent for that occupation from working in that occupation, and pushes them to work in other ones where they are less productive. 

They then take this model and choose values of the variables in the model that best fit the data, including the discrimination parameters. They're able to match the observed data on earnings and employment quite well, as shown in [this table](https://i.imgur.com/LKQMXRO.png). But because they now have a structural model of the whole economy that takes discrimination into account, they can simulate what would have happened to US GDP if discrimination against women and black people had stayed at the level that it had in the 1960s, rather than falling over time. They do this by choosing all the other parameters describing the economy to match the data, but holding the discrimination parameters fixed at the level they were at in 1960. The result from this simulation is that 27% of growth in GDP per person between 1960 and 2010 is accounted for by changes in discrimination. The figure for *market* GDP per person is even higher at 38%, but this is an overestimate because market GDP excludes the value of unpaid work done at home by women, which was probably higher in 1960 than in 2010 since more women now participate in paid work.  Splitting up the three types of discrimination described, they find that the most important one was educational discrimination, by some distance - labour market discrimination had an effect, but a smaller one, and there's not much evidence that changes in social norms/preferences had an important effect.

How does this break down between groups? The simulations imply that reduced discrimination slightly lowered the earnings of white men - they grew about 10% less since 1960 than they would have done if discrimination had been maintained. The mechanism is that in 1960, white men who did not have much talent for high-skilled occupations were still working in them because discrimination prevented any competition from women and black people, but by 2010 reduced discrimination has meant these kinds of men have to work in lower-skilled jobs. But this is more than offset by big gains in earnings for black men and women, and for white women - 28%, 56% and 85% respectively of the earnings growth for these groups from 1960-2010 is explained by reduced discrimination. 

The authors provide several robustness checks, showing that different assumptions about talent and the discrimination faced by men and women are either implausible or do not affect their conclusions too much. The specific numbers that they come up with depend on some of the assumptions about the model structure, the way the economy works and how discrimination matters. But the basic conclusion is clear: reducing discrimination was a very important contributor to American growth between 1960 and 2010, and continuing to reduce discrimination could produce more economic growth in the future. This is true not just of discrimination on the grounds of race or gender, but also economic barriers that people from poor families and regions face regardless of their race.",usrname42,t2_6jd5g,81,0

>We examine the issue of PD in two-sided markets. We assume that there are two symmetric
horizontally differentiated platforms and two groups of agents. Agents from both
groups must join a platform for successful trades to take place. Platforms possess information
about the agents’ brand preferences which can be used to customize prices. We
derive new results regarding the equilibrium discriminatory prices. When indirect externality
is weak (relative to marginal cost), contrary to predictions from one-sided models,
equilibrium prices are not distribution-free. Moreover, they do depend on both group
externalities, as opposed to uniform prices in two-sided models which only depend on
the other-group externality.

>Then, we compare the profitability of PD with uniform pricing in a two-sided market.
Our main result indicates that when the marginal cost is low relative to externalities
perfect PD yields higher profits relative to those under uniform prices. This result is
in sharp contrast with the prisoners’ dilemma prediction in oligopolistic one-sided PD
models.

>Our results have new and clear managerial implications, regarding pricing strategies
in two-sided markets. Moreover, in a two-sided market, firms may have stronger
incentives to collect consumer information which allows them to price discriminate.
This should happen when the marginal cost is low relative to cross-group network
externalities.",davidjricardo,t2_bcma6,15,0

426,dcljmg5,t3_5oojt4,2017-01-18,Economics,"This is why the exploding cost of college is so damaging to the society.

Ostensibly, the quality of education and the return on investment for a college education has not increased above inflation since the 1980s (just look at differences in incomes between baby boomers in their 20s and 30s and Generation Y/millenials today).  Instead, the value of a high school degree has just plummeted.

So in one way it makes sense that if the RELATIVE value of a college education is improved, that colleges could charge more and people would pay more because the opportunity cost difference between a college education and not having one is pretty large.

However, education quality (sure we have new technology and everything, but a physics education for example really hasn't changed that much in the last 30 years) and the return on that investment HAS NOT gone up relative to the past.  And, there's no monopoly in higher education.  So it's crazy how college costs keep increasing above inflation.  Shouldn't they be competing for lower costs?

And another thing.  With college tuition skyrocketing, why do adjunct professors make so little?  Usually donations fund big ticket items like a new stadium or building, but I suppose students have to pay the increased cost of upkeep.  I don't think college professors make vastly more than they did in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  Is it just the administration that's gobbling up the money?

for all the horror stories about the cost of cars, they aren't that much. family I have in Colorado pays like $90 a month full coverage for insurance for an older car and I pay around $150 or so a month full coverage near NYC for a luxury SUV. the NYPD doesn't enforce most traffic laws and there are a lot of accidents and property crime and it's in the higher insurance costs. 

&#x200B;

most of the everyday stuff is about the same but NYC everything is an extra cost. if you have a car and want dedicated parking then you have to pay $300 - $1000 a month for a garage spot,  many schools don't have sports so you have to pay for it for your kids. used to cost me $200 a month. fines for everything

Prices are so different depending on where you are that simply looking at gross dollar income gives no idea what that will buy.  $100k does not buy a lot in California, but in Bethany Oklahoma you would live like a king as long as your idea of a king is your communities' top 5% or so.

I say what we really need to do is set a standard for what is and is not the traditional middle class activities and expectations and divine the income required to support that at a given start date, say, 1995.  What did it take to break into that middle class for an average household size.  Two parents and a couple/few kids for example.  Middle class people do not have to limit family size because of financial limitations.  If you have to hold yourself to one or two children you are not middle class.  And that is the way to approach it, for example if you cannot afford a foreign vacation every other year or so you are not middle class.

And I would say that middle class should be the the middle third of all incomes.  Low income and poverty being the bottom third, and affluent to wealthy the top third.  Middle is just the middle of all that.  As it is they usually use quintiles and a lot of the time you see the bottom two as poor to low income and the working class, then two quintiles for middle class, hence lower middle class and upper middle class, then there are the affluent and rich.

Then to define it further you have to differentiate between very expensive metros like SF Bay Area, LA, NYC, Miami, and Seattle, from the rest of the nation.  St. Paul is going to get to middle class at a lot lower income than Atherton.  Tampa would be about where Ukiah is for a middle class income.  By the way, Ukiah is up in Mendocino County a long way from a city.

As a single head of household in the greater Tampa region I would say that to be middle class as I understand it would take me at minimum $135k.  Part of the problem is middle class traditionally not only could afford ALL necessities but quite a few ""luxuries"" from the point of view of the working class, and they had enough to set aside for full college expenses for their kids, and they had enough to save a significant portion for retirements, and they had enough in the bank for emergencies.  They were fully insured too against disasters or medical need.  They has financial security as well as a decent if not luxuries life.

&#x200B;

a lot of these articles are often wildly skewed by what they're actually considering to be nyc.    


like... those articles that say the average rent is 3k    ...rarely ever consider anything above 96th street.    


NYC is more expensive.   but ... the relative expense in different areas isn't so wildly extreme.    


for instance.  my rent in upper harlem (the 140's)  for a decently sized one bedroom at the time i left the city  was $1600  (started at $1200... and crept up over a decade i lived there)     When i moved back to where my parents live in coastal VA.   I couldn't find any decent apartments.  for cheaper.  everything was $1500+   and  anything nice was more.   And while there may have been some very marginal gains in square footage.  a lot of apartments in that area were old.  shitty old like garabge construction lame as fuck boring apartment communities.  like... nothing more than motels as apartments.      and still.. comparably priced.  to find new construction,  or nicer areas to live in ... $1700  or $2k  plus wasn't outside the norm.      But... when i looked around at jobs in the area.  the rate of pay for a comparable job...was a lot lower in that area.  


So...in a way. the cost of living in that misc part of coastal virginia was higher than upper harlem manhattan nyc.    


now... if you live in a fucking nowhere part of the country.   maaaaybe those metrics change.   but holy fuck who wants to live there.    And what are you getting living in such a place.    


I wound up moving to silver spring maryland.  a commuter suburb of washington DC.   my apartment is aprox $2k.   and it's nice.  my current apartment if it were in nyc.  Would be $3k-$5k  easily.    but... i wouldn't even say it's bigger than my old harlem apartment.    


and now.. living in the burbs,  i'm paying for parking, and have a car payment.   So.. my income is spread over more requirements or strain on it.    


and i make just under six figures.   I don't feel like leaving nyc,  suddenly made my income go a whole lot futher.  if anything,  it's extremely tight/nuanced trade offs.   of slightly better amenities.  but more costs for necessities in transportation.    


and would say... i knew people in nyc who made huge salaries.   200k   500k and up.   some people spent their money on living downtown, or in hipster neighborhoods,  insanely high rent.   everything was an order service, paid for extremely overpriced gyms or fitness fads. blew a ton of money on luxury clothes/fashion.    went out to over priced bars or scenester events.     ---but i also knew people who worked in tech,  for the same high salaries.  who living in deeper brooklyn   or way uptown.   saved a fuck ton of money.   and didn't live extravagantly.    hell... my neighbor in harlem worked for uber,  made 300k a year.  paid slightly less than me in rent.   We would hang out   ..do nerd shit like board game nights.   and yeah.   his TV was huge,  and he bought like.. brand new gamer PC stuff a lot.   but...

This is a vicious cycle.

The minimum wage freezes in place the most vulnerable people in any given society - the young, the poor, minorities, those with social functioning disorders, those with prior criminal history, and those with mental handicaps. They never have a chance to ""climb the ladder"" because the minimum wage cuts off the bottom rung.

These are people who are more likely to lack the ""human capital"", i.e., workplace skills and habits, that most people is a society acquire through the circumstances of their birth, childhood social interaction (""privilege""), and unofficial employment. A white kid in the suburbs who has zealous teachers, teamwork experience in class projects and sports teams, and mows lawns under the table, is much more likely to be hired at $10/hr than his urban black counterpart who has none of those things. 

Indeed, many minorities, not just minority youths, rely on ""under the table"" work to acquire the experience and skills necessary for the above the board workplace. The minimum wage is cancer.

Each single one of those cities listed in the article are the most desirable places in the country to live in due to weather, culture, geography, amenities, architecture, etc. There is high competition to live in these places, and it will never change. If everyone had the choice of living in San Diego, or Fargo North Dakota, 99 times out of a 100 people will choose San Diego because it is the more desirable place to be.

But we can’t all live in San Diego. So prices go up.

I’m not denying boomers could buy a house in Boston or Seattle for a cashiers salary in 1965 or whatever. But that was 70 years ago. The population doubled, immigration has increased, the nation de industrialized and the world globalized. Things change, and with it economic realities.

People try to defend living in these places because “higher salaries”, but It is a well known fact that adjusted for cost of living, the coasts have some of the worst salaries to offer.

https://flowingdata.com/2021/03/25/income-in-each-state-adjusted-for-cost-of-living/

I’m sorry, but at this point, if youre insisting on living in a place with high desireability and competition, you have to accept that what is considered middle class lifestyle in your Midwestern home state is exponentially harder to achieve in a place with lots of money. That’s not the systems fault it is a fault of your expectations. You’re not a victim. 

Edit: just to further emphasize the point- when adjusted for cost of living, average salaries for coastal states don’t actually out class those in the interior even though the sticker price is higher.

When adjusted for affordability from average salaries, Massachusetts is beaten by Iowa, Washington States is Beaten by Missouri, Oregon is beaten by Alabama, and Hawaii, California, AND New York are beaten by West Virginia.

Edit 2: people arguing that salaries on the coast ARE high enough despite evidence to the contrary. I don’t even want to argue. Either the article is wrong and making 300k IS enough in NYC to offset the costs so you shouldn’t complain; or the article is right and the rat race salaries don’t justify COL.

* Digital subscriptions (Netflix, Office 365, etc.)
* Phone and internet service
* Most physical electronics (phones, computers, TVs)
* Most durable goods that can be bought online
* Any consumption that takes place away from your home city: travel, vacations, charity/support for a dependent who lives elsewhere, etc.
* Investment grade assets, like stocks, bonds, CDs, even real estate in some cases

1. Even if you only buy a ""crappy"" million dollar house, that house is worth a  ton which you can later sell for a ton. When you retire and move to a more cost friendly area you can use that equity to live like a king.
2. You can get a much larger 401K match at your company due to your location inflated salary. This will also allow you to max out your 401K every year which will allow you to live much better when you eventually move.
3. You can also max out your IRA. 6-7K is nothing when you are making a 300K salary. Once again, this all drastically helps you in the long run when you go to retire and move to a more cost friendly area.

You have a choice, you can live in a cool fun place with lots of restaurants, culture, etc, and pay a premium for it. Or, you can move to a smaller town and get a lot less of all that but at a reduced price.

Unfortunately, similar efforts have backfired in the past. For example, ""ban the box""--laws prohibiting employers from asking about criminal records until late in the hiring process--*quadrupled* the black-white callback gap in experiments, and reduced employment of black and Hispanic men without college degrees at a macro level (https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ban-the-box-does-more-harm-than-good/). White men with criminal records benefited most.

Without information on criminal records, employers relied more on their own biases; the large unintended effect suggests that employers overestimate the share of black and Hispanic men with criminal records, so criminal records information equalized hiring outcomes. 

One could imagine a similar mechanism with salary history, whereby this ban forces employers to rely on their overstated preconceptions of the wage gap, in turn worsening it with their own offers.

I'd love to be proven wrong here. Maybe researchers will study this law like they've studied ban-the-box laws and find positive results.

Once you’re actually working in the field, you realize how much you’re forced to spend time on useless initiatives and incompetent managers.

I was told that it shouldn’t have taken more than 5-10 minutes and I should have started academic skills already). 

Not to mention that 60 years of education research has shown that the average adult reads at the 5th to 6th grade level but you’re expected to get every student above average. You’re constantly told that you’re the problem with everything by society even though you feel like you’re the only one trying to make things better.

But it doesn't matter. They're not going to pass any of this stuff anyways. Why you may ask? Is it cause they lost control of the house? Nope. 

They had control. The teacher shortage isn't new. They couldn't do shit. Manchin doesn't support any of this crap. 

Look at Michigan. Gov. Whitmer proposed teacher retention bonuses last year, knowing Republican controlled state legislature would block it. Then Democrats get control. And wow. Stunning. All financial assistance, bonuses, or talk of raises for current teachers disappears from the budget proposals. When asked about it, her office gives no comment. 

Instead they're giving scholarships for incentives to get new people into the system. Which, sure, great! But that doesn't change the system. It doesn't make the actual job or pay of the jobs better. It just makes it easier to pull people into a profession where half of people leave the career in 5 years. 

Whitmer pushed the emphasis to the scholarships and expanding preschool to 4 year olds for free. Awesome. Absolutely amazing. 

Who's going to teach them? How are you going to make people want those jobs? Because we already woefully underpay early childhood educators compared to their underpayed K-12 counterparts. Crickets for those answers. 

But hey, they're going to spend millions on tutoring for kids after school! Awesome! Who's doing that? The underpaid and overworked people you already abandoned as soon as the votes came in?

The sad reality is: I will vote for Democrats again because they are absolutely the best option. They're not making things worse. 

But they're not making things better. 

And I swear, if I see one more study showing ""We looked at the reasons teachers leave. Outside of pay, here are the reasons!"" No. Just stop. Pay people. It's that simple. 

But no one wants to do that. And the teachers are already in the room for this price, so uh... Let's just try to replace all the ones who are running because they know the con, with fresh college kids we tricked into thinking it was a great opportunity.

654,jbsjc35,t3_11o63vm,2023-03-11,Economics,"I've taught eight years, middle and high school. The first six at an alternative education school, and the last two at a public school. I was happier at the alternative school, even though they were the ""bad"" kids who got expelled, and even though I had to work 12 hours a day since the pay was so bad, because I had smaller class sizes. 

Yes, all education staff members deserve to be paid more, but for a lot of us money isn't the biggest thing. To me it's class size. And it really just depends on the makeup of individual schools. 25 might be fine in one school, another school it's 15.

For the last two years I've taught at a really low public school. I love my students, but they have a lot of issues. Once my class sizes start getting over 15 students, adding one more student is like adding five. There are just so many behavior issues, but there's also so many academic issues. I'm talking about kids who are seventh graders who read at a second grade level. Kids who need one-on-one help to complete the most basic of work. As a teacher it's impossible to deal with extreme behavior issues along side the extreme academic issues and effectively teach when I've got 20-25 kids in a small classroom. 

My school's enrollment has slowly been decreasing, and the AP said yesterday that instead of having 1.5-2 teachers per subject there would just be one. He framed this as a good thing because we'd have less students in the school and it'd be easier to control things. What it really means for me is now instead of having 95/115 kids spread between 5 classes and the rest with another teacher, I'll have 115/115 spread between five classes because I'll be the only one teaching that subject for that grade level. So now my already too big of classes to effective teach in this school just went up by 4 kids per class.

669,jbsymlx,t3_11o63vm,2023-03-11,Economics,"Hi, I’d like to chime in. I’m 23 years old, graduated in 2018 with my diploma. When I was in high school, when sophomore year came around,I started to skip school and get high. It was easy. No one ever came looking for me and I never had to worry about getting caught because there was just no one to catch me. Both my parents worked full time so I could just stay home alone if and when I wanted to…. I kinda miss those days. 

As junior and senior year came around, I would
Only go to school 2-3 days a week, and only like 1-2 days a week about half way through senior year. I wasn’t performing academically, not because I was incompetent but because I just wasn’t ever at school. Sometimes I’d feel guilty, but then I’d go to school and sit in classrooms for hours to feel like I was wasting my time. There would be worksheets to fill out and text book pages to read, that’s pretty much it. I stopped feeling guilty for skipping school because I wasn’t learning anything anyways. School was just a placeholder for me at this point, a waiting room until graduation. 

Speaking of graduation, since I wasn’t performing at school I thought I might not graduate. I began to worry, I really wanted my diploma and I wasn’t really on track to get it due to not only my grades, but also my attendance. I had no where near enough seat time to graduate. But it’s okay because they gave my graduating class these grade recovery packets that were a completion grade basically. If you completed the packet, it’ll bring your grade to a c for whichever class it was designated for. So I just filled out those packets and graduated that way, I got my diploma. This was the case for about 70% of my graduating class…. It may have been closer to 80% now that I think about it. 

This was my high school education. It could’ve been better if I put more effort into it, put more effort into keeping my grades up, more effort into attending, more effort into my mental and emotional health so actually getting out of bed and making it to school would be easier, but I didn’t because I was bored and anxious. I’d struggle with anxiety, depression, and boredom while at school. It simply wasn’t a happy place for me, and that sad thing is that there were so many others just like me, and some far worse off.",icedcoffeeuwu,t2_5rgbmvnf,5,0
670,jbu8fft,t3_11o63vm,2023-03-11,Economics,"I agree that it will take more than $60,000 to solve the teacher shortage. Look, when I made the transition from Corporate America to Teaching - pay wasn't entirely a factor for me. I made the drop from $64,000 down to $46,000. After two months of teaching, they bumped me up to $55,000 because they factored in all my master's degree units. So it wasn't as bad as of a drop. If I made it tenure at the end of this year, I would have gotten a $10,000 raise thus effectively bumping me up to $65,000. So $65,000 pay would have been doable for me for a few more years - I would have had to take more salary point classes to get to my personal min required of $75,000. 

Pay is only one part of the equation, but something that needs to be talked about are the working conditions. I'll lay out the issues below: 

1. Extremely limited bathroom breaks. This came as a shock to me coming from Corporate America. You only have recess & lunch to take your bathroom breaks. That's not how the human body works!!! If you gotta go, you gotta go. So teachers get a lot of UTIs and it is possible for UTIs to develop into a further complication because of lack of access to bathroom. 
2. No access to coffee and snacks. This was another shock because I always had free access to this no matter how big or small of a company I was at. We work with kids for God's sake and you can't even at least supply us with that? It's more energy draining than any office job. 
3. Some admins believe that you should be on your feet all day long and that if they catch you sitting down for one minute (even if its just to take a sip of water) - they think you're lazy and will write you up. This is horrible! Again, we're human and we need breaks too. 
4. Admins come into your classroom, they sit there, and they watch you work. They will do this multiple times a week or multiple times a year calling it ""informal observations"". It's unnerving having someone sit there and watch you like that. That's the most extreme amount of micromanagement I'd ever been subject to. In corporate America, managers just ask to be copied in on emails and they will only step in if there's an issue. I thought I had a micromanager in Corporate America when she was calling me every 20 minutes, but honestly, I rather take a phone call conversation every 20 minutes then have someone sit there & breathe down on my neck watching me.
5. Behavioral Challenges - Parents and Admin refuse to take accountability of any kind and they blame it on the teachers. This current generation of parents are extremely hands off unlike any other generation... all they wanna do is have fun with their kids (vacations and buying them fun stuff) without the responsibility. Parents don't discipline them at home and they refuse to reinforce concepts at home. Yet we get blamed for low assessment scores & we're doing everything we can... but we need help of the support system. Yet we don't have the support system. Parents & admins are stacked against us. 
6. Socio-Emotional Issues - After the pandemic, both adults and children cannot regulate themselves emotionally. I've seen both adults and children throw tantrums at each other, say really unkind things to each other, do such inappropriate things. I think everyone needs a social skill training. It doesn't matter who you are or how old you are - I feel basic manners and boundaries have gone.",chocolatelove818,t2_3qh891fc,3,0

But the first year she was teaching, we qualified for food stamps. The salary was a joke. She's gotten several raises from the state, worked her way up the ""tiers"", gotten her national boards, and so on. It was hard work but she's doing well now.

But even so, there are over a hundred job openings in our district for special ed teachers. Resources and specialists are stretched almost to the breaking point. Classes are overcrowded. Special ed especially benefits strongly from small group instruction, and she has 4 times the number of kids in her class than the curricula assume. 

Parents are struggling, and don't have the time or energy to participate in their children's education. Most of them are no-shows to IEPs and parent-teacher conferences -- which are all scheduled with them over the phone. Kids do no homework or reading outside of school. There's a strong ""that's not my job, that's why we have teachers"" mentality among parents, especially the ones struggling with poverty. 

The grades the students get almost fully correlate to the income level of their parents. Rich kids live in rich areas and have parents who focus on education from an early age and donate generously of their time and money to their schools - and I can't blame them for doing so. They want what's best for their children. 

But most of our state is very poor, and those struggling parents can't make those kinds of sacrifices or investments.

We're near the bottom of the country in education, and there's only so much the teachers can do. Every now and then we get a governor elected who wants to base teacher pay off student test performance, which just means teachers in rich neighborhoods will get paid more.

I support deregulation of the labor force.  And deregulation merely means ""less regulation,"" it doesn't mean no regulations at all.

It can be incredibly demoralizing for a teacher to spend years getting masters degrees in education- only to enter the classroom and find out that they are surrounded by horrible children and it is illegal to discipline them.  This is very common in the labor force, someone goes through years of formal education- only to find out that they hate the job.

There are plenty of shortages in blue collar contracting work too because of labor licensing and regulation. Logic means comparing what happens in heavily regulated vs less regulated states and countries. Are there really more accidents and incompetence in carpet installation in less regulated New York than highly regulated California?  There weren't a bunch of wicked villainous kidnappers because Uber replaced government regulated taxis.

If you think about salaries as a market transaction, you're signaling that your time is worth $X when you accept a job at a company. That of course doesn't happen in a vacuum. You probably have researched salaries, or have competing offers from other companies. That turns it into something akin to checking prices on Amazon or Walmart before deciding where to buy a product. From that perspective, transparency seems like a good thing in that it helps you more accurately settle on a price of what something should cost.

However, from a business perspective it seems terrible. I'd imagine it would sow discord among employees or demotivate people. It reminds me of the the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard in which each worker had agreed to work in the vineyard for a denarius. At the end of they day when the workers received their denarius, they became angry when they found out some had only worked part of the day while others had worked the entire day.",MrDrego,t2_36t0t,3,0

Or we can just keep doing it the way we do it now, which is to say 'Hi, we have a massive salary range, and where you fall in that range will be determined by your performance in the interview process. What salary are you expecting?'. 

It's not that we want to hide anything, we just don't know what your value is and if we broke it up into more discreet roles, it wouldn't change anything. People will still apply to the wrong roles and we won't know until the process has already begun anyways.",,,17,0

809,hx2mp13,t3_st6r6e,2022-02-15,Economics,"The highest paid individuals will make far more than the average for their field if they are in a specialized field.  They make more because they contribute more and add more value.  People are willing to pay those people more to use them because they get what they pay for.  These are lawyers, engineers, trades people, etc.  There are very low paid and very high paid individuals that have the exact same job title.

The idea that ""all jobs of the same title are equal"" doesn't apply to high paying fields.  Low paying jobs that are low skill are more likely to have similar compensation for the work done.  It's not easy to differentiate yourself and the value you add as a burger flipper or as a janitor.

The real problem are the fields where high effort work is rewarded with average pay based on job title and not value produced.  When employers or managers pay based on the ""going rate"" of the job title and not the value produced, the incentive to provide value through your efforts disappears.  Teachers get paid roughly the same regardless of whether they are awesome or terrible at their jobs.

So I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $150,000, or I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $60,000 and both would be valid depending on who the person making the statement is.  Sharing my salary is pointless.

This is why I somewhat support unions for jobs that are tough to do but there's no real need for different compensation for different efforts.  If the outcome of the job is predetermined and the employee cannot change that outcome regardless of their effort to add value, then there is no competitive advantage for that employee to improve their life.  There should be an acceptable industrial compensation that those employees should receive and sharing salaries could help them out significantly.

I don't support unions for work that can be done at very different levels and provide different values to the customers/clients.  In my field I want to differentiate myself from others in my field to be near the top of the compensation that I can get.  I can take a project design from someone else and save hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars over what they did.  People pay me more but they get more in return.  Having everyone that does what I do get paid what I get paid wouldn't be fair for the weekends, evenings, long hours, and efforts I make to add value to my work.  

You don't deserve a specific pay because you have a specific job; you have to add value to be compensated for it.  Make sure you are compensated fairly and salary sharing may help.  I recommend applying for other jobs every three to five years and taking whatever offers you get back to your current employer and letting them know what those offers are.  That is the ""salary sharing"" that will result in increased compensation for what you do if you are worth it.  You'll at least know if you're already being highly compensated for what you do even if you don't switch jobs.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,-13,0

Besides the fact that costs rise and so it’s the same as yknow $5 today being a penny so long ago, once prices rise to figures that include many digits, the prices are adjusted to be less ridiculous.

For example, in Colombia things cost ridiculous amounts, like 50,000 pesos for a taxi ride. That being said, the last three zeros are just chopped off everything and everyone treats it like a “50”. 

Prices in stores are in tens digits (with the extra three zeroes to be assumed), banknotes also essentially have the extra three zeros in parentheticals, as in its a 50,000 peso note, but at a cursory glance it looks like 50 peso note. 

So, if someday the median salary is $1,000,000.00, reality won’t look or feel like that. People could be walking around with $100k bank notes treating it like we would a normal $100 bill. People wouldn’t say things cost “one hundred thousand” because it’s a mouth full, they’d say “one hundred” with the thousand implied because with inflation a straight 100 would be a nonsensically small amount. 

So I get what you’re saying with how ridiculous it would be with prices at such high figures, but that’s not an unknown issue, many countries have dealt with out-of-control inflation before and have culturally adapted to prices with an absurd amount of digits attached to them.

The dates that OP pulled out of a hat are 1950 and today.  They draw a straight line between them and then imagine that the line continues on pretty much that trajectory over the next 73 years, landing them at $1M/year salaries.  

But the salient detail that's being missed here is that in 1950 the United States was on the Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods system was in full swing.

Why is American leadership effectively just placating and appeasing the financially well off house owning tax paying baby boomers who will be dead before climate change really affects them?

Where the fuck is **ANY** representation for Gen X and younger who will face a disastrous ever changing landscape within their life times? Flowers are literally blooming in Anartica. ""Normal"" isn't coming back. Nothing we ever did was ""normal"". 

Why do I as a non-baby boomer have to continue having my entire existence shackled to antiquated baby boomers traditions? You're uncomfortable with change and can't deal with your existential crisis that makes you uncomfortable? The goddamn Sun may explode on top of us at your age if we even have the luxury of living that long and not dying in some horrific event such as water wars. Try working until 67 fucking years old with that shit looming over you every single day. Nuclear war is hypothetically preventable, but climate change can have a band-aid slapped on a gushing wound at best and we can't even do that.  Just continue everything as is - kick the can down the road until it explodes. 

Fuck anyone under 65 years old is how this all feels.

Nihao, china” is the name of the country’s latest effort to attract foreign visitors. The logo accompanying the phrase (which means “hello, China”) features a panda—an image always handy when China wants to seem cuddly. Chinese officials have been touring the West to promote the campaign, helped by a video in which happy-looking foreigners intone the Chinese greeting. Those with a deeper grasp of the language might sense a different mood, including billboards on city streets warning people to look out for foreign spies, and government propaganda on social media urging vigilance against threats to national security. The Communist Party often tells Chinese people that tourists, journalists and businesspeople could all be after the country’s secrets.

More than a year after China scrapped its “zero-covid” policy, which had kept it sealed off from most foreign visitors from early 2020 to the end of 2022, the country is now pushing in two contradictory directions. Parts of the government appear eager to court foreigners. Last month China sent a large delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Li Qiang, the prime minister, told the gathering that “no matter how the world changes, China will…open its door still wider to the world.”

In at least one key respect this is true: China’s trade in dollar terms is 31% higher than in 2019. But The Economist has looked at a range of other measures, from visits to China by foreign tourists and flight numbers to levels of academic exchange, investment flows and even the personal travel schedule of China’s leader, Xi Jinping. They suggest a country overshadowed by a profoundly changing relationship with the West, a more security-driven style of policymaking at home and by the parlous state of its economy. China has become more inward-looking; the West more wary.

China crisis

At the most basic level far fewer outsiders are crossing borders into China. Last year the country recorded about 62m fewer entries and exits by foreigners than in 2019, before the pandemic began: a drop of more than 63%. Behind these figures lie deeper trends. Take the geopolitical environment. In the three years during which China shut its borders to prevent the spread of covid, and its leaders hunkered at home, the West—led by America—was engaged in a wide-ranging re-think of how to cope with China’s rise as a global power.

President Donald Trump focused on trying to cut America’s trade deficit with China, but his administration sought to push back on other fronts, including efforts to contain China’s military activity. There was no let-up after Joe Biden took over in 2021. In the following year Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove the wedge between the West and China even deeper. China called itself a “no-limits” partner of Russia. President Joe Biden ramped up controls on the export to China of advanced semiconductors.

The invasion threw up an unexpected obstacle to the restoration of normal flows of people between China and America. In response to Russia’s aggression, America and its allies barred Russian airlines from using their airspace. Russia imposed a tit-for-tat ban. This has impeded the re-opening of aviation routes between America and China that were severed during the pandemic: America does not want to give an advantage to Chinese airlines by allowing routes to re-open, when those airlines could save time and fuel, and therefore gain passengers, by flying over Russia.",WillT_Super_Ninja,t2_k3doysnr,15,0

It appears the wealthier CEO’s and companies are becoming, the less regard they have for the health & welfare of their staff, all the while complaining to the media of worker shortages. 

Where I live, there are 10+ daycares that closed in March 2020 that have yet to re-open. The remaining daycares have waiting lists for years to come. I know parents who’ve been on the waiting lists since the beginning of their pregnancies and have had their babies and are still on the waiting list! 

With covid positivity rates up and down, schools are in session one day and remote learning the next day. Businesses are in the same position. The higher the number of covid cases in an office, staff are expected to pivot to work remote from home one day and be in the office the next week. 

Parents have to pivot day to day where their children are concerned. Company leaders don’t appear to be take this into consideration. 

I live next door to my 80 year old mother in law. She has the spunk and youthfulness of a 60 year old! She used to watch our kids for a couple of hours each day after school. To prevent her from getting covid, we can no longer do this. She is a 3 time cancer survivor with a compromised immune system. She is fully vaccinated, including booster shot. We’ve had to limit our interactions with her and socially distance by staying outside her home to protect her. I now work remote from home as I no longer have after school childcare and from day to day I may have to play teacher and assist my kids with their online learning and resolving IT issues when they have issues connecting to ZOOM, etc. 

CEO’s and company leadership can afford nannies & staff to manage their households. Workers cannot. I’m wearing more hats now than I’ve ever worn before in my life being a Mom to middle school and college kids, who are also in class one day and remote learning the next day, working my job, being a wife and helping my husband as we manage our household, our budget, inflation, rising costs in everything and shortages for food & household items and taking care of my mother-in-law and senior citizen neighbors in my community who have no family to check on them.

If people were willing to purchase goods at a higher price, giving them more salary will allow them to purchase more, leading to a possible inflationary cycle. Most central bankers were against increasing wages for that reason.

The problem though here is with the legitimacy of the bargaining power that allows the generation of profit. Large corporation set a price. If people don't like it, they can simply create their own big corporation to normalize prices. And that's how you calculate the amount of profits they can get away with, the cost of producing redundancy. In some sectors, this cost is really high.

1281,jmlyvw3,t3_13ybj4z,2023-06-02,Economics,"The problem with using job creation as an indicator now:

1. There is no indication of the type of jobs being created - since most jobs have moved from full-time to part-time hours to keep from having to pay benefits, contribute to pensions, and contribute to Medicare for All. This leads to a necessity for the average worker to have 1+ jobs, meaning that making more jobs doesn't mean increasing economic output. There is the need for 3 part time jobs at 26.5 hours a week to cover what used to be 2 40-hour jobs. 

2. The idea of job creation as a macroeconomic indicator was one that was created and used when a ""job"" used to represent a living wage that provided enough money for a household to subsist off of. Now that most jobs pay less than a living wage, again we have the issue of the average person having 1+ job and the average household having 2+ jobs. So, more jobs doesn't mean economically better off like it used to.

3. The increase in wages represented by the creation of 1 new job is not enough to cover the loss of buying power that is represented by the devaluation of the dollar, increases in average household debt, and the high inflation rates, so a new job no longer represents a measurable increase in living standards in the American macroeconomy. Core inflation has outstripped earnings increases across the board and the economy is at a net loss for the average worker that cannot be accounted for or negated by the creation of a single new job. 

So, the creation of new jobs no longer represents an improvement in the economy or living standards for the average worker.

The definition of job creation needs to be adjusted to represent number of additional hours created versus number of hours lost if it is to retain any meaning for the economy. 

Additionally, the job creation number needs to be published side-by-side with data that shows real increases in total earnings (income growth minus inflation) to be a better barometer of economic health and well-being. 

But the media and even the Fed are caught up in this ""red hot job market"" that has little or no bearing on the reality of the economic landscape for the average American and is a red herring that many economists continue to focus on for decision making. A mistake to be sure.

The US is an oligarchy/plutocracy/kleptocracy, in which the ruling class uses the thin veneer of ""democracy"" to superficially legitimize their systems of mass human enslavement, abuse, and exploitation.

Because the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class owns and controls the political class and the political system, voting alone will never liberate the public and working classes from enslavement and exploitation.

[https://bulletin.represent.us/u-s-oligarchy-explain-research/](https://bulletin.represent.us/u-s-oligarchy-explain-research/)

The corruption, authoritarian control, and ""manufactured consent"" required for billionaires to legally exist alongside manufactured poverty and extreme political and socioeconomic oppression to keep the public stupid and docile is intolerable and obscene.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc31Vi1h4rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc31Vi1h4rk)

Just as our predecessors evolved age of consent laws, eliminated legal slavery (notwithstanding modern prison labor), and developed laws against individuals murdering each other, modern human society needs to evolve reasonable limits on property rights.

Those limits could be at 100 million dollars or whatever (age of consent laws and speed limits can also vary by jurisdiction), but you cannot be worthy of the protection and acceptance of human society if you do not accept that there are limits on the property that you can claim for yourself.

This is as obvious of a moral, ethical, and political concept as the ideas that murder and slavery should be illegal.

The only reason this doesn't seem exceedingly obvious is the abuse, theft, and extreme socioeconomic oppression inflicted by the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class on the public and working classes to keep them in line.

People claiming more than \~100 million dollars in property rights deserve to be kicked out of human society at least as much as the people raping individual children or enslaving individual people.

Question: ""But what about Elon Musk? Maybe he is driving the species forward with electric cars and Space X? Would these types of projects not get done if billionaires didn't exist?""

Answer: Public benefit corporations also exist, and the human species doesn't have to be driven only by the profit motive. Beyond that, a system in which billionaires exist alongside massive, needless (systemically and deliberately created) poverty, keeps the collective intelligence of the species much lower than it needs to be, which is one of the main things holding back the human species.

And beyond that, for every ""ethical"" billionaire, there are a dozen more Kochs, Mercers, Murdochs, hedge funders, and other kleptocrats lobbying for mass human enslavement, abuse, poverty, and stupidity ""behind the scenes.""

No one should consent to a system of unlimited property rights any more than they should consent to a system of unchecked, unlimited political power.

The capitalist/corporatist/kleptocrat media will never admit the truth about this and will do everything they can to lie, distract from, and suppress the truth.

The truth is that the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class is [socially murdering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_murder) the public and the working classes, in large part through the political class and the political system that they own.

Because the so-called justice system doesn't recognize social murder as a crime, the ruling billionaire/kleptocrat class gets away with abusing and murdering the public and working classes with NO RECOURSE.

The policy question of our time that the capitalist/corporatist/kleptocratic media can barely ask, let alone answer correctly, is ""Should there be limits on property rights?""

The answer is yes, and it's time for the public and working classes to build the power to fight the abusive ruling class, establish those limits, and re-write the ""social contract"" for the 21st century.

Property rights beyond a reasonable limit should be aggressively nullified, as should any social contract that protects the obscene property rights of billionaires/kleptocrats by subjecting the public to mass enslavement, abuse, and exploitation.

The ruling class will continue their policy of socially murdering the public with no recourse until the public and working classes build up the power to stop them.

""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."" -Louis Brandeis

""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress."" - Frederick Douglass

EAT THE RICH, unionize, support ranked choice voting, build power outside of the two party duopoly, and vote Democrat until an actual labor party develops.

A [32 hour work week](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/f4bade/comment/fhqhco4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) would give the public and working classes the leverage, bargaining power, and intelligence to stop the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class from socially murdering the public and destroying the planet.

Imagine the world we could create if the public wasn't being enslaved and socially murdered for the profits of the ruling class.

This is because my partner realized that I was better able to meet my educational goal while simultaneously having improvement with with serious mental illness. As a result, he asked me to stop working until I had completed my education (which mental illness has drawn out longer than it would have otherwise been). I'm fortunate to have a support network that made it possible for me to do this, and a partner who believes that my well-being is now important than the small amount of money that I would have been able to make working part-time.

In any given year, 20% of the US population is dealing with mental illness, and around 70% will experience mental illness in their lifetime. Unfortunately, the culture in the US, as well as the economic reality for a great many, is that taking care of your well-being takes a back burner to making money. The economic consequences of the ""money first"" cultural mindset aren't something that I ever see included in the conversation of people choosing to leave the labor. Stress, depression, & poor diet (due to lack of time to cook, lack of energy to cook, or income which is insufficient to provide a healthy diet) have the potential to linger until they cause long-term consequences on physical health. Add to that the fact that insufficient quality and quantity of sleep can exacerbate mental illness. These alone have the potential to force people out of the labor market and on to disability and publicly-funded healthcare. At this point, they don't really make enough to pay taxes, and don't have disposable income to participate in the economy, outside of purchasing whatever necessary goods and services they are able to afford. 

So, why is this not the conversation that we have? Why is it always framed like taking care of one's self, rather than prioritizing work, is bad/selfish/irresponsible? Health-minded workers may not be what is best for employers, but why is the conversation not about the cost to taxpayers and the economic consequences of having workers leaving the labor market permanently, due to workers ignoring their health problems until they develop into disability?",Miathemouse,t2_p54ng,2,0

Considering we are at full employment **and** there is well-known shortage of healthcare workers in particular, CareCentrix is in a labor market where they can't pay minimum wage if they want to hire and retain employees.

A game of poker is zero-sum, not because the amount of chips on the table is fixed at time X(they are, but that’s not a definitional characteristic) but in order for me to change how many chips I have over time I.e gain more chips, I must take them from another player in the game who must lose them.

If this were true in the real world (we’re all shuffling around a fixed pot of value) - where did that value come from in the first place?

Your argument is that the pot comes from the transformational nature of labour over resources - no one disagrees with the that.

Edit: I realized I didn’t address the cash vs non-cash portion too clearly. Sometimes providing the service is better than cash, such as Medicaid.

Specifically, the high-paying jobs discussed here are often higher risk than the lower paying ones--not physical risk, always, but career path risks, financial risks, and so on. And what drives risk taking? Excess testosterone. 

You think I'm joking about testosterone? Check out [this peer reviewed article](http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2808%2900067-6/abstract ) on testosterone and financial risk preferences. Here's an excerpt from the abstract:

>Many human behaviors, from mating to food acquisition and aggressiveness, entail some degree of risk. Testosterone, a steroid hormone, has been implicated in a wide range of such behaviors in men. However, little is known about the specific relationship between testosterone and risk preferences. In this article, we explore the relationship between prenatal and pubertal testosterone exposure, current testosterone, and financial risk preferences in men. Using a sample of 98 men, we find that risk-taking in an investment game with potential for real monetary payoffs correlates positively with salivary testosterone levels and facial masculinity, with the latter being a proxy of pubertal hormone exposure

As far as ""social expectations"" go, maybe society expects men to take those risks, but what is the causation? If testosterone causes risk taking, then naturally, as a result, ""society"" expects men to take the risky, high-paying jobs, and women to seek security at the expense of lower pay.",IslandEcon,t2_8qiwh,6,0

So if these 2500 people were mainly older Gen X, Military or Boomers all of which have or have a high probability of pension then they could easily live on 1.3 million due to the offset of the pension and SS and possible employer-provided secondary insurance.

Being pregnant felt like crap, but I was still expected to show up at work every day and give 100%. I had to go back to work before my kid was even sleeping through the night.... I won't even talk about the compete joke that 12wks of unpaid  ""leave"" is in the U.S.

Then after the exhaustion of working all day, instead of laying back on the couch and relaxing, I am chasing a toddler around the house for hours. We go from playroom, to living room, to hallway, to kitchen, again and again and again. Sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up, near constantly on the move. It hurts my back, my hips, my shoudlers, etc Especially on weekends when it's near constant motion for around 8 to 9 hrs a day.

I have no time to relax. No time for TV, exercise, or hobbies. I do more laundry and dishes than I've ever done before. I spend hours preparing nutritious meals only to watch handfuls get thrown on the floor between screaming and tears. Even on the weekends they wake up at 6:45am so you're perpetually exhausted and have to accept a 10pm bedtime or deeply regret it. They need constant supervision because they are always finding ways to injure themselves.

It is hard to maintain friendships or a social life b/c of chores and lack of childcare on weekends. It's also tedious at times. I've heard the same Fisher Price songs on loop so many times I have them menorized. I never do what I want to do anymore. It's all about the kid almost all of the time. Even when we go out for a treat,  like eating at a restaurant, we have to make sure it's kid friendly and bring things to entertain her.

We only have two remaining living grandparents and 1 lives out of state, so there is very little help there. Both have a series of medical problems that we also coordinate taking care of on their behalf. Both are widows from a generation where they need help with paying their bills, setting up a roku, interacting with A/C repairmen, etc.

Having kids while both parents work is physically exhausting, emotionally draining, constantly overwhelming, and just f**king hard every single day. The time for me to be myself is between 8pm and 9:30pm every night, at which point I am stressed out and exhausted for anything except mindless TV comedies. There is no meaningful shred of time that belongs to me anymore. I count down the days to when I can have just a little alone time or sleep in on a weekend. I will never, ever have a second for this reason. I love my kid immensely and would do it again for them in a heartbeat, but I am at my goddamn limit. 

So why aren't women in most developed societies having more kids? Because we've reached the very real physical limit of time in a day, and most child rearing activities are really unenjoyable. Sure playing online videogames, taking a bike ride, or even just watching TikTok videos aren't ""meaningful"", but they damn well feel good in comparison!",econgirl8,t2_8jazx,327,0

The solution is called [Efficiency Wage Theory](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/efficiency-wage-theory/)*.  In effect, at market-clearing rates, there is no incentive for employees to remain loyal to their jobs or employers. Because of this churn, the training efforts of firms to train employees places drag on their MPL (Marginal Product of Labor), which is exactly the issue outlined by the title.

By paying above market-clearing rates, the MPL increases to not only reduce employee turnover, but to increases the incentives to try harder and maximizes the MPL at a rate higher than equilibrium and the additional production (more than) covers the increases in wages.

Why CEOs aren't required to take and apply Labor Economics is beyond me.

1625,j2w2h7h,t3_102rwko,2023-01-04,Economics,"TLDR: Harsh reality - over 3 years I switched 3 jobs. This resulted 3x salary increase, free luxury company car and 100% working from home office in my private garden district house so that I can munch on my own home grown ripe juicy tomatoes for lunch or walk my dog in a close by pine forest while still living in a capital city.

Full story (bragging):

1-st job 2016-2021: I was 24 when started it in this innovation centre, spent there 5 years working with scientific research, R&D, MVP, POCs.
Started as an engineer on country average salary. After 3 years become a Head of Prototyping lab. Salary doubled, responsabilities doubled. Used my own car and gass to visit customers. Had to work extra hours to deliver. Bonus - free worldwide trips and business trip to Burning Man (yeah, I know... but I was an art builder there). For 2 years saraly was the same. Bought a house which needed lots of renovation, so neither the budget, neither the spare time was sufficient to have a comfy life.

2-nd job (2021-2022): they found me on LinkedIn and bought me. Design engineer in a foreign capital company. Salary 4 x country average (double from previous work). 8 to 5 job, close the door and forget one. Gass compensation for trips to work. Life in a cubicle. 4 days work weeks on summer months. Bonus - travel to USA for trainings, trips to other countries to support customer site tests. Con - 1h15min drive to the office.

3-rd job (2022-present): they found me on LinkedIn and bought me. 6 x country average salary. Working as a tech. consultant for tech. companies. First time they checked me in 2018, offered way less (3 x country average), but my qualification was now much higher and they doubled the old offer. Free company car (Lexus), free gass for personal use, 100% working from home office, except the trips to visit customers F2F. I am considered as an independent contributor, so much flexibility. As long as numbers are met, I can work the way I want. Since I live in a private house on a capital city garden district it was a no brainer. No traffic jams, fresh air, pine forest, small veggie garden, apple trees. Sometimes working from a hammock under an apple tree. Bonus - wordwide trainings and working with bleeding edge tech. Cons - the one can get draged down to daily overtimes to deliver if not being efficient. But I try to optimise my effort and workmanship so that 8 hours of work with a healthy rest breaks in between would suffice.

So that is my past 3 years. I was lucky that my speciality rolled out from my hoby, so it was relatively easy to get the skills and knowledge in the field or adapt super fast to a smal pivot in speciality since it was personal interest, not only job. Though, it was constant effort all three years to improve myself.
So the wins are definately a better income situation, better life/work ratio, more prestige if that matters.
The loses are - first job was actually fulfilling me as a human being, as I helped others. Got to work with young talents, got students involved to get their first hands on projects on R&D. Also tought youth and developed STEAM labs at schools.
Current job is less fulfilling, since it is just a big corporate world I got into. Though I will try to gain some fulfillment while helping smaller and younger tech. companies by helping them to develop good products, but it won't be the same as seing some student finish his first real prototype.
So I guess you gain something, you loose something.

My colleague who took my place at my first job got about 15% rise over those 3 years, while I tripled my salary. So changing jobs is worth it as long as you are ready for extra stress as a new hires get while they adapt. For me - I might stay here for a while now just to get more in to the comfort zone and then maybe start my own business or something. What is rarely worth it is climbing the ladder, since salary increase is usually lesser that the extra work burdened over the ones head...",Ciakis_Lee,t2_ds7vyjn3,4,0

Essentially it’s gambling on that new hire that time and money spent will benefit the bottom line. If an employee gets trained for x amount of time but quits two weeks after…back to square one. So now the company is hemorrhaging money into hiring. If they can’t keep the doors open local, sate, federal tax revenue disappears.

* The central bank has said it will use all its tools to bring inflation back to its 2% target, and that includes looking at how companies are setting prices.
* This is a new approach for the Bank of Canada, which has traditionally focused on monetary policy to control inflation.
* However, the central bank is under pressure to act more aggressively to bring down inflation, which is running at a 31-year high.
* By looking at corporate pricing behavior, the Bank of Canada is hoping to get a better understanding of why inflation is so high and what it can do to bring it down.

* The Bank of Canada has said it will be ""particularly attentive"" to corporate pricing behavior in the coming months.
* The central bank is concerned that companies may be using the current inflationary environment to raise prices more than they otherwise would.
* This could lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of inflation, as higher prices lead to higher wages, which lead to higher prices, and so on.
* The Bank of Canada is hoping that by shining a spotlight on corporate pricing behavior, it can discourage companies from raising prices unnecessarily.

Janet Yellen Is Struggling at the Treasury Job She Never Wanted

The ex-Fed chair has been sidelined by the White House on some key issues.

It was supposed to have been a capstone. Instead, Janet Yellen’s stint as Treasury secretary threatens to become a stain on a storied career.
The former Federal Reserve chair was recruited to help steer the US economy out of the pandemic by lending her gravitas and credibility to the Biden administration’s pursuit of a robust and lasting recovery. It took some arm-twisting to persuade her to take the job.

Eighteen months later, Joe Biden’s presidency is in trouble, with inflation soaring to a 40-year high and Democrats on course for a wipeout in the midterm elections. The 75-year-old Yellen finds herself trapped in the inevitable blame game, fighting to keep her professional reputation intact.
On May 31, Yellen took matters into her own hands and did something that caught the White House by surprise. She admitted to the American public on CNN that she “was wrong” about the path inflation would take. The administration had thus far been relentlessly trying to paint the surge in consumer prices as temporary.
With her statement, Yellen broke ranks with Biden’s inner circle—which doesn’t include her—and exposed the dysfunction at the heart of an administration that’s botched its communications around the country’s economic problems. Americans haven’t felt this dismal about the nation’s—and their own—prospects since the recession of 1980, according to the latest reading of the University of Michigan’s gauge of consumer sentiment, while polls show the majority of voters disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation.

Some of Yellen’s travails come with the territory. US Treasury secretaries are supposed to take a leading role in formulating economic policy but at times wield less influence over important matters than the president’s own cadre of advisers. The job demands sharp elbows and assertive salesmanship, helpful in dealing with Congress. These are qualities frequently associated with Robert Rubin, Henry Paulson, and Steven Mnuchin, all of whom worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before being tapped for the top job at Treasury, and not with a soft-spoken technocrat like Yellen, who’s accustomed to the more predictable and measured world of central banking.
Yellen’s most tangible accomplishment so far is the progress she has forged on an international tax agreement designed to halt a global race to the bottom on corporate tax rates, a goal that has eluded negotiators for nearly a decade. The framework has the support of almost 140 nations but US voters, preoccupied as they are with kitchen-table issues, have not taken much notice.
This account of Yellen’s struggle to find her footing is based on interviews with almost two dozen current and former senior officials in the US and elsewhere, most of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly. Yellen declined to comment for this story.",ImpossibleHandle4,t2_5p3gy4rk,185,0

That’s actually such a powerful move.

Also I’m an idiot - I thought she’s still the Fed chair 🤦🏻‍♂️ It makes sense for a Treasury secretary to admit fault if that’s what it takes to gain back trust.

Let’s face it she not working for the American people with clear lies that we may not be headed for a technical recession. In the same way inflation was temporary or “transitory”. 


Not only did she not want the job but also just a bad appointment. She given no insight on the fiscal direction the country should take beyond parroting fed talking points.

I appreciate how open Yellen is and I believe her ability to realize when she is wrong and persuade others of that party to be aware of their mistakes is an asset in the Treasury position.

We have a list of applicants a mile long and work very hard to do the right things: good onboarding and training process, GREAT benefits for our industry, safe and respectful workplace, guard against burnout, etc.  The amount of potentially very good candidates that we screen, select, hire and onboard only to have them not show up after the first 1-5 days is unbelievable.  I've been in business for 30 years and I have never seen anything like it.  Not to sound naive, but I really do not think it's pay rate or benefits, because our package is FAR better than those that we are competing with for the workforce.  I am not opposed to raising rates, but I have experimented with that in the past in my small towns of 3,000-4,000 and the result is that I end up paying more money to the same people to do the same work.  I know I am not alone; everyone I network with is having the same problem with entry-level/non-skilled labor.

So the question is: are these circumstances, these ultra short-term hires, contributing to the ""jobs-added"" number?  If that is an economic indicator, then I would suggest that we are far worse off than some would like us to believe.",31Tumbler,t2_6xa54a5o,1,0

1808,ismihs3,t3_y5nwwl,2022-10-17,Economics,"I’m still a bit confused about the whole recession thing; Oxford Languages defines a recession “by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters,” the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports Q1 2022 & Q2 2022 as decreases in GDP of -1.6% & -0.6% respectively. Why are we talking about this? The Wall Street Journal released “Economists Now Expect a Recession, Job Losses by Next Year” on October 16th stating that a survey conducted among economists that anticipate a recession within the next year has risen. By definition, it is here.  
  
Is this too much to couple with rampant inflation that the Feds are seemingly unable to tame? Sure, we’re late to the party in raising interest rates to mitigate inflation, the Federal Banking system is now playing catch up and the broader markets just slipped below the pre-pandemic highs, the DOW sitting at $29,634 or roughly 200 points below the February 2020 high.  
  
The Federal Reserve just needs to play its game to subdue inflation, and fiscal policy needs to remain aligned with these initiatives. How do we tell a nation to hold on to their britches for the next 12-18 months? A bump in Social Security payments by 8.7% (Tergesen, 2022) for individuals on fixed income will aid while we ride to the other side, a privilege this country has.  
  
Hard times create strong people, strong people create good times. Jerome Powell said there would be “pain,” I can appreciate his candor.

1809,isksrs9,t3_y5nwwl,2022-10-16,Economics,"That might not be very important if GDP goes down. GDP isn't a very meaningful indicator. Our economy is very heavily burdened by impersonal capital income earners and economic rent seekers that inflate GDP numbers, for example. These things are very bad for the economy, yet inflate a number that people wrongly believe is an indication of a good economy.

Let me give you a perspective about the GDP. The optimal economy has 0 GDP. That doesn't sound right, yet it's entirely true. Imagine if we created a general AI that eliminated scarcity. Everything would have a price of 0, so GDP would necessarily have to also be 0. Yet the economy would fulfill all of our need without requiring any labor from us. This would be objectively ideal. 

The point I want to make is that an economy is something complex that can't be simplified to a single number.

What we are seeing now is production responsibilities shifting to generations of smaller size as well as inshoring. In these circumstances, it would be unbelievable to have any significant reduction in employment. 

As the smaller laborer population will have to support an aging population as well as the class of impersonal capital income earners and economic rent seekers, they'll be sucked dry. The governments will have to find other sources of revenues to afford public services. Especially since the retarded central banks decided it was a good time to increase rates. So governments will have to seek other sources of revenue, and they'll target the impersonal capital income earners and rent seekers first.

 If higher taxes disincentivizes those parasitic behaviors, which compensations are included in the GDP, then it might very well cause a decrease of the GDP. But that'll be a good thing since those behaviors are very bad for the economy.",Holos620,t2_8duym,6,0

>The jury ordered NAR and others to pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages to a class of more than 250,000 home sellers. Under antitrust law, that figure can be tripled to over $5 billion, at the court’s discretion. 

>Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, was impressed that the jury understood the complex antitrust arguments about market power well enough to rule for the class. 

>“It was unclear whether a jury would understand the economics of price-fixing well enough to see NAR’s rule of having the seller pay the buyer’s agent as a scheme to prevent competition, but they did,” she posted on X this afternoon. “Bravo to the [prosecutors] for their economics communication skills.”

>The case, *Burnett et al. v. NAR et al.* is the first of two antitrust lawsuits centered on NAR’s commissions policy to go to trial, and it could upend the structure of the entire real-estate industry, which the class of plaintiffs claims amounts to a giant price-fixing conspiracy. 

>The “cornerstone” of this conspiracy, according to the complaint, is the requirement for home sellers to pay commissions to the agent representing the buyer before listing homes on the property database used nationwide, the Multiple Listings Service—which local NAR associations control.

REX Real Estate chief executive Jack Ryan told the New York Times that the verdict is “extremely good news for Americans.” If commissions can be lowered, “the price of every home will come down, jobs and wages will go up, tax revenues will increase, people can easily move to better and more fulfilling jobs,” he wrote.

NAR released a statement to say that the association will appeal the verdict. But an appeal may require an appellate bond amounting to over $5 billion, that NAR and its co-defendants may not have.

- typical selling agent commission is 2% in the main markets but you can negotiate less, particularly if the house is very expensive or likely to be easy to sell

- buyers rarely use an agent and if they do the fees charged are either flat (up to about $20,000) or around 1% commission

75% of Americans are incorrect in their assessment. Most ""talk show"" economists are incorrect. People in general just do not have a good grasp of logic when they allow emotional fear to steer their conclusions. 

There will be structural unemployment, as AGI is tried and reliably used, in say, a call center, those workers will be replaced by it, but this will just mean there will end up being more call centers and there will be an equilibrium point between the hardware and maintenance required to use AGI and human labor.

Secondly, AI does not have bodies, physicality will have a higher cost (and lower equilibrium as a result). Ironically a fast food worker will likely not see as much structural employment due to needing to physically be there. 

The average person has no notion to the cost associated with AI, Open AIs GPT costs billions... granted AI investment world wide is multiple trillions, but these investments want a return. The cost will decrease exponentially, but the transitional period will not be stark and immediate, it will be slow and methodical... employees will be retrained, people will still work though our work will be different. 

Then we will use AI personally, likely through BCI. Which will slowly become a standard across industries, then will become societally expected (those who refuse will end up like modern day Amish).

The reason this is all more probable than not is opportunity costs. It is more costly to immediately adopt AGI. It is less costly (in terms of time) to use human labor. The most successful businesses will be ones that most effectively integrate AGI with their employees. 

Lastly something I want to point out is that demand for digital existence and experiences will skyrocket, already there is not enough for many people today, this alone is a market that will eat up all surplus resources just for entertainment of not only humans, but of AGI as well.",Bismar7,t2_9or2a,3,0

>The historical parallel often trotted out in discussing wage-price spirals is the 1970s. Price and wage inflation seemed to interact throughout that decade, much as the spiral framework suggests. 

>Each surge in general price inflation was followed by a surge in wage inflation, which was followed by more price inflation—and on it went. 

>But the 1970s are flawed as evidence for the existence of spirals.

‘Wage-price spirals’, according to evidence, “are a caricature of what happens to an economy with an inflation problem”:^1,2

>Late last year a group of economists at the IMF interrogated the historical record, creating a database of wage-price spirals in advanced economies dating back to the 1960s. [...] Judged by this longer standard, the IMF economists offered a more upbeat conclusion: the “great majority” (they omitted the exact percentage) of short-term spirals were not followed by a sustained acceleration in wages and prices.

Wage growth is a lagging indicator, confounding hot takes to the contrary:^1,3,4

>[...] the spiral thesis claims not merely that wages matter, but that they predict future inflationary trends. 

>On this count, the Chicago Fed economists found the relationship unidirectional: inflation helps to forecast changes in labour costs, but changes in labour costs fail to predict inflation. Service providers, in other words, raised prices before rising wage costs hit their bottom line. 

>Mr Barlevy and Ms Hu posit that employers may have been ahead of the curve in anticipating the effects of a tight labour market. That makes wages a lagging, not a leading, indicator for inflation.

>Adam Shapiro, an economist with the San Francisco Fed, has been even more critical of the wage worries. In a note in May, he isolated unexpected changes in wages to argue that rising labour costs were only a small driver of non-housing service inflation and a negligible one in broader inflation. 

>Like his Chicago colleagues, he concluded that wage growth was following inflation.

2001,kganj6c,t3_18yg3p0,2024-01-04,Economics,"This article essentially rests on the idea that unemployment benefits should be revised whenever we have more unemployment. I base this on the fact that the article notes that state lawmakers have broad power to increase benefits, but are being distracted by the good jobs numbers. I disagree with this basic argument.

First, because not every movement in the economy is a crisis requiring state intervention. You could see this a lot in the early COVID recovery, when businesses in some sectors monopolized the media daily to complain about how difficult it was to hire staff (“no one wants to work anymore”). They demanded the government take action. This was, at its core, an assertion that their businesses should be protected from the natural ebb and flow of market activity by state intervention. Nevermind that the PPP had already intervened by underwriting the staffing costs of millions of businesses with easily-forgiven loans. They wanted even more direct interference to force people to change industries and work for lower wages. You also saw this later with the rise in interest rates, the ensuing collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and the weeks of strident calls in the media once again for state intervention. This time, influential tech investors demanded a full bailout for SBV and that interest rates be once again decreased until their hyper-leveraged industry could become solvent again. Once again, private industry reacted to an ebb in their position in the market by demanding manipulation. Whether or not unemployment benefits should increase is of course a somewhat different issue with its political basis in a totally different group of people, but the reaction to a living market is the same. Sometimes things are good, sometimes things are bad. Let’s not react to every downturn by rigging the market.

Second, and more simply, because the benefits should be set at a reasonable level that works while unemployment is fine and also when it is bad. How many people are on it should make no difference, unless the system is about to run out of money.",LoriLeadfoot,t2_iptbfpg9,105,0
2002,kgahd7s,t3_18yg3p0,2024-01-04,Economics,"*From Bloomberg News reporter Michael Sasso:*

An unexpectedly strong US jobs market is helping average Americans keep spending while staying up-to-date on their bills.

With the US unemployment rate still hovering near historical lows, advocates for America’s jobless worry that the solid labor-market data is hiding the pain of those stung by recent cuts in sectors like housing, technology and human resources.

It’s also allowing state legislators, who have broad license to set benefit levels for unemployment insurance, to keep payouts achingly low. Five states have weekly payment maximums below $300, despite inflation that’s raised the price of an average basket of goods and services by almost 20% since 2020. A third of states don’t account for wage growth, and by extension inflation, in their payouts.

By the numbers, the average American should feel relatively secure in their jobs. Friday’s employment report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by a robust 170,000 in December, based on economists’ forecasts, and the jobless rate ticked up to 3.8%, still low by historical standards. Weekly jobless claims have remained low as well, while wages keep increasing, helping to offset rising prices.

In Atlanta, LaRon Eskew, 28, lost his job at a large bank’s data center in February. He’s been getting by on gig work — fixing cars and installing security cameras — but the side hustles only bring in about three-quarters of his former salary.

“I wouldn’t say I’m sweating bullets, but I’m up to my neck,” said Eskew, whose rent has climbed to $1,600 monthly from $1,200 per month in the past two years.

Businesses will seek financial professionals who can help them manage costs and enhance profitability. Companies will also value personnel who possess deep technical expertise, are excellent communicators and collaborate effectively with colleagues across multiple departments. 

Positions with the best prospects include:

1.    Tax accountant: Companies will seek tax accountants who can help their organizations achieve bottom-line savings through effective tax management strategies. Businesses also need their guidance to maintain compliance with tax regulations, such as FAS 109 and FIN 48. Tax accountants with one to three years of experience at large companies (more than $250 million in sales) are expected to see an average national starting salary in the range of $46,500 to $61,500.

2.    Compliance director: Firms need professionals who can help them comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandates and prepare for the potential transition to International Financial Reporting Standards. New regulations that are issued as a result of the financial crisis may generate further demand for professionals with the requisite compliance expertise. The starting salary range for a compliance director at a small company (up to $25 million in sales) is forecast to be $83,750 to $108,500.

3.    Credit manager/supervisor: Companies need professionals who can contribute to the bottom line by reducing inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. As a result, credit and collections specialists who can evaluate credit risk, manage delinquent payments and help improve cash flow are in demand. Base compensation for credit managers/supervisors working in small companies is projected to range between $42,500 and $57,500.

4.    Senior financial analyst: Businesses need professionals who are able to evaluate financial plans, forecasts and budgets, and identify ways to improve profitability. A senior financial analyst at a midsize company ($25 million to $250 million in sales) is anticipated to earn $57,750 to $74,000 in starting salary in 2010.

Giving students unlimited access to loans has simply driven up the cost of education because education is characterized by a high demand market (i.e., highly inelastic market). Think about it, if you need a life-saving prescription or some service that is essential to your well-being you will pay whatever it takes to purchase that service. Most people agree education is also essential in this sense. In fact, you will pay (and borrow to pay) as much as you possible can to purchase such essential services.

The corollary of all this is that seller will charge essentially whatever you can afford. If you can only afford $100, the seller can only charge that much. If you can borrow $900 more and the seller knows you absolutely require that service, they will charge $1000. This is what is happening right now in the education market. The government essentially gives students access to more loans with the intention of making education cheaper when in fact the universities know how much additional loan assistance the government has provided and simply increases tuition by the amount of the assistance.

This is simple economics, really, in a high demand market. By restricting the amount of loans made available to students, this will reduce the amount of tuition universities are able to charge thereby eliminating the amount of debt students are saddled with when graduating.

Sounds about right factually speaking. The question is, what's a college degree worth? 

Look, in 1981 and earlier a person could *probably* make a living without a college degree.  What are you left with now? Coffee Shop? Retail Hell?  

Unless you're in a union town you're basically screwed without a college degree. There's something to be said about starting your own business, but then again - you'd benefit from an accounting degree if you did it.

So don't look at it as the value you receive from a college degree, look at it like how fucked you are without one and factor the costs from that end.  

Yes, yes...I'm sure there are plenty of singular examples that 'disprove' the need for a college degree. The rest of us 'regular' human beings didn't have the right timing, luck, rich uncle, whatever.

I want to say I am NOT at all against people making more nor do I NOT understand that inflation is most definitely a thing and people are struggling out there.

People primarily work (especially in low income jobs) in order to survive.  If you can answer this question, perhaps you’ve got a clue as to what happened.    

My theory is a combination of things- living with less (no childcare, no commute, no work related expenses) combined with consolidated households (parents, brothers, sisters, living situations much more common in developing nations) have resulted in a subset of the population not needing to return to work to survive. The juice simply wasn’t worth the squeeze, and now they’ve evolved. If that’s true, things are about to get much more interesting in the labor markets.",chubba5000,t2_1vuofvcc,423,0

We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report weekly statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, job postings, and employment rates disaggregated by county, sector, and income group. Using the publicly available data, we study how COVID-19 affected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts across subgroups. We first show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in March 2020, particularly in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in affluent, dense areas. Those businesses laid off many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses, especially among low-wage workers in such areas. High-wage workers experienced a “V-shaped” recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger, more persistent job losses. Even though consumer spending and job postings had recovered fully by December 2021, employment rates in low-wage jobs remained lower in areas that were initially hard hit, indicating that the job losses due to the demand shock led to a persistent reduction in labor supply. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we evaluate the impacts of fiscal stimulus policies designed to stem the downward spiral in economic activity. We show that cash stimulus payments led to sharp increases in spending early in the pandemic, but much smaller responses later in the pandemic, especially for high-income households. Real-time estimates of marginal propensities to consume provided better forecasts of the impacts of subsequent rounds of stimulus payments than historical estimates. Perhaps because of the substantial expansion in government support, consumer spending remained high even in low-income areas where many workers lost their jobs. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policies can stem secondary declines in consumer spending and job losses, but do not have the capacity to restore full employment when the initial shock to consumer spending arises from health concerns. Furthermore, even after health concerns have abated, changes in labor supply among those who lost their jobs may lead to persistent reductions in employment. More broadly, our analysis demonstrates how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and real-time policy analyses, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.

You need a minimum of two degrees to make slightly more than minimum wage, or less than minimum wage, when you consider all the hours you have to put in outside of class--roughly one-to-one, when you factor in lesson planning, marking, and ancillary tasks.

You'd think they'd get some recognition for this herculean effort of raising society's children for virtually no compensation. After all, parents will complain about the behavior of their *one* kid, and how stressful it is, but teachers have to not only control the behavior of 30+ kids (including multiples of that *one* kid that all the parents complain about when it's their own kid)--they also have to teach them. And stay up-to-date with curriculum requirements, regulations, standardized testing, new learning initiatives, and other red-tape obstacles to doing an effective job, put in place by micro-managing non-educators who think they can ""solve"" education by means other than properly funding it and treating professionals like professionals.

What kind of recognition do teachers get for their efforts? For putting up with this broken system and doing their best to make it work, despite the lack of compensation? More or less, they get shit on by media and used as a punching bag by politicians.

[NCES has a tool that lets you really dig into all the things TALIS measures](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/idetalis/format.aspx), but I can't for the life of me figure out how to use it, and we can see a report what it thought were the most interesting figures from the latest full TALIS cycle [here](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019132.pdf). NCES also keeps very detailed statistics on American teachers in its [Digest of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/current_tables.asp), with salary data being in section 211.

&#x200B;

Overall, it looks like American teachers are paid pretty well, but it's offset by unusually long teaching hours, leaving little time for planning, professional development (which tends to be of low quality in America, anyway, although REL [released resources to address that earlier this year](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/northeast/OurWork/Resource/7) and WWC is chugging along), office hours for individual attention, coordination with special needs and ELL staff and oversight, and peer engagement. As with medicine, the move toward holding practitioners to evidence-based practices determined by the academic sector (see: WWC) and chosen by administration, while a natural part of the field professionalizing, reduces perceptions of difference-making and autonomy, as does the greater progress-checking apparatus that, at the very least, tells teachers that administration doesn't have blind trust in their self-assessments of efficacy.

Such conceptions and words are, the Churchy Science, Justice, the State, and Civilization, Thus, the Church becomes not what it really is, a number of men who have all fallen into the same error, but a ""communion of those who believe rightly."" Justice becomes not a collection of unjust laws framed by certain men, but the designation of those rightful conditions under which alone it is possible for men to live. Science becomes not what it really is : the chance dissertations which at a given time occupy the minds of idle men, but the only true knowledge. In the same way Civilization becomes not what it really is : the outcome of the activity (falsely and harmfully misdirected by force- using Governments) of the Western nations, who have succumbed to the false idea of freeing themselves from violence by violence, but the unquestionably true way towards the future welfare of humanity.  ""Even if it be true,"" say the supporters of civilization, "" that all these inventions, technical appliances and products of industry, are now only used by the rich and are inaccessible to working men, and cannot therefore as yet be considered a benefit to all mankind, this is so only because these mechanical appliances have not yet attained their full perfection and are not yet distributed as they should be. When mechanism is still further perfected, and the workmen are freed from the power of the Capitalists, and all the works and factories are in their hands, the machines will produce so much of everything and it will all be so well distributed, that everybody will have the use of everything. No one will lack anything, and all will be happy.""

Not to mention the fact that we have no reason to believe that the working men who now struggle so fiercely with one another for existence, or even for more of the comforts, pleasures and luxuries of existence, will suddenly become so just and self- denying that they will be content to share equally the benefits the machines are going to give them — leaving that aside — the very supposition that all these works with their machines, which could not have been started or continued except under the power of Government and Capital, will remain as they are, when the power of Government and Capital have been destroyed, is a quite arbitrary supposition.

To expect it, is the same as it would have been to expect that after the emancipation of the serfs on one of the large, luxurious Russian estates, which had a park, conservatories, arbors, private theatrical troupe, an orchestra, a picture gallery, stables, kennels and store-houses filled with different kinds of garments — all these, things would be in part distributed among the liberated peasants and in part kept for common use. One would think it was evident that on an estate of that kind, neither the houses, clothes, nor conservatories of the rich proprietor would be suitable for the liberated peasants, and they would not continue to keep them up. In the same way, when the working people are emancipated from the power of Government and capital, they will not continue to maintain the arrangements that have arisen under these powers, and will not go to work in factories and works which could only have come into existence owing to their enslavement, even if such factories could be profitable and pleasant for them.

It is true that when the workers are emancipated from slavery one will regret all this cunning machinery which weaves so much beautiful stuff so quickly, and makes such nice sweets, looking- glasses, etc., but, in the same way, after the emancipation of the serfs one regretted the beautiful race-horses, pictures, magnolias, musical instruments and private theaters that disappeared. But just as the liberated serfs bred animals suited to their way of life, and raised plants they required, and the race-horses and magnolias disappeared of themselves, so the workmen, freed from the power of Government and capital, will direct their labor to quite other work than at present.

"" But it is much more profitable to bake all the bread in one oven than that everybody should heat his own, and to weave twenty times as quickly at a factory as on a handloom at home,"" say the supporters of civilization, speaking as if men were dumb cattle for whom food, clothing, dwellings, and more or less labor, were the only questions to solve.

An Australian savage knows very well that it would be more profitable to build one hut for himself and his wife, yet he erects two, so that both he and his wife may enjoy privacy. The Russian peasant knows very decidedly that it is more profitable for him to live in one house with his father and brothers ; yet he Separates from them, builds his own cottage, and prefers to bear privations rather than obey his elders, or quarrel and have disagreement, "" Better but a pot of broth, and to be one's own master. "" I think the majority of reasonable people will prefer to clean their own clothes and boots, carry water, and trim their own lamps, than go to a factory and do obligatory labor for one hour a day to produce machines that would do all these things.

When coercion is no longer used, nothing of all these fine machines that polish boots and clean plates, nor even of those that bore tunnels and impress steel, etc., will probably remain. The liberated workmen will inevitably let everything that was founded on their enslavement perish, and will inevitably begin to construct quite other machines and appliances, with other aims, of other dimensions, and very differently distributed.

This is so plain and obvious, that men could not help seeing it if they were not under the influence of the superstition of civilization.

It is this wide-spread and firmly-fixed superstition that causes all indications of the falseness of the path the Western nations are traveling, and all attempts to bring the erring peoples back to a free and reasonable life, to be rejected, and even to be regarded as a kind of blasphemy or madness. This blind belief that the life we have arranged for ourselves is the best possible life, also causes all the chief agents of civilization — its Government officials scientists, artists, merchants, manufacturers, and authors— while making the workers support their idle lives — to overlook their own sins and to feel perfectly sure that their activity is, not an immoral and harmful activity (as it really is), but a very useful and important one, and that they are, therefore, very important people and of great use to humanity ; and that all the stupid, trifling, and nasty things produced under their direction, such as cannons, fortresses, cinematographs, cathedrals, motors, explosive bombs, phonographs, telegraphs, and steam printing-machines that turn out mountains of paper printed with nastiness, lies and absurdities, will remain just the same when the workers are free, and will always be a great boon to humanity.

Yet to people free from the superstition of civilization, it cannot but be perfectly obvious that all those conditions of life which among the Western nations are now called "" civilization,"" are nothing but monstrous results of the vanity of the upper, governing classes, such as were the productions of the Egyptian, Babylonian and Roman despots : the pyramids, temples and seraglios; or such as were the productions of the Russian serf-owners : palaces, serf-orchestras, private theatrical troupes, artificial lakes, lace, hunting packs and parks, which the slaves arranged for their lords.

It is said that if men cease to obey Governments and return to an agricultural life, all the industrial progress they have attained will be lost, and that, therefore, to give up obeying Government and to return to an agricultural life would be a bad thing. But there is no reason to suppose that a return to agricultural life, free from Government, would destroy such industries and achievements as are really useful to mankind, and do not require the enslavement of men. And if it stopped the production of that endless number of unnecessary, stupid and harmful things, on which a considerable portion of humanity is now employed, and rendered impossible the existence of the idle people who invent all the unnecessary and harmful things by which they justify their immoral lives, that does not mean that all that mankind has, worked out for its welfare would be destroyed. On the contrary the destruction of everything that is kept up by coercion, would evoke and promote an intensified production of all those useful and necessary technical improvements which, without turning men into machines and spoiling their lives, may ease the labor of the agriculturists and render their lives more pleasant.

The difference will only be, that when men are liberated from power and return to agricultural labor, the objects produced by art and industry will no longer aim at amusing the rich, satisfying idle curiosity, preparing for human slaughter, preserving useless and harmful lives at the cost of useful ones, or producing machines by which a small number of workmen can somehow produce a great number of things or cultivate a large tract of land ; but they will aim at increasing the productiveness of the work of those laborers who cultivate their own allotments with their own hands, and help to better their lives without taking them away from the land or interfering with their freedom...""

Mikael Rahmani, a senior at Boston University, checks all the boxes: extracurricular activities, good grades, internships. But as the clock ticks toward graduation, he’s struggling to find a job — despite applying to about 15 a week.
It was only a couple years ago that graduating seniors were able to leverage multiple job offers and boost their compensation. But after a pandemic hiring spree, major companies in technology, finance and consulting — top destinations for ambitious students — have been cutting costs and consolidating their workforces.
Read more: EY Says It’s Cutting US Jobs, Delaying Start Dates for New Hires
Rahmani had a full-time offer from HP Inc., where he interned last summer, but he turned it down because he didn’t want to relocate to Houston. Now, he and other college seniors interviewed by Bloomberg News are grappling with a sluggish white-collar job market, where companies navigating an uncertain economy and higher interest-rates have pulled back on entry-level hiring.
“I’m seeing a little bit of a disconnect between my internship prospects last year versus my full-time prospects this year,” said Rahmani, who is studying finance and business analytics.
The issues for new graduates started to pop up last May as layoffs in technology and finance soured their job prospects. And it’s gotten worse. Layoffs have mounted, and fewer employees have been quitting, leaving less room for new hires. University career-service centers say full-time recruitment is eerily quiet. More interns aren’t getting job offers. And start dates for some new hires have been delayed or even rescinded. It’s bad enough that University of Michigan alumni who graduated into the Great Recession were recently asked to speak to current students.


To be sure, the overall labor market has proven resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes to quell inflation. The health care sector, for instance, has created more jobs. But growth in better-paying industries such as technology and financial services has been more uneven. Hiring in both sectors was down more than 20% in November compared to a year ago, according to data from LinkedIn, an employment-focused social media platform.
What’s more, mass layoffs earlier this year have given rise to greater competition. In 2022, there was a job opening for every applicant, according to LinkedIn. Now, there are two applicants for every job.

“The question is what jobs are available?” said Kory Kantenga, a LinkedIn senior economist, noting that many young professionals are concerned about finding a position that matches their skillsets. “Are you going to end up as a barista with a bachelor’s degree?”

This summer, many students began to realize that landing a coveted internship at top companies was not necessarily a guaranteed path to a full-time job offer.
In one example, managers at Apple Inc. told interns they’d be given an update on their conversion to full-time roles in October. But when the month passed with silence, many interns felt ghosted and were left scrambling for interviews late in the recruitment season, according to people familiar with the matter.
“When employers want to shrink down, the easiest way to do it is to freeze hiring. That doesn’t matter all that much to most employees who already have a job,” said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “So the impact mainly falls on new hires.”

Nicole Jurado, a senior at Miami University in Ohio, said looking for a consulting job has been a “blood bath” this fall. The 21 year old applied to as many as 26 jobs — and made it to late-stage interviews at Deloitte— but is ending the semester empty-handed.
It’s been a shock. She had four internship offers last year, including one at Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. where she spent the summer. But she does have a plan B: grad school. It’s better than settling on a job that “doesn’t live up to my standards,” she said.
While it may not be 2008, today’s job market is a harsh reality check for students who feel they did everything right. Those who have locked in jobs say at times they’ve also felt forced to make compromises. Some class of 2024 students with offers at consulting firms, including, Bain & Company Inc., are having their start dates delayed by months.
Despite the ominous signs, many students, including Jurado, say they’re hopeful they’ll land their dream job.
“This year I’m doing the exact same things, taking the same steps and I have zero offers,” said Jurado. “I’m stubborn. I know what I want and what I deserve. I want to be able to say I’m happy to wake up today and go to my job.”",Any-Formal2300,t2_fvk5njozu,31,0

1) employers are being selective, not raising wages to accelerate filling of empty roles (hence many openings)

2) employees being more selective, not settling for lower wages in less appealing jobs

3) frictional mismatch of skill sets in shifting market, where growth coming from different sectors.  It takes time to retrain people.  Example: lots of people left hospitality and service industry for good, no going back.  But they aren’t qualified for the fastest growing sectors: health care, senior care, green energy technicians, data analytics, actuary and accounting

The first point is good in the sense that desperation of hiring isn’t leading to a wage/price spiral, accelerating inflation and forces more rate hikes from the fed.  

Second point is good too.  If people can afford to not take crappy jobs for low pay, that’s awesome.  I hope they can hold out long enough that industries are forced to improve because they can’t hire people (looking at your restaurants).

Third is what it is.  There are simply fewer and fewer jobs for moderately skilled workers anymore.

I’m broke and need glasses right now (-8.00 vision) do I couldn’t make out much about him but then, as people do sometimes, waiting, we engaged in conversation.  

The relevant part to this post?
He was recalling how our area did a LOT of manufacturing back in the day; and  paid qualified workers $15-$20-per-hour *during the Cold War.*

Back in 1969, my mom was going to be paid $1600 *to start,* as an automotive journalist.  

Back when I started working a job, most people paid $10 per hour.  I remember working for one restaurant company.  They paid their  head line cooks $14 an hour.  (1987)

Retail Clerks Union had us at $5.50 an hour; but with benefits, overtime, double time, holiday pay, a credit union.  (1982)

Suddenly this all stalled...was it gradual, or did everyone suddenly realize something was amiss? 
I’ll tell you when I noticed a difference.  

In 1987, I was offered a management job for 19,000/yr. 
A male co-worker started the same time, same position...$26-$27,000/yr.  I didn’t even stress that.  Why? What could I do? But $19,000 was a cut.  

I definitely felt the difference.  I thought “Well, I will pay my dues and go the salary route.  Try to get somewhere.” I ended up having to go back to waiting tables/tips.  Because I was in a high $$$$ area, again I didn’t noticed wages stalling.  

But then I began trying to move out of restaurant work,  discovered wages had simply stayed put and employers didn’t mind turnover, no, not at all.  

As the years passed, my older friends began losing jobs they’d held for 30+years, homelessness increased, Enron scenarios reoccurred...and all the rest of it.  

At this time, elected officials keep bleating about raising minimum wages.  Partially because they finally realize most jobs are minimum wage to start now, or perhaps $1.00 over, as a grand draw.  
I just don’t see how cost of living/wages will ever match up again.  

It can be done.  [Gravity Payments ](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/business/gravity-increases-employee-minimum-salary-to-70k-trnd/index.html) 

I remember reading about Ben and Jerry’s financial model.  An executive could not give his/her self a raise unless everyone in the corporation could receive an increase in income.  

So...why aren’t we praising these people to the skies? 

I’m not saying financial perfection will only be achieved when everyone gets to have everything, just because they want it.  

Just feels like we’re getting pushed backwards, again.  

I just remembered Hogarth’s etchings of “Gin Lane” in London.  

***That*** is what gets me riled.  All through history, there’s been this vast divide between the wealthy/powerful, the comfortable and the wretched poor.  

But after two World Wars, it looked like that was going to change.   The irony is that those ancient behaviors didn’t change.  

We kept tugging our forelock and looking down humbly, certain that something about the way the sun lit *our* downturned hair would alert The Great Ones passing by that there’d been a mistake: We belonged with Them, up at The-Great-House.  

Okay I’m done for a bit.

Edited: I wanted to go to college. When I graduated high school, I needed to work as much as possible.  
Now I could go back for skills now...
We forget: People get tired, and stuck.

I am not sure I agree with it in practice however. There is a growing wealth of University studies on the economic impacts of minimum wage increases in cities that have passed this type of legislation I'm the past 10 years or so. These suggest that minimum wage increases do in fact provided increased purchasing power for those impacted with minimal inflationary pressure on consumer prices or significant decreases in overall employment. I think the issue with the standard macro-impact model is it doesn't account for the fact that minimum wage increases only impact a minority of labor. Overall labor costs in the economy don't move as measurably as the model assumes. Here is one such [link](https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-testimony-feb-2019/).

They started by offering $12 an hour and I suppose they didn’t find enough people so they raised it to $13, then $14, then $15, and finally stopping at $16 an hour and that finally got them enough potential workers. High employment raises wages naturally. As opposed to having a minimum wage rate that forces companies to lay off workers to meet marginal productivity of labor, which will result in higher unemployed. You can’t have high employment and low wages, it’s not possible (unless people are forced to work for nothing, but we don’t live in socialism.) 

This article is probably examining people who still haven’t left their minimum wage job to find a better paying one because they’re unaware of how good the market is right now for employees. You can find an hourly job paying $12+ an hour in less than 15 minutes. You want a true “labor first” job market? Lower taxes on corporations. Lower taxes gives corporations more income to raise production and labor which leads to more profits. Obviously corporations benefit the most from this, but they benefit from taxes as well because they just pass costs through to the consumers by raising prices.

Recently I got a call about a freelance gig for a web editor job. They told me that it was an emergency and that they were looking to get someone hired very fast. They were straightforward (like freelance gig used to be) that it was for this specific project that would last until January. I said that was fine. I've done this before.  


Four days pass and I get an email with an interview schedule. There were four calls over three days all of them on WebEx except for the pre-interview the night before which was on Microsoft teams. For one evening I thought it was the recruiting agency making this difficult until the next day in the first call with the client there were five people and four of them stayed on mute with no video. The second one had three people. I am 100% sure I did not get that job because I had a hard time hiding my frustration with their bloated interview process. How many people needed to hear the same info from me?

2693,hdzk6cs,t3_ptoehr,2021-09-23,Economics,"A lot of very good comment. I see both sides of the medal (getting a job and hiring). I can say that in my domain the problem is on the hiring side.

We engage you because you are very good in your domain... but we don't follow your recommendation (on project design, tools etc.). You can't have the elite in the domain and make it sweep the floor. No matter what is the pay. Once this is know... well the elite  will share with other in the domains and this will be known. The opposite is true too, be a cool place and good employees will attract good candidates.

We have strongly average condition! We proudly have hired the best firm to validate salary scale just to be sure that we are there together with others averagers in the industry. Why can't we get more candidates?

We agree that you have a crucial talent we need, but in the name of equity we can't accommodate you on salary/vacation/hours management etc.

I can go on... employers use a work structure designed for production (40 hours/weeks, 5 days a week) and won't revise this for other kind of works (like developper / devOps / devSecOps / etc). Time is a very weak indicator of the value of a dev. It's impossible to be performant 40hours a week. You want to hire devs? 6 weeks vacations, 32 hours / week, 4 or 5 day basis (at the dev discretion). Put in place good ""Technological leaders"" that will tell you what need to be done (even if you don't see why it is important). Actually I don't think devs have more than 5 hours of good concentration times per days. Following that we can probably drain 100% of the value of any dev in 20-25 hours per week. Add a few meeting (few is an important keyword here) and you probably have the best working condition to get the most of them. The sweet spot is probably bellow 30 hours.    
    
Edit:    
Ho also, an employee is quitting? make sure you understand why and see if it's an isolate case and normal or if you have a problem. Celebrate ""what he have done for you"" in the years he was there and say goodbye.

* 83.0% -> 82.4% (-0.6%) Labor Force Participation Rate, 25-54 years
* 40.3% -> 38.6% (-1.7%) Labor Force Participation Rate, 55+ years

If we go back just 3 months to August 2022, the 25-54 rate was 82.8% compared to 83.0% pre-pandemic.  That's pretty much unchanged from pre-pandemic.

It's not just the participation rate that matters, though-- it's the total size of the labor force. The US is demographically aging and shrinking, just like every other advanced economy. That means we are seeing a reduced participation rate from a declining force size.  


Which means a wage increase has been baked into the pie for quite awhile, and we're seeing it now.

What people don't realize is that, once upon a time, when college was only for the elite, it was never primarily about studying something that would enable you to get a job. College was were the boys of decent families went to network, and to pool them all in one place so that the daughters of decent families could find them more easily. After school, no matter what you studied, your uncle gave you a job. Or, you went to work for the father of the girl you met at school and married.

Sure, there were always future doctors and lawyers studying with the aim of going to graduate school, but this was a minority.

When the middle class began going to college, they went to get jobs -- at first. They studied engineering, or teaching, or pre-med and pre-law. But a couple of things happened. The colleges began to style themselves as vocational schools, and developed the business major. Meanwhile, other departments -- English, philosophy, and, much later, ""puppetry"" -- began to get on board and looked to get some of that student loan money, money which *never* should have been made available for those purposes.

Colleges have always had an elitist side. That's *not* the side ""society"" ever should have subsidized. The elites know how to take care of themselves.

2824,c2z3t1j,t3_m8o0g,2011-11-12,Economics,"There are numerous causes of the unemployment crisis in the U.S. these days.  Chief among them is that many of the jobs that don't require relatively sophisticated skill sets have been replaced by technology.  Support staff in particular, positions which used to require only high degrees, have been hit hard.  And it's been documented repeatedly that industrial jobs in the U.S. have disappeared.  To a significant extent it's always been the minority that had professional and math/science skills.

Also, however, what a lot of the younger generations don't realize, because they grew up in a nation in which it already was reality, is that *globalization*, which was praised so mightily in the 90s, has devastated the U.S. job market, as many jobs, up and down the pay scale, have been offshored.

A result of all of those and many other factors is that a person essentially has a choice when s/he chooses a major.  Unfortunately this choice exists whether s/he knows it or not--and whether or not s/he understands its implications.  

The choice is whether to major in something that may lead toward employment or in something that may lead to an expansion of knowledge or personal satisfaction but may not lead to employment.  To some extent this choice has always existed, but its effects may be getting exacerbated these days due to many of the factors mentioned above.

Also, of course, to a large extent, this choice is influenced by many factors which pre-exist the declaration of a major, including high school preparation.

Whether a society should, in effect, subsidize majors which don't lead to immediate social return is arguable.  Many societies fully endorse subsidization of the humanities.  

Unfortunately, the U.S. isn't close to doing that, and until the masses realize just how much we've lost due to globalization and technology, and children are educated on how to cope with those losses and/or U.S. society undergoes a profound transformation, complaining about it isn't going to accomplish much.  

I've read statistics that say that up to 15% of people in the U.S. are unemployed (including those no longer counted as unemployed).  Economically we're on the verge of collapse, and it has nothing to do with the issues politicians typically identify.  Instead, their pro-corporate myopic policies which tend to compensate their political supporters have devastated our nation.  Choice of major is only another symptom.

2828,c2z5ibe,t3_m8o0g,2011-11-12,Economics,"Judging from the quality of the critique I would say that Will should revisit how much his Graduate studies actually contributed to his mental reshaping. The fallacious logic and liberal use of emotion-intensifying words like ""moron"" and ""tone-deaf progressive editor"" seem to say more about what it apparently takes to pursue graduate studies in philosophy at the university he attended. but ok let's look at it:

>>Conservatives sometimes bitch about the National Endowment for the Arts, but they rarely bitch about the fact that State U employs a healthy handful of poets, sculptors, violists, and other artists totally extraneous to the goal of winning the economic future from the Red Chinese.

Does he understand _why_ the endowments exist in the first place? Because people realized (pre-Communism) that in order for countries to be taken seriously they need to have a well rounded culture and that living in a Metropolis-style dystopia isn't exactly an attractive scenario. Universities (public and private) support the arts for that same reason. Sometimes it's hard to put a precise dollar figure to it, but it is in the institution's financial interests to offer them.

Put it this way: you're a parent trying to pick a school to goad your child into attending. If a college can offer exposure to arts majors and performances, you're automatically going to prefer that one. Parents (in general) are interested in their children living a rich a diverse existence, whatever gets them there is going to win every single time.

Having ""nice things"" (at the very least as a society) is what makes going to the widget factory day after day bearable.

**tl;dr:: ** Arts are subsidized in the first place for a reason/reasons, ignoring those reasons and then claiming they're pointless luxuries is itself pointless. 

Also, I disagree with the headline on two grounds: a) It's not what the author was saying, he never explicitly stated that he considered philosophy to be a ""whimsical middle-class life choice"" he said that of puppetry and b) philosophy actually _isn't_ a whimsical choice. It's hard to find a way to relate it to something in the production system but that doesn't make it irrelevant.

Metaphysics can sometimes get pretty ""out there"" in terms of practical concerns, but that doesn't mean that a huge field of human study is irrelevant as a result of that. Even metaphysics contains concepts that are useful within the field of philosophy itself. Without philosophy we wouldn't have [Daniel Dennett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) or [Karl Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) both of whom have made massive contributions to the philosophy of science. Ethics and logic (both philosophical fields) are at the core of the work done in all legal and political fields, so yeah, glad we're not worried about _those_ things, right?

Read about Rosseau and Locke in highschool? Locke was also a physician and Rousseau was also a composer, but I bet they never talked about Locke's patients or had you listen to a work by Rousseau in class, did they?

How many of our current politically process is dominated by people without a firm grasp on logic or ethics? If those two fields were even touched on in any detail how many of our current problems would be gone within a generation or two? If kids are taught basic logic for a year or two in high school (at least to the point of understanding formal logic) then they will grow up to be a nation of not-Bachmanns. Bringing the kids in early on and explaining logic to them heads off the problem we're at now, where there is a attention-demanding critical mass of people who are clearly incorrect but still feel like it's something to be debated and no matter how long you talk to them it never clicks why their process of ""fightin' it up"" isn't yielding any useful results.

**tl;dr** Philosophy can get pretty esoteric in a way only academia can accomplish, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a field of study that has yielded (and is yielding) valuable results to other fields over the centuries in addition to improving the quality of life for people who have modest .

Excerpt:

>Starting Tuesday, companies with at least four workers that post a job that may be performed in New York City will be required to include salary ranges, whether they advertise jobs online, in a job fair flier or on internal bulletin board. 

>Similar laws for job ads have been enacted in Colorado, California and Washington State. And since 2017, four other states have adopted laws requiring companies to disclose a pay range to job candidates at some point in the interview or negotiation process, according to the National Women’s Law Center.

>As transparency rules take effect in some of the country’s largest job markets, their proponents hope that pay disparities for women and workers of color will narrow. 

>In 2020, women earned 84 percent of what men earned, according to Pew Research Center, and the gap was wider for women of color. In the federal government, where pay rates are public, women made on average 93 percent of what men earned in 2017.

>New York City’s law has been met with some resistance by employers and recruiters, who argue that it will introduce hurdles in an already tight labor market.

At the very top of industry, virtually all are men. They are working 90 hours a week and do nothing else but work. Very few women are willing (or want) to do that. Also, most men don’t either.

So a few more points could force companies into ""unheard"" of decesions that modern business and corporations simply have never had to make, all without making a sink or swim situation.

Here's the historical data. Look in particular at the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, the late 1990s, and the late 2010s:

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ZQpM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ZQpM)

In all of these cases, unemployment/jobs data was very misleading. In the mid-1970s, unemployment was high, but demand (in terms of nominal spending) was growing too rapidly and so there was persistent inflation (stagflation). The same was true in the early 1980s, when inflation was very fast in 1980-1981 even as unemployment was high.

In the late 1990s and late 2010s, we saw the opposite phenomenon. Low unemployment and excellent job growth coincided with low and stable inflation, because demand was on track.

The previous administration sat down with the incoming administration back in 2017 to walk them through a hypothetical in which the United States would have to deal with a pandemic worse than the 1918 Spanish flu. Many specifics were gone over, like the potential for a shortage of life-saving ventilators, and it was communicated that a coordinated, national response as quickly as possible would be necessary to control the outbreak and keep the numbers relatively low. Of the 30 or so transition officials who attended the presentation, nearly all have been let go, fired, or quit, including a National Security Council directorate at the White House that was explicitly set up to deal with a pandemic which was disbanded in 2018 by the White House. The US went from a state of preparedness to a state of being unprepared, and we're still in a situation in which the White House is regularly sharing false or misleading information and there are few if any vitally important orders or standards being shared at a Federal level to control the outbreak. 

This is an example of where policy and economics are inextricably linked. 

Looking at the responses to the pandemic in places like South Korea demonstrate where decisive action taken to institute a ready plan to deal with pandemic can mean that the rate of infection can be significantly slowed and governments haven't had to shut everything down. South Korea's health authorities came together in mid-January, months ahead of other nations, to develop a test, to work with pharmaceutical companies to produce the chemicals needed for testing, and put in place a significant infrastructure for testing not only of those with symptoms but even mild or suspected cases (remember, by mid-January we knew that COVID-19 could remain symptomless but transmittable for many days). This allowed the South Korean government to laser-target individual quarantine orders and to otherwise isolate those found with the virus. Most of those who quarantined weathered the illness like they would any other, but those who had more severe symptoms were already confirmed and could go to hospitals and be treated appropriately with all necessary safety measures in place. 

As a result of these policies, South Korea has been able to keep most factories, most retail shops, and most restaurants open, significantly reducing the economic contraction that we're now seeing in the United States. It's almost certain that while there will be some significant economic cost for South Korea in the short term, in the long term the economic cost will be negligible compared to countries which reacted slowly or poorly.

Want to see this more locally? The San Francisco Bay Area was one of the first hotspots for COVID-19 in the United States, and a number of counties in the Bay Area issued Shelter-in-Place orders two weeks ago, about a week after schools started closing. [According to this article, published this morning](https://brokeassstuart.com/2020/03/30/bay-area-curve-stays-flattened-ucsf-er-stays-quiet/?fbclid=IwAR1Od6FlK5MuEoWfolTcP5PUXkWEwViFb5LpikNFAmHNtZEa2S4wlLMTQgQ), indicates that local health authorities are seeing new cases of COVID-19 with severe symptoms leveling off. People with mild symptoms are doing the right thing and staying home, most people are respecting the shelter-in-place order and are engaging in social distancing behavioral rules. Compared to New York or New Orleans, the Bay Area is actually doing a lot better, and it's because local authorities acted before state or national authorities, many of whom are still fucking around.",Willravel,t2_31guv,20,0

This implies that majority of the human population will have developed either an immunity by the beginning of the next quarter or a highly effective vaccine is made available and distributed to a majority of Americans.  I find it highly unlikely that America is going to have this virus buttoned up just in time for the next quarter.  I've seen projections that say this pandemic has a two year life span.

I remember job fairs all throughout College where companies would tell you something to the effect of ""to be honest with you about 70-80% of what you're learning won't actually be used with us"". It was more so about your background (which encompassed basic knowledge, and personal). 

Sure having some semblance of background in said field helps. Yet often times each business has there own ways and methods of accomplishing their goal (s) and or target (s). Which you learn by training on the job. Gaining experience with the job. Heck it's also known that some jobs require a multiple months training program degree or not.

There are also successful Bosses and CEOs who don't have a degree but have received an job opportunity, trained on the job, became proficient at the job, and worked their way up. On the flip side, there are plenty of people who know at least one Boss and/or CEO with a degree and/or ""scholastic accolades"" that are horrific at their job and know they have no business holding that position.

And of course there are plenty of people who got a degree in a specific field, and ended up landing in a totally different field. On the job training.

**(Edit, TL:DR) So, I don't feel sorry for said businesses/companies that claim that they are ""so desperate for workers but they can't find anyone who wants to work"".

In college it's when you truly need to figure things out because truth be told teachers and curriculum aren't designed to ""teach you"" as much as see what you can do.

Fine, you know your book, now, what can you do with it? Do you actually understand how to make a profit about it? And how are you going to fill all the required tasks in a single week? Use your imagination and no, parents aren't going to talk with head-staff about how you got depressed on finding everything so difficult, you are an adult now.

There is also the fact you are basically tested to see if you are capable to grind through, you actually develop a lot of patience while learning to catch the in-between meaning of what you are being told, and you have to see how to make functional teams instead of buddies you spend the time with you but will drop at the first sight of work.

Are all these things enough for making you a good employee?

They are a start, but having a college degree is the best warrant a company can get about you having bothered both with the attitude and the strength of character to see the bitter end.

Oh, and just to add the next level, you are now competing against automation, which means it's not only not enough for you to have a good memory or being dedicated, you need to out-think tireless, utterly loyal physical and digital machines with perfect memory and no need for vacations, you need to show you are valuable, you need to show no machine can beat you, and you need to show them they can give you the task and it will get done better than if you just put some ERP software to do the things and you are a nice and friendly office companion while doing so, most of what we call experience is exactly that, the company asking you you to be likable and trusty.",Commander_McNash,t2_1u295zyv,0,0

I disagree with the first part about mistakenly equating college completion with work aptitude.  Finishing that degree is a hell of a lot of work and and takes grit and perseverance.  You learn a lot about researching and critical thinking.  These are important skills that matter to any career.  In addition, even if your degree isn't specifically tailored for the job you end up in, going through your gen eds you pick up a lot of different useful knowledge like how math and science work.  You gain a lot of awareness of the world as you learn more about it.  That's not the same as experiencing being directly a part of it, sure, but at the same time this kind of perspective you don't pick up in your day-to-day experience either.

I definitely agree that self-acquired knowledge and nonacademic experience should still be valued but I hate to see all this anti-intellectualism growing in society too.  Casually implying that college completion doesn't translate in to some sign of work aptitude is ridiculous.  I have an IT career that required me to have a 4 year degree to be hired and also I was hired because I'd learned a lot about computers on my own.

I had 20 minutes to inspect the house before the next buyer arrived. I loved it, put in a deposit, and my offer was rejected. 

3 months and 4 rejected offers later, the seller contacts my agent to say the sale fell through and would accept my offer if I was still interested. 

I agreed and scheduled an inspection, which came back with only a few very minor repairs that were needed. I didn’t have the chance for a walkthrough until closing day. I closed last September. 

By October, I realized that this “fully renovated home” was renovated very badly. The “new roof” turned out to be 5+ years old with a failing patch, and a severe leak into the living room. The backyard floods very badly when it rains. ALL of the appliances all died within 2 months. 
There was missing flashing and caps on the roof, as well as HOLES large enough for squirrels to start living in my attic. 

I feel like if I had the chance to walk the property for more than half an hour, 3 months before closing, I might have caught some of this before it was too late.

I had a beautiful home listed in July, one of the nicer homes of the year for that matter, under priced by 5k and it went under contract just yesterday after we dropped the price on another 15k last week.  What I’m saying is, yes some people may be upside down if you are in a thriving city or a booming city but their jobs will back it up and pull them through.  They may have to stay there a little longer to get back on top but there are jobs this go around and the parameters are different for lending than they were in 2008.

3292,k92lfvl,t3_17ua2zg,2023-11-13,Economics,"A few thoughts...

1 - Job hopping is 100% the best way to get a raise.  I actually changed jobs a few years ago after years at one place and it was crazy the urgency by my old employer to match my new salary.  They were actually angry that I wouldn't tell them what my new offer was and I was like, ""Lol....no.  The new place told me what they think I'm worth.  Why don't you take a shot?  There is a number I'd stay for, but you'll have to figure it out yourself.""

2 - I also suspect that Gen Z is in a good spot to do this.  Kids make it hard to job hop and relocate because everything revolves around your children's schools until they go off to college.  But we hear about how Gen Z isn't having kids, so that makes job hopping easy.

3 - Remote work also helps a LOT.  I'm a 50-something Gen Xer and part of my job does have to be in person.  I can do a lot from home, but sometimes a political dumpster fire erupts and I need to put on my flame repellant business suit and go into the office to pee on the fire.  But my minions don't need to deal with that political shit.  I basically designed their jobs so they don't need to come in unless they want to.  It helps me with recruiting, but it also makes it easier for them to leave.  

4 - The one caveat is that by the time they're getting \~15 years into their career, I really don't want to see their resume be a series of 2-year gigs.  I do like to see at least one stop on their resume where they stayed for 5-6 years.  Sometimes job hoppers are just bad at their jobs and keep moving to avoid the knife.  It's pretty smart, but I do like to see that they sunk in one place, had to live with a boss finding out how good/bad they are at their job, live with the long-term ramifications of decisions they made, etc.",dogs94,t2_wvez1,73,0

Companies that have struggled to fill job openings in the US for long stretches are starting to ask a pressing question: Do we really need those roles?

With interest rates soaring, stocks tanking and fears of a recession mounting, employers are axing jobs or dialing back their once-breakneck hiring plans. Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., America’s two biggest private employers, have said they’re thinning out their hourly workforces through attrition. Jobless claims, while still low, have risen slightly, based on a four-week moving average that smooths out weekly volatility.

The pace of job postings has also slowed in recent weeks, according to data from career site Indeed, and not just in the hard-hit tech sector: Even hospitality job opportunities have decelerated, although they’re still above pre-pandemic levels. Those vacancies are staying unfilled for longer periods as increasingly skittish executives slow-walk the recruitment process. Reluctant to say they’re curtailing or even freezing hiring, companies instead couch their moves with corporate jargon like a “review of business processes.” 

“They don’t want to talk about a hiring freeze, but what they are doing is adding an extra layer of scrutiny, like saying only the CEO can approve these jobs,” said David Vied, the global sector leader for medical devices and diagnostics at executive recruitment and consulting firm Korn Ferry. “There is this stealth slowdown.”

To be sure, plenty of jobs are available, and qualified candidates are in high demand in today’s tight labor market with openings still near record highs. But vacancies are staying unfilled longer, according to Greg Summers, North American president of recruitment firm Cielo, as it’s tougher to coax people out of their current jobs.  


White-collar workers, keen to resign just months or even weeks ago for higher pay or a more flexible work arrangement, are now reassessing whether it’s worth jumping ship in choppier waters, according to recruitment experts. 

“The balance of power is shifting,” Vied said. “There is this erosion of the power of the job candidate.”

More than six out of ten CEOs expect a recession before the end of next year in the region where their company primarily operates, and an additional 15% think a recession has already hit, according to a Conference Board survey of 750 CEOs and other C-suite executives conducted in mid-May. Since then, the benchmark S&P 500 has fallen further and the Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates by the most since 1994, with the expectation that inflation will cool and the US unemployment rate will rise to 4.1% by 2024, from 3.6% today.  

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that policy makers aren’t trying to “induce a recession now,” but that the “pathways” to overcoming inflation while maintaining a strong job market “have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.” Powell’s critics, including Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, expect the jobless rate to go even higher. 

Employers are getting caught in the middle of this macroeconomic mess, stuck with dozens of job openings they can’t fill while also wondering whether they actually need to fill them.   

“Virtually every organization we work with has an absurd number of open job requisitions right now,” said Melissa Swift, the US transformation solutions leader at workplace consultant Mercer. “They sit around unfilled for very long periods of time. This is both a crisis, and an interesting indication that we simply might not need some of those jobs.""",Ron_Reagan,t2_ci9r0wen,159,0

3432,fl5wbx3,t3_fme38h,2020-03-22,Economics,"Hello. I started a small business awhile back with a passion of mine in a real niche interest group. It suddenly became a force to be reckoned with and swept the industry (no, not coins, I enjoy having healthy profit margins). I was not prepared for this and somehow managed 100h weeks alone for 19 months on top of my part time job.

I was also not prepared for coronavirus or the ways in which it has, and will continue to, fundamentally change every detail of our lives that once were. I saw things start to get some real momentum and knew I definitely couldn't do this alone. 120h/weeks would not be scratching the surface. I can't keep up on email/orders. I have to give myself intermittent reddit breaks for r/coronavirus updates because I can't rest between orders long enough to do anything at length.

That being said:

I've had to hire five package stuffers and two online customer service reps, both of whom are working remotely from home. I hired someone to run post office dropoffs and inventory pickups. He rides his bike and is fit, and I'll know he needs time off if he cannot catch his breath to make the ride. That's when I'll offer to pay him to stay home so he gets better sooner and comes back to me sooner. He's an essential service as far as I'm concerned, and he deserves every penny that people are willing to pay for his superb delivery service, timeliness and skill.

We also took on local delivering - because now apparently we have local clientele which I never knew existed - and my customers are very pleased at the steps we are taking to not only protect our employees, but them also. They are a lot more comfortable spending their money, that's for sure!

I'll be hiring an online media director in the next 36h and those are hardly more than just words to me right now. I will provide them with PPE and check-in to make sure they're healthy. The first round of masks, gloves, sanitizer and vitamins / cough drops just arrived to my two WFH. They are in good spirits. They tell me they eat well and treat themselves well and they look it. Good. Things like this are the reason why I have zero problem paying them what I do.

All of them just lost their jobs because of the virus. I'm paying them hazard pay and will pay them when they get sick so they can come back to me healthy and keep kicking ass. Some just went from too poor to pay electric in full to ""my family is now prepared.""

There is a lot of doom and gloom. A lot are suffering. But PLEASE don't close your mind off to the possibility that maybe things will be alright. I've got over half a dozen families boned by coronavirus now making better money than they were before.

I used to average 20 orders on a busy weekday. I have a pile of shipping labels as thick as a book. This is unreal. I hope to continue to expand and take the necessary measures to protect my employees, because right now, that's the #1 failing of every American company. The American public absolutely loves that a small one man show that has more awareness about customer and employee health than the US government. I've had so many people tell me they were thankful their product was delivered by a person in PPE, inside of an easily-cleaned recyclable vessel, or that they were worried because they didn't know specifically how they'd be handling their product when it came.

I might not be worth billions of dollars, but I'll have healthy, happy and experienced employees used to working in high pressure situations, in an (apparently?) disaster-proof industry. Now I can just pay people to make my money for me.

Adapt. Turn this shit right around. Take your beatings and get right back up. Restaurant closed? Deliver. Find that niche. Fix that logistical and supply chain issue that makes 10 sick people touch your products. Invent machines that have easily interchangeable parts, or near-instant specialty 3D printed parts that turn a bobblehead factory into a respiratory mask and faceshield factory. Use your new experience to consult businesses and governments on disaster preparedness. Find out the part of America who needs you right now. They will reward you mightily.

A local business just offered a bunch of food and hygiene products wicked cheap. They're clearing their shelves to completely change their business, so sure why not? I'll be including it free for my customers who know they will be taken care of with an enriching experience when they buy from us.

I'll be supplying people with free rare goods by healthy people during a pandemic.

a) not getting any raises or additional compensation for working through the pandemic, and

Yes an extra few hundred or any number of dollars will mathematically impact the level of incentive to return to work. And we can argue all day on the moral points of minimum wage labor and exploitation. 

However the fact remains industries like bars and restaurants have massive average turn over normally. So you add average turn over + accute covid turn over + no net employee add, and without even factoring in how negatively new potential employees may view the industry post covid, you have a massive unprecedented level of labor squeeze in the industry.

Thing is I live in RI, a liberal subsidized state and they kicked me off at year end, said it should take 2 weeks max to file new claim.

4 weeks later they hadn't processed my claim, any number to call, no hold, just hangs up on you saying it's too busy. No response to emails.

So I go get another shittier job that pays way less then I'm making on unemployment have to do 27k steps a day. Now, my old boss at community college is hitting me up, saying I'll get my job back sometime in between now and September.

Thing is, this shortsighted ghosting from UE trying to stimulate the economy (or maybe it's just a contract with real estate corps and banks trying to foreclose houses who knows) is gonna bite the economy in the butt. 

Because my boss at my shitty job is having a really hard time hiring people with the low pay and the crazy hours (I work nights and weekends) so I'm going to just quit this job, as soon as I get my old one back or sooner, seeing as it's also giving me poison ivy that is rapidly spreading everywhere including my face.

So unemployment ghosts people pre maturely, forcing them to take worse jobs, and then when they get their old jobs back, WHICH HASNT HAPPENED YET, many new businesses are going to be CRUSHED by labor shortages from people quitting to return to their old, better jobs!

I'm doing AV, but all the areas are understaffed. The head of security is quitting because he's doing 90 hour weeks only getting paid 40 for salary, the food and janitor people are severely understaffed. And pretty soon all the new hires like me will bounce.

And if you look at the Rhode Island unemployment reviews my experience is not unique. They get one star, everyone's going through the same thing.

People aren't taking the shitty jobs cuz they suck. Every single person that I worked with at my college job have re applied and we are all going to be rehired. I really could just quit this job today but I'm sticking through because I like my boss and I feel bad, but I have enough money to make it until September which is the latest I'll get rehired. Most people wouldn't walk 27k steps nights and weekends getting poison ivy all over there bodies just because they feel bad for their boss. Idk if that makes me a sucker or what.

A few percent may not make much of a difference, but for trillions of dollars economies, that’s a difference of tens, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.

The United States, with the ability of its population to move from where the were born to where they work has always enabled it to be able to optimize its human capital.   Europe, seeing this, established the European Union, with its single currency and just as importantly, the ability of people to move to where the jobs are.   This  is impossible in India due to its caste system, which as Britannica notes, ""has been a dominating aspect of social organization for thousands of years.""   Social mobility is essential for a nation to achieve optimal efficiency, and productivity.    Until India moves away from this caste system, they simply cannot compete.   Of course many other nations have faced discrimination that retarded their growth, the U.S. had its slavery, and afterward racial discrimination, Europe had its many wars between what are now peaceful members.   Neither the US or the EU are perfect by any means.   But India seems to be a case study of a society, unfortunately, too firmly rooted in the past.   Until there is a real and effective effort to eliminate the caste system, India will never reach its potential, and always lag behind the developed nations.  Some will argue that part of India's problem is the tremendous theft of its resources by the British during the time they controlled India.   That is true, but then China was kept in a backward state by Maoists, and they have been able to change.

The rule of law is a joke.

You can legally buy a property, hold the deed and half a dozen guys will show up with some vague claim to the land. Hashing it out in court will probably take a decade because it is impossibility backed up. So you pay them off but more will show up later.

You will pay a bribe for everything. Want your electric hooked up? Bribe.

Their politics is beyond dumb but so is us. They had a woman get elected to parliament who was a convicted murderer on name I'd. Modi is basically Indian Trump.

Infrastructure is terrible with the power blinking on and off regularly. Traffic is insane. Rent is high. Public transit is shockingly inadequate for such a high pop density country.

Some of the cultural ticks that make Indian white collar workers less efficient than other cultures include:

If they are given a task and don't know how to do it they just won't do it instead of telling you they need help or more instructions. 

Building on that subordinates will never tell a manager when things aren't going well. Building can be on fire and it's all 'everything's going great boss!'

Sexual harassment of female employees is in its Mad Men Era right now. I had so many incidents with managers doing things like cornering women in stairwells to grope them.

Both countries practiced what the USA, the EU, and China practiced: neoliberalism, but neither of them could become as developed as the three entities mentioned above. In fact, for similar reasons. Corruption and looting of state assets and government institutions by politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate leaders began to run rampant in both India and Mexico as their economies grew and developed, and as many have stated, India has focused on specific developments without focusing on the underlying infrastructure that makes the whole thing work. Mexico has the same problem, as they make shiny hospitals and highways every now and then, but even the largest cities (like CDMX) have really shitty infrastructure and you see tens of thousands of poor people living and starving on the streets of the supposed “developed” megalopolises. I know a scarce amount of the economic history of India, but in Mexico, when neoliberal policies were implemented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by PRI officials, it enabled temporary economic growth but became largely stagnate since the privatized state assets largely came under the ownerships of corporations that had close ties to government officials (i.e, corruption, not unlike what happened in Russia during the privatization efforts after the fall of the USSR) and they established monopolies and that’s why the only other “companies” are small shops that are mainly for localized areas. A few big names and companies became rich and powerful, but the rest were left largely the same or even more poor, which is why in Mexico you have people like Carlos Slim living near people who barely have enough money to buy bread.

1.India is least corrupt big economy. 
USA is the most corrupt big economy. 

2.Brain drain is less than 1% of indian talents so its also a non issue. 

3.Protectionism is what made China develop so fast indeed we need more of it to develop fast. 


All three points u mentioned had no base. 
You lack even basic knowledge about economy. 


The reasons behind Indias slow growth compared to china:-
1. China is an autocracy they dont need to aquire land neither they have these NGO's stopping the progress example:- just look at bullet train project in india due to lack of state government help for land acquisition and NGOs and godrej literally halted mumbai metro for over a decade such thing would never happen in china or have u ever heard of such thing in china research theres no such incident in china bcz its autocracy no one can go againsts the government not even provinces people or companies. 


2. Too defensive loan and investment strategies. China took huge debts India isn't doing so China's bullet train project was over $1Trillion dollar debt project such thing can never happen in india people would burn the nation down. 


3. China exploited alot in geopolitics took grasp of resource full small countries with debt trap like in south america china took grab of lithium mines. 
India would never do that bcz of high morale. 


4. China always copied technologies and put no regard to patterns they steal every successful pattern. They literally developed their industeies by stealing technologies from other nations.


China's bullet train is stolen from japans pattents and RND. They buikt over a stolen technology. 


Chinas smartphone industry developed from stealing iphone and samsung design patterns and pattents. 

BYD came from stealing tesla tech designs. 

Even their space program fighter jets are part to part copy of american fighter jets and space behicals. 

5. China was less than half the size (demographically) compared to India and theres was little competition back then today things are just different. 
And its simple economics bigger the economy harder it is to grow. 

India at more than twice the size of 3decades ago china. 
Will really be slow moving elephant compared to relatively smalled cheettah china was. 

China developed so fast because it exploited every single exploitable illegal and immoral practice. 

Foxconn works with no regard to human life. 
China owned lithium and cobalt mines are literl child exploitation counderies India could never do that. 

You see china is built on hardwork of other nations companies and people every single big technologies they have are built on stolen pattents.",engineergamer0,t2_dbm6i3ye,1,0

The problem was cash related.  Most of our customers were on long term pricing.  We could do price increases pinned to the steel prices but those took months to pass through.  In normal times steel prices fluctuated but not at the same speed as they did this time.  Also, many customers auto denied invoices because tariffs caused the invoices not to align with PO’s.  Demand also dropped fairly quickly so much of our fixed cost wasn’t being absorbed.

Delays in payments caused us to miss payments to our suppliers.  They started holding back shipments until invoices were paid.  This caused production and freight issues.

*A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts.*

*Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter, noted that not everything in the January report was consistent with gangbuster job growth. She pointed out, for example, that Americans worked an average of 34.1 hours a week last month, the lowest such figure since 2010 excluding the COVID-19 recession.*

*The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them — and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation.*

&nbsp;

Julia Pollak was also cited in [USA Today’s analysis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/25/part-time-jobs-hit-record-high/72331112007/) of 22 million Americans in part-time work:

*Also, about 70% of working men and women over 65 are in part-time jobs, ZipRecruiter says. Because the population of baby boomers in that age group is so large, it’s pushing up the number of Americans working part time, says ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak.*",marketrent,t2_fj9vsvfd,28,0

>Many of the gender wage gap arguments on reddit boil down to one side asserting that the 77 cents to the dollar wage gap is pure discrimination and the other asserting that other things like education, hours worked, etc. have to be controlled for as they cause earnings to be higher. They are arguing that the 77 cents on a dollar claim isn’t looking at all relevant variables, and that the gender wage gap mostly disappears when you control for these relevant variables.  
>  
>Both of these two views paint too simplistic a picture. It's true that the raw gap is roughly 77 cents to the dollar. It's also true that the gap shrinks significantly when controlling for hours worked, education, etc. **What we don't know is which way the causation goes. Do women earn less because they choose lower earning majors and shorter work hours, or does the existence of discrimination cause women to alter their choices of majors and alter their working hours? Education, working hours and other 'controls' are not necessarily appropriate controls, as they could also be dependent variables which are outcomes of discrimination.** For further discussion of this point, see the [/r/economics](https://www.reddit.com/r/economics) [Bureau Member Chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/5myux7/bureau_members_discuss_the_gender_wage_gap/).",lalze123,t2_6epggyd,115,0

The authors of the paper chose (purposely) an unionized setting where workers should be identical (tasks are similar and pay is dictated by tenure).  They find that wages are different, and this is entirely due to workplace choices.  They conclude ""some policies that increase workplace flexibility, like shift swapping and expanded cover lists, can reduce the gender earnings gap and disproportionately increase the well-being of female workers.""

Nowhere in this paper do the authors suggest that the overall gender wage gap across all jobs & industries can be completely explained by workplace choices, because of the lack of external validity of this study.  That's not to say it's bad, on the contrary, the authors purposely and cleverly chose the union setting because it removes any element of discrimination so they can attribute their results solely to workplace choices.

Women face tremendous social pressure to be the primary caretakers of children. It is changing but not as much or as quickly as you think. It is not a choice made in a vacuum free of social and cultural forces that change in the face of tremendous inertia. 

The existence of a wage gap makes it economically rational for women rather than men to leave the workforce or take reduced work duties. Systemic bias is self-reinforcing in this way.

You want a well paying low skill job? There you go.

If I was underemployed right now I'd be looking into trucking without a doubt. A long haul trucker can get close to six figures or even exceed it depending on how much they want to work and so long as you don't have a DUI or some terrible driver abstract, you will get hired.

No young people want to get into it because they think truckers will be a thing of the past in a ""no time"" but that is just not true. There will be plenty of trucking jobs in the 2030s still, plenty of runway left.

Edit: Alright adding this because Im over responding to everyone saying something along the lines of ""Yeah but its actually a terrible lifestyle"" or whatever variation of that. Yes, it is a hard life, thats why its a viable way for someone with no education, skills or career path to literally turn their life around financially in a few weeks time with no investment besides time. If you want a cushy job thats easy and fills your wallet, well shit, build a time machine, go back to your teenage years and early 20s and fix whatever mistake or shitty hand you were dealt to put you into the position you are in now and youre set. If thats not an option and you dont want to wait until capitalism magically starts paying you great money for serving or cleaning after people this is a real way out.

First, $32 billion isn't even that much.

Second, it slowed down the system responsible for climate change.

Third, it helped bring home *some* manufacturing, but more importantly it helped show us all how dangerous it is to put all our manufacturing eggs in the China basket.

Fourth, it was one of many factors leading to China showing us their teeth and claws which has helped people to learn just how dangerous China is to us militarily and what their global military ambitions really are.

Fifth, it has helped spur home chip fabrication, an extremely important and often overlooked national security issue.  We *must not* rely on China to produce the microchips that go into our tanks, ships, missiles, communications devices, electric grid, weapons, etc. --- lest we open ourselves up to trojan electronics embedded in our nation's critical infrastructure and military.  We must have access to a secure foundry within our borders, ideally at least one that can produce rad-hardened and analog chips (these chips require older processes, like 45nm/90nm.)

Sixth, it has helped put a temporary cap on China's GDP and given them a few domestic problems to concentrate on which in turn has forced them to take at least some attention away from their military ambitions in Taiwan (and possibly elsewhere.)

Seems more like 99 than 08. Many stupid, over-valued stocks that got steroid injected by virtual gambling coins (literally, in crypto's case). Not sure how the hell Netflix got to a $300B valuation (larger than Disney at some point), but it happened. All the SPACs and start-ups that flew up. The WSB mania. None of these were sustainable in any way. I'm sure it'll have an effect on the real estate and overall job markets, but a lot of rich people got more rich, and a lot of big gamblers got poor. But at its core, real estate and jobs aren't going to crash just based on the trend line of ""what goes up must come down"" - banking and real estate really crashed in 2008 for a very particular reason.

Unless the same thing is happening in the shadows (which it might be, I don't know), then it won't happen the same way. My hunch from the beginning of the pandemic to now was that big corporations saw that a lot of business models are gonna fly through some epic turbulence due to a global pandemic, and they decided to put a ton of eggs in real estate, knowing that in the short and long run, people need places to live, and collecting rent (or flipping homes) is a hell of a business. Of course it ended up running way higher than anyone imagined and probably recedes, but in many ways it also just finally caught up (well, outpaced) median rent. But for a long time, owning was a cheaper monthly cost than renting, which actually made no sense at all.

(Commercial real estate is a different story...)

Pets Dot com and Peloton are more similar stories than the housing bubble comparisons (not as companies, but the rise and fall). Peloton's market cap was $38B at one point. Today it is around $3.6B. That is a 90% loss in 1 year. It was a good idea to catch the subscription boom, with a quick money injection, but doesn't mean much if the core business plan is not executed well or profitable in the long-run. So for all the doom's day recession fears, it'd be nice to be reminded how preposterous Wall St. was from Q3 2020 to Q4 2021. Yeah - I would imagine there are (and will be) a lot of layoffs from companies that were operating at a loss or not creating any tangible, essential products, yet running 12-figure valuations.

This is unlikely to be heavily divorce/custody related as it only refers to women and men living alone (not with children).  Although some divorces are childfree I suspect that is a smaller percentage of the difference here, if any.

Regarding older men and women - this is likely to be a significant factor.  [This study](https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/aging%20and%20Disability%20In%20America/2020Profileolderamericans.final_.pdf) on older Americans (which is a real study unlike the linked article) suggests that ""About 27% (14.7 million) of all older adults living in the community in 2020 lived alone (5 million men, 9.7 million women)."" This is a gap of 4.7 million women.  That said, not all of them will own their own homes.  Later in the article we have ""Of the 14.1 million households headed by persons age 75 and older in 2019, 77% (10.8 million) owned their homes and 23% (3.3 million) rented.""  While we don't know if this would apply to those under 75, or whether the split of renters is the same among men and women, if we assume those percentages hold, that means 3.85 million older men live alone and own their homes, and 7.47 million women do, for a gap of about 3.62 million women.

Obviously there are a lot of assumptions but that gap is not that far off from the 2.71 million women in the article.  So it's reasonable to suspect that a majority of the gap (or even an excess amount of it) is due to older women living alone.  Older meaning over 65.",corinini,t2_bbwf3,80,0

Let me start off by saying this is all hypothetical and beer talk, so take with grain of salt. But traditionally men bought homes to start a family with a wife and kids. We know with statistical facts that men are single more than ever and less likely to marry compared to previous years (decline in marriage rates) 

With that said, if men are marrying less, they don’t have a *strong* reason to buy a home. Personally I rather just rent a studio by myself and have the freedom to relocate and move around when I feel like it. Only when I’m settled down would I consider buying a permanent home. Until then, since I’m still single and childless, why buy a house? I’ll be stuck in that location unable to up and leave as I please. 

Also men are more likely to relocate for work, so by renting an apartment I can just move states whenever. Until I get married I have no reason to buy a house. 

Im not saying this is the reason men aren’t buying homes, I think for some men, myself included, it is a reason. 

The title even says women who “live” alone are more likely to buy homes. Yeah if I’m living alone, I don’t need a house, just give me a living room with a bathroom and kitchen, I’m good. I just need a mattress, and a computer desk. Men live very minimal, you seen the memes and pics of single men living space.

My feeling is that single childless men tend to live and crave extremely simple lifestyles and tend to be unambitious/value free time.

Kids used to be labor for the family. They were a net-positive economic contribution to the parents income statement, starting at an early age and increasing with the years. Then we started moving to the cities and changed the rules - and the economics.

Now, and with the best intentions, we use urban-centric regulations that restrict the work children are allowed to do, we price them out of the labor market with artificial wage controls and we monopolize the vast majority of their time for the decades between 5 and ~~15~~ 25.

Further down the line, in a modern tragedy of the commons, we have shifted responsibility for care of seniors from the family to the larger collective, further diminishing the value to the family of having children.

Thus, children are no longer the future in the urbanized West. With children representing an increasing economic drag on their parents it's no wonder that so many young adults are making the entirely rational decision to forego the expense of having them. Instead, children have become  expensive entertainment and socio-economic status symbols and that ain't enough incentive to perpetuate the species.

This guy gets into the weeds with the historical trend and economics:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwIeDuHwXJY

Economics - People can barely afford to live, how are they supposed to start a family? The average age of first time home ownership has gone from mid-20s to ~46! If women want to have a traditional family and be provided for, then they're going to have to do so with men MUCH older as the guys their age are struggling economically more now than ever. And the data bears this out. Bumble is calling 2024 the year of the (large) age gap relationship.

Education and getting their bag - Many modern women have been mistakenly convinced to focus on getting their degree and starting a career before having their family. This frequently causes the hypergamy success paradox where the higher up the socioeconomic ladder women climb, the fewer suitable men there are to date (up to), and is a major component why half of childless women are NOT childless by choice as they ""stayed in the casino too long"". 

In the end a ton of women squander their fertility window for 10-15 years of fun, education, and career, and it's not until the wall approaches as their fertility begins to wane they decide to settle down and pencil in a husband and kids. Often to find the men they want are already married or otherwise unavailable. 

This is why my advice for women who know early on they want to have a family, to do so young when they're 18-23 in your physical prime. You'll never have a better opportunity to attract a man and your body will bounce back after birth far easier in your prime. After you have the kids and they're off to school, THEN go get that degree and start a career. You'll be much more attractive to employers when they know you're not going to disappear on them to *start* a family as you're already established.",rpujoe,t2_ung2sof2,1,0

A naive and short-term optimization for profit is not equivalent to ""ideal optimization"" regardless of how core that assumption is to mainstream economics. It encourages deprioritizing long term gain and protective strategies to achieve consecutive short term advantage on a per-quarter basis; the least resilient outcompete the more resilient over each consecutive short term period until that resilience is tested - by disruptions, such as a pandemic - at which point the disadvantage of resiliency in non-disrupted environments ensures an insufficient level of market share/economic activity remains with resilient actors to prevent the disruption from collapsing the entire system (absent outside assistance to the non-resilient, further encouraging the dismantling of resiliency strategies and making future disruption more and more dangerous).

4045,igl2y69,t3_w13ljl,2022-07-18,Economics,"Biggest problems with the global economy as I see them:

* Lack of affordable housing in North America. This disincentivizes immigration and strangles the economic potential of the most prosperous continent of the last century. As this market is so huge and real estate is such a large part of this market, this in turn acts as a brake on the potential of the top end of the global economy. A brake which when tapped in 2007 caused the Euro to all but fail and the global financial markets to collapse.
* Lack of regulation of financial markets, especially where they straddle borders. Money moves faster than regulation, and in recent years it has evacuated increasingly via loopholes & tax havens into the richest individuals. This wealth inequality further acts as a brake on the global economy, as the uber-wealthy are rarely willing to invest in the high risk endevours & strategic spending that tends to benefit society the most in the long run (Elon Musk & Bill Gates are notable exceptions to this rule, but even then they can only spend their money so fast and it would likely benefit more people directly if most of that wealth was spent by the government).
* Demographic collapse in East Asia, especially in China & South Korea. Japan has been struggling with this for a while, and the net effect we’ve seen has been a lack of innovation and a slowing of the appearance of novel businesses. Additionally the demographic imbalance tends to be a self-feeding problem if social spending is not geared towards children, as people are forced to pay a premium to have children since so much of the potential socialized wealth is absorbed by white hairs. No country on planet Earth has this priority in order, and the only reason it hasn’t happened in NA or Europe yet is a much more robust dating culture among young adults, no gender-selection among infants, and plentiful immigration from Latin America & Africa (which now appears to be stalling in Europe).
* The steady rise of the global price of wheat. Wheat is the most important calorie crop globally, accounting for most of the international market in calories. As this price rises, the poorer & already cash starved nations in Pan-Arabia & central Africa are going to grow increasingly unstable. These regions are important sources of many natural resources, so instability here will have a very immediate effect on other markets. This is of course not anywhere as important as the human cost, with literally millions of people facing famine in the next 3-5 years at the latest if something does not budge with the global wheat market (Russia has to let Ukraine’s grain ships go).
* The immediate effects of global warming. Rising salinity in water tables, acceleration of the water cycle with longer drought periods, and the expansion of deserts are the most immediate impacts of global warming, and have already had a very real global economic impact.

**Executive Summary**

>In the two years since Opportunity Zones (OZs) were signed into law, OZ investment had reached at least $10 billion—and likely more than that—before the COVID-19 crisis took hold. Despite being viewed primarily as an economic development tool in low-income communities—that is, positioning the local economy on a higher growth trajectory—many proponents have suggested that OZs also have a community development purpose of helping people in poverty to improve their local context and lead healthy, productive lives. We refer to development that blends economic development and community development goals, and that seeks to engage residents and local leaders in decisionmaking about development in their communities, as equitable development. This report examines how actors driven primarily by a community development mission have sought to use OZs to fulfill an equitable development mission.

>Our research process included about 70 in-depth interviews with project sponsors; fund managers; investors; wealth managers; developers; philanthropies; and public and nonprofit agencies working with OZs, such as community development intermediaries, state OZ program offices, and city-level OZ coordinators. We asked interviewees to describe projects that were funded as well as those seeking funding, the terms of investment sought by project sponsors as well as investors, the nature of community engagement that they have observed, and other opportunities and challenges they perceive around using the incentive for equitable development. We found our sample of OZ projects through discussions with national and local OZ experts, the Opportunity Exchange listing of projects, the Economic Innovation Group’s Opportunity Zones Activity Map, scans of news articles, examples highlighted at a number of convenings around the country (including in Atlantic City, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbia, Greenville, Miami, Norfolk, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Washington, DC), and through a snowball sample of additional informants we became aware of. 

>We find that OZs are helping spur the evolution of a new community development ecosystem, engaging both project developers and investors who have limited historical engagement in community development work. Despite this catalytic effect, however, we also see that many mission-oriented actors are struggling to access capital. Many project sponsors are struggling to access the class of investors—wealthy individuals and corporations with capital gains—for whom the OZ incentives are tailored. Additionally, many mission-oriented projects yield below-market returns that most OZ investors appear unwilling to accept. As OZ incentives are not structured to encourage resident or community engagement, mission-oriented projects struggle to compete for attention with higherreturn projects—for which OZs provide much larger subsidies because of the design of the incentives.

>A further challenge for mission-oriented projects is that the sponsors are seeking to support a community asset with a lifetime well beyond the 10-year time horizon of the OZ incentives. Given that an illiquid investment over a 10-year horizon is already challenging for OZ investors, the type of investment many mission actors need and the OZ market’s investment parameters are mismatched. Because of these challenges, we mostly saw mission-oriented projects succeed in using OZs when the capital stack also layered in significant other subsidy sources, or when a well-connected project sponsor was able to locate an investor willing to accept significantly below-market returns.

>Although OZs were designed to spur job creation, the vast majority of OZ capital appears to be flowing into real estate, not into operating businesses, because of various program design constraints and the undesirability of selling equity from both the business owners’ and the investors’ perspective. Ultimately, most developers and investors view OZ incentives as providing a relatively small boost to overall returns. The OZ incentives have had mixed effects in terms of making projects work that would not otherwise happen. Some developers reported that the incentives did make a decisive difference in allowing a project to go forward, while others were clear that their project would have proceeded with or without OZ equity. Most observers appear to agree that a primary benefit of the program is that it elevates the visibility of neighborhoods and deals that investors might not have considered otherwise.

>Taken together, these results raise a question for policymakers to reflect on the goals of OZs. To the extent that the OZ incentives were intended to foster equitable development outcomes—such as by creating quality jobs, affordable housing, community-oriented amenities like grocery stores, and improved quality of life for low-income people—our evidence suggests they need to be redesigned to more effectively allocate government dollars to help project sponsors achieve those outcomes. As they redesign OZ incentives, policymakers should use four broad principles to guide the process:

> * **Better support investment in small businesses.** The most egregious failing of OZs to date is that very little OZ investment is going to small businesses, the exact group of investees that proponents had held out as standing the most to benefit. To correct this failing, one important solution is incentivizing investments in QOFs that could provide subordinated debt investment, or hybrid debt/equity products such as royalty debt, to small businesses. Beyond that, policymakers should consider granting greater flexibility around certain program rules, such as deployment rules, to mission-driven funds that specialize in small business investing.

> * **Size the incentive based on the impact.** Rather than providing the largest incentives to the most profitable projects regardless of their social impact, the incentive should instead depend on project impacts. In turn, by targeting incentives toward investments with the greatest impacts, these investments could be more deeply subsidized while more efficiently using total federal tax expenditures. To provide one example, OZ tax incentives could be based on the number of quality jobs created by the OZ investment. Other alternatives could include tweaking the incentives based on the equitable development characteristics present in a project, or limiting the incentives only to those types of projects where a positive social impact is deemed likely.

> * **Broaden who can invest.** Because only a limited number of (mostly wealthy) taxpayers have capital gains, limiting OZ incentives to capital gains holders freezes out most stakeholders in low-income communities from investing in their own revitalization. A refundable tax credit, rather than a capital gains exclusion, could open up opportunities for these investors. Moreover, other actors such as foundation endowments and pension funds, have substantial resources, and most likely a greater proclivity to consider community investing than many capital gains holders, if an incentive can be structured to engage them. 

> * **Support mission-driven funds that are accountable to the community.** A redesigned OZ incentive should encourage equity investments in groups such as community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which have a long track record of making substantial investments in low-income communities, taking on higher risks than conventional investors, and working with the kind of investees who have been struggling to access OZ capital, such as small businesses and less sophisticated developers.

> Protests in the wake of George Floyd’s killing underscore, among other things, the realities that opportunity is not spread evenly in our nation, especially by race. The COVID-19 health crisis, and the economic recession it is causing, add significantly to the list of challenges for practitioners looking to use the OZ incentive. Investment in operating small businesses are facing particular strain, but consequences will radiate to the financial sustainability of real estate, both commercial—which relies on rents from shuttered businesses—and housing—which relies on rents from residents who may have lost jobs or face a cutback in hours. At the same time, the crisis may provide an opportunity to rethink and redesign the OZ incentive so it can play a stronger role in helping hard-hit communities recover.",GaySkull,t2_a9j08,72,0

The way these credits are structured are fairly simple once you work on them for a bit but take some following-the-breadcrumbs. On the surface, it seems like a good idea: real estate developers make a profit, banks earn a nice tax credit for their investment risk (plus they satisfy CRA requirements by investing in the communities they operate in and earn a very modest ROI; the ROI is negligible compared to what other activities banks could invest in to earn a higher ROI, but it’s still better than sitting on cash by a slight hair) and the communities win because they receive an injection of cash that they would not ever receive otherwise. 

I am not however an economist but we have begun hearing that these credits may not be as good for the communities as they are for the banks and the real estate developers. Not just for the Opportunity Zones tax credit, but NMTC and LIHTC as well.

These credits are very much so an example of the argument for trickle down economics being very weak. Trickle down economics might as well be trickle down tiny crumbs economics. 

To this, I say: first, economic development is hard. We don’t exactly know how to target these communities with economic investments without attaching huge incentives for the banks and developers. Second, what else can we even try? Seriously. These credits are EXTREMELY popular in both parties and we may have them for a while. Most say they should even be increased.

>The core of the American labor force is back.

>Americans between 25 and 54 years of age are either employed or looking for jobs at rates not seen in two decades, a trend helping to counter the exodus of older baby boomers from the workforce.

>In the first months of the pandemic, nearly four million prime-age workers left the labor market, pushing participation in early 2020 to the lowest level since 1983—before women had become as much of a force in the workplace. Prime-age workers now exceed prepandemic levels by almost 2.2 million.

In my modest of opinions, I think it's the latter. as the turn corelates with the start of the new year, an the last stimulus check (assuming this chart only reflects the US job market - as its not specified to be global) was march 2021 which could have given folks the last push through 2021 not needing a job.

A lot of people who are valuable to these businesses have newly found leverage and it makes it uncomfortable for management to plan around. It’s like an organically formed and organized labor union. And employers are fighting back in a very carefully planned way.

Some employers are pretending that employees “can’t wait to see each other in person again” (Apple). Another example is that a number internal surveys at tech companies have found that tech workers want a 3 work from home days yet employers are lying and clawing back that 3rd day for the “hybrid” model while pretending that it’s what their surveys concluded (n>10,000 on these surveys FYI). Nope, it isn’t true, people want to spend less than 50% of their week in an office, and obviously businesses prefer the opposite situation because giving employees what they want more than half of the time is a bad place to start negotiating from. It’s a misinformation campaign at this point and companies are more or less treating this WFH situation the same as a union busting exercise. 

I’m excited about this, I think a form of hybrid or fully remote will win out in the end but there will be some amount of turbulence and some people will have to be dragged kicking and screaming. It just isn’t clear to me who or which side will win at this point.",obnauticus,t2_3bty7,127,0

Like Godot, I keep waiting for it.  And then some people tell me it's already here.  Buuuut, there's no way in hell +263k jobs is a recession.  That's actually quite a good number.

I... don't understand how we can reconcile this data with anecdata about how bad everything is, how people can't afford food, etc..

E.g.: on the one hand I'm told that 40% of Americans  can't pay for a $400 emergency.  But on the other hand, consumers are spending a TON of money on travel and leisure, on Christmas presents, etc... I mean WTF?  Are we getting killed by inflation or are we not?  Despite all the complaints about inflation, it seems the economy is stronger than ever by the numbers.  8% inflation seems not to be affecting it.

The ONE thing I'm seeing different is slowdown in home sales.  Houses in my area used to sell in like 3 days.  Now, I'm seeing more and more sit on the market for a more ""normal"" 3-7 weeks, and they often have to slash their list price by 10-25% to move it.  Still, 20% off the 2022 highs is still a hell of a lot more money than anything pre-Covid (in my area housing values rose about 90% from 2019 values).

Otherwise it seems like people are spending money like drunken sailors.  In particular, I'm fascinated by the travel & leisure spending.  I live in a touristy place, and AirBnBs are making **bank**.

On this very website you will have people swearing up and down that 200k a year is basically destitution.

However there is in fact a big difference in salaries between Italy and the US. 
Average US salaries are 74k+, median is about 40k+, in Italy the average is 30k while the median is closer to 20k. 
However it's crucial to remember that there are significant differences in the cost of living, so its not quite as big of a difference as you may think.
The purchasing power parity convesrion factor for italy is 65%, so prices as a whole are about 1/3 lower. 

Why is this the case?
The simple answer is that the United states is a richer country, so its citizens earn more. 
Even accounting for PPP, the US is significantly richer than Italy in terms of GDP per capita (70k vs 50k)
So, basically the same reason poles earn less than italians.

We have established that the difference in income is not as large as suggested by nominal figures. When PPP figures are used the difference in income between the US and Italy is smaller.

Now, lots of people are posting their own personal budgets into this thread. As a mod - *I'm not interested in this* - and I probably won't show your comments! We have PPP adjustment which is an aggregate statistical method that incorporates all these differences in cost-of-living. We don't need anecdotes which will be less representative than PPP is.

However, it is worth mentioning that MachineTeaching used as a comparison the household type ""Single person at 100% of average earnings, without a child"". If you select one of the other entries in the OECDs drop-down menu then you'll see more information (for example two-earner and one-earner married couples).

4533,kjb83li,t3_19e6x5m,2024-01-24,AskEconomics,"This is from Forbes with government numbers, “Average annual salary nationwide: $59,428.”

That’s for individuals, but household income in 2022 was about 75,000. So that’s not a ton more. 
Household could include 1 or two working adults, basically whoever lives at that address. 

There are many ways to tackle your questions. First, minimum wage statistically doesn’t have much to do with it. Many countries have literally no legal minimum wage and still have quite high incomes like Denmark. 


Many factors go into how rich a countries citizens are. The main way to set the stage is it all has to do with productivity. Simply in economics, wages and salaries have to do with the productivity of each person. 

For example, if an employee only creates $30,000 for your business each year, you could not pay him $40,000. Otherwise, you’d be a charity. 

Then the question is, how to make people in your country more productive? 

This could be human capital (education, university, trade skills etc…). It could be capital such as money and machinery/equipment that is used to be productive. 

A  trained construction worker with a digging tractor is much more productive than even 3 people with a shovel for example. 

Certain industries are critically important like having an effective financial industry, which essentially just moves capital where it’s most needed or hopefully best deployed. 

In economics, we have a somewhat controversial but general framework for helping make a poor suffering economy, richer. It’s called the Washington consensus, I’ll copy its proposals from Wiki below. 

Not that this set of proposals is perfect (it’s not). 
Not that successful countries do all these things effectively, but I think it still stands as a good roadmap. 
Basically these policies create the atmosphere where productivity has a chance to grow. 

You’ll notice many of these are hallmarks of economic success: trade liberalization, privatization of state enterprises is huge, deregulation etc… 

“The consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:[1][3]

Fiscal policy discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP

Redirection of public spending from subsidies (""especially indiscriminate subsidies"") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and infrastructure investment

Tax reform, broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates

Interest rates that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms

Competitive exchange rates

Trade liberalization: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs;
Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment;

Privatization of state enterprises

Deregulation: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of financial institutions

4538,k6pebvw,t3_17gjzw2,2023-10-27,AskEconomics,"Some advice for people commenting in this thread:

* I do not want to know your anecdote.

So, you have a story about your own job search, or your own employer. I don't want to know. Individual experiences are very different. That's why we have overall statistics. I have deleted more than 20 anecdotes already.

* Remember Rule II.

If you want to make some long-and-complicated claim then you must provide a cite for it.

* Multiple jobs are irrelevant.

Lots of people claim that employment is high because lots of people are working multiple jobs. This is not true. The BLS do not double-count. If you work two jobs you are counted as one worker.

* Are the statistics faked?

If you want to claim that the stats are faked then you must follow rule II and give evidence!",RobThorpe,t2_gj75p,1,0
4539,k6h77db,t3_17gjzw2,2023-10-26,AskEconomics,"i think it's mostly that the US is really big and the people who tend to post tend to be the unluckiest (news in general just tends to be negative). The US labor force is like ~167 million people, so even with a <4% unemployment rate -- which is around the historical low -- the number of people actively looking for work who can't find it will be in the millions.

If you drill down to people unemployed for more than 27 weeks that's still going to be around 1.1 million people, even though as a percentage they're pretty small.

4542,k6wm33p,t3_17gjzw2,2023-10-29,AskEconomics,"Reddit is dominated by younger people. According to the second source I was able to find on Google the modal user is a male between the age of 18 and 29. More Redditors have college degrees than have high school diplomas but only by a small margin (46 pc with college degrees; 40 pc with high school diplomas). [https://medium.com/@sm\_app\_intel/the-user-demographics-of-reddit-the-official-app-7e2e18b1e0e1](https://medium.com/@sm_app_intel/the-user-demographics-of-reddit-the-official-app-7e2e18b1e0e1).

The BLS' *Employment situation* for September 2023 – [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) – says:

* men between the ages of 20 and 24 have an unemployment rate of 8.4 per cent (for comparison for men 25 years and older that is 3.3 pc and for women aged 20–24 that is 5.7 pc);
* within persons above the age of 25, high school graduates have seasonally adjusted unemployment at 4.1 pc while for college graduates this is 2.1 pc.

If one were to combine those two statistics, I would expect they wouldn't be uniformly distributed either. It's likely that the demographic of men between the ages of 20 and 24 with high school diplomas has an unemployment rate in excess of 8.4 per cent. The median person who is unemployed has been unemployed for about 9 weeks.",ifly6,t2_bliq7,6,0

“For example, durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and education and health services have a labor shortage—these industries have more unfilled job openings than unemployed workers with experience in their respective industry. Even if every unemployed person with experience in the durable goods manufacturing industry were employed, the industry would fill only around 75% of the vacant jobs.”",Excellent-Source-348,t2_dpka4yka,2,0

A couple of things to keep in mind:

1) The US is large and moving from an area of low unemployment to high unemployment to find a job with a certain skillset can be difficult if not impossible if you're living paycheck to paycheck.  

2) Not all job skill translate *or* many employers *feel* not all skills translate across professions or industries.  Employers need someone who can come in and start being productive immediately, not 6 months down the road. 

3) It depends on what jobs are in demand and have low occupancy rate.  A factory worker that's out of work can't immediately start working in an IT job at a computer help desk as they don't have the skills to effectively communicate with customers on a phone, navigate potential issues in the operating system or troubleshoot issues without having the exact steps needed to follow.  Even then, the employee would be much less productive than their peers until months down the road with some experience.   

&#x200B;

That's just a few reasons I can think of.  It's not great, but unfortunately there's not a collective  force between states to work together to allow areas with high unemployment with certain skill sets to influence businesses to expand there or re-locate where the labor is.  As well even cities and the state governments have issues as each city is trying to act solely in their own interest to expand and get more jobs regardless of the amount of available labor they have.",KC_experience,t2_iir2q,2,0

4558,fyhetp2,t3_ht5mme,2020-07-18,AskEconomics,"For the investing industry, there is actually a fair amount of competition. The average hedge fund [only lasts for five years](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/07/31/1913792/most-hedge-funds-fail/), while [the average mutual fund fares marginally better at 8.6.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/can-mutual-fund-get-better-age/) The comparison of compensation scheme to structural engineers is rather unfair: a construction company is done once the building is complete, while a hedge fund continues to actively manage your money the entire time you keep it with them, so charging a percentage of the total assets every year is much more warranted. However, you're right that the infamous 2 and 20 is exorbitant. The good news is that competition is working! [Fees are declining, with only 30% insisting on the traditional 2 and 20.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/only-a-third-of-hedge-funds-charge-2-and-20-fees-says-expert-1541851200) More generally, thanks to competition from low cost index funds, [money is drastically flowing away from actively managed funds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/outflows-inflows-active-passive-stock-funds-51571439212), and some of their largest clients like the [California pension system](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pensions-calpers-hedgefunds/calpers-dumps-hedge-funds-citing-cost-to-pull-4-billion-stake-idUSKBN0HA2D120140916) have sworn off hedge funds. It took a while, but over time, the sheen of active management and their (usually unfulfilled) promises of outperforming the market has worn off, and they're being competed away by lower cost alternatives.

As for investment banking, the relevant competitive angle is relationships with the CFOs and CEOs at potential client companies. Large firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley provide enough continuity that new entrants into the investment banking industry can develop those relationships as they rise up the ranks, so that by the time they become managing directors they are already chummy with their decision making counterparts. And indeed, most of a managing director's time is spent not doing market research or detailed quantitative analysis but instead [cultivating their relationships with clients](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-career-path/) so that when a CFO is contemplating a capital raise or M&A transaction, the name they know and trust is yours. The idea that competition is based not around price or competence but rather networking may be gauche, but for better or worse it's how the industry works. And because those relationships are very scarce, the people who have them are able to extract large rents.

All that said, there *is* competition in the investment banking industry, and even new entrants! Most new entrants are what's called [""boutique investment banks.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutique_investment_bank) Such banks are usually founded by a former managing director at a large who has decided that he can leverage his relationships without the corporate name to help him; for example, [Qatalyst, one of the most prominent investment banks for the tech industry, was founded by Frank Quattrone, who was a former star managing director at Morgan Stanley's tech investment banking group in Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quattrone). However, you'll still see the established names like Goldman or Morgan on any deals that a boutique bank facilitates. That's because investment banking often requires a large balance sheet to help finance transactions. While a top managing director can take his relationships with him when he starts his boutique firm, he can't take the balance sheet as well. So rather than try to accumulate enough capital to run an entire deal in house, most boutiques will instead partner with the larger and older firms, where the boutique is providing most of the strategic direction and advice but the older firm is making their balance sheet available for a smaller cut of the fees.

**TLDR: Hedge funds actually *are* being competed away. For investment banks, the relevant dimension is their relationships with CFOs and CEOs, which cannot be competed away except by new firms founded by industry veterans.**",say_wot_again,t2_ezakb,112,0

Downside is, since piping goes into the seams, you need to have open seams to put it in, so you’ll need to either make from scratch or heavily modify a preexisting garment.

If you are unable or unwilling to do that, then I would go with gold bias tape or braid, applied on top. Sewing it on would be best, but glue will do if you don’t need this to hold up for more than a few days at a con and aren’t really planning on washing it. 

BE CAREFUL about using gold ribbon. Ribbon is different from bias tape. Bias tape is cut on the bias, which is cut on the diagonal across the grain of the fabric, and gives it more stretch. This matters when you’re trying to get a smooth line around a tight curve, such as down around those pockets.",SnowLeopardCatDragon,t2_3fizvtlc,47,0

I am soo happy how it turned out, and i learned so much that i cant wait to make it better.

All i need to do bow is to move a few things around and fit the belt a little better and i am all done for my first con in 11 days :)

4985,i1m18d7,t3_tjje9h,2022-03-22,cosplayprops,"Nice! Well done for your first cosplay ever!

I want to get into cosplay myself too. For a long time now, I've been wanting to cosplay SCP-049. However I've had a roadblock in my way. See, this is the exact [mask](https://www.thecostumer.com/p-20875-venetian-beak-mask.aspx) used in both his original [photo](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/S76vL) as well as his updated photo by [Yukki.](https://aminoapps.com/c/scp-foundation/page/blog/new-049-pics/jL1g_rYcKug74Bd7olXQjb14V0XlXRk1Ll) International shipping costs $44 when normally, you could just buy it for $7.98.

So, I've been asking around if anyone owns this exact mask. That way, they could 3D scan it, either with a professional 3D scanner, or you can get 3D scanning apps for either Android or IPhone. Once scanned, simply upload the file so then we can 3D print them.

I want accuracy, you see? I'm quite a perfectionist. Once I can get a perfect replica of this mask, I can then finally start working on a cosplay for SCP-049.",PauseNo2418,t2_k6lxpgji,2,0

Good post, one thing that I think merits mentioning is that the adjusted wage gap in part controls for intermediate outcomes. People make their career choices based on expectations, including expectations of experiencing discrimination in certain fields. As such, some of the sources of discrimination are controlled for, leading to a potentially downward biased estimate.",OxfordCommaLoyalist,t2_12z9fo,113,0
5064,ddz9e58,t3_5v0o0i,2017-02-20,badeconomics,">The adjusted one is a problem because even accounting for all factor it's still between 4% and 8%. This gap exists because people (men and women) rate a women who is objectively as good as a man as less competent. We don't see this implicit bias we all have, but it's important to acknowledge that it is here.

Be careful here. 

1. We have feedback effects. The most trivial is that more discrimination => less incentive to enter a field. Theoretically, education will act like an amplifier in a circuit, for discrimination. Controlling for the amplifier is labeling it all as one sided causation which is possible, but very unlikely. There are also effects where getting credentials is used to [fight discrimination](http://www.nber.org/papers/w8985). To be sure, these are hard to estimate and may not be large. 

3. Self selection. Maybe people who get education or whatever trait you adjust for differ in ways from people don't. This can, under certain assumptions, be controlled for. 



3. Omitted variable problems. Technically, these feedback effects are a type of omitted variable problems. There are also more general problems. Maybe we also need to account for differences in ability or work ethic. Those are going to be hard to measure and might not be important.
 
All in All, I think people gravely over estimate what a unadjusted wage gap and an adjusted wage gap tell us, particularly when applied to the population at large.

There are a couple ways around this problem. One is to make a model that will simplify and isolate specific causal mechanism. The other is to make some type of experiment. 

Making a model is what [Claudia Goldin](http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/publications/grand-gender-convergence-its-last-chapter) does in her most famous paper. It also helps she narrows down the population she is looking at signficantly.

The problem with these is there is no guarantee your model is right. You have to assume your model is true AND THEN you can evaluate the data. However, if you get the model right or right enough, you usually have clear policies you can impliment to help. 

2. Is run some type of experiment or find a natural experiment. An example of this is random changing resumes from Jane Smith to John Smith. Another is Claudia Goldin's [blind audition](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/orchestrating_impartiality_the_effect_of_blind_auditions_on_female_musicians.pdf) natural experiment.

A problem with these is there is often less clear of policy to impliment. The resume experiment isolates average effects, but it's marginal effects that matter! Simply put, you want to know what someone's maximum wage offer is, not their average wage offer, to help determine what their opportunities are. The advantage of these, is no\less modelling assumptions are required.

Finally, a major problem in the entire gender wage arguments on reddit is that both sides scream ""YOU NEED TO PROVE MY VIEWPOINT WRONG"". Proponents of unadjusted wage gaps demand to be proven wrong it isn't just overt discrimination. Proponents of adjusted wage gaps demand to proven wrong that it isn't ENTIRELY different preferences. In reality, both sides need to prove **their** viewpoint, not demand the other side disproves it.",mrregmonkey,t2_104u3m,41,0

The trend is clear: men tend to make more than women almost everywhere in the world. To turn your point around, if the wage gap was cultural why is it so ubiquitous across cultures?

I'm not disagreeing with most of your points. Obviously the wage gap has cultural causes. However any wage gap post that doesn't even mention testosterone is not well researched in my opinion. [You can inject traders with hormones and it will alter their optimism and risk preferences](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11206). Men are less risk-adverse than women and there are strong arguments that much of this difference is biological. This doesn't imply wage gaps are ""natural"" per se, but that differences in (risk) preferences are.

Much of the pay gap, the study found, came down to a tendency for women to graduate in less-lucrative academic fields — such as biology and chemistry, which are known to lead to lower post-PhD earnings than comparatively industry-friendly fields, such as engineering and mathematics. But after controlling for differences in academic field, the researchers found that women still lagged men by 11% in first-year earnings. That difference, they say, was explained entirely by the finding that married women with children earned less than men. Married men with children, on the other hand, saw no disadvantage in earnings.

Apparently you and I don't think there is a doubt. How could anyone? Academic research aside, you've lived in a world where it's obvious that women are often not taken as seriously. 

The challenge is parameterizing the model correctly. Most of this research deals with money, and there you go, it's largely worthless. The way men and women experience and enjoy life has some serious differences, and this experience and enjoyment is related to trade-offs we make with regards to money.

I'm not a women, and I've never had a child. From what I've observed though, many women seem to find this to be an existentially rewarding experience. Should women take more time off to rear a child than their typically male partner? If so, is this cultural? Or is this biological? What if their preference is that they enjoy it? Or do they only enjoy it because of a misguided cultural view that they have to? After all, the power of culture to shape preferences can induce humans to do do horrific things. 

Do we know how men and women vary on empirical intelligence distributions? Yes. Do we know these are biological and not cultural? No. Do we have an easy way of telling? No, probably not for 5-10 years when we can start mass sequencing genomes. Could small differences in the 2nd and 3rd moments of the distribution cause massive differences in observed performance in the highest and most successful (and visible) humans? Of course.

Could this be true, but also interact with a discriminatory dynamic? Of course. What if the 2nd moment of STEM skill was such that at the +5 standard deviation, the baseline ability would suggest 80% men 20% women at the top 5 most prestigious universities. Yet, this baseline fosters a masculine culture such that at the margin of the distribution the equilibrium dynamic becomes 85% 15%, as 5% of the women felt discouraged, thus ceding their position to men who rank slightly lower than them on base ability?

What if this also interacts with a biologicalxcultural view on the time a women should want to dedicate to her children? If it is biologicalxcultural, can we decompose it? And if not, how do we decide what is a more optimal culture? 

What if these dynamics exist across a wide range of different biological distributions, in small ways, and interact in incredibly high-dimensional settings. Do we truly think we can tease them out with well specified regressions and experiments on undergrads?

Then again, high degrees of uncertainty don't mean we can't make any inference. It's clear that some women do exit the labor force for love of raising a child. It's clear that some women, for reasons we may not know, prefer jobs that require less stress, hours worked, and focus on healing and children. We know some men prefer higher stress jobs that require more confidence. We can map some of this to what we think are biochemical differences. Some of it to what we observe is explicit sex based discrimination. Some of it to what we think is cultural. 

Of course, when we start making these comparisons, anecdotes, case-studies, historical examples, we leave the world of matrix-based causal inference, and enter into a narrative based system of scientific inference. Narrative systems are most adapt at dealing with high-uncertainty and high-dimensions, above what computers can handle. Yet they also deal with the most lost fidelity, omitted variable bias, and overfitting.

Anyway, your post is a fair response to the argument that the difference is entirely explained. But you seem to dismiss anything that can't be directly measured, only reasoned through abstractly, as not-worth considering or outright wrong, which I think is a mistake, and results in over-confidence in your view.",NatalyaRostova,t2_1663xw,1,0

The wage gap between smokers and non-smokers that the anti-smoking campaign harp on does not show any subservience or double standard. It is just an explainable difference in outcome. The constant quoting of explainable wage ""gaps"" is the true bad economics. It is the CORE of badeconomics. It is no different than me complaining that someone with 10 years experience makes more money than I did as an intern ""doing the same work.""

Business studies in mixed but still mostly male, whilst law is more balanced. This focus is true from entry level to retirement. 

Now you can argue that this is due to ""monopsony"" or similar, but you need to explain why the patriarchy defends chemistry more solidly than anthro, engineering more than medicine. An easier explanation is that gender has work preferences, just as it has highly stereotyped preferences in everything from clothing colours to entertainment. (Billions spent on market research can't be wrong;) )

If gender determines work preferences - and very likely competitiveness within any one work theme - then all you need for earnings to be different is for male preferences to have a higher propensity to add tradeable value than the female ones. Many female dominated professions generate public goods, for example, whereas male preferences - STEM, say - are associated with tradeable value. ",OliverSparrow,t2_48sms,21,0

For instance, at a MegaCorp, women admins are ""administrative assistants"" but often dudes (who are basically admins) are given pseudo-technical entry level positions.

Also, if men are more likely to get promoted to Accounting Manager while women remain Accountant, then only managers get compared to other managers and accountants get compared to other accountants.

>  Well firstly, it’s literally not bourne by the data.

Just plotting wages since 1960 is not particularly convincing here. There's ongoing debate about why wages seem to have stopped rising as fast as productivity starting around 1970 (or if that's even true). One the one hand, flat real wages is clearly a phenomenon to be explained, since real GDP is way up in the past 50 years (women's increasing wages might be explained by e.g. them moving into higher and higher paying roles over time). Male wages would be higher if they had kept increasing at the same rate as they were before 1972--something like 30,000$ higher, based on your graphs. On the other hand, non-wage benefits like health insurance have probably also increased in value, so maybe there *isn't* anything to explain. But these arguments should at least be acknowledged. 

> This plays into and affirms the idea of the male breadwinner. The idea is that we had a simpler equilibria in the 50s, 60s and 70s, whereby men went to work and women largely stayed at home. This also plays into the idea that nowadays both parents need to work just to get by whereas previously it was possible just one person to work and for the family to do fine. This of course ignores two inconvenient facts. The first is that two people now both want to work because they can now afford more things than they could previously. People are no longer happy with what just 1 income can get them. Keeping up with the Jones’ and all that. Also this ignores the fact that when women were working at home was still doing work however it was unpaid labour. And since everything is measured in monetary terms GDP growth that meant that all of the work and all of the frankly really hard work that women were doing at home was not measured in statistics. And so ultimately all that happened when women started to join the workforce on mass is that they were now getting paid to work whereas previously they were not.

There doesn't seem to be a lot of economic content in this paragraph. Maybe women joined the labor force because they wanted to or because of social pressure or because the economy is collapsing under the weight of higher prices and if they didn't their families would all starve. Maybe the ""male breadwinner"" trope is toxic. None of that tells you what the effect on wages will be if women join the labor force. The point about unpaid labor might be relevant, but it should be fleshed our more. How does this relate to male wages? Maybe you could discuss the fact that families now are more likely to pay someone to do what the wife used to do, thus increasing demand for paid labor (and offsetting some of the change in labor supply). But that requires some data and argument. 

> From Page 600 we see a scatterplot showing female labour force participation rate against the change in median wages. Here we see a strong positive relationship,

Eh? This relationship looks weak and noisy to me. The slope of the regression line is 8 cents an hour for 1% increase in FLFPR, over 30 years. And R^2 is only 0.08!

> he hypothesis is that because of the gender wage gap, women are not joining industries or occupations that pay the most,

While hopefully avoiding any semantic argument over whether the GWG is ""real"" or how it's defined or philosophical arguments about causality for a variable like gender, I think it is clear that the GWG is generally small *within a particular occupation.* (edit: and experience/education level)

> This is why we see per capita GDP rising, wages for both men and women rising as more women joined the workforce.

The greatest place this plays out is with housing costs because now it’s almost impossible to afford housing without a dual income.

Secondly, childcare is getting more expensive over time because the free labor (grandmas mostly) is slowly disappearing as the generation of stay at home moms dies. 

Other nice to haves become necessities too. Two cars is a requirement. Women often need double the wardrobe. Things you could do at home can’t anymore. 

Senator Warren digs into this in “the two income trap”

So even though GDP and wages are growing, many lower income families are actually worse off. 

In a way to the layman the suppressed wages could be semantics. Wages may not be down, but for families with children the costs have far outpaced the wage gains such that you end up with the same result. Families get less because women are working. 

Flip side, which I can personally attest to, is that for couples without kids, economics of this are way better. Having a decent wages earning partner means disposable income is way better than it was 60 years ago.",wise_man_wise_guy,t2_42944,9,0

So to answer this, I don't have a specific source, but from my reading of the literature the issue is that women are in general discouraged from many industries by societal norms, and some ingrained sexism. Senior management is one area I've seen evidence for. Engineering is a big one, and engineering jobs tend to be high productivity and high paying roles that women in general are not contributing to.

But there is also the issue that the industries that are dominated by women, say teaching or the childcare industry tend to be undervalued, and underpaid, due to the above issue of the gender wage gap and ongoing discrimination.

While women tend to take a break when having a child, really that's a societal norm and not something that is absolute. It's also possible for the man to take the break to take care of the child, but this isn't seen as normal or the done thing. So yes women do suffer because they are expected to take care of children, but also do many related tasks which take up a significant amount of time, and time they can't put toward their careers. And these additional tasks are generally expected of women, rather than men, meaning this gives more time for men to focus solely on their careers while women raise the children.",PetarTankosic-Gajic,t2_3cglppdt,4,0

> Well you know that wages have been flat except in the upper 1% since 1973. 

This is not true.  

I suspect that Peterson is looking at *household income*, not wages. Household income has been constant, largely because of changes to the composition of households. See [Where Has All The Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) for details.

I'd also suggest looking at [Autor's Inequality Among the 99%](https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/96768), which shows that we have seen increases in wages for the population with college degrees, while those with HS degres or less have not seen changes (or slight declines)

> Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? 

This is the Borjas gambit. Peterson is looking at how women entering the labor force in partial equilibrium, but has forgotten that they would also consume more. 

> What happens? You halve the value of the labor. 

Peterson seems to think that Y=W*H (GDP = Wages x Hours). This is 1.) incorrect. 2.) causing him to reason from an accounting identity, assuming that GDP is fixed.

> So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. 

This is not true. Labor productivity is increasing. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MPU4900062

> So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.

Peterson is missing that women largely moved from unpaid in-household to paid out-of-household production. Hours worked has actually been remarkably stable for women over the last several decades.

Cheaper labor also means more freedom to substitute labor for capital for the firms that can do so, leading again to an increase in productivity.

Also, lower prices means increased quantity demanded, it also means a higher real wage for all workers.

Let's look at these countries at each date.

United States circa 1870.  [Massive tariff increases in that decade.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Average_tariff_rates_%28France%2C_UK%2C_US%29.png)

Germany circa 1870 under Bismark.  [Massive tariff increases in that decade.](https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/rise-german-protectionism-1870s-macroeconomic-perspective)

Soviet Union circa 1945.  Communist country.

Japan circa 1960.  [Massive protectionism for their automobile industry.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-fletcher/japan-the-forgotten-prote_b_850269.html)

Only China could be considered to have their economic boom coincide with them opening their economy in the 1980s but even then most major companies are still under state control and their boom has been going on for over half a century.

>he lofty moral tone of the opponents of globalization is possible only because they have chosen not to think their position through. While fat-cat capitalists might benefit from globalization, the biggest beneficiaries are, yes, Third World workers.

I live in a ""third world"" country called Uruguay.  The countries that are growing the fastest in South America are Uruguay and Bolivia which rely very heavily on state investment, regulation, and support.   Even supposedly less regulated Chile has more than half of the government's budget funded by the state-owned Copper company, Codelco.  Krugman is way off the mark on this one.

If 1$/hour is the norm through neoliberalism, how is the system going to create wage growth for the future?

If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers. This is monopsony power.

I think a detail worth mentioning explicitly is that the friction from turnover also falls somewhat on the employer, but typically to a lesser degree than on the employee (hence, monopsony).",nuggins,t2_4ij7n,6,0

Skill is irrelevant if you are contributing to the economy and helping to make money and keeping the motor running, you are helping to create wealth. 

What is so wrong with wanting people to be fairly compensated at a baseline so they can afford to eat healthier, take their car to the mechanic and fixed it finally, maybe get a gym membership or pay for better childcare or be able to go on a trip with their kids. 

Why are we so obsessed with maintaining hierarchy that we want to make it an impossible shit hole you have to climb out of whilst trying to keep a roof over your head and not get sick and die. Picking yourself up by the bootstraps is an _oxy moron_ it’s meant to be contradictory, not inspirational. Literally go put on your boots and try picking yourself up by your bootstraps because _you can’t._


Corporations have made it impossible for workers to value their own labor. Uber, Amazon, they can afford labor at a wage that would keep people from slipping into poverty, but they just don’t _want_ to pay for it. Well, the rest of us don’t get to control the price of the things around us, yet we’re required to pay it otherwise we can’t have it. 

I’m sick of the argument that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and small businesses. 

Want a small business? Well, if you want labor you have to work towards being able to afford that, you don’t get handouts and cheap labor. Sorry, tough luck. 

Too bad it’s not seen this way and working class people are vilified for wanting to be valued as human beings. Why do poor people have to get fucked sideways and live on a knifes edge? They didn’t do well enough in their first 20 years so fuck them for the rest of their lives i guess. 

People  like Ben act like it’s not a zero sum game when it comes to acquiring wealth when you’re at the bottom, someone else having money doesn’t prevent poor people from making more money, 

But they’re the ones who treat it like it’s a zero sum game! Paying people more for their work isn’t going to ruin the economy and make you poorer either, and if it does than you lied about it not being a zero sum game. 

Labor is a privilege, not a right, you’re not entitled to exploit working Americans.

He clarified, after the clip went viral, that he didn't mean to blame people working two jobs for their own mystery, but that the solution ultimately has to come down to your own actions. He also stated that blaming those people is stupid, because they should rather be cheered for their hard work that they're putting in to bettering their lives and their families.

How does ""the wall"" have intrinsic value? I don’t know. I think what the author means to say is that he’s going to provide a framework for determining at what age the wall occurs, but since he's attempting to copy academic writing, he had to make his prose as opaque as possible. 

I think your views here are right, but this same language could support an even creepier and uglier analysis.

Consider the Red Pill framework of a woman as a female unit that supplies sexual services over time.  Ignoring the ""wow, ick!"" factor, this is broadly the same as any other delivery of commodities.

This means that &ndash; and again I'm glad the author here appears incoherent &ndash; there *is* a kind of crude valuation possible.  Consider ""the NVP of a woman"" as the value of an options contract whereby the male holder can exchange nominal resources for sex at any point in the future.  The valuation depends on the floating price of this exchange, any coupon payments that accrue over time, and any lump-sum cost of ending the contract.

Relegating women to the demeaning role of sex-providers and men to the still-demeaning-but-slightly-higher-status role of sex-consumers, it would be possible (with the absent mathematical framework) to consider the NPV of an average ~~sexbot~~woman as a function of age and other factors; this valuation could in theory exhibit a sharp decline around a particular age consistent with the idea of a 'wall'.

The application of bargaining analysis to relationships isn't really new, and with bargains and long-term agreements financial valuation could in theory follow.  Of course, the core reprehensible idea here is that this community seems to think that it's a bad idea that women have any bargaining power at all.

Also,

While I laughingly agree with pretty much everything you wrote,  
right here, I know you believe you understand what the guy wrote, but when I read it I arrive at a completely different conclusion - which is probably due to shitty writing, of course, since his prose is as beige as it is opaque.

But part of the redpiller philosophy is the despicable assumption that women are **incapable** of responsibility and it's therefore *impossible* to blame them. To a redpiller, a woman is a child who cannot take care of herself and that ALL of society's problems come from expecting women to be people instead of *pets*. 

So what he's really saying is,

""This dude was too incompetent to keep his poorly-chosen defective pet woman under control and now he has to pay for it because he's a man and men are the only humans responsible for anything.""

5267,dviz3t6,t3_83ll72,2018-03-11,badeconomics,"Thanks for writing this. I basically agree with almost everything you wrote, and would welcome specific fixes you’d like to see in the AskHistorian post, since I would love to correct misinformation.

Women’s exclusion from economic contribution statistics is not a topic in unfamiliar with. I didn’t include it because it’s also a very politically charged topic and AH tends to discourage such answers in part because AH, outside of historiography, would rather answer a question than “teach the controversy”. But yeah, obviously moving women into the workforce because they have more productive opportunities than running the household is awesome because it gives people the OPTION of either, whereas I think a lot of 1950s women didn’t have the option, their highest output role was homemaker first.

I do think my opinion on the hedonic feel of the 1950s was probably true. In particular, working adults in the 50s probably had a strong sense that things were getting better and would keep getting better. Not that people shouldn’t have that same sense today, but the rapid pace of real productivity each year and rising standards of living do make a difference. We might be absolutely better off today but still feel more pessimistic because of the derivative. 

Also, I suspected I was asking this question into the direction of a Trump-MAGA headwind, and I wanted to be respectful of that opinion and try to explain to that audience. Citing economics academians is a risky choice for AH audiences that like Trump’s worldview. ",remotecar,t2_4enp1,43,0
5268,dviuw5w,t3_83ll72,2018-03-11,badeconomics,"Wow, good find OP.  One of the better finds on here in a while.

Hopefully /u/remotecar reads through this a bit. Judging from their response to /u/BenniG123,   I think they are still a bit confused even after quoting what the LFPR measures.

____________

/u/remotecar, here’s a TLDR for that section of OP’s post.

Unemployment, as a statistic, only includes people who want to be working (employment / LFPR).  The LFPR includes those who want to be working divided by the entire eligible population.

So this is incorrect:

> labor participation (men between 25-54) peaked in 1954 at 98% employment and has gradually declined over the next 64 years to today, where we now sit at around 88%.
...

> only 2 in 100 men that were seeking employment would not have found it, compared to 12 in 100 today.


Labor Force = (employed + seeking work) / population

Or another way to phrase it

LF = (population - those not seeking to work)/population

So what you should have said is:

> “[in 1954] only 2 in 100 men ***were not seeking employment***, compared to 12 in 100 today.”


This makes a much different statement than above.  10% more men *are not seeking work* because they don’t need to or have been discouraged out of the labor market.

Again, if you have some village woman who no longer needs to spend 4 hours a day trekking for water because her home now has plumbing, and she spends those 4 hours working for an income – there’s both more production (S) and more spending (D). When the supply of labor exogenously increases, labor demand increases also so more women working will have an ambiguous effect on wages.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you're mixing up the effects within the goods market and the labour market.

I agree with your point about there being a higher labour supply N^s and a higher output demand Y^d . But labour demand N^d is determined by the marginal product of labour, which is increased by investment in capital.


This means that a rightward shift in N^s with no change in N^d causes an unambiguous decrease in real wages and an increase in the quantity of labour employed. The increase in employment moves us up along the production function, shifting output supply Y^S out.

In turn, this causes an ambiguous effect on the real interest rate, and thus an ambiguous future shock on labour supply and investment. 

The last bit assumes a closed economy model, but with international trade, there will be changes in net exports and possibly different effects on interest rates.

In any case, if the increase in the demand for output you described was caused by higher consumption, not investment in capital stock, so a labour supply increase should push wages down.",WYGSMCWY,t2_j8xg1,0,0

> There are organisations that already redistribute food that would have gone to waste in most cities around the world. No need for mandates here.

Yes, there are, and they are chronically underfunded and do little to prevent the nearly [40% of food production that goes wasted in the US each year](https://www.feedingamerica.org/our-work/our-approach/reduce-food-waste#:~:text=How%20much%20food%20waste%20is,food%20in%20America%20is%20wasted.). You can definitely argue about what policy changes are needed to change this number--but this is a real problem.

> If their dream of degrowth occurs, we won’t have our dense cities anymore, and hence no need for public transport.

Degrowth is a large movement, and frequently (if not always) includes dense urban living in plans. 

*More importantly*, I also think you've misunderstood the degrowth argument. Degrowth's central thesis is that continuing (economic) growth among rich countries has stopped improving quality of life (or, in the weaker formulation, the marginal gains on QALY from economic growth are now going down). Yes, there exist new technologies and discoveries that we have yet to develop, and yes, those technologies are probably really cool and let us do all sorts of things that we can't do now: but they don't improve our life, they just change it. Ergo, degrowth argues that economic growth (and consumption) driven by  high-wealth consumers is bad because that growth has high costs for little benefit. 

As a corollary, degrowth argues that because our economic and governmental systems are predicated on continued growth ad infinitum, we need to change our policies and systems. In this response, you seem to have used the fact that degrowth policies slow or reverse economic growth and technological change to argue that it's a failure, when really **that's the objective!** You can certainly criticize degrowth on objectives or on implementations but don't criticize the implementations for failing consumerist objectives!",Azertygod,t2_fw5jtpi,119,0

One thing that irked me specifically was the link to the heinous chart for decoupling. Being a Swede, Sweden's way of portraying itself as climate smart really annoys me. The so called decoupling of Swedish emissions are more of a ""move production to other countries, and then blame them for pollution when producing the products we buy"". I'd think someone in economics would have a better eye out for cooking the books, look into how the data in the source was collected and check if it's from a consumption or production perspective, no spoilers.

Rant aside, the real point the speaker is trying to make here, with a heaping spoonful of politics attached, is that we're in a risky situation I think we can all agree with that. The proposed solution is that we need to reduce consumption to a sustainable level and halt or decrease growth as a cost. 
Your opposite point, if I'm not misinterpreting you, is that growth and the innovation we need to save us are coupled, to save us from disaster we should continue, or catalyze growth so that we can develop the means to solve our current problems.
Neither side is stupid but it's just opinion. And what you think best will come down to how much you trust our economic system, or conversely, trust that people are remotely inclined to lower their standards of living. 

Throwing around history is just bloating your argument and makes it seem like all you heard was ""capitalism bad"" and just went off the rails. That being said, the most convincing arguments for your point, in my opinion, is the overpopulation scare and peak oil in the second part of the 20th century.

More likely, it was normal for two earners to support a family of five, because families with more kids need more money for them to be fed and clothed.

I know that you meant this as just a bit of speculation and it's not important to your overall point, but I think this is far less clear.

Yes, a three child household has more expenses and having an extra earner helps with that. However, they also have more childcare expenses. So the value of stay-at-home work is also higher. I don't think it's clear which way this would actually go.",BernankesBeard,t2_dvkrz,70,0

Haven't the majority of US men who entered the US labor market since the late 1960s seen little-to-no gains in lifetime earnings relative to earlier cohorts?

Since younger cohorts of men have experienced a decline in their median lifetime earnings compared to older cohorts of men, doesn't this interfere with major lifecycle decisions—such as investment in education or starting a family— which require knowledge (or expectations) of lifetime resources?

With the massive drop in shipping costs, manufacturing became global, and manufacturing labor now competes globally as well, so looking at wages just in the US becomes irrelevant, just as you wouldn't look at wages just in the city of New York (since they compete, for example, with all the neighboring cities and with the rest of the US).

The increased competition of global manufacturing labor means wages for low-skilled workers in the US remained stagnant at best (when they didn't drop to $0 as jobs were automated or shipped overseas). The impact is also a massive wage growth in developing countries, particularly those where to jobs were shipped to, such as China, India, Taiwan, Not-the-best-Korea, etc.

Meanwhile, more skilled workers didn't face the same global competition, so their wages continued to grow (almost doubling from 1963 to 2012):

Why convolute real data with such blunt instruments like CPI and seasonal adjustments. The economy is not homogeneous, and inflation is different across all goods.  We are seeing massive inflation right now, it's just not where the FED wants it, labor wage. Instead it is all happening in the capital markets, commodities and fixed assets.

A friend alerted me to your post. Because I happen to have some published work in this area, I figured I'd share a few references, and provide some extra context.

The statistical power issue in Gilovich et al.'s Study 2 (76ers data) was well-known and pointed out well before Korb & Stillwell, see footnote 8, page 3 of this paper for some citations: https://osf.io/pj79r/ 

Free throw results contradicting Gilovich et al.'s (Study 3) predate Yaari & Eisenman's study. For example, Arkes (2010) finds positive autocorrelation between successive shots (see link above)

The paper linked above also mentions other papers not mentioned in this thread.

Relevant to your discussion.  Gilovich et al. considered Study 4 to be their critical test of the hot hand. It was a controlled shooting study, in which players were paid. Studies like this have been repeated (also the 3pt contest is somewhat similar). Statistical power was not the issue with Study 4; it was reasonably powered.  The reason why they didn't find evidence of the hot hand in Study 4 was because a subtle, and important statistical bias, discussed in this paper: https://osf.io/sv9x2/.  Also see this paper: https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.33.3.144 where the bias is discussed further, and related to other topics (e.g. Monty Hall and Bridge).

A reader-friendly version of much of this can be found here: https://theconversation.com/momentum-isnt-magic-vindicating-the-hot-hand-with-the-mathematics-of-streaks-74786

note: with regard to Study 2 (76ers) and related data, the biggest issue is measurement error, not sample size (of course measurement error influences statistical power).  For a discussion of the measurement error issue see Appendix B (p. 24; 2041) of this paper: https://osf.io/sv9x2/",jbm-reddit,t2_pb8ylk3,7,0

Anyone who has played sports and felt like they were in ""the zone"" knows what I'm talking about. The basketball player is confident and relaxed, making shots he might not normally even take because of it. The golfer goes for the green at times he might otherwise lay up. 

Where the human factor isn't present-  cards, dice, etc.- then I think ""fallacy"" is the right term, though as a poker player who has ridden a ""heater"" more than once it sure doesn't feel like a fallacy.",bacchys1066,t2_nkzzf,16,0

5355,eykgd4h,t3_cx6j9z,2019-08-30,badeconomics,"This is not my research area and I'm only familiar with this literature because I'm both a basketball fan and an academic. But this does not seem to be a very good summary of the literature and at points reads as quite amateurish, to be quite honest. My understanding is that there is strong evidence of a hot-hand phenomenon, but not *at all* for the reasons that you state.

> The core problem with the study was sample size. The Gilovich et al looked at a sample of 48 games played in Philadelphia in the 1981 NBA season. This represents less than 5% of the 998 regular season and playoff games played in the 1981 NBA season, concentrated among a single group of players. The authors made a sweeping conclusion about the nature of streakiness in basketball based on less than 1/20th of an NBA season. That's absurd!... In short, GVT used a sample size too small to draw a positive conclusion from, and then took the lack of positive conclusion as a negative conclusion.

The % of the population doesn't matter in evaluating sample size; only the absolute size of the data does and 5% of an NBA season is plenty. And then to compare it to another study and go ""it has 25.6x the data therefore take it more seriously"" is just a silly way to reason about statistics. To suggest academics of that repute failed to consider *sample size* of all things is absurd. The only reason the tracking study was able to detect an effect was because of accounting for shot difficulty (I'm skeptical tracking data does that all that well, but point is that it's not sample size that drove the difference).

> The belief in the hot hand and the “detection” of streaks in random sequences is attributed to a general misconception of chance according to which even short random sequences are thought to be highly rep- resentative of their generating process. In other words, the hot hand is just p-hacking.

That's a cognitive bias, but in what way is that p-hacking?

There are a couple of problems with the GVT study that also hold with almost every other study cited by the OP (not familiar with the Stillwell one), even the ones that do detect a hot hand effect. First, their counterfactual analysis contains a bias that would steer results toward rejection of an effect. This was pointed out in the authoritative study on the topic that came out in one of the most prestigious economics journals last year but had been circulating for several years prior. Anyone who is serious about this topic would know of it and it's a HUGE omission not to mention or be aware of it. If you're interested in the details, [this blog post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/) by Gelman is relatively accessible. Basically once you account for this bias in the counterfactual used by these analyses, you can recover a hot hand effect. *Even using the exact same data GVT used!* So that kills the small-sample-size and ""GVT is useless"" conclusions.

The second problem is that their operating definitions of ""a hot hand"" would be rejected by anyone who's played basketball at a competitive level. The notion that if you hit a shot you now have a hot hand, i.e. a null that P(make | miss) = P(make | make), just doesn't really capture what 'being in the zone' means. Sometimes you make a shot because you're an NBA-caliber player and by nature you make almost half of your attempts. That's quite different from being locked in and unusually focused such that in expectation, you make more shots in this new state. The null those other studies use doesn't really capture this distinction, but this one does. The Markov switching model that appears in the appendix is much more akin to how one would describe 'being in the zone' (and also detects a hot-hand effect).

Finally, the effect size is not small. From the lead author:

> These are not small average effects. With the bias correction (mean adjusted) the *average* effect size is 6 percentage points in the 3 pt data. and 13 percentage points in the original GVT study (the bias was bigger in GVT because there were 100 shots). The difference between the median NBA shooter and the best NBA shooter is 10 percentage points.

That's pretty huge and would only suggest overestimation if you have data that says people think the hot-hand effect is much larger than even that.",,,2,0

/u/brberg pointed out that fewer children also means fewer dependents, which can balance out the problem. But I have to disagree, because this can only be true temporarily. If a new generation is smaller than previous ones, the share of the population that's dependent will be smaller while they're children.

Wages for men won't increase if you ban all women from the workforce because the demand curve for labor shifts to the left due to the diminution of consumer spending by former female employees.

But let's presuppose that Mr. Dasho's reasoning is palatable and that wages for men WILL increase if you outlaw female employment. If wages are increased for your remaining workers, then your production costs increase due to higher labor costs. Increased production costs shift the supply curve to the left, raising the equilibrium price for goods; this will be deleterious to those male workers whom Mr. Dasho extols so much. 

This reasoning is similar to the argument that increased immigration will reduce native employment and wages. However, this has been disproven by [Card (1990)] (http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf), [Ottaviano and Peri (2006)] (https://www.nber.org/papers/w14188), and [Peri (2007)] (https://www.nber.org/papers/w12956.pdf).

The real ""funny"" part of the vaccine causes autism camp is that the proposed *mechanism*, ethylmercury, has been steadily removed from vaccines circa 2000. [Hence the increasing autism rates actually correlated with decreasing mercury exposure in vaccination.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0749379703001132-gr3.gif)

You can also show this independently by simply charting autism rates, which are increasing, and mercury exposure, which is decreasing.

The obvious and logical conclusion is that mercury *prevents* autism.^(1)

When one points this out to vaccine skeptics, they tend to promptly either block you, or begin denying that mercury has actually been removed from vaccines. To justify this assertion, they assert that science is controlled by some combination of jews, communists, homosexuals, liberals, or aliens. Sometimes all five!

Of course, the relevance to economics is that if someone is so incompetent as to identify *negative* correlation as a *positive* correlation, they aren't to be trusted with calculating change, let alone proposing economic policy.

This isn't true, wages is a measure of just that - wages, not any deductions.

The actual answer is that measuring wages alone only measure the wage part of *total compensation*.  Benefit beyond just wages have increased substantially and health insurance is a large component of it.

But think of it this way, if you measure wages alone, you ignore things like a 401k match, medical, dental, disability insurance, bonus.  For many jobs equity is a component too, or even just profit sharing.

So, your argument that health care costs is what is driving this divide in productivity and wages is debunked. Even if we did go with your health expenses argument, health expenditures were increasing before 1970 as well. The [earliest chart](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_0540-1_arrow.jpg) I could find that matched your chart was from 1960. But what we can see is that from 1960 to 1970, the health expenditures as percent of GDP went up by 38%. 

Another [chart you shared](https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Urban_and_rural_populations_in_the_United_States_US_Census_Bureau_1790_to_2010_OWID.svg_.png) where you contradicted yourself is in housing and how more people have been moving away from rural areas into urban areas. As your own chart shows, this trend has been steadily increasing since well into the 19th century. This wasn't a random occurrence that started in the 1970's. So yes, this can be used as a reason for why housing in urban areas has become more expensive, but the point of wthh1971 is that after 1971 the price of homes didn't increase at a similar rate compared to wages as it did before 1971. 

Another reason why you believe the housing has gone up disproportionate to wages is that there has been an increase in divorces leading to more singles needed more homes. But again, the divorce rate trending up [happened well before 1970.](https://www.lovetoknow.com/life/relationships/historical-divorce-rate-statistics)

Next, regarding housing, that this is an issue mainly affecting urban housing. That is false. [Many rural areas have similar trend to their corresponding urban counterparts within the same state.](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Documents/HPI_Focus_Pieces/2006Q3_HPIFocus_N508.pdf)

Nobody would expect you, or anyone to know this. This is the fundamental flaw in central planning which assumes it can make decisions for others better than they themselves can.

Take your cafe analogy. The likelihood of each of the three options for the barista varies from firm to firm, employee to employee, and region to region, among other factors. Likewise with MRPL, how many employees are at each cafe, and whether the would-be barista decides to open or own cafe, or simply decided that selling meth was a lot more profitable.

There are an uncountable amount of decisions every individual market actor has to make, and they will always prioritize the decision that maximizes their own self-interest given the constraints. Even criticisms to the economic calculation problem I've read such as using super computers, ignores the human component of our always changing desires, motives, and material circumstances. Economics of course isn't a ""hard"" science like physics or chemistry, so we can't ignore our own unpredictable nature.

There are three main mechanisms of monopsony (in terms of the practical empirics): market concentration, labor market segmentation, and frictions. Traditionally in the empirical literature the focus is on market concentration, as friction and segmentation creates, in effect, concentrated markets by reducing realistic options. As an example, just being technologically illiterate creates frictions to adjustment; and elderly laborer without internet access experiences an effectively smaller job selection, creating concentration. Then labor market concentration acts via bargaining power on wages, but of course this gets more complicated. 

Some great empirical papers on general evidence of monopsony (for the U.S.) include [Benmelech et al. (2018)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24307) (which used the US Longitudinal Business Database for firm-establishment level data, so certainly of interest for any skeptics) and any of the series of papers by José Azar, Ioana Marinescu, Marshall Steinbaum, and a few others across different papers (sorry co-authors) where they establish the empirical usage of job opening concentration as a more effective proxy for labor market concentration than employment concentration (the argument goes that job openings reflect more closely the realistic options to laborers; the empirics look quite decent). One can also check out Arindrajit Dube’s work, who has many “cool” papers, including a paper on monopsony in AER: Insights. [That paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180150) showed that in MTurk tasks, where theoretically search and switch frictions should be quite low, the wage labor supply elasticity faced by the employer was quite low (approx. 0.1), thus an example of monopsony power in what should be a low friction market.",aegiskey,t2_6qhw0mrz,4,0

I would argue that a minimum wage is a net drag on wage growth, because companies now know what they have to offer in order to get employees, and it will also be harder to argue for a higher wage when its instantiated into law not to mention it gives employers more excuses not to increase that employees wages.

That being said - thank you OP for taking the time to explain econ 102 to people who only know econ 101 - you’re the MVP here. 
Edit: I’m not saying the MW doesn’t ever change employment, just that it is still not entirely clear when it will increase or decrease the number of jobs.",yehboyjj,t2_86rmp2bq,-10,0

You pointed to culture, but one Great Divergence theory I'm particularly partial to is the idea that Europe's fractious interstate anarchy contributed to its explosions first in the Enlightenment, then Industrial Revolution. 

Being divided in bloody, high-stakes competition with no hegemon, European states had a very strong incentive to innovate and adopt new ideas, because falling behind could very easily mean ending up dead. Thus, new ideas proliferated very quickly, either by adoption, or by conquest from the new innovation. Violent competition was one factor that shocked Europe out of torpor and conservatism.

Middle Earth, however, very clearly has no such state of international relations. It seems stuck swinging on a binary between periods of long-term idyllic peace, like the millennium after the War of the Last Alliance and cataclysmic 'oh shit everything is burning down' disaster, such as in the fall of Arnor. The former provides no incentive to innovate - in fact, it provides a strong disincentive, as in satiated states, rulers prioritize staying in power rather than changes that might cause social instability. In the latter, everyone is hindered from an innovation by a rare condition known as 'being dead'.

It's very possible, therefore, that despite the best efforts of poor Aule, his lore and crafts were merely left to languish by a population and society that had no incentive to adopt and iterate on them.

I believe you are undervaluing the importance of magic to, at least, Elven lack of interest in innovation. As the dominant and certainly wealthiest power in Middle-Earth, particularly after the fall of Numenor, they are best placed to support a programme of innovation and research in Middle-Earth. However, elven magic allows for the creation of beautiful, perfect crafts, and the magic of the Two rings in the hands of Elves essentially allowed for perfectly serene life. There is no need to develop better steel for weapons, elven steel is already perfect^1. There is no need to develop better medicines, elven medicine is already perfect. There is no need to develop technologies to improve the quality of life, for the magic of the Two Rings (and the magic of the forest) provided a place to live that elves were perfectly content with. Elven magic is incredibly powerful but incredibly subtle, so it's hard to quantify how much of an effect this would have had on technological development, but I would say a lot.

As for the Dwarves, it's possible that they would have, as the creations of Aule, been the drivers of technology in Middle-Earth, had not a series of unfortunate catastrophes befallen their polities. Tolkien does not write much about the Dwarves, so I don't know if one can really say what level of technology they had at their height.

Also enjoy Tolkien, the IR, and a morbid fascination with WW1 which is the catalyst for Tolkien’s writings- serious PTSD which created such escapism like Middle Earth. I’d think of Birmingham or Manchester as more of a Mordor and London as more of an Eisengard. It’s the bigger population center where the ideas are vastly different (the battleground.) where you can see the industrial change happening, the air souring, the water acidifying, the exploitation of labor happening. Recovering from the war, wondering what the hell you fought and died for when everything is changing, was it for the better. But that British caste system Tolkien was privy to the charity of, and well familiar with, the industrial revolution 100 times dirtier and rougher in Birmingham, the British Detroit. Home of Rolls Royce, BSA, Purdey and Sons, Jaguar, industrial complex stuff. Cadbury too, yea chocolate, woo hoo. Walked those canals, very neat to see, but makes you think about all that industry flowing downriver keeping the big L ever growing. Saruman more of a Thomas Shelby type thug (or maybe Smaug- embodiment of greed and power) going against more of a Churchill type, prepping for the next round with Souron- being Germany, both had 2 rounds with the hun horde. But technology/ industry ultimately grows out of necessity. Guns vs butter stuff. Smelting, metallurgy, forging, metal work grew out of the need to win the war. For the crown. Riverdale, would that be Liverpool? Living on the water- Harland and Wolf building ships? The Shire, maybe Wales- pretty chill place, not too industrial. You mention elves, humans, orcs, wizards, all the D&D stuff save dwarves. The dirty secret race- lives underground, builds unseen but has a large network. Would that be Ireland? Bust your hump to get mention in the game? Or the Scottish? Where you do something spectacular and become British overnight like Papa Adam Smith? Or Tolkien? But back to technology out of necessity, the British built ships, made castles obsolete. Airplanes made boats obsolete. Radar becomes necessary to spot planes, transponders to distinguish the good guys from the bad. Penicillin for the infection, opium for the pain, tilling crops to keep the soldiers fed on schedule. Tolkien saw and experienced it all. It broke him. He made a fantasy world to cope, it became a success. In his case, the invisible hand, his writing ability, took him to success. I’m not sure he fits an economic model, but it’s intriguing to try to make the economic material relatable.

We don't have to price gouged by these mechanisms, but they are part of a healthy insurance system.

The articles here are quite cherry picked. One article or even several stating a particular point of view (especially with strong political connotations) is hardly ""strong evidence"" or ""concensus"". Also articles which don't even mention their authors from some ""think tank"" or ""policy institute"" should be read and interpreted with a 50 lb bag of salt unless you read carefully all of the techniques used within. Reading just the conclusions from these articles means you might as well be reading off the front page of CNN Fox or MSNBC. 

Many many notable Economists today agree with Bernie's plans. Truthfully neither Bernie, not those Economists (as they self admit), nor any of the articles you mention have a credibly precise estimate of Bernie's plans costs or benefits. It's simply too many factors to even think about. These papers are still useful as they are the start of useful debate. But they shouldn't at all be taken as anything more than that. No one knows what Bernie's plan will cost, or if it can be paid for. However what many Economists do agree on is that many of the things in the plan are good policies. Atkinson, Autor, Piketty, Saez, Stiglitz, Krugman, Byrnnolf, I could go on and on and on. The number of Economists who agree with these policies outright is clear. The numbers who disagree is more unclear. I understand that this article is meant to clarify things, but what it in fact does is provide a narrative that is empirically unsupported and creates fear. 
The idea that ""economists disagree with M4A and the methods used to fund it"" is misleading and clearly false. Most do agree with many parts of the plan, including wealth taxes.

I tend to think that EJMR is sexist because it's crass and tasteless and awful to be sexist, rather than the other way around. I would expect that support for feminist policies such as flex-time working hours, abortion's legality, and parental leave is higher among EJMR regulars than the general population, the lowbrow tone of discourse there not withstanding.

Edit: I've been banned, but apparently many people are interpreting the results backwards, which bears commenting on. Just so it's clear, the paper does not give the odds that ""boobs"" etc. will be discussed given that women are discussed and female pronouns used. Rather, the paper gives the odds that women and only women will be discussed if ""boobs"" are discussed. [Confusing these is a statistical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse). Granted, EJMR sometimes does talk about sex when it's irrelevant, or say demeaning things about women. But they say demeaning things about everyone, and the study's argument is different than the story many people are perceiving.

This is meaningful. This is the difference between conversations involving women being proven to almost always drift into sexist diatribes, and discussions of sex or occurrences of diatribe involving female specific slurs being proven to involve female pronouns. The latter would hardly be as controversial or surprising as incorrect perceptions of the former have been. I blame the misleading use of the word ""associated"" in Wolfers' article, along with all the framing he used to encourage pattern-matching.

An example might be illustrative. If we ran the same method on the NYT comments section for the past several dozen articles they've published, we would inevitably find a similar association for many words. It is inevitable that if someone uses the word ""vagina"" or ""feminazis"" female pronouns will appear nearby. This association is not strong evidence of intense sexism, although clearly sexism does indeed exist on EJMR.",entropizer,t2_17804v,31,0

Likely she was mistaking median personal income for median earnings of employed workers. Median personal income is a statistic that includes people like retirees, homemakers, disabled people, and high school students (everyone over the age of 15), so it's considerably lower than the median earnings of employed workers. Median usual weekly earnings of full-time workers are around $1,000, per the BLS.

Of course, referring to median personal income as the median wage of earners is simply wrong.

Doesn’t that imply that 30% of the poorest people should be considered barred from social participation? That percentage decreases as one moves up the income scale, but as the number of people in those incomes drop, shouldn’t I expect something between 20-30% of the population to be barred from social participation?

Edit: also took a look at the income sources you cited, and I think it’s the phrase “functional poverty” that’s doing the healthy lifting for the author.

In other words, if ""physics"" tried to predict even something as simple as a single human's motion, let alone that of societies and armies, it would hit limitations and uncertainties very quickly. Although it would be able to say some things without much hesitation, like ""we're reasonably certain that the vast majority of humans are within Earth's atmosphere at the moment and will remain so for at least a few decades"". And mathematical models developed for physics have seen some interesting applications in predicting specific types of human motion like, say, the prediction of crowd movements.

> The assertion that politics has not influenced the hard sciences at all is quite difficult to defend when one considers history and current events.

It has influenced what gets funded and published, but it hasn't been able to influence actual results all that much. Unthinking matter does not lend itself very well to justifying ideology. To give an example, fossil fuel companies have spent immense amounts of money taking control of climate science, and yet even when their paid scientists do their utmost to please them, they overwhelmingly cannot bring themselves to claim that anthropogenic climate change due to fossil fuel emissions doesn't happen.

> Schools of economic thought such as the Chicago School of economics are not really a thing anymore.

This does not seem to have made it to most media introducing people to economics - including quite a bit of university-level stuff. A public exam I got recently tested on explicitly required me to memorize and regurgitate information on the Mercantilist, Marxist, Keynesian, Chicago, and Vienna schools.

> Simply dismissing rational choice theory just because behavioral economics is sometimes ""better"" would be akin to throwing out Newtonian physics because of general relativity and quantum mechanics.

That's a fair and elegant retort.

> It should also be noted that economics was originally called the ""dismal science"" by Thomas Carlyle, a 19th-century pro-slavery writer who expressed dismay at the fact that political economy often led to conclusions against the institution of slavery.

Fascinating how memes from questionable sources take a life of their own, their filthy origins forgotten.

> The award was created by the Sveriges Riksbank in commemoration of the central bank's 300th anniversary, not by an international cabal of economists conspiring to gain legitimacy.

That said, being created by bankers celebrating a banking institution doesn't exactly suggest a lack of bias. *That* said, the same could easily be said about the other disciplines that get Nobel Prizes, and the specific demographic trends of whom and what gets awarded those. 

> The majority of Nobel Prize winners have won for ideas/thoughts that are not exactly associated with ""capitalist/neoliberal"" ideology. 

If I were to take that claim literally, it might say very little, depending on how narrow ""exactly associated"" is. Can you elaborate on this point with specific examples?

> Economists are perfectly willing to accept that market policies are not always optimal 

As a group, I'm sure that is the case, particularly in an academic setting. Even Milton Friedman the Economics Professor and Published Scientist was *much more nuanced* about the claims he made in peer-reviewed papers than Milton Friedman the Political Advisor, Conference-Giver, and International Celebrity-Scholar.

> while also not letting Marx live rent free in their heads.

Presumably Marx does actually pay rent, if only by the legacy that his critiques and insights have left, even through the later advances that outdated, superseded, or built upon them.

> And out of those four figures, practically none of them are ""worshipped"" by economists, with only some of Friedman and Hayek's ideas still being seen as relevant (and Friedman much more so than Hayek).

Ideological neoliberals, libertarians, conservatives, etc., and the voices that they like to platform, like to present themselves as understanding economics better than their opposition, and often cite authors such as those two in defense of their preferred policies. This can give people whose exposure to ""economics"" comes mainly through mainstream mass media, politicians' public rhetoric, and, worst of all, [social media information silos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g), a very skewed perspective, compared to one who's mainly exposed to it through academic settings and published, peer-reviewed papers.

> Pretty much everything about economics is political, whether economists deny it or not.

If we define economics as the study of how we assign limited/scarce resources, then the relationship with politics is indeed pretty inextricable. But perhaps the same could be said of all sciences? What is ""apolitical"" or ""nonpartisan"" anyway?",AlarmingAffect0,t2_6ao4xmb7,1,0
5673,kfp75ri,t3_18u33vo,2023-12-31,badeconomics,"> the majority of economists do think that it is a problem

I would guess that the claim is probably true, but I doubt that the link you gave shows the opinion of the majority of all people who do economics research for a living. Let me [take a look](https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/inequality/)...

> In preparing for **the IGM conference** on THE ROLE OF ECONOMICS AND ECONOMISTS IN PUBLIC POLICY AND PUBLIC DEBATE, which was originally scheduled for April 2020, we asked **the US economic experts panel** these questions in February 2020. 

> **[The Initiative on Global Markets (IGM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative_on_Global_Markets)** is a research center[1] at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in the United States. The initiative supports original research on international business, financial markets, and public policy.[2][3] The IGM is most famous for the **weekly polls** it conducts of its **Economics Experts Panels**, consisting of
    * 43 leading economists in the United States panel and
    * 49 such economists in the European panel.
        * [a] A separate panel, specializing in finance, consists of 40 economists in the US, three of whom are also on the regular US panel.

So, ""the majority of economists"" becomes ""the majority of the 43 economics experts deemed by the US's UCBSB's IGM to be leading economists in the United States"". 

We're in a discussion defending the status of Economics as a science. I know these distinctions can seem tedious and hair-splitty, but it's important to be explicit and rigorous when making broad claims, if only to avoid giving your opposition something to nitpick.

And I don't think this is a nitpick. Whenever I've interacted with economists on the English-speaking Internet, a US-centric view so myopic it bordered on the absurd kept coming up, with some staggering gaps in their knowledge concerning the economic evolution of countries abroad, even within the EU. I'll take the opportunity to note that, for an Initiative on *Global* Markets, supporting original research of *international* business, its choice of panelists seems *unaccountably* parochial. 

> Countercyclical fiscal policy is seen as a reasonable course of action by most economists, especially when monetary policy has been exhausted. It is not a 50-50 split at all. 

Given the big asterisk in the claim on ""most economists"" we have just discussed, I find that, while, again, what you're saying seems quite believable to me, I *do* need to ask you your reasons for believing that a lot more than a simple majority of all economists advocate for countercyclical fiscal policy.

> [as explained in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_methods/#wiki_can_economists_reach_consensus_on_any_issue.3F)

Well, that explains your choice of source. I'd still suggest it might be good hygiene to make sure to make explicit what population sample of economists we're basing our claims of ""most economists"" and ""consensus among economists"" on.

> As u/modular_elliptic explained, physics professors do make somewhat less than economics professors, so their claim is technically true for academia. Moreover, there are more options that one can do with an economics degree.

For the purposes of discussing Economics as a science, my assumption, as stated earlier, was that ""economists"" were ""people who do economics research for a living"" (or, if it's technically unpaid, as their main labour/activity).

Financial institutions recruit physicists straight out of school all the time, but laboratories never recruit economics majors or economists (i.e., quants at Black Rock).

Economics is not a science *yet*. To claim that it is betrays an ignorance of what separates science from ""not-science"", which is a philosophical (epistemological) question better explained in Michael Strevens's book [*The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science*](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Knowledge_Machine_How_Irrationality.html?id=ISXWDwAAQBAJ). If economics was a mature science, there would not be such disagreement among its experts about the grand explanatory narratives it proposes. Economics, as a science, is where cosmology was hundreds of years ago when natural philosophers were debating about geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system.

Physicists are in a unique position to offer insight to economists in the academic setting as all material conditions are subject to physical laws and processes, thus making economics an area within their purvue. Thermodynamics is a great place to begin:

>""For a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.""

Obviously the reality is that nothing prohibits landlords from engaging in the activity of rent-seeking and that they are the ones who literally demand and collect rent as a ""job"" means they are probably more likely to do so is this not obvious to everyone?

As if there's some magic forcefield that prevents landlords as a class from rent-seeking. It's total nonsense. If all the landlord does is rent out the property to you *then impose a bunch of restrictions on you they wouldn't impose on themselves and keep your security deposit, then they are indeed expecting to reap value where they did not help to create any. They depend on you to pick up their slack and fix everything they always give you the runaround for when you call them, then their property is maintained for free by their renters.

All the paint and locks that you change, any nice lighting fixtures you installed they will expect to keep for themselves and will insist that you throw out the junk they expected you to be happy with when you moved in. 

There is no magic forcefield here, landlords can and do rent seek, and I will concede that some landlords do their best not to rent seek too heavily but there's certainly something to be said for the fact that even good landlords can just raise rent arbitrarily to whatever they deem they deserve.

I agree that incel theory is odd and has a huge number of issues with it, but, if we look at the phenomenon, there exists a rational explanation to why incels exist. 

&#x200B;

Let's look at the data:

 [https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) 

&#x200B;

 

>A data scientist representing the popular dating app “Hinge” [reported on the Gini coefficients he had found](https://hingeirl.com/hinge-reports/whats-the-biggest-challenge-men-face-on-dating-apps-a-qa-with-aviv-goldgeier-junior-growth-engineer/) in his company’s abundant data, treating “likes” as the equivalent of income. He reported that heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing. 

&#x200B;

Or in other words, if you treat ""likes"" as currency, then the inequality in sexual opportunity on hinge is significantly higher then the US economy. 

&#x200B;

In criminology, there exists this idea called strain theory. Strain theory states that society puts pressure on people to achieve certain goals, and when these goals cannot be achieved, people are pressured into five common ways of coping: (stolen from wikipedia)

&#x200B;

>Conformity: pursuing cultural goals through socially approved means.   
>  
>Innovation: using socially unapproved or unconventional means to obtain culturally approved goals. Example: dealing drugs or stealing to achieve financial security.   
>  
>Ritualism: using the same socially approved means to achieve less elusive goals (more modest and humble).   
>  
>Retreatism: to reject both the cultural goals and the means to obtain it, then find a way to escape it.   
>  
>Rebellion: to reject cultural goals and the prescribed means to achieve them, then work towards replace both of them. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at it through the lens of the incel community:

&#x200B;

>Conformity: ask out a large number of girls, follow all the guides on the internet, and hope one of them will go out with you.   
>  
>Innovation: just hire a prostitute man...   
>  
>Ritualism: I can't find someone willing to date me/sleep with me, but I got a friend at last!  
>  
>Retreatism: the /r/mgtow idea. Who needs women anyways right?  
>  
>Rebellion: Who needs sex when you got hentai? I prefer 2d girls anyways!

&#x200B;

If we look at incels through the lens of strain theory: Society is telling these young men that sex is something desirable, and that everyone else is doing it. Therefore, their inability to get laid is creating strain. This drives those men to communities for innovation, ritualism, retreatism, or rebellion. 

&#x200B;

During times of high economic inequality, we aren't surprised to see the emergence of various radical, heterodox, economic extremists. The Jacobins, Bolsheviks, and Chavistas all appeared during times of extreme economic inequality. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, during times of extreme inequality in sexual opportunity like today, is anyone surprised that we're seeing heterodox social theories pop out of incel and/or foreveralone communities? 

&#x200B;

In a sense, it doesn't really matter if the theories don't make sense. I'm going to sound like a communist revolutionary here, but for large swaths of society, ""orthodox socialization"" has failed them. So yeah, they're grasping at straws to explain why the typical advice others give them has failed.",Uptons_BJs,t2_f6gr6,258,0

There are cases where the linkage principle is violated, in other words, where the seller in an auction can be better off concealing their information. One such case, is when there is an auction for an item that comes in multiple types, where the buyers receives multiple signals. In that case, the seller can be better off not revealing the type of the item.

I don't know what incel theory has to say about it. But its easy to imagine ways that one could send out multiple signals in the dating market: telling Republicans you want to date that you are a Republican, while telling Democrats you want to date that you are a Democrat, telling Christians you want to date that you are a Christian, while telling Jews that you want to date that you are Jewish. If incel theory does allow for W to send out multiple signals, then its entirely coherent. If it doesn't, then there are still other ways for the linkage principle to fail, like when the private information of the buyers is correlated, in that case, its possible for the seller to capture the entire social surplus for themselves, just like Incels think in this model[https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf) Maybe there is some other way to prove Incel ideology incoherent. However, you have failed to prove the incoherence of Incel ideology by relying on the Linkage Principle, because it doesn't apply in all cases. I think that what you have actually proven is that Incel's believe that mating markets are auctions in which the seller (the woman) extracts 100% of the social surplus. I don't think that any of them would dispute that. Edit:  On closer inspection, the bit about correlated private information said that there is a way for the seller to extract all the social surplus that they would get as if the bidder's private information was public. In the example they gave, the linkage principle still holds. That being said, there are still other ways the linkage principle can fail besides the one that I have outlined.

It's optimal for W, before the start of the auction and *before knowing the signal*, to commit to revealing her signal once she receives it.  But there is no point at which an actual, individual woman could make commitments to potential partners before knowing her own value.  Rather, the commitment would have to exist implicitly and collectively, as a cultural consensus that people should release verifiable information about themselves, such that people who decline to do so are probably trying to hide some flaw.

But even that only makes sense if the information is *verifiable*.  If an auctioneer's claims can't be verified (and are not trusted for some other reason), and there are no long-term consequences for lying (not true in reality but can be assumed for this model), then there is no incentive for an auctioneer not to exaggerate their claims as much as possible.  This is true even if the auctioneer's item really is of high value!  In this case, it would have to look something like (...ugh, this is so embarrassing to write...) women agreeing to allow potential partners to interview their associates about their personality or something, rather than just making claims about their own personality.",,,13,0

This means that if you gave all men more game. It would make no difference. As hypergamy is entirely based on hierarchy. If everyone gets more game, the hierarchy stays the same.

That is scientifically proven to be true.

Incels understand hypergamy. But the problem is they believe that value is only obtained through looks. Since you can't grow taller, widen your jaw or regrow your bald spots, they think they are doomed be remain low value males and never get into the 10% that women desire.

Value and hierarchy amongst men is not decided only through looks. It's also decided through intelligence, via wealth and social status. Wealth and social status can be acquired through intelligence and effort.

That is also scientifically proven to be true. Women, unlike men, are not ONLY attracted to looks.

For some reason incels refuse to accept that you can climb value hierarchy through social status and wealth (ie effort and intelligence). Instead they choose to do nothing and dwell on the fact that good looking men and women go through life on ""easy"" mode, and refuse to make any effort as a moral stance against this ""inequality"".",cannotbecensored,t2_5n0xijif,-6,0

Let’s assume the argument is correct, and that small towns exhibit more monopsony characteristics than larger areas and that wages/employment are depressed relative to what they “should” be. The question then turns to whether a $15 minimum wage is the correct wage. 

It is entirely possible that small towns exhibit characteristics of a monopsony AND that the minimum wage increase is too large and employment will decrease. I’m not saying that will happen, I’m just saying the presence of a monopsony is not in and of itself a sufficient argument that the minimum wage increase wouldn’t be harmful.

5785,gjfkntd,t3_ky6l95,2021-01-16,badeconomics,"I appreciate the thoughtful comments, but I should make a couple points here.

1. The survey numbers over time aren't meant to show that economists are strongly in support of $15 minimum wages, merely that their position on minimum wage has evolved over time. And that's meant to show that economists have responded to the emergence of evidence. The argument that a $15 federal minimum wage is pretty safe is my own; it's not meant to be an argument from authority.
2. I do explicitly deal with the fact a $15 minimum wage fits Dube's 59%-of-median criterion at the national level but not at all local levels. I spent a lot of time talking about that! 
3. The excerpt from Azar et al. that you quote here does not question the paper's external validity. Instead, it says that concentration is not the only factor in determining the effect of minimum wage on local employment. I explicitly note this in my post, writing: "" This implies that in smaller towns where wages are naturally low, the danger of minimum wage is reduced because employers are more powerful to start with."" In other words, concentration mitigates the disemployment effect of minimum wage; this is completely consistent with the Azar et al. quote that you excerpted. :-)
4. The Biden plan is likely to have some sort of partial exemptions for low-cost areas. That will reflect the danger of raising minimum wages too high in low-cost, low-productivity labor markets. The plan already indexes future minimum wage growth to median wage growth, suggesting that the people in the administration are aware of this issue. The observation about higher concentration in many low-productivity areas indicates that the danger of getting the partial local exemptions wrong is less than we might fear...as you note in your update. ;-)

Anyway, thanks for the thoughts! Always appreciated.

5786,gjep96f,t3_ky6l95,2021-01-16,badeconomics,"I wouldn't say Noah's post is bad. Maybe it's a little speculative. But 15 dollar minimum wages not reducing employment isn't so big relative to the minimum wage increases observed in the literature. Turns out we've already observed a fairly healthy number of minimum wage increases in rural areas and elsewhere thst are larger, in min wage / median wage terms, than a 15 dollar min would result in in most places. They're in Dube's sample (duh, he has every hike) and he's talked about not seeing issues for them every so often.

Anyway, you can argue maybe there would be issues despite that. It is a larger hike than most in sample. But it seems a little rough to say the claim is bad or wrong, as opposed to maybe just a bit uncertain.

Edit: as a side note, intuitions that rural areas are less productive probably should be tempered with an understanding that rural areas probably suffer from more monopsony. Hard to say which way that breaks.",gorbachev,t2_3g3fi,29,0

There will probably be some partial exemptions for small businesses, startups, etc. There should be a policy allowing the government to reduce the minimum wage during a recession. **And despite the mitigating factor of monopsony power, there may be some kind of policy that allows towns to get partial exemptions from the federal minimum wage if their prevailing wages are low enough, just to be on the safe side.

Yeah there’s not many employers in a town but rural workers often willingly drive an hour or more for work. That greatly widens the scope of employment in rural towns causing his monopsony idea to crumble. 

Where I live in TN, factories in different counties are having to offer competitive wages to draw reliable workers in. The job I’m at right now has employees from maybe a dozen rural counties at least. It’s definitely not centralized and stagnant as Noah suggests.

And 15$ is usually below the starting wage of these factory jobs, but it’s close, and that’s way above the minimum for cost of living out here already.

The easiest way to impose identification in this case I guess is to use recursive identification and assume that oil prices do not change contemporaneously with changes in presidential approval ratings. I think you're using R? so you can actually do so using the svars package where you apply id.chol() on a VAR with presidential approval ratings entering the equation before oil prices, and voila, I reckon the results would be quite similar though, but I might check this out later.",sohaicinapek,t2_wg9mn,5,0

>Contemporaneous correlation: A weekly average of oil prices is not stationary, so a natural upward trend in the price of the asset is in the data, which means that the R\^2 of 0.96 he got is wrong and the correlation he establishes is highly biased.

The length of oil price data under the Biden presidency is less than a year. Is this is enough for long term downward trends in commodities prices to affect it?

>Weekly frequency when dealing with gas prices don't reflect the nature of how gas prices behave (they are volatile and are typically examined at higher frequencies)  
>  
>For approval ratings, I used all voter approval ratings for Biden from fivethirtyeight.

First comes the question of how reliable daily approval ratings are. They are done on a much smaller scale than one-off polling data right before and after a debate for example, or even weekly data. 

Also, high pump prices do not affect motorists if they are temporary. A temporary surge in prices only affects a small proportion of those who are pumping gas or reading about gas prices at the moment, reducing the accuracy of approval data (which we know for a fact can be affected by so many factors). I think weekly or monthly data, stretched across multiple presidencies are better suited at answering the original question. It's not reliable or even necessary to divide these 2 data sets into the smallest intervals possible. Only a sustained price change can affect approval ratings meaningfully. People fill their tanks once every 2 weeks, so I think a great way is to start with this interval. 

>When replicating the regression I used first differenced / % change gas prices at the daily frequency instead of a weekly average (Data was stationary after first order differencing with 2 different unit root tests) . For the dependent variable, I used daily approval ratings. 

This question is amateur, feel free to just link me some resources. I'm curious as to why you didn't use change in daily approval ratings as opposed to daily approval ratings for the dependant variable? When you used change for dependant variable.",bogdanoffinvestments,t2_3a58vdds,0,0

The main contribution consists of modelling an adverse shock that restricts the set of suitors attempting to match with an agent and its impact on reservation suitor quality. While I consider the post to be a sufficiently novel and dank RI for this journal, I believe it would be beneficial if the author could address the following points in the revision phase.

1. It is unclear what would be the shock's effects in general equilibrium. I propose the author extends the model to involve a continuum of suitors and suitor-recipients and a matching function along the lines of Mortensen & Pissarides (1994), and integrates this mechanism into an otherwise standard contemporary macroeconomic model such as Smets & Wouters (2007).

2. Citations to relevant prior literature should be added (e.g. analysis of sponge option value in Dixit, 2012).

3. As a robustness check, the author offers alternative model setup with an infinite-horizon agent. This part is however somewhat unclear and should be polished before publication.",ivansml,t2_i9fo0,120,0

>This is also bad economics.  Inflation is by definition an increase in the *price level*.  Monopoly power should show up in *relative* prices (the prices you get out of your supply/demand graphs either in perfect competition, monopoly, etc).  Breaking up monopolies would lower *relative prices* (an admirable goal!) but would not lower *inflation* which is a rise in nominal prices.

I'm struggling to understand this part, can you explain it differently somehow? My understanding would be that if, in a simplified model, you had five products and the basket of goods that inflation is calculated from is also those five products. There's a given price in each market and they're all competitive. If four of those turn into monopolies, those monopolies are gonna raise prices (P>MC).

> ""Doesn't have to worry"". What does this mean? What, in MMT's minds, are the relevant tradeoffs, the relevant welfare considerations, of having high deficits? This is not clear, aside from the inflation consideration. Debt is raised from capital markets from investors. The government auctions bonds and takes money out of capital markets. That means government debt ""crowds out"" private investment. Is this something we don't need to worry about?

this doesn't matter because MMTers don't want to fund deficits with debt. so in their view - even if they were to agree that crowding out would occur if the gov were to issue debt - crowding out is irrelevant to deficit spending. this is why they say deficit spending INCREASES private net financial assets.

probably more important to the overall debate though is the theoretical disagreement between MMT and the mainstream about if crowding out happens even if the government issues debt. 

one place where the mainstream textbooks seem to be wrong is in loanable funds model where they say that government deficits decrease the supply of loanable funds and therefore increase interest rates. this is wrong b/c the supply of loanable funds at a given point in time doesn't depend on how much financial assets the private sector has. 

https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy

(i think crowding out should still happen though since the gov needs to increase interest rates to entice people to lend, but the typical way that crowding out is explained is wrong.)

> Seignorage financed deficit spending increases aggregate demand. The objective of government policy is to regulate aggregate demand such that AD2 = AS at Y*, as the free market (Y = Laissez-faire) will be perpetually below potential. Y* is potential output, which is where full employment exists. Inflation (higher price level) occurs here because too much money is chasing too few goods. Deficit spending increasing aggregate demand is normal in AD/AS comparative statics. However, what is different here is the implicit belief behind seignorage: money printing doesn't cause inflation. Money neutrality states that printing money cannot move around real resources (shifting AD to where AD = Y*) in the long run, it only increases nominal prices.

the empirical evidence is pretty convincing, but i don't get it from a theory standpoint. LRMN says that a one time increase in the money supply will eventually cause a 1-1 increase in inflation. according to your graph, [if the money supply is increased such that  Y increases to Y* where the arrow is](https://imgur.com/a/JFpZ5iy), why does inflation have to increase?

Personally, I think Benack really confuses the idea of rhetoric as a mode of analysis with fiction as a thing that isn't true.

At this time economic hypotheses cannot feasibly be reduced to the natural sciences. That doesn't mean, as Miss Benack would suggest that economics are just storytellers or that economists are not practicing the scientific method, and her claim is equally untrue for other social sciences which practice similar scientific rigor. However there are limitations that social sciences (economics included) face that physics, chemistry, and a substantial and growing portion of life sciences do not.

First and foremost are the limitations imposed by the infeasibility of methodological reductionism to test most economic hypotheses. This makes it considerably more difficult to establish causal relationships when compared to many natural sciences, and especially difficult to tease out the mechanistic basis for such relationships. That's arguably the reason why the statistical methods used in physics, chemistry, and ""hard"" (ie molecular biology) life science papers tend to be simpler than in social science papers: due to the reducibility of these fields, we simply don't require advanced statistics nearly as often to provide satisfactory evidence for our claims. That's the conventional wisdom at least, though especially in biomedical research a lack of people with training in advanced statistics is definitely harming reproducibility.

>Not everyone who is in contact with someone infected with a virus will catch it, and everyone who catches it will react differently: so, immunology is not a hard science? Because it doesn't describe ""immutable physical facts"", it seems.

To illustrate the value of methodological reductionism in natural sciences, let's consider the specific scenario mentioned here. A virologist notices that a subset of individuals exposed to a particular virus do not end up exhibiting symptoms of infection. They hypothesize that the immune individuals have a mutation in a receptor crucial for uptake of viral particles which abolishes the interaction between the virus and the receptor, thereby preventing infection. They sequence the DNA of individuals who became sick and compare them to individuals who are immune, and identify a point mutation in a cell surface receptor among the immune individuals, which supports their hypothesis. Their next order of business is to generate mice with this mutation, and expose them to the virus. Sure enough, they find that mice with the mutant receptor do not get sick, and conclude that the mutant receptor confers immunity to the virus.

In an analogous experimental economics, things would often wrap up there, with a conclusion about the causal relationship between the observed phenomena, but a limited ability to draw conclusions about the precise mechanism which underlies that relationship, because the tools to probe the underlying mechanism of the phenomena do not exist or would be ethically/financially prohibitive.

For the virologist however, it is feasible to go considerably further by reducing their biological hypothesis to one grounded in physics and chemistry. For example, the virologist or a collaborator with a stronger emphasis on biochemistry  might characterize the interaction between the viral surface proteins and the receptor. If these physical measurements showed that the mutant receptor had a dramatically lower binding affinity, the results provide strong support for both the virologist's causal claim and the mechanistic hypothesis, and the virologist can keep going even further.

A biophysicist colleague might solve an atomic resolution structure of the virus receptor complex, identifying the specific site of binding. Using this, one can precisely calculate the strength of the specific atomic interactions involved in the receptor/ligand complex, and predict the existence of different mutations in the surface receptor which should also confer immunity.

The usefulness of methodological reductionism in natural sciences extends even to squishier life science fields like clinical research. The gold standard for proving the efficacy of a particular medical intervention is the randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial. Much like economics experiments, these are extremely expensive to run. In order to determine which experiments are worth pursuing, physician-scientists rely heavily on reductionism to gauge whether there is a plausible biological basis for a proposed intervention before moving forwards with clinical studies. So, to continue with the virus analogy, a molecule which can be shown to interfere with the interaction between the critical surface receptor and the viral particle is a much more promising drug candidate than an old antimalarial drug with immunosuppressive properties, which is something that would be demonstrated using the techniques of biochemistry and biophysics.

Right now and for the foreseeable future there's pretty stark line between disciplines where researchers routinely reduce aspects of their hypotheses all the way down to chemistry and physics versus disciplines where that isn't feasible, and thus the claim that economics and other social sciences as they currently stand reflect a different kind of truth from the natural sciences isn't devoid of merit. However, the notion that (rigorously practiced) social sciences are closer to literature than to the natural sciences is absurd.",InfinityArch,t2_htxev,1,0
6002,g8n9qo0,t3_j9svyp,2020-10-13,badeconomics,"To play devil's advocate, the author's arguments have some merit, even if they are not well argued in the article. For example in the case of stories within economics, economic theories shape narratives and narratives shape stories about the world. ""The Fable of the Bees"" is one of the earliest and best known works of economics and the book largely works with a story in which it is argued that private vices provide public benefit. Now in the modern day, nobody writes economics in story form, however economic stories can still be seen within the different theories like Post-Keynesianism, Neoclassical Economics or Austrian Economics. Who is responsible for growth? How to increase growth? How to deal with what economic issues?

Then there is the ""issue of fiction"" as the author calls it. In economic terms I would call it abstraction with the author pointing out that through this abstraction you believe in a fictional/abstracted version of the economy in the hope that this version mirrors real life as close as possible. As example the author takes perfect competition and opportunity costs. Both ideas are accompanied with fiction, in this case in that this is the idealised version of how people and the economy function. In the latter example the author wants to shine light on the idea of how there could be issues with this as persons often act with limited rationality and take shortcuts when deciding their opportunity costs.

Lastly the point about the Nobel price. The author has a point in that economics enjoys higher prestige in the public sphere than other social sciences and there is an air of hard science surrounding it after large PR campaigns in the post war years including funding the Nobel Price of Economics.

Now, the goal of the author to achieve with this article is to bring economics more in line with other social sciences and shed the pseudo hard science image of economics. I would think this is to enable a greater plurality of theory within economics, because for a social science economics is extremely uniform, being dominated by Neoclassicism.

While true the study of human behavior is more the realm of psychology than economics. I would say that as a graduate student in an economics program I don't consider economics to be a science. Not because I don't believe it's poorly thought out or that it's not accurate or even that it's not good at prediction, indeed economics is rather good at all of those. Rather it is that economics is really interested in the allocation of resources which isn't really a scientific question. And while I do believe that economics is accurate, falsifiable, and rigorous I'm not sure we can really accurately describe science as anything that possesses those characteristics. Economics has over the course of the 20th century become something fairly different from the other social sciences. I imagine the 21st will be the reintegration of the social sciences back into a more cohesive whole.

>The father of economics is generally considered to be Adam Smith, who certainly never spoke about marginal utility. The father of macroeconomics is Keynes, who also didn't speak much about marginal utility (although he was certainly familiar with the concept).

I wouldn't say Adam Smith is **the** founder of economics. His economics is not easily recognizable to what is done today and is arguably more social philosophy. In addition there were prior economic thinkers who are not as well known due to being none English like the Physiocrats that were doing economics.  I would say that it's once you reach figures like Walras and the other marginalists you really start to see the beginning of economics as we know it today.

It is interesting that so many people who study economics are so interested in defining it as a natural science but the epistimologies are clearly different in natural sciences and social sciences. This comes about due to the way humans behave and the way we can create fiction. 

What is interesting is how economics make assumptions that do not match with findings in historical, psychological and anthropological findings. It is no wonder that these disciplines don't take economics very seriously as they have answers to questions that economics doesnt ask. 

It is interesting that you continue to look to Adam Smith and Kenynes as two of the fathers of the discipline as economics now looks radically different to the discipline they envisaged. Smith and Ricardo were great thinkers of their time but many of their thoughts and assumptions are unsurprisingly out of date, eg Smith's conception of a barter economy or Ricardo's comparative advantage (which doesnt apply when three is free movement of capital). Equally, we are no longer in the time of Keynes instead we are in a stage of free market fundamentalism more influenced by Hayek and Friedman than Keynes. 

Economics is generating academic output that is abstracted to the point of irrelevance.

This is true if it’s possible to absolutely decouple economic growth from growth in energy/material throughput at whatever level of aggregation we're measuring economic growth (typically GDP). 'Absolute' meaning that GDP can increase while energy/material throughput doesn’t (c.f. 'relative' decoupling, which implies only that GDP increases faster than energy/material throughput). Recent analyses show that despite examples of relative decoupling, absolute decoupling is not happening and is unlikely to happen in future:

Much discourse in sustainability science now revolves around the ‘Planetary Boundaries’ ([https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a](https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a)) and sustainable development goals ([https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300)[ https://www.nature.com/articles/495305a](https://www.nature.com/articles/495305a)). It’s acknowledged that increased energy efficiency helps with relative decoupling in some cases, and so, in combination with other measures, can be a valuable contributor to achieving sustainable development goals and living within planetary boundaries. However, increasing energy efficiency alone often doesn’t achieve even relative decoupling due to backfire ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19559580-the-jevons-paradox-and-the-myth-of-resource-efficiency-improvements?ac=1&from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19559580-the-jevons-paradox-and-the-myth-of-resource-efficiency-improvements?ac=1&from_search=true)). If we want both endless GDP growth and sustainability, we need absolute decoupling, and that doesn’t seem to be possible. Coincidentally, arguably the world's leading expert on energy and material flows in nature and society has just published a book on growth, in which he argues that economic growth must end ([https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/vaclav-smil-interview-growth-must-end-economists](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/vaclav-smil-interview-growth-must-end-economists)).

The same guy has a nice book demonstrating that despite ongoing relative dematerialisation of the modern economy, total material throughput continues to grow because efficiency improvements are overwhelmed by growth ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17941760-making-the-modern-world?ac=1&from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17941760-making-the-modern-world?ac=1&from_search=true)).

The same is true for carbon flows through energy converters; despite all the work that’s gone into cleantech innovation, efficiency improvements and other decarbonisation measures, global emissions continue to grow. Emissions growth is now the highest it’s ever been, even though decarbonisation efforts are also the largest they’ve ever been ([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/charts-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-2018/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/charts-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-2018/)), because we continue to prioritise GDP growth and decoupling isn't keeping up.

*>>For all intents and purposes, the earth*[ *is not an isolated system*](https://i.imgur.com/MPuvhP9.png)*.*

Agreed. But for the thermodynamic processes relevant to human society, the Earth’s supply of negative entropy is limited by the temperature difference between the sun and the cosmic microwave background. This has serious implications for the future of humanity ([https://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9511](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/31/9511)).

\>>*the implication that th-e-e-e-e entropy would be a limit on technological innovation a-a-a-and human advan-an-ancement is an intellectually dishonest misrepresentation of the implications of the fundamental laws o-o-o-of thermodynamics.*

If you mean naive arguments about the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics, like those made in the above lyrics, then I agree. If you mean physical analysis sophisticated enough for a complex-adaptive system like society, then I tentatively disagree. Thermodynamically, societies are non-equilibrium systems and the more general theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is still under development. For what's been done so far, I personally like this text ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18350079-nonequilibrium-thermodynamics?ac=1&from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18350079-nonequilibrium-thermodynamics?ac=1&from_search=true)), and wikipedia gives a decent intro ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium\_thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics)). The full implications that a complete non-eq thermo theory will eventually have for technology, innovation and economics more broadly are not yet clear. Nonetheless, we already have some evidence that innovation probably won’t let us continue growing the economy forever. See above and ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajes.12162?casa\_token=9nyWeU2PdsgAAAAA%3APSrC49Lkp6z3nleLU0yE9zSHrjraicjtdhIIka96K7Hcs715K4OIpZcRwa7IkQvPJmhqN4zQmtlJ\_do](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajes.12162?casa_token=9nyWeU2PdsgAAAAA%3APSrC49Lkp6z3nleLU0yE9zSHrjraicjtdhIIka96K7Hcs715K4OIpZcRwa7IkQvPJmhqN4zQmtlJ_do))

I guess neoclassical devotees will always be able to convince themselves that markets and innovation will clear all obstacles to eternal growth. Maybe they’re right; I don’t know.

For the curious, there have been some expert attempts at formally integrating thermodynamics with economic theory (in addition to classic Georgescu-Roegen). Recently, Reiner Kümmel's 'The Second Law of Economics' ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10368087-the-second-law-of-economics?ac=1&from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10368087-the-second-law-of-economics?ac=1&from_search=true)). ‘Energy and the Wealth of Nations’ is also an interesting read ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39311242-energy-and-the-wealth-of-nations?from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39311242-energy-and-the-wealth-of-nations?from_search=true)). Others are working on developing systems of national accounting that go beyond GDP by accounting for biophysical realities ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23333803-beyond-gdp?ac=1&from\_search=true](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23333803-beyond-gdp?ac=1&from_search=true)).",dr_strangeloop,t2_vpij154,4,0
