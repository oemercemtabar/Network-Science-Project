I can see how it might come off as invalidating, (I have adhd/autism and sometimes I don‚Äôt express/verbalise my thoughts promptly and type out of impulse, often forgetting that people aren‚Äôt telepathic and they can‚Äôt read my mind. Honest mistake, I apologise).

What I meant to say is first of all, I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through this. Where I live, I keep a pepper spray on me at all times. This gives me a sense of reassurance to use an highly aggressive approach to scare people like him off. I grew sick of having to gently tell people like him to fuck off, on the off chance that they actually take the hint and leave (plot-twist: they won‚Äôt!), and I‚Äôm sitting there calculating a million scenarios where this person could hurt me cause ‚Äúhow dare I‚Äù say no to his almightyness..

However, without the pepper spray, I‚Äôd be thinking twice before I pull off that move. The depth of depravity people like him can go to is beyond my reasoning.

It was very clever of you to just play oblivious and give a concrete answer regarding where you‚Äôre heading to. And I would report this to the police, although granted, police might do fuck all about it, cause that‚Äôs how the system is. I just like to think more reports against him, the harder this will push their hands to take action against this criminal.


I think safe spaces, in general, don‚Äôt exist cause these unsanitary characters could very well trick their way in. The best way to prevent this is through very strict security policy, making sure to inform attendees of that place to be respectful, and that should they feel uncomfortable they can be rest assured that security will take the necessary action in the best interest of those who are affected, and finally black-listing those who show no regard for other people‚Äôs safety.

We also need to acknowledge that living alone this day and age is an absolute privilege that not everyone can afford, so to say you can only reach your full potential if you happen to have this certain privilege just kind of rubs me the wrong way. It‚Äôs up to each individual woman to determine what her own full potential looks like and how she can reach that for herself, regardless of circumstances that may be out of her control. 

I‚Äôve lived alone and I loved it. I‚Äôve lived with roommates and I loved it. Now I live with my partner and I love it. I can honestly say I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúdependent‚Äù on my husband now, nor did I feel dependent on my roommates when I‚Äôve had them. Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to have another person around, sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be in your own space. That‚Äôs not dependence, that‚Äôs choice. Of course I am affected by the people around me and by my partner. We are evolved to be social animals who live in a society; we affect people just as they affect us. Thats neither good nor bad, it just is. I can still ‚Äúfigure shit out for myself‚Äù while also acknowledging that I‚Äôm both being acted upon while also being an actor in society. 

You put forward the question at any point in my life when I was around other people, could I have thrived in a setting controlled by myself? The answer is yes, I could have, but I also thrived in those situations surrounded by others. Having roommates didn‚Äôt control/ manage me, I adapted and compromised and that was 100% within my control and my choice to do. I chose that because I wanted pleasant relationships with the people around me, not because I needed validation or because I was being controlled. I find having good relationships fulfilling and meaningful so I‚Äôm willing to invest in that and compromise within my relationships. 

I can definitely agree that a lot of people (particularly women) might benefit at certain stages of their lives from the increased self-reliance and independence that comes with living alone, and that when we go through certain struggles by ourselves we can come out stronger in our own sense of self because of it. That being said, I disagree with the statement that a woman can‚Äôt meet her full potential without living alone.

I live with my partner now, it's much cheaper, and I do really enjoy sharing a space with him. We sleep together most nights but we also have separate bedrooms to decorate as we please.

There are huge benefits for this approach, for the record, the happiest people are basically single childfree women. Because there is no substitution for quiet focus.

I have had this privilege for a good chunk of my life. It allowed me to make mistakes, learn to recover from them. To seek higher education. Develop as a professional, become skilled as a musician outside my profession.

Again it also turned me militantly childfree and anti-traditionalist. But I see that as a benefit because I ended up fully knowing myself rather than letting the world define me.

I relate this to my point because I think that women at a very young age feel like they **need** a relationship so they end up looking for the wrong people to fill that spot but when a women knows she can live by herself and sustain herself and live a happy fulfilling life she's so much more likely to only settle for a partner that meets all of her standards.

Like we are all individuals with brains and passions and likes and dislikes and talent and skill but for hundreds of years they were just like fuck that and gave all women these chores and duties that aren't unique or satisfying and are mostly repetitive like cooking and cleaning just to suppress us from channeling any sense of creativity. 

It reminds me of another metaphor in A room of one's own where Woolf describes an idea as a fish that you throw back into the water to grow but before it can grow it is interfered.

kp54hoa,t1_kp3lxt5,2024-02-06 05:49:54,Feminism,"Hi, thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate your fresh perspective :)! 

Firstly I want to say that it wasn't my intention to insult you or any woman with this post so I deeply apologize if you felt like the strong language targeted you in a negative way. 

I also want to say that I completely agree with you that women can thrive in different settings. I also completely understand that financial dependance is a privilege that not many people have and I hope it didn't come off as tone deaf to say. 

I would say that in your case it's not at all about dependance as you were clearly financially independent with your roommates :). I would say that a big part of my argument (which you addressed) is the fact that we're influenced by the people around us. Environment takes up such a huge part of our psychology. I definetley agree that you didn't seek validation or feel controlled by your roommates. I just mentioned the roommate thing to reiterate that I meant women should live completely alone at some point in their life, which it looks like you did :). 

While I agree that there are specific benefits to living with others you will always be affected by it. Like if your roommates had a specific taste in music you might be influenced by their taste in music, if they felt badly about something you may inherently start disliking the same thing. Meaning that you might unconsciously be seeking validation from them if you disagreed with them fundamentally or politically you would likely not be as open about it to keep the peace. 

This can't happen if you're living alone. You don't have to worry about pleasing people at all. In any sense of the word. Only pleasing yourself. Even in the sense of labeling your food for example so no one takes it by accident. that is an act you do for the sake of others that you're living with, to uphold manners and respect. 

But what if you were by yourself and you were like fuck the manners and everything else that I've been taught. You leave a mess until you feel like you have to deal with it. You don't have to compromise on plans. On furniture. You don't have to clean anyone else's shit you don't have to quietly compromise when you don't want them making noise or you don't like the furniture they're buying because you chose everything in your home and you choose how to live your life and allocate your time. So you choose to allocate your time and money in yourself and your career consequently meeting your full potential.

It's literally how we survive. And that's going to happen regardless at work or wherever we go but when we come home at night all I want for us is a few hours of genuine relaxation and peace and freedom where we turn all of that shit off and watch shitty tv and order our favorite foods and actually wind down and sleep when we want.

Honestly though one of the main things is that I think that women are so smart and have such complex minds that go far beyond their relationships. 

Sure, you should try to find community and friends and go to work and socialize and go out. But when you get home you should actually be at a level of comfort and relaxation that feels like home. So many women go to work and work their asses off just to get home and try to please as many people as they can and then do a bunch of bullshit house chores because that's what they were taught. 

Another important part of my narrative is that in this time alone women should develop their education, hobbies, and careers. Shit that they usually lose once they have a family. You just wouldn't have to sacrifice your time. You like movies? go to the movies. You love knitting? start knitting. You're a bookworm? join a book club. You love working out? join a gym. And definitely find communities in all of these things. 

It's not about staying within a comfort zone and isolating its about a woman finding out who she is, outside of the family she was born into, outside of the family she will marry into, but who she is, what she loves and for her to do what she loves and learn to be okay with herself.",poe293,t2_tdqm9j80d,3,0,reddit2

kp5ysks,t1_kp54hoa,2024-02-06 11:47:17,Feminism,"Even if what you‚Äôre saying is a huge oversimplified version of what you‚Äôre trying to say, I think you‚Äôre missing the fact that living alone doesn‚Äôt equal not being influenced by the people around us. 

Unless we are to fully isolate ourselves, we‚Äôll always be influenced by others to a degree. We‚Äôll always have to compromise on some things and adapt our behaviours to coexist with others. That‚Äôs what living in society means. We still have to work, we still have friends and we still have romantic relationships (if we want them) when we live alone. 

I also disagree that we cannot reach our full potential unless we live alone for a while. I would even argue that, in some circumstances, living alone can be detrimental to reaching our full potential. Whether we like it or not, living alone is more expensive. It requires more of our financial ressources. The added expense means that we may have to sacrifice or make some compromises on our goals. It can restrict our ability to travel, participate in some hobbies, take risks, save for retirement, etc. 

In your OP, you mention your cultural background and the fact that middle eastern women are expected to go from their parents‚Äô home to their husband‚Äôs home. I think this background may play a bigger role in stifling women‚Äôs independence than simply not living alone. It‚Äôs the underlying expectation that women‚Äôs lives should serve others rather than themselves. 

I grew up with a completely different background, where living alone as a woman is absolutely normal. I was raised with the expectation that I would be financially independent and that it would be my choice to live with someone or not. I wasn‚Äôt expected to stay home until such time as I was in a long term relationship, let alone married. In fact, I and all of my close friends have lived alone at one point or another. 

Do I think there‚Äôs value in living alone? Yes, absolutely. For both women and men. I believe it teaches self-reliance and fosters independence. Do I think it‚Äôs the only way to achieve this? No. Just like I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed or even doable for everyone.",couverte,t2_br888,4,0,reddit2

Financially it's not possible for people to live alone at some point. But what I'm saying is if you have the opportunity and privilege to, you should take it. People can choose to live alone and don't because it's harder but the pros outweigh the cons. And maybe reading my other replies will help you understand what I'm saying. 

I understand that people are influenced regardless of their living arrangement. My hope is that when a woman leaves work, social events, whatever, where we have to uphold the people pleasing ladylike tendencies that have been ingrained in our mind, we can go home and live truly and authentically. And more importantly, comfortably. 

It doesn't mean not being completely influenced but so much of your life is spent at home. It defines what your life is like at that point in your life. 

The concept is like a safe haven. We can all acknowledge that we aren't truly comfortable around other people. Not as comfortable as we are alone. There are certain things we're just embarrassed or weirded out doing around others that we would be fine doing by ourselves. I think building a home for yourself where everything in it is a reflection of you and you have control over your own life is crucial to finding out who you are. 

I think we can agree that things like social media and outside pressures push women into the pressures that make them feel like they need to be in a relationship. So we look for relationships and companionship in the wrong people and we end up tolerating and sacrificing a ton of our own standards. But if we live alone and build a life for ourselves **before** getting into a relationship we realize that it's not something that we actually need and are more likely not to settle. 

also I wasn't personally raised with those middle eastern norms but I know that in my culture that it's not normal for a woman to live alone. and yeah obviously it's an independence thing?

I immediately shot my hand into the air and retorted, ""Why don't we set a curfew on all men that they have to be home after dark? That way women can walk around campus without fear and any man caught outside will be assumed to be a predator and arrested.""

So many men seem to think of women as being servants, caregivers, sex objects, object to prey , objective derision, etc. etc. etc.

It seems outrageous to a number of men to simply treat women as being equally deserving of dignity with men 

The only way I can think of that things might change is if more and more women start regarding relationships as completely optional, and maybe not even desirable 

Because so, many men are so badly behaved or so careless or so entitled 

If men don‚Äôt choose to commit violence against women, or regard women as things to be subjugated, then they‚Äôre only other choice if they want to have a woman in their life is to be pleasing 

But I know a number of women who‚Äôve given up on being pleasing or fair or respectful, or anything like that some of whom put decades of caretaking into the project 

They‚Äôre not going to deal with manboys anymore 

If men want respect from women, they need to give respect to women 

And the kind of respect they give has to satisfy the woman the man‚Äôs criteria our secondary here 

If they don‚Äôt choose to satisfy women with a quality of their behavior toward women, then women have a right to just not have men in our lives 

‚Äî-

I think a lot of the problem is it men kind of grew up, believing that they would always have access to having a woman in their life to provide caretaking, servitude, placidity, housekeeping, pleasing temperaments, docility , and sex

And many men grew up, believing it was fine to disrespect women to make jokes at women‚Äôs first expense to cat call or demean or insult women, and it was supposedly all in good fun, and women were supposed to be fine with it 

Now a fair number of men are shocked to find out that women just don‚Äôt see the value in them as potential partners and want nothing to do with them in their personal lives

And that many women are skeptical that bringing a male into one‚Äôs personal life even has a payoff that‚Äôs valuable to the woman 

Men used to like women fine when women were good sports, and were willing to be in second place all the time, and never have the authority and we‚Äôre always trying to be pleasing 

Perhaps women would like men, if they were always being docile, and pleasing and amenable, and willing to always take second place

So this will obviously result in women ""with reservation"" getting in with even lower test scores than before. They will get to college with less prep and knowledge, less qualifications. They'll work harder to graduate or graduate with less knowledge.

Also, rich women will get private tutoring because the access of the rich to tutoring will not change, while poor women will disproportionately score lower because their access was more affected.

That said:

-police got the address wrong and are not liable for that piece.

-the judge said ‚Äúok‚Äù to go in unannounced, making the interpretation of the crash at the front door open to, well, anything...and the cops are not liable for either requesting or implementing this lack of announce prior to entering

-the police decided to serve their warrant at 1am, again no accountability or legal liability for this decision


To recap: unannounced group of men crash through the front door.  Resident, who would normally be well within his rights under castle doctrine, wakes up, grabs his gun, and opens fire.  Police return fire, hitting Breonna 8 times (out of 20), killing her.  A woman is now dead and to add insult to injury the man trying to defend hearth and home is charged with assault on a police officer.

Let‚Äôs say no gunfire happened and they entered the house, said oops, and left.  They would not even be accountable for the door, doorframe, or anything burned/damaged by flash bangs or gas thrown in ahead of them.

This ‚Äúqualified immunity‚Äù is bullshit.  This entire encounter escalated from horrid decision making and never should‚Äôve happened.  If they‚Äôd been accountable, then maybe things would‚Äôve gone down differently, starting with the front door.

&nbsp;

I say not just because if somehow it were possible for everyone to be equitable to generic white guy or girl there is still way too much acceptance and lack of accountability for when officers act in violent ways.  I don't have the right answers and I try to listen as much possible when I'm not amplifying those trying to reach a better future, though my worry is that schisms within movements can be exploited by those who want to restrain progress or even roll it back.  It's important to build coalitions and to utilize the political energy to do as much as possible for all of the people victimized.  Breonna Taylor and her surviving boyfriend, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery(which involves a retired policeman and his son), Atatiana Jefferson....too many names to adequately recount, and in *some* cases there seems to at least be the hope of some kind of justice seen like with Botham Jean(though it would be nice if all these people were still alive rather than people pursuing some kind of modicum of relief after the fact).  Even further, there are countless people arrested, ticketed, have their property taken under the guise of asset forfeiture who might not rise to the level of outrage currently being felt but are no less important to be ground out of institutions and individuals as an acceptable par for the course.

&nbsp;

I guess I just worry that if the facets of people are too narrowly focused on it will only bring people in targeted communities up to the level of white people when situations like Daniel Shaver's murder or the women raped by police officers while in their custody, white or otherwise, show that that standard of treatment is not good enough for any of us.  :/   Hopefully there's enough energy and political will to get things to a much, much better place than they are now.",Tynictansol,t2_4dqz9,1,0,reddit2

It strikes me that we as a nation are saying black girls are not children when we fail them in this way. Just as we say black boys are not children when we shoot them for playing with toy guns. Only white children are afforded a childhood and seen as innocent children, depending on who hurt or killed them and how much power and privilege they have.

EDIT:
Women intersect at the places where we are objectified by people,  systems and institutions. 

Black women and brown women have a hundredfold burden of that patriarchal, paternalistic, and proprietary bullshit of old white dudes who feel entitled to all of our labor. 
 
Right now, in June of 2020, it is all about BLM, and the subtext is last month's headline: Covid-19. It ain't over. Wear a fucking mask. No matter what your political views are, do this to show your neighbors you do care about public health. Then wash your hands, and go make money, because the more of us wearing masks, the more businesses can open.

We share this time. Make it matter no matter who you are. Be for the future, and for the benefit of everyone. Corporations are not people, money is not speech. Your neighbor is not your enemy. Be a decent human and treat everyone like you want to be treated.  

Insist on accountability of the police and politicians. Hold them to the same standards as anyone else you would hire to do a job.",puss_parkerswidow,t2_8663g,43,0,reddit2
fsti5ej,t1_fsrtzzq,2020-06-04 02:47:33,Feminism,"I remember reading the [Village Voice interview](https://www.villagevoice.com/2013/12/16/read-the-stomach-churning-sexual-assault-accusations-against-r-kelly-in-full/) with Jim Derogatis from 2013. Derogatis had initially received and then submitted the tape of Kelly having sex with a 14 year old girl.

>The saddest fact I‚Äôve learned is: Nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody. They have any complaint about the way they are treated: They are ‚Äúbitches, hos, and gold-diggers,‚Äù plain and simple. Kelly never misbehaved with a single white girl who sued him or that we know of. Mark Anthony Neal, the African-American scholar, makes this point : one white girl in Winnetka and the story would have been different.

>No, it was young black girls and all of them settled. They settled because they felt they could get no justice whatsoever. They didn‚Äôt have a chance.

It's crazy for instance when people can bring up R Kelly as an example of cancel culture when he should have been fucking cancelled two decades ago. He married Aaliyah when she was just 15 and made an album called ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"". Everyone knew he was a pedophile who lurked around Chicago playgrounds to find another victim, and yet he kept performing and getting invited onto talk shows and performing at festivals etc. Society only cares about black women when it's all up in your face and you can't ignore it, but if you can ignore it, then the abuse and harassment that black women face goes under the carpet.

>Proponents of the sex work model sometimes suggest that anyone who is against prostitution is against sex. The sex they are talking about is the real ity of abuse I am describing. It is like saying that being against rape is being against sex. Indeed, it actually is saying that. The same group sometimes also insists that all of the abuse, rape, and beatings are in ven ted or exaggerated by us ideologically motivated, 
repressed, sex- panicked Victorian prudes and whiners who just don‚Äôt have what it takes to make it as whores. The pimps are in ven ted too, apparently. Prostituted women, in their view, are in de pen dent entrepreneurs; well, maybe some have managers.

>Then along came HIV / AIDS, and even this crowd discovered a harm along with a lucrative profit center in purporting to address it.How handy, this disease that sickens the men who use the women as well as the women whose faces they explode all over. How refreshingly gender neutral and symmetrical. Now the pernicious brothel 
system in India must stay in place, or where would the condoms be distributed? Sex trafficking in India is up 300¬† percent since Bill Gates spent his thirty million on condoms. Who is keeping track of whether the women can actually use these condoms, or the skyrocketing prices for the women next door who have no choice but not to use them? I have come to think that these condoms are emblematic of the prophylactic sex work idea that proposes to make the world safe for prostitution by containing and covering up its violations one at a time.

>The first fault line in the denial of prostitution‚Äôs intrinsic harm came when it was conceded that children should not be prostituted, a concession the sex work approach now routinely makes. No one ever says precisely what is wrong with buying and selling children for sex. Just that it is ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù Well, if prostitution is freedom, equality, 
liberation, and empowerment, if it makes a woman‚Äôs life more autonomous and in de pen dent, and its harms are occasional or negligible and can be minimized and contained, do tell what on earth is wrong with children doing it or seeing it being done. Nobody says. And what ever is wrong with children being involved in prostitution, 
they also don‚Äôt say what precisely changes suddenly when she‚Äôs seventeen years and 366 days old. The fact is, and every one knows, if no one could enter commercial sex as a child, the sex industry would be depopulated overnight (making a look- back provision attractive). Few try to deny that most women enter the sex industry as children 
with previously violated childhoods. What is denied is that defending the prostitution of adults supports their continuous violation on the rationale that they are no longer little girls.

>Adults and children in the sex trade are not two separate groups of people. They are the same group of people at two points in time. One consequence of childhood sexual abuse, fought by women in or outside prostitution, is feeling valued and approved when you are being sexually violated, while also feeling fundamentally ashamed, humiliated, and worthless. Sexual abuse in childhood makes it seem 
that prostitution is where you belong, while law, policy, and popular culture just wait for you to live long enough to be written off as a consenting adult.

I am always wary of sources when I read articles like this one, but history is proof enough that men  more often than not have abused women when able to overpower them. It seems like only socializing makes them behave. It almost makes you wonder if this predatory side of them is just tamed by ""civilization"" since many seem to lose any morals given no consequences or risk to be held accountable. It's painful to observe how many men lack self awareness and refuse to look inside, to understand how they contribute to the problem. Equal rights in a world where women have to constantly make sure that what they have won't be taken away from them (similar to what Rebecca Solnit said, just because we made progress doesn't mean we can't go backwards) are a very fragile thing. The change needs to happen in men's minds, I wonder if educating them from a very young age would suffice.

Don‚Äôt forget your self-defense keychain when you leave and make sure to check under your car and in your backseat. when doing errands make sure you pay attention to everyone around you because at any moment you could be kidnapped. when walking to and from your car have a hand free in case someone attacks you. dont forget to also check your car when you get back from shopping to make sure it hasn‚Äôt been tagged by traffickers. 

whew, now that‚Äôs done you can finally go to work where you‚Äôll be harassed at least once by a coworker or client of the opposite sex. if you work in customer service, you‚Äôll be harassed multiple times a day no matter how you look or what you‚Äôre wearing. 

okay works done! time to go out with friends. make sure you wear low heels or no heels at all in case you have to run from someone trying to assault you. while out with your friends you‚Äôll have to deal with people once again harassing you but this time you also have to be vigilant because some of them might try to drug your drink to get what you want. unfortunately these people look just like everyone else so you can‚Äôt tell who they are. the more persistent ones you can trick with a fake phone number because you‚Äôre too afraid if you reject them they might kill you. 

once you‚Äôre done having a good time with your besties, you finally get to go home and get ready for bed but not before you triple check all of your safety measures in place (special door jams for intruders, security cameras, etc) just in case someone might have realized you live alone and you‚Äôre an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô target. now you can sleep and do it all over again tomorrow. 

this is what daily life like for women in some parts of the world (especially the USA). I refuse to believe that women would cause the world to collapse when men already ruin so much. I‚Äôm so ready for a societal shift so men like you can be fearful instead. maybe you‚Äôll start to understand.

Second, when programmers ask each other questions on the internet about programming problems, sometimes someone replies with ""RTFM,"" which means ""read the f---ing manual"". They mean that ""this is clearly documented in the manual, don't ask us this."" This is generally considered a toxic response in those circles, because yes, people can simply google for answers - but some people prefer to *discuss* the issue instead. And nobody is forcing anybody else to answer programming questions on the net if they don't want to. Asking a question on the internet is not the same as demanding that any one group in particular answers it. Think of it as, ""if you're willing to answer it, here's a question. If not, feel free to ignore it.""

So, instead of replying ""RTFM,"" programmers on such fora are encouraged to answer with a link to the relevant part of the documentation, or not answer at all.

Remember, ALL feminist hates men 'til the enemies are at the gates. It's quite unfortunate that you keep using the word incel for a 17 year old man who has no urge to even have a romantic relationship with a woman, and it is even weirder to think most men are rapist, and being not a rapist is odd for a man. Even the word feminism has the prefix, ""-fe"" which indicates being related to feminity, whilst they seek equality. Why not use equality instead? Even the word itself doesn't indicate equality. Keep using expletives at me, because if i insult you back, everyone will call me mysogynistic because i am on the r/ feminism, having a disquisition with brainwashed women. Some women here are actually decent and doesn't hate all men, unlike most of them who even upvotes the comments that contains malignant and terrible thoughts about all men.

Radio Free Europe and other outlets for the West have credibility because they basically tell the truth. They need this credibility to gain the trust of those in their audience.

So, yes, Russians are raping their soldiers. There is well known raping and sexual assault of male soldiers in the ranks as accepted hazing.

Yes, I agree. I apologize for being unclear. My intention was never to say that ""men are pigs"" hurts my feelings and please stop everything else until my feelings are no longer hurt. My (or other individual men's) feelings are not the issue. My concern was that such generalizations might run the risk of alienating potential male allies to the cause of women's issues, which as you rightfully point out, *should* be the center of attention in this context.

> you‚Äôre not helping your case by (repeatedly) attempting to ally yourself with the only other person in this thread disagreeing with women.

Right. I'm trying to offer support for someone who is perhaps misguided (I honestly don't know, if he is I'm probably misguided too), but to me, seems to have his (I think it's a guy) heart in the right place. Perhaps he did make the mistake of putting himself in the center of the discussion. That was a good point that I hadn't thought of. But in that case, wouldn't it be better to say ""You might have a bit of a point at least, but please don't derail the discussion from the much more important subject of this post. If you're concerned with what you're talking about, perhaps consider making your own post about it?"" Maybe you (or someone else) did something like that earlier in the discussion and I missed it - in that case, I apologize.

Well, I disagree. I think I am an ally. I certainly try to be. And I'm not saying I'm a good ally, I've specifically stated that I have a lot to learn, but I do try. If that guy indeed decried feminism, then I honestly missed it. Also, English is my second language, so I may well have been missing nuances in this thread that native speakers would not. I might have misinterpreted him. Or is it possible that you did?

> It‚Äôs tone deaf

Perhaps. Again, I am aware of the fact that I have a lot to learn. I'm not being intentionally tone deaf.

> my guess is if you believe you should get some extravagant welcome for meeting the minimum baseline of not raping and assaulting and demeaning women, you don‚Äôt understand at all

Well, I don't believe that, so that settles that.

> and because your feelings are hurt you won‚Äôt try any further.

This is not about my feelings. And I will try further.

> You actually commented you are not feeling welcomed on a post about the systemic abuse and ongoing sexual assault on women in order to connect with a man trying to dismiss these facts.

If he did try to dismiss those facts, then I missed that when I skimmed the thread. It was not my intention to connect with someone who did that.

> Do better or be quiet.

Okay, that's just plain not nice. And that's okay - you don't have to be nice to me. If you choose to be not nice to someone who is honestly trying (but is perhaps bad at it) to be an ally, then you are more than welcome to do that - you obviously don't need my or anyone else's approval. I just don't think it's conductive to the goals of feminism.

1. Feminism needs all the allies it can get.
2. If allies feel welcomed, or at least don't feel un-welcomed, then they are more likely to stay allies.
3. Therefore, it is in the interest of women to at least not be un-welcoming to people who honestly try to be allies even if they are *really bad* at being allies - not to spare the allies' feelings, but because the allies are needed.

I have not been intentionally argumentative, dismissive, or abusive to you. Like I said, I have a lot to learn and I'm sure I've made mistakes in this thread (for which I apologize). But my intentions are just. Telling me to ""do better or be quiet"" is not, in my opinion, constructive.

Also, please don‚Äôt apologize for English being your second language as I think you express yourself well (being able to communicate effectively in more than one language is an impressive skill in itself, truly).  

I also appreciate your desire to be an ally to women and clarification of your comments here. I don‚Äôt want to speak for all women in this sub so will share my thoughts with the caveat they are mine alone. I have certainly been guilty of being short with some men who disagree with women in this space because it happens *so* often and the majority are not arguing in good faith. I‚Äôm not sure if this sub is shared in other forums but there is a problem with brigading, where people come here with the intention to antagonize and start arguments (this happens in pretty much every women‚Äôs space, on Reddit and otherwise). Other times, even when a man is an ally, they sometimes inadvertently speak over women and centre themselves and their feelings. This happens in other spaces that are targeted to marginalized groups, such as some white women in WOC spaces. This is not always ill intentioned (I‚Äôd say quite often it‚Äôs not) but the impact to that group is the same. You‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs important to not drive away allies but at the same time I think there should be room for people to (rightfully) express their frustrations with groups that oppress them. I think the term ‚Äútone policing‚Äù applies here as it‚Äòs more important to focus on the factual or logical content of an argument instead of the emotion with which it is expressed. If we don‚Äôt agree with a statement (ie. ‚Äúmen are pigs‚Äù) expressed by a member of a marginalized group, it‚Äôs best to ask *why* they feel that way and how we can address it instead of calling them out for feeling the way they do. As a white person who is actively working on becoming anti racist I have to remind myself that when some BIPOC say white people are awful, they‚Äôre not necessarily referring to me and I don‚Äôt have to take it personally. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not for me to be offended at because I‚Äôm not part of the marginalized group. I can just move on and ignore the comment whereas they can‚Äôt from racism (similarly to how women can‚Äôt from sexism and misogyny).

That's a good point, I'll try to do that from now on. Honest question, though - should we do the same with people who say ""black people are pigs"" and similar things? I'm not saying those two things are the same, obviously my example is worse, but I'm curious if you could perhaps make headway with racists using this method too.

isq75in,t3_y6g1ab,2022-10-17 21:47:46,Feminism,"I think that the blanket empowerment mantra of modern sex work definitely leaves women vulnerable to exploitation in a more subtle way than before. Before we just assumed all traditional sex workers were exploited and now we just assume that all modern sex workers (""models"", OF, content creators, streamers, etc) are all empowered independent women. And that makes it more difficult for them to seek help or for others to help them if they need it, because it now goes against the narrative and the profit streams to let the secret out that you aren't really single or don't want to be doing this stuff all the time because you're some unicorn nymph.

A slightly tangential gripe i always have with the modern sex work empowerment movement is the internalized misogyny within it. There is often a denial from models or content creators or whatever they call themselves that they are sex workers and they often act disgusted as if ""how dare you presume I'm a sex worker, I'm just a model/streamer/content creator/etc"". But at the same time they claim all of the victimisation and activism for sex workers. Idk but it seems like like an internalized double standard of wanting to fit the empowered modern sex worker stereotype to benefit from it while simultaneously looking down on and shaming traditional sex workers or even the term sex worker itself.

Edit to add that I think some of that internalized double standard comes from a class distinction possibly. It is typically still highly vulnerable lower socioeconomic status white or migrant women who are prone to being trafficked into or pursue traditional sex work while we see a much more diverse and ""privelaged"" mix of women involved in modern sex work. The typical model, OF, content creator, streamer, is often a fairly middle class white woman, hell even celebrities or IG stars who are already making good money are all over this side of the modern sex work too and I think this plays into the double standard.",Alternative_Art_528,t2_74bawrnb,75,0,reddit1

Kinda like many marriages out there, you see a wife with a happy face but in reality she was suffering abuse at home.

I strongly disagree with this. It can go either way. It can be willful and enjoyed, and forced and hated.

What you're saying is like saying a hammer cannot continue to be used because it's been used to beat or kill people. It's just a tool to reach an end goal, and can be used for good or bad.

The intent is what you're ignoring. How do we know what their intent is? If some are forced to lie, that doesn't mean all sex work is suspect. Having a scorched-Earth policy because there's something bad in it is incredibly simple-minded and egregiously wrong.

What's needed is safer+easier ways for women to not only reveal or report their abusers, but some way to also keep enough finances or continue getting them so that they can get the benefit of any work they do (even non-sexwork) without going to the poor house or getting hurt.",reviradu,t2_9xwb9wdc,1,0,reddit1

I don't think incelish is an apt comparison personally. I think all online content creators, not just women doing sex work, are perceived as having it easier relative to typical careers. To some extent that can be true as some of these careers once they gone through the hard work of building a successful brand can have a lot of the work outsourced and become slightly passive as a career.

Yet there are some sex workers (even if only a small percentage of very privileged ones) who choose their clients based in part on attraction, and who insist they do enjoy the sex. Perhaps some are lying to themselves, but again, that is a personal truth a woman must be allowed to decide and speak for herself. And it‚Äôs not so hard to believe when you consider that lots of people get paid for work they enjoy, and choose their professions based on that. This is the kind of reform I‚Äôm talking about ‚Äî a fundamental shift in the underlying assumptions about what sex work means. Imagine a world where if a sex worker gets the impression a client would have sex with her regardless of her desire, or even a hint of disrespect,,she could just choose a different client. We are a long long looong way from that. But it‚Äôs what we should be moving toward.

While he points out some legitimate flaws in the paper, Mr. Weitzer's assertion that a better way of understanding the problem is by looking at specific case studies doesn't make sense to me at all. And then when he actually talks about specific cases, he addresses the incredibly important ""case"" of the Netherlands by simply quoting vague statements from the Ministry of Justice rather than actual numbers. Overall I thought he did a good job in showing how the Cho paper could be better but a poor job of proving that legalization leads to better outcomes than criminalization or decriminalization. 

Regarding the main question: The source I linked does primarily use a study that has some issues. I looked for other research into the issue, but didn't find much that seemed like good quality to be honest‚ÄîI'm sure a more experienced researcher could do a better job here. I did find a study on the issue by the European parliament that seems to suggest that legalization or ""regulationism"" increases trafficking: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2005/360488/IPOL-JOIN_ET(2005)360488_EN.pdf (relevant summary of findings on page 8, 9, and 10 in the pdf‚Äîfull disclosure that I skimmed through and did not read the whole 173 pages). I'd welcome any good sources you (or anyone else) happen to have handy on this topic as well.

I can bet Anyone here that some of them were mixing their alcoholic beverages with things just as modern illegal street drug kingpins mix their drugs to artificially inflate the weight or concentration for greater profits.  

When Portugal lightened their restrictions on all drugs it led to a decrease in hospitalizations and deaths from ALL drugs cause people there had less of a need to rely on dangerously mixed drugs.

It sounds as tho u have somehow misunderstood the very basis of sex work: the provider has to be paid for the interaction *BECAUSE she has no actual interest in fucking this person,* and WOULDN'T, were it NOT for the money.  

Its not, afterall, as tho if she actually DID have any interest, sexual or otherwise, in any specific client, tht she couldn't simply choose to see him WITHOUT pay, or WITHOUT watching the clock. Which is exactly what many do within the context of their *personal* relationships- the ones tht are actually reciprocal; with the partner(s) tht truly know HER, as an individual; the ones she *doesn't have to ACT around....*    

These are fairly clear indicators. And they very obviously do not point in the direction of her receiving actual enjoyment, at least of any notable amount, in 99.99% of said interactions she's paid to be a part of.  

And why would she? Nobody *enjoys* fucking ppl they're not attracted to!

Also, it's def worth noting tht we are speaking in the context of *THEE VERY BEST* OF SITUATIONS & CLIENTS one could hope for while offering to fuck for money, & we are speaking as tho thts the majority, or hell, even a small percentage, of what her interactions actually look like. In reality, the vast majority of these clients are often apparently quite disgusting, despicable, egotistical, manipulative, misogynistic, utterly selfish, uncleanly, unattractive, *& sometimes even violent* Neanderthals, tht are often lying to & cheating on their unsuspecting wives & female partners at home, whom mind you, *were afforded EXACTLY ZERO ABILITY TO CONSENT TO THIS SITUATION tht deeply, deeply affects their bodies, their understanding of their relationship, & their lives.*   

We're talking about men delusional and self-centered enough tht they literally DO NOT CARE whether or not the human being they're fucking is enjoying herself. I mean, at least so long as she PRETENDS to be, thts plenty enough for him.  .....And unfortunately, thts a description tht can be applied to many MAAAANY men, not just men whom rent women's bodies for their own personal enjoyment & power.

Nah, if these dudes are too lazy to put in the effort they should be single. If its too much too ask to show your partner that you appreciate them every once in a while, then chances are they are also not pulling their weight in other areas as well (cleaning, cooking, watching the kids etc).

We usually use my account on a streaming platform to watch movies and tv-shows  on. Then one day I got curious about how the stupid algorithms are set up to pick content for each of our profiles. For my husband who had basically just created the profile, it only picked action and war movies. All with aggressive looking, sweaty, bleeding, lone wolf type dirty men on the cover. And when I asked him about how he felt about the selection he couldn't see why I asked. But when I showed him how many different types of movies from a wide selection of genres was selected for me, after I used my profile for years, he was mortified. It was like he was expected to be this violent maniac with a very limited interest including lone wolf type men, violence and disaster, and he didn't even notice because that is the kind of expectations he actually meets everywhere more or less.

I don't remember exactly what content was picked for me when I first set up my profile but I remember having to actively look for content that wasn't only romance or sitcoms with almost the same types of characters. And actually I still have to look for that a lot when we are watching something on holidays. Anything that doesn't fit in a very narrow box I have to spent a fair amount of time looking for and it's a bit difficult getting out of the loop actually.  So much harder than it should be because we pay for the damn thing and should really be able to just watch what we want.

So someone is ordering algorithms that decide that stereotypical content is exactly what a man or a woman should like. Reinforcing gender stereotypes in a bad way.

I'm not saying the company made my husband into something he's not (yet) but it seems like they are working really hard to NOT make it easier to pick something else. And if we didn't share our experiences he might never have noticed what they expected of him. Like I keep falling into traps that feels like they are made just for me, when I'm shopping, planning trips, picking toys etc because the world around us expect me, in fact it insists on it, to want very specific things based solely on rigid gender stereotypes.

It sometimes really is too much work finding something outside of the box and I don't know why the men don't rebel more. I guess they are trapped same as the rest of us.",Free_Layer2116,t2_9i9ajp07e,25,0,reddit2

I think it might be a little more nuanced than ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt want to do more work in relationships‚Äù I‚Äôm sure that is absolutely the case for some men. This might be a bit ranty, but I‚Äôll try to be succinct.

I think there other important considerations that should be accounted for as well. Like the social expectations of who romance novels are for. I distinctly remember being labeled as gay when people found out that I read all of Twilight in high school. It was both an implicit and explicit message of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk about it‚Äù.

 I know Twilight might not be the epitome of good romance but it was popular enough at the time and it caught my interest. My favorite genre at the time was rom-com movies, but it was definitely filed under the, don‚Äôt talk about this tab of compartmentalization.

I‚Äôve also tried books by Hank Greene which I thought was more great story telling but it hit close to home in a couple of ways which brings me to my second and third thought. I‚Äôm curious how many women read books from a philosophically empathetic perspective versus how many men read books from a philosophically sympathetic perspective (kinda like 1st person vs 3rd, maybe it‚Äôs not a gendered thing at all). When I read any book, they are just characters. I do not put my self in the shoes of the protagonist, however my wife will. She will imagine her self as if she is the character. What this means for romance novels for me is it takes a lot for me to be invested in the characters based on how they are feeling instead of what they are doing.

And my third thought, men are often socialized to avoid big emotions such as sadness or to turn that sadness into anger, which is maybe why it‚Äôs okay to have some romance sprinkled in with the action. But it took some self-work for me to be okay with sitting in sadness, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the average person is looking for though when they sit down to read a book for fun. But what I think this might translate to is for many men when there is a theme of grief/loss within the relationship even if it is resolved, it leads to anger/frustration from reading. And at least from my experience, romance novels tend to be more okay with exploring sad themes.

TLDR; Toxic masculinity probably plays a significant role in what‚Äôs okay fro men to be interested in.

k09xae7,t1_k07xclb,2023-09-12 16:18:33,Feminism,"Why do you not want your partner to feel good? Do you not enjoy making her feel good? Do you initiate all of the time because you expect sex far more than she would naturally choose to have it and so you never give her a chance to initiate? If you are initiating sex because **you** want it and the ‚Äúentry fee‚Äù to get it is actually doing a thing that would make her feel good - aren‚Äôt you still mostly doing that for your benefit?  You‚Äôre doing that work because *you want sex* and being a decent human being means that the person you want sex from should actually enjoy it too. It sounds like really you just want a sex doll, in which case, can you actually complain if she‚Äôs ‚Äújust laying there‚Äù? 

If sex is just about orgasm to you then masturbate. But you can‚Äôt expect to use another person as a sex doll. You do have to treat them as a person who deserves to feel loved and appreciated by the person they are having sex with if that‚Äôs what they need to have sex. When you say that, what do you even mean? Do you need to dim the lights and draw a bath and light candles and scatter rose petals and read her poetry and give her a back massage for 45 minutes every single time you have sex, or does she just want you to treat her like a person and pay attention to her and her pleasure rather than just recreating how they do it in porn?

If they are just ‚Äúlaying there‚Äù - are they into it? If they are just laying there, maybe you need to ask if they want to be having sex. Or maybe they aren‚Äôt just laying there, and it‚Äôs possible to move from the bottom, and you just aren‚Äôt paying attention because you‚Äôre so invested in how much you deserve to cum (but not yet, I guess - is that a thing that *she* cares about, or is that a thing that *you* care about?) because you‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing the work‚Äù. 

A lot of the unseeen work that women do in sex is emotional labor. There can be so much ego in male sexuality that for some men, it seems like sex can become a thing that is not about us as individuals at all. Or we have to become cheerleaders or therapists because there‚Äôs so many men place all their self worth on sexual conquest/performance. 


Regardless either you need to check your own stuff about sex and relationships or you need to have an actual conversation and talk about each person‚Äôs wants, expectations, likes, etc during sex.  Because it doesn‚Äôt sound like either of you are enjoying it for different reasons.

Of course the quality/success of this kind of arc depends on the skill of the author, but that‚Äôs the basic idea, and it is a kind of female fantasy because many women rarely get that kind of acknowledgment/apology or commitment to growth from a male partner.

k088r0y,t1_k07sm4g,2023-09-12 07:50:52,Feminism,"It's a lot of things, I think.

For instance, straight women are the least likely to end up having an orgasm during sex of any group. Men not only often do not put effort in but are encouraged to believe they don't *have* to... That their dicks will just be magically enjoyable and they don't have to learn how to use it or anything.

Then there's potential biological stuffs. Women are much more likely to receive UTIs from sex, end up with more fluids they have to clean off themselves, etc. So there's often more non-sexy work involved for people who are receiving (also true of ""bottoms"" in gay parlance). There's also a load of extra cleanup required if butt stuff is involved, complications around periods, and that the receiver is more likely to incur injury / soreness in sensitive areas.

Then you add the pre-existing labor gap around housework and emotional labor, and you end up with a tired woman who's put a lot of effort cleaning up after her husband, having to do extra cleaning for this event, *and* she's far less likely to get that orgasmic endorphin rush from it? Yeah, might explain why she might be less eager even with a similar libido.

Societal expectations and shame around women's pleasure probably also play into this... Just look at the outrage around a song focused more on a woman's pleasure (WAP) when compared to another explicit song that happens to focus on the man's (CPR, for instance).

gv7k0aw,t1_gv7iob4,2021-04-20 15:10:23,Feminism,"As a scholar and activist, Federici is one of a cohort of thinkers who have, for decades, critiqued the way capitalist societies fail to acknowledge or support what she calls ‚Äúreproductive labor.‚Äù She uses this term not simply to refer to having children and raising them; it indicates all the work we do that is sustaining ‚Äî keeping ourselves and others around us well, fed, safe, clean, cared for, thriving. It‚Äôs weeding your garden or making breakfast or helping your elderly grandmother bathe ‚Äî work that you have to do over and over again, work that seems to erase itself. It is essential work that our economy tends not to acknowledge or compensate. This disregard for reproductive labor, Federici writes, is unjust and unsustainable.

These ideas weren‚Äôt exactly obscure before the pandemic. But mainstream feminism ‚Äî not to mention mainstream economics or politics ‚Äî has mostly ignored domestic labor. Instead, it has measured women‚Äôs empowerment by their presence and influence in the workplace, which is attained by outsourcing housework and child care to less economically advantaged women for a low wage. Even so, women remain mired in housework. It‚Äôs common now to hear the term ‚Äúthe second shift‚Äù (coined in 1989 by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild), which describes how the work of maintaining a home and caring for children still falls disproportionately to women, even if they have full-time jobs and pay for help. What‚Äôs more, people who are paid to do domestic labor or care work (like elder care or house cleaning) are, as a group, badly compensated and denied workplace protections or benefits. These jobs are held mostly by women of color and immigrants. The arrangement is hardly a success for women at large.

Women's unpaid work enables their male spouses to work full time or even over time and in general be more flexible when it comes to working hours or events. Without someone doing the 'invisible' work, society would not be able to function properly.

So, they saw me, I asked if they saw the bus, they said I missed it and I can go with a guy who is going into town for something so he'll drive me. I knew I shouldn't have but I went. The ride is about 20 minutes to half an hour. 10 min in, he tried to put his hand on my thigh, I moved it. He asked me all kinds of questions and put his hand back more tightly and wouldn't move it. I was so scared, I called my mom on my cell to tell her where I am like causally cause I didn't want to upset him. As soon as I we were near the town I asked him to stop and I'll get out and he wouldn't do it immediately, pretending to be concerned like how far I am from the city center...but I said it's okay just let me out so he finally did.

Countless catcalls when with other without family.

Went to movies by myself at age 17 in the top row, an older guy arrived halfway through, walked up, sat a few seats to my right, and watched me near constant the rest of the movie. He  then tried to follow me out of the building but I lost him. That was the first and last time I tried going to the movies on my own.

Gym teacher in middle school favored us girls always giving us jolly ranchers from his pocket. He peeked in a handful of times to get us moving when we were changing. Honestly, if he wasn‚Äôt fired for calling a kid fat, I always thought he‚Äôd be caught with a camera in the changing rooms or something. 

Had a guy try to get me in his car coming home from high school.

Tattoo artist when I was eighteen and getting my second tattoo got my money in advance for a second session. He added me on Snapchat and sent dick pics and asked constantly for me to come ‚Äòhang out‚Äô and drink alcohol and smoke with him. I didn‚Äôt respond and he got to keep my money.

Nothing really happened but a worker at my grocery store had this habit of watching me and only me when I was in that section. Like out of twenty people, he‚Äôd stare non-blinking and I felt in danger the whole time. Happened three times.

Also nothing really happened, but when waiting for a vaccine at a CVS, a guy stood there waiting and stared dead at me for several minutes and all I could think was the certainty that this guy wanted to hurt me. I‚Äôve never felt that about anyone before and haven‚Äôt since. But I‚Äôll never forget it.

And then just a handful of instances where guys have followed me, or tried to follow me home.

I went to a new park, really nice and natural place in the middle of a run-down urban area. Not a lot of foot or car traffic, nobody taking advantage of the park. I got there in the afternoon to prep for the next day and this guy was there, looked like he was passing through in his way somewhere. He stopped and talked to me, chitchat about what I was doing (he saw my gear) and then he asked for my number. I said no, I don‚Äôt give my number to strangers. He tried to argue that we exchanged names and weren‚Äôt strangers, and y‚Äôall. He was beyond angry that I wouldn‚Äôt give him my number. He was enraged, but he was very controlled. It was terrifying. He didn‚Äôt do anything, but I was afraid. 

I continued walking the park, looking for a place to set up my traps for the next day, and then I realized. I couldn‚Äôt see my vehicle, I didn‚Äôt know how long the trail was and how long it would take me to walk it, I didn‚Äôt know if he was going to follow me, and I didn‚Äôt have anything to defend myself with. I walked back to the car really fast, passing the guy again. When I got there, got in and he was as still be at me. I offered him a spare bottle of water, hoping to defuse it. (I should have just left, I know.) He gave me that look again, that controlled hatred, and showed me he had a bottle in his bag. I left. Y‚Äôall. I had to go back to that that park the next day. Good news is I never saw him again, but that may be the scariest guy I ever met.

I went and we sat down on the edge of the lake and we're talking just fine when he suddenly lunged over me and I fell backwards onto the sandy dirt, he was on top and tried pulling my shirt up and my pants down, his hands were like an octopus just everywhere. I was certain he was going to rape me when he forces his body in between my legs. That's when he fussed with getting his pants undone but his belt buckle was stuck and I was able to roll him off of me, got up and kicked him real hard then ran back to the party.

I'm a 61 year old woman who experienced most of these things prior to age 12.  The stalking I was older about 21 years old.  

One of the worst experiences was when I was about 19 years old.  I was walking in the downtown area of a small town and I passed up two guys that I had never seen before and I didn't know them. They laughed as I walked by.  I should have ignored them and walked on but I turned around and looked at them.  They stopped looked at me and what they said totally shocked me.  They basically said that I enjoyed playing with their thing in public and that really turned them on. They basically couldn't help it as I couldn't keep my hands off of that area.  I was a slutty type of woman. They were a lot more explicit.  I toned down the language so it could be written in here.  

That was the first time I was ever called a slut.  Sexual comments were often made to me (mocking or making fun of me because I was a virgin) but I was never called a slut.  I was horrified and shocked by the comments as at that time I still was a virgin and had never done what they said I did.  People heard these comments that these guys said very loudly and looked at me in disgust.  It appeared that they believed them.  I just got out of there quickly.

- Groped by the manager of a Texas Roadhouse, in front of my then-wife. Just... Guided us to our booth then shamelessly grabbed my ass as we were getting into it.

He was a little odd, not good looking, but I felt bad for him because the boys would pick on him sometimes. One day as I was tying my shoes to leave the school to walk home (15mins) and he stopped and starting talking to me and he walked home with me. I don't recall if he asked if he could or not. I really didn't want him to because I didn't want him to get the wrong idea. I also didn't want him to know WHERE I lived. At this age I was already cautious and thought about things like that. Mid-way home I said goodbye to him and said my house was ""just over there"" and cut through a short cut - it was a residential area, homes and families everywhere - BUT, he followed me!! I looked around and he had cut through the short cut too...when he was supposed to keep walking the original route.

All were while I was living alone with roommates I didn't know in a house and were one of two reasons I decided to move home

1) my first week moved in my roommate invited me to his room for drinks, tried to get me drunk (I drink slow), tried to coerce me into sex, got mad when I wasn't too drunk to say no, and got mad when I walked away. 

Same roommate would get drunk once a week and bang on my door at 3am trying to sleep with me. 

Once told me he can't accept my flirtation anymore because he had a girlfriend. That part was just funny

2) my roommate upstairs had severe rage issues. Once I parked my new car slightly wrong and he almost busted down my door screaming at me to move it at midnight.

Same roommate got mad the landlord made us pay to clean the roommates trash professionally and he stole the induction spirals from the stove and hid them so the landlord had to replace the stove.

3) I was showing my room to a dude who was gonna move in when I moved out. I had a week left. He told me I was always welcome to visit when he moved in, demanded my number, and then when I declined both he said its okay because he knew where I lived.

I had been sitting at a picnic table reading a book when i heard a group of teen-age boys screaming and yelling.  They were cussing up a storm and I happened to look at them. They were on a nearby bridge. Big Mistake.  One of them said, ""Yes, we are talking to you..  What he said next was every insult to woman.

Finally some of the people in the park threatened to call the police on them if they didn't stop yelling and screaming.  They cussed them out and then went on their way.  It was a group of guys who were surfers.

Once I got into my car, I started crying.  Couldn't understand why they were harassing me as I wasn't bothering them.  All I was doing was reading a book at a picnic table where there was a waterway to look at and they happened to see me from the bridge. All of these guys were probably between the age of 16-18.  The disrespect they showed me and others was appalling but this is commonplace.  When I was that age, my peers wouldn't have even bothered a plus size middle age woman..

**REALITY BLEEDS THROUGH**

Maybe it was the moment I realized our workplace was a runway, a stage set for a performance I never auditioned for. Like that time you suggested, nonchalantly, that my presence could be ""optimized"" if I considered ‚Äúmore professional"" footwear, this unspoken dress code.

And I, in my naivet√©, thought you were merely concerned about brand alignment, not realizing you were endorsing a marathon in stilettos. 

Maybe it was during those endless stairways, where my pain became a background track, the kind you don't even hear half the time. You said something about efficiency, about maximizing client engagement, while my soles screamed in dissent.

""Why must comfort yield to aesthetics?"" I mused, but the question hovered, unvoiced. And I laugh, a sound more bitter than amused, at the irony.

Maybe it was when you equated professionalism with endurance, suggesting that the measure of my commitment was directly proportional to the height of my heels. A ludicrous notion, yet there I was, bleeding for the cause.

Perhaps it was the silent judgment, the unspoken critique when I opted for comfort over couture, only to be met with eyes of disappointment. Maybe you thought I was compromising our brand, not understanding that I was preserving my sanity.

Maybe it was when you discussed ""team dynamics,"" and subtly hinted that my choices were a reflection of my dedication. As if my footwear was a barometer for my ambition. And I, foolishly, wondered if my worth was measured by my ability to conform, to endure silently.

Maybe it was when you couldn't see the absurdity, and I realized that our corporate ladder was less about climbing and more about conforming to an archaic standard of beauty and pain.

Maybe it was the day I saw my own blood as evidence of my compliance, the price of acceptance. 

It hit me, a revelation  in crimson. You and I, we are always going to navigate these corporate battlefields, wearing our scars as badges of honor. I am always going to question the cost of conformity, to challenge the norms that demand our sacrifice.

I've been waiting for a moment of clarity, for the courage to redefine success on my own terms. This world  is always going to push me, to test the limits of my endurance, until every illusion is shattered. Every step I've taken has been a dance with absurdity, a performance I'd never rehearsed but mastered in silence.

And even when aristocracy wore heels, which they started apparently partially because they were associated with masculinity via horseriding, everyone *knew* they were impractical. That was the *point*. It signaled to the world that you didnt have to do any working whatsoever. You could get away with wearing impractical clothing cause you were just that rich and important.

Apparently women started wearing heels as part of an effort to masculinize their outfits. But at a certain point, mens fashion got away from frivolity and started focusing more on practicality, whereas womens fashion leaned *more* into impracticality because... well, patriarchy, I suppose. Women were seen as stupid and emotional and impracticality still had dumb associations with attractiveness, so high heels stayed in womens fashion for a good while longer before phasing out then coming back later.

And as others have mentioned, even in the design of the heels you saw a divergeance for men and women.

The clothes drier died after just a few years, and it was cheaper to buy a new Maytag than it would have been to repair it.  The Maytag has worked flawlessly.  The clothes washer had numerous problems needing repair, and just a few months ago they replaced a part for free as part of a recall - apparently the part was a fire hazard and I had been in danger of a house fire for 10+ years without knowing it.  The refrigerator has a built in tapwater dispenser, and the filter needs to be replaced.  It's a tiny little water filter which probably costs less than a dollar to manufacture.  The price is $165.

Sure, there seems to be more emphasis on group work, but there's still tons of lecture, majority of teachers are still women *especially* at the lower levels, children as a whole are more likely to come from single-parent households (generally with a mother) so many boys don't really have a male role model, things like ""Girls Code"" camps, girls math things, and what have you are advertised in school, boys are being told that ""no means no,"" girls are taught to be wary of boys, the boys seem to be the ones who are all drugged up on amphetamines because they have \*insert mental problem here*, loads of places the majority of people on the honor roll are girls, the boys are the ones all getting detention, I could go on. 

There are people who are noticing that boys are getting shorted in school, but it's like they don't care or think it's great because it just means that girls are starting to do well, nevermind that the education system is better suited to girls in the first place.

The other thing is NEVER go in to any meeting that is close doored with a single person. If you are forced to do this then record the entire thing and explain to them it is to protect everyone involved. If they have nothing to hide then it won't be an issue. You may want to record any closed door meeting anyway so it doesn't become a he said she said, she said situation. You should never go in to a closed door meeting alone with the opposite sex, that is just asking for trouble down the line for all kinds of claims that things happened that didn't. Most companies have policies against this for that exact reason.

If your work place has gotten so bad that you feel you are always being attacked or whatever, then check the laws for your location and start audio recording your entire day on your phone or whatever. This will further allow you to document things if you ever need to go to a lawyer.

I am not a lawyer but if a work environment is hell I would consider recording my day regardless of the law and then allow the lawyer to figure out what to do with it when you are forced to sue.

No. You're wrong. You clearly dont understand socialism. Also, acting like the US court system is inherently anti-right-wing is a joke.

They outnumber men in cushy government and bureaucratic jobs, which they then use to further antagonize or punish men with policies created to benefit themselves.

Think about carpool lanes & who the beneficiaries are and who is harmed most by them.

They have wormed their way and spread their legs into all these government positions while men were busy building the civilization around them, then immediately began to oppress men. The majority of women have cushy indoor office jobs & usually work at companies where carpooling for example is feasible and frequently done - and they created these rules knowing that the vast majority of men do NOT work in cushy office jobs with other people from their geographical area - they do NOT usually have coworkers they can ride with and most men usually DO need to use some tools to perform their work (you know, useful work. real work)

So the entire carpooling system is a sham being propped up by these feminist whore bureaucrats and its yet ANOTHER way they have created a broken system that forces men to waste more of their lives waiting in traffic while they get to ride to their cushy office jobs with their friends where all they do is gossip and come up with stupid policies to make it look like they're actually doing something useful- and by doing so, freeing up more of THEIR days to enjoy doing stupid shit, while men are punished by being forced to waste THEIR time sitting in traffic. So it's not just taxation being set up to effectively transfer resources from the most productive members to the least productive members in society - consider the amount of time that has been lost by men who had to wait in traffic due to those stupid carpool lane policies. Ever since they entered the workforce in droves, they have done everything they could think of to make their lives easier, make mens lives harder, and give themselves an advantage at the expense of men - as if taking their money through taxes wasnt enough, theyre effectively now robbing them of their time, their youth, and their life for their own benefit- all this while also supporting mass migration into our country & essentially promoting and enabling a future attempt at genocide of the white male citizenry as a whole.

No matter how much they complain about this and say that its not true, they know that theyre lying and that i'm not, and i know that theyre lying and im not- and they know that i know that theyre lying, but theyre still going to choose to keep lying because they're all worthless whores and snakes.

- and this is all coming from one of the chaddest Chads there is-its not an incel view point, as much as they would love for it to be

Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. According to the 2019 annual report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 32033 rape cases were registered across the country, or an average of 88 cases daily,slightly lower than 2018 when 91 cases were registered daily.Of these, 30,165 rapes were committed by perpetrators known to the victim (94.2 % of cases), a high number similar to 2018. The share of victims who were minors or below 18 - the legal age of consent - stood at 15.4%, down from 27.8% in 2018. On the other hand, rapes by juveniles remained high in India with 3 minors being arrested for rape, assault and attempted violence on women and girls each day in 2019.India has been characterised as one of the ""countries with the lowest per capita rates of rape"".

I was a single father to 2 kids at the time. 

At our induction we had one of the directors give us ""a talk"". He told us that we were not a sexist organisation, and also that there were no such things as ""job hoppers"" (people that will leave a job as soon as a deduction of earnings was put in place to get another job)

My ex-wife was job hopping at the time. Just starting a new job, i decided against calling him out on it.

The organisation itself wasn't sexist, we didn't penalise men as such.

It is society that did. 

For a woman, it's very easy to get a new boyfriend to support you. Meaning that you have no income, and so don't have to pay anything. This is exactly what my ex did. Job hopped till she got a new fella, got pregnant very quickly to keep him, then he supported her as a stay at home mum. 

No income. Simples.

I'm not saying that it's impossible for a man to be supported and not earn any income, but it's very rare.

I used to actively request the male pwc cases when i worked there. Fucking loved it. One guy i remember had to move to the mainland to get away form her threats. I had info that she worked at a hotel, but she denied it when I got her on the phone. I took some advice from one of the senior guys that worked in teh same office, and called the employer. ""i know she works there. You know she works there. You'll send me 20% of her earnings or I'll send the inspectors round"". We didn't keep hold of the cases when we'd sorted them out, but I kept an eye on it, and we got at least 6 months of payments out of her.

My little brother's father had two kids from a previous marriage...and he was court ordered to pay child support. Which he did...when he was employed. The ex would use that money for things not related to the kids...which was bullshit. And he had no way of proving it beyond his son's testimony.

I don't have any solutions, but I wonder if setting up a trust or payee with required proof of receipts and such would be smarter alternatives. If a trust or payee where to be setup (even if court ordered), the holder (which would be the support paying parent) would be able to verify if the money was being used for the benefit of the child. It'd be harder to hide shit from the supporting parent. The way some of this shit works, it's a check the receiving parent can use carte blanche.

By your logic since it all goes into a giant pot and they also provide abortions it is absolutely true tax dollars fund abortions. Even if, it's fractional amounts of abortions are more likely by paying the other overhead or other services down. Not any accounting tricks like you portray.

I support them for two reasons, they do provide other services (you can't name anyone else who actually does anything they do at this same scale) and I'm alive because of their counseling (herp but they only provide abortions!). I actually have no real formed opinion on abortion, I just love single issue voters, on both sides, or people who get so wrapped up in this they constantly lie. Like you. 

You talk about facts and yet you could easily Google:

>In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, total revenue was¬†$1.3¬†billion: non-government health services revenue was¬†$305¬†million, government revenue (such as Medicaid reimbursements) was¬†$528¬†million, private contributions totaled¬†$392¬†million, and¬†$78¬†million¬†came from other operating revenue

Most? You are wrong. It's just nonsense. It's bias. I hope that doesn't hurt your feelings. 

Edit: honestly the stats don't back all your claims. They gave in one year 1 million pregnancy tests and performed 300k abortions. So one out of three *could have been convinced* to abort but we both know 300k isn't a subset of the 1mil. If it makes you feel better they also will provide services to men.

>Ummmmm..... this law applies *after* custody has been granted. Nobody pays child support before then, so I have no idea what you‚Äôre even talking about right now. 

Women don't like to date down.  Custody follows the economics of that decision.  If a woman specifically picks a mate who earns more than she does, it's more likely she'll scale back hours when a couple decides someone should.  This isn't rocket science.  

The courts are very comfortable with disposable men.  The system is literally built around this.  Laws like OP's only exist because they don't affect women very much.  Women get sympathy, men don't.

You're right.  It happens so often there are numerous places for women to abandon their children without consequence.  

What a wonderful thing it must be to decide one day you just don't want to be mommy anymore.  And to solve your problem you simply abandon your children at a safe surrender site kinda like taking trash to the dumpster.

Do you think those kids are better of with their parents, or with foster parents?",tothecatmobile,t2_9jm8v,1,0,reddit1
ec8wwvb,t1_ec8utl0,2018-12-21 12:50:35,MensRights,"Hmm.  You are unable to say mommy who wants to dump her child.

Why is that?

Is it because when you look at the situation without all the PC cover the reality is incomprehensible?  That a woman could actually not be the wonderful, loving, caring mommy that we want to think she is?

It's almost as if you are trying to sterilize the situation.  By changing the word from mommy to parent you are trying to detach the person from the atrocity.

Mommy would never abandon her child, but a negligent parent would... right?

Doing this makes it easier to swallow that not all mommies actually love their children?

Because we certainly don't want to soil the stereotype of the perfect mommy doting tirelessly over her children with infinite love and unending care.

If we allowed that to happen, what other ugly parts of women might start to show through?

So let's stop replacing words that we don't like because they hit a little too close to home, shall we?


>And if the choice is foster homes or negligent parent, which do you think is better for the child?

Mmmm, textbook extortion.

Mommy doesn't want the hassle of raising the child she created.  She can't be bothered with that right now, she has more important things to focus on than being a responsible mother.

Problem is, if she's caught murdering her infant then she risks a few years behind bars.  Can't go to jail over some untimely baby.

What if mommy could find somebody else to raise her child?  Yeah, that's the ticket!  But who wants to do that?

Hmm, adoption is a thing but it's so dang expensive!!! There's got to be a better way.

What if she could just drop off the excess baggage for free?  No questions, no responsibility, just poof!!! Baby be gone!!!

But... how can she convince the public to foot the bill for raising her child?

BINGO!!

Extortion!!!

By playing on the love that other people have, she can put them in a bind.

She can insinuate that if she is forced to raise the child it will have a horrible upbringing with very real possibility of neglect and abuse.

If you don't want that to happen, you better reach into your wallet and fund a better alternative!!

So mommy manipulates the system to get rid of her child with no repurcussion and the rest of us pay the bill.

Sucks for me, I'm out a few more tax dollars, but it's not the end of the world.

The true victim here is the innocent child.

Thanks mommy!

Do you think children with negligent parents are better off with their parents or with foster parents?

I'll even rephrase the question, so parents (And yes that includes the mother) aren't looking after their child, and what to give it up, what do you think should happen?",tothecatmobile,t2_9jm8v,1,0,reddit1
ec902tl,t1_ec8xdtg,2018-12-21 13:51:29,MensRights,">You're really trying everything to avoid the question aren't you?

I'm following your style of debate.  I initially asked:

>If you don't want children, why are you making them?

You avoided the question by responding about birth control.

If I don't want a sandwich, I'm not going to get out the bread or the deli meat or the mustard.  Likewise, if I don't want children I'm not going to have sex.

If I asked you why are you getting out the makings for a sandwich if you don't want a sandwich, and you replied something about the inadequacy of appetite suppressants, do you see how you didn't answer the question?  You were in the same neighborhood but you went to the wrong house.

You avoided the question that asks about taking responsibility for personal behavior.  Instead you went forward with the assumption that sex is inevitable and birth control is not completely effective.  

I wasn't asking about birth control.

Next I asked:

>How about we teach responsibile sex and responsible parenting?

To which you did stay on topic for a moment by completely ignoring the possibility that teaching children to be responsible will lead to better decisions and less unwanted children.

Instead you continued with your campaign to make it ok to abdicate your responsibility as a mother by laying the foundation for your upcoming extortion - take care of this baby or it will suffer.

But now, when you can't make a rebuttal to what I'm saying you try to complain about not answering questions?

Mmmhmm.

I have an answer to your question, and I am happily waiting to give it to you...

 ..after you recognize your attempt to accuse me of the very thing you have already done.

When you can say to me that you are wrong for holding me accountable for something that you do not hold yourself accountable for...

When you can recognize your double standard...

And when you can apologize to me for doing this...

I will gladly answer your question.

* https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/sarah-jeong-new-york-times-anti-white-racism.html

* Is the newest member of the New York Times editorial board, Sarah Jeong, a racist?

* From one perspective ‚Äî that commonly held by people outside the confines of the political left ‚Äî she obviously is. A series of tweets from 2013 to 2015 reveal a vicious hatred of an entire group of people based only on their skin color. If that sounds harsh, let‚Äôs review a few, shall we? ‚ÄúWhite men are bullshit,‚Äù is one. A succinct vent, at least. But notice she‚Äôs not in any way attacking specific white men for some particular failing, just all white men for, well, existing. Or this series of ruminations: ‚Äúhave you ever tried to figure out all the things that white people are allowed to do that aren‚Äôt cultural appropriation. there‚Äôs literally nothing. like skiing, maybe, and also golf. white people aren‚Äôt even allowed to have polo. did you know that. like don‚Äôt you just feel bad? why can‚Äôt we give white people a break. lacrosse isn‚Äôt for white people either. it must be so boring to be white.‚Äù Or this: ‚Äúbasically i‚Äôm just imagining waking up white every morning with a terrible existential dread that i have no culture.‚Äù I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm offended by this ‚Äî it‚Äôs even mildly amusing, if a little bonkers. (Has she read, say, any Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson?) But it does reveal a worldview in which white people ‚Äî all of them ‚Äî are cultural parasites and contemptibly dull.

* A little more disturbing is what you might call ‚Äúeliminationist‚Äù rhetoric ‚Äî language that wishes an entire race could be wiped off the face of the earth: ‚Äú#cancelwhitepeople.‚Äù Or: ‚ÄúWhite people have stopped breeding. you‚Äôll all go extinct soon. that was my plan all along.‚Äù One simple rule I have about describing groups of human beings is that I try not to use a term that equates them with animals. Jeong apparently has no problem doing so. Speaking of animals, here‚Äôs another gem: ‚ÄúDumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants.‚Äù Or you could describe an entire race as subhuman: ‚ÄúAre white people genetically disposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs this simple expression of the pleasure that comes with hatred: ‚Äúoh man it‚Äôs kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men.‚Äù I love that completely meretricious ‚Äúold‚Äù to demean them still further. And that actual feeling: joy at cruelty!

* ...

* But the alternative view ‚Äî that of today‚Äôs political left ‚Äî is that Jeong definitionally cannot be racist, because she‚Äôs both a woman and a racial minority. Racism against whites, in this neo-Marxist view, just ‚Äúisn‚Äôt a thing‚Äù ‚Äî just as misandry literally cannot exist at all.

* But the alternative view ‚Äî that of today‚Äôs political left ‚Äî is that Jeong definitionally cannot be racist, because she‚Äôs both a woman and a racial minority. Racism against whites, in this neo-Marxist view, just ‚Äúisn‚Äôt a thing‚Äù ‚Äî just as misandry literally cannot exist at all. And this is because, in this paradigm, racism has nothing to do with a person‚Äôs willingness to pre-judge people by the color of their skin, or to make broad, ugly generalizations about whole groups of people, based on hoary stereotypes. Rather, racism is entirely institutional and systemic, a function of power, and therefore it can only be expressed by the powerful ‚Äî i.e., primarily white, straight men. For a nonwhite female, like Sarah Jeong, it is simply impossible. In the religion of social constructionism, Jeong, by virtue of being an Asian woman, is one of the elect, incapable of the sin of racism or group prejudice.

 If there was an original tweet attacking her CNN and NYT would make sure everyone knows about it in an attempt to show her as a victim of bulling (a common feminist tactic) but they could not find one. In my opinion she IS a misandrist and a racist.

Again if a man had said the same thing she said about women he would not have a job anymore, (and possibly in jail) the double standard against men put in place by decades of successful feminist activism IS a Men's right issue.

Goalpost moving is often done to avoid tough questions.  Since you dodged the question (as if that would make it all go away), here's your answer:

The National Organization for Women is the largest feminist group on planet earth. Full stop.  Nearly every feminist agenda from #METOO to keeping lifetime alimony has been funded and fought for by the NOW.  

Because of the absolute reach of NOW, the ""No True Scotsman"" argument doesn't apply here. 

NOW has openly and proudly fought against the [recognition of parental alienation syndrome](https://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/the-national-organization-of-women-vs-parental-alienation-the-strange-parallel).  This is something that no only hurts the other parent, but also devastating consequences for the children.   And before the chumps try the next tactic of attacking the source, here it is [in their own fucking words](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/0dab915e/files/uploaded/California-NOW-Family-Court-Report-2002-2.pdf).

Fighting against one parent to alienate (and subsequently harm) the children from the other parent should be a titanium pillar of parental equality. Same with equality measures such as default 50/50 parenting.  [NOW is against that, too](http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2006/0802sacks.html). The red herring is that ""Well some men are baaaaad and should have custody.""  

Sure.  Some women are too.  But even if we stick to men, the courts take these factors into account.   If there is an anomaly, this is addressed. Default shared parenting simply means that the default position is for the child to have equal access to both parents.  

Who spent millions to fight this by influencing judges and politicians to fight or delay shared parenting initiaves (and is still doing so today)?

 Same organization.  

Next direct question to you.  If feminism was about equality, why would this group fight measures for equality? And why don't the feminist icons, supporters, and stalwarts denounce such efforts?  Hell,  even to look askance at the NOW would be a marked improvement for these feminists.  But not even that.  Either tacit approval or complicit silence.",NohoTwoPointOh,t2_2b1m4j1i,4,0,reddit3

I would say that it's because there isn't an equality issue there (maybe other than social stigmas, but thay often goes against both genders)

The problem isn't equal outcome, its equal opportunity. Everyone understands that a gender may naturally lean towards a certain job for whatever reason.. but in the instances of board rooms, it's fairly gender neutral in terms of the people who want to apply.

But I do agree in breaking down gender stereotypical norms. And everyone should be able to apply for whatever job they want without fear of gender being an obstacle

I mean, think of this. All jobs used to be men's jobs right.

yeah, women being immediately dismissed and there not being an investigation is obviously bad but prosecuting and arresting men because a woman has accused them of raping is just ridiculous (i know that you haven't said anything like that, i'm just pointing this out because most feminists want this to happen)

in israel, men still have to serve for the military longer than women. that's an issue. also, i agree with feminists on completely removing compulsory military service. it's basically taking somebody to another place and making them work against their will.

Child support is fair.

Child support **ISN'T** fair.. because the majority of people paying Child support are men. And, in many cases these men are forced to pay child support without having any legal right to spend time with the child / children they are paying for.

If a man can not pay child support he's called a dead beat and thrown in jail.  
If  a woman can not pay child support she is told she's the true victim here and given support.

Also the system is 100% broken when it will force a boy who was raped by a woman pedophile and went on to have the baby to pay back dated child support as soon as he turns 18.

Let that sink in for a second.. a boy whom was below the age of consent is raped by a woman and instead of getting justice for what happened he is told that the woman is the true victim and he needs to pay child support for a child he was too young to consent to having.

And yet you seem to think that Child support is 'Fair'

if you murder someone, it's murder no matter who you killed. their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc. doesn't matter. and this applies to every single violent crime and non-violent crime as well. people shouldn't be sentenced less or more depending on the identity of their victims. people should be sentenced based on the crime they commited but anti-discrimination laws make it so that people get sentenced more depending on the identity of their victims and that's absolutely unnececcary in my opinion and prevents equality.",OnThatSigmaGrindset,t2_dtxxqne0,3,0,reddit3

Once the projects wrapped up and we were delegated to work on other stuff, naturally we weren't talking as much. 

Months later I get a disturbing email from an internal investigations group that I was reported for code of conduct violations. I go into the meeting with them completely baffled what it could have been. They tell me who reported and why and drill me as if I'm a monster. After which I sent 55 pages of texts showing how consensual it was. 

Fast-forward to the follow up meeting, I'm completely exonerated once they saw how consensual it really was, and told me she was mad that we weren't talking as much and felt used. 

I was also advised to not do anything that'd appear retaliatory, meaning, I had to keep having ONE ON ONE weekly syncs with this person who tried really hard to get me fired. How fucking uncomfortable. 

A month later she quit. Good riddance!

I'm one of the few lucky ones where an honest investigations group did the right thing, but it could have easily gone the other way. Ever since then I stay clear of any conversation that could remotely be considered flirtatious, look at the floor if standing in an elevator alone with a woman, do my best to stay in my lane and minimize interactions with women, and pretend to be an inferior species just to get a paycheck.

One day they hired a new prep cook and i was assigned to train her with the recipes and shit. Started off well, she was nice, and i kept it strictly just about the training, no small talk at first. 

After a few days of training her, she began to attempt small talk and i went along with it moderately. Around the end of the week, i noticed she was having some trouble with the knife, so i taught her some knife cutting techniques to help her prep more efficiently. Along with this and for the final recipes she had to learn, i helped her out on how to do it, and how to use the knife the best way. After her training ended, she started to have attitudes with the rest of the kitchen staff, and i found out from someone there that she complained about me to the head chef that i was being ""creepy and too touchy"" with her. 

Really pissed me the fuck off, when i was just doing my job in training her and she knew that. The head chef came to me and told me that he found this weird and for me to be careful, so i asked him to not to put me with her again.

I was convinced she lied to me about being 28, she said I was mistaken, so I asked her age a few more time to see if she would slip up & she did, I think she told so many people so many lies, she didn't know what was real and what wasn't..

oh I agree nepotism is a problem, that is a pretty common thing enjoyed by both parties having their children and relatives given big jobs across seas, not uncommon. Does not really affect me or the country. However what does, and people like you never seem to mention is when Kushner can not pass security checks and gets nepotism 20 times that level, and billions from the Saudis, or Ivana and her Chinese millions and copyrights.  Not even remotely close on the same level of harmful nepotism. Thats cool and all you are not American and still giving your opinion, but what is a bigger deal, someone unqualified getting a job that has no affect on your country, OR multiple children getting top clearance jobs that have serious implications on your country and those some half wit shit stain kids cashing out with hundreds of millions of your countries money? answer this please?



> the idea that some random woman can show up with very vague claims

That was a character testimony, for a lifetime position job. She put her life  on the line to do that. She was not random, they went to school together.

The thing you are missing is Kavanagh did the same thing, but even worse.

I suggest calling it ‚Äúfake feminism‚Äù like I do.

Because in reality there are issues that only women face, and there are genuine, not-man-hating feminists tackling them.

But 99% of feminism, at least in the west, is not tackling inequality. It is simply trying to get middle-class women money and privileges that they don‚Äôt deserve, while masquerading as feminism.

>I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded. There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. 

I want you to read very carefully for a minute. If you think the administration is not aware of what this teacher is doing you are dead wrong. By allowing it to happen for as long as the teacher has been doing that class, the school is willfully indifferent. That is implicit support and why willfull indifference is a thing under Title IX.

You say you aren't worried about retaliation but here is the deal. There are many ways a school can fuck with you. The teacher has the backing of the administration if she is getting away with this. Be very careful. When it comes to Title IX issues (which this is) it is like dealing with HR at a company. **Rule of acquisition number 48: The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife.** I have personally been down this road and see some similar mistakes being made here.. This is a topic of study for this professor. If you think that a short email and a quick talk will fix her thinking this way about men you are wrong. She will just do it to another person the next semester at best.

If you are in the USA and *actually* want to do something the *worst* thing to do is tell the administration. It is a conflict of interest for the school to find it discriminates against men. They don't do it. Have you ever read a news story showing a school investigated a professor and found they discriminate against men?

If in the USA you can file federally through OCR for free. I can point you to the website for filing and Title IX legal manual for reference if you choose to. Violation of Title IX is a federal issue. Let the OCR's lawyers represent you rather than hoping the school does the right thing. OCR has binding resolutions that force the school to do substantially more. Once you file, your protection against retaliation goes way up. From what I have read the general idea is that the burden of proof is shifted to the school to show an adverse action was *not* retaliation, rather than you needing to prove it was.

If I was about to, or wanted to file federally the last thing I would do is tip the entire case into their lap by dumping evidence to higher ups hoping the people who support this teacher will suddenly do the right thing. Establishing patterns of discrimination via OCR is useful for people who come after you. Also, more cases like this going to OCR helps set the tone and inform OCR this is a real issue across the country that we care about. OCR looks for case patterns. If we don't file, we arent changing the narrative. Hit me up if you want me to point you in OCR's direction.

It sounds like the people you are talking about fall under the umbrella of women's rights activists, but feminism is pretty clear on its objectives, goals and definitions. If you don't confide with the concencus of Feminism then well you're not a feminist. Feminism is a subset of women's rights in the same way that MGTOW is a subset of men's rights. The difference being, is that feminism has become so large, in peoples perspective feminism has become synonymous with women's rights, and feminists work damn hard to keep it that way.",Vegetable_Ad6969,t2_9xwsz4r4,4,0,reddit1
