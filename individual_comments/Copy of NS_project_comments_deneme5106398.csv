It gets stickier with employment or anything that is tied to surviving/thriving, so it's great that this is being studied.  That they respond with anger, for narcissists, makes sense.  That can lead to actions which violate policies as well, depending on their self control.  Either they'll do petty, messy things, or maybe they'll hold back and it festers until they do something more explosive.  It's nicer when things don't come to that, but bullies are bullies.

They found a very small (r = .15) relationship with anger, but a nonsignificant and almost zero (r = .03) relationship with behavior. Although one can get good fit to a model where a variable has essentially a zero correlation to something down the causal chain, it is not very strong evidence considering the size of the correlations, not to mention the cross-sectional design. This paper shows that people who score high on narcissism might be inclined to experience more anger (not a trivial finding). The anger finding is consistent with [Penney & Spector 2002](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2389.00199) who found that narcissistic personality is related to anger (as a trait) and to interpersonal counterproductive work behavior.",Readypsyc,t2_8k3o7hd8,1,0,reddit3

I saw your comment and it was like a warm person was gently patting me on the back. I know that's not necessarily healthy and I'm not fond of parasocial relationships on the internet but just thought you should know. 

What I've described happening to me at several facilities has been called toxic by others to whom I describe the conditions. I certainly realize I have bias and cannot accurately assess the situation but there have been more than a few occasions at work where I have literally wondered if I'm crazy, usually when called into a manager's office and they begin by saying ""remember when you were counseled about x y or z?"" And I truly have no memory of being counseled, at any time, about anything.

 I found out over the last few years that this is gaslighting, and although the term is overused it accurately describes how at least three managers I've dealt with operate. The last time it happened  I called her on it and had my union rep with me at the meeting. She was trying to write me up for peeing, in the bathroom, while not on break. 

I'm not even kidding. I was going to get a written warning that day, over peeing, in the bathroom, at work. I told her that I am not going to stop going to the bathroom when I have to go to the bathroom and this has nothing whatsoever to do with whatever she supposedly talked to me about and I am taking this up the chain to a grievance and will fight it until they figure out how to fire me some other way. 

I then promptly got another job. 

This had me feeling like my unmitigated rage was *my fault* because I must have a cluster b personality disorder. I'm literally almost crying writing this all out.

The ethical leadership condition was developed by [Bhal and Dadhich (2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-22734-008). The condition read as follows:

*Consider the following individual as your direct supervisor in the workplace:*

*You are working with your supervisor. Your supervisor is a person who can be trusted, makes fair and balanced decisions, and conducts personal life in an ethical manner. Your supervisor defines success not just by results but also by emphasizing the process. Your supervisor also takes the opinions of others before making any decision. Your supervisor listens to employees and disciplines those who violate ethical standards. Your supervisor sets an example of how to do things the right way in terms of ethics. Your supervisor has the best interest of employees in mind and discusses business ethics and values with employees.*

The non-ethical leadership condition read as follows:

*Consider the following individual as your direct supervisor in the workplace:*

*You are working with your supervisor. Your supervisor is a person who cannot be trusted, does not make fair and balanced decisions, and does not conduct personal life in an ethical manner. Your supervisor defines success only in terms of results without any concern for how the results are achieved. Your supervisor also does not take into account the opinions of others before making decisions. Your supervisor does not listen to employees and does not discipline those who violate ethical standards. Your supervisor does not care about employees and never talks about business ethics or values with employees.*

The construct of ethical leadership is not only based on moral/ethical principles, but overtly promoting normative communally beneficial ideals and establishing guidelines for acceptable behavior (Bedi et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2005).

jb1bfbl,t1_jb0wmm2,2023-03-05 18:00:46,science,"This thread is about the self-righteous vs. the self-interested. Often those who are forced to play by the rules will complain bitterly when someone else appears not to be held to the same standards, particularly if they are perceived to be getting ahead, having more, or receiving recognition.

What exactly those standards are (ie.  what is ethical?) actually varies by the group that you are in.

Essentially the fact that you're asking for a universal principal indicates you are looking for a metric you can self-measure against, which is not how this works. Therein lies the fallacy. You can only know by asking the person making the assertion in real-time; at worst, they want you to beg for their approval, which they will grant conditionally day-to-day according to how slighted they feel. At best, it's a type of group-think, or decision by committee. You would periodically conduct your own 1:1 to gather 360 feedback, and modulate your behavior according to the lowest denominator.

The power in that type of organization stems from the idea that some individual or group of individuals is ethically infallible, and a perfectly honorable and fair judge. Or that a system is perfectly fair, such that an imperfect judge would be sufficiently mitigated.

Both systems are equally exploitable, and power rests in the hands of either: the person who defines the principles, or the person who judges the ethical behavior.

If you meant to ask about the traits of NPD, this is well-documented, but I'd advise you to seek a professional diagnosis, not an armchair review by the Internet.

Particularly because the term has become a pejorative label, a convenient political device, and those who attribute overwhelming negativity to it have often experienced an outsized trauma in their life, which has colored the term's most common uses in ways that are highly subjective; meaning it varies by person you ask.",JohnBuxly3487,t2_5uxfzft9,1,0,reddit3

jb0lk20,t1_jazdvxa,2023-03-05 14:56:30,science,"Both views are equally correct. The study only focuses on how ethical leadership interferes with their counteractive strategies because it pertains more to the group setting and handling personnel problems.

What drives their strategies is a deeper, analytical subject, which I touched on because it is relevant in the one-on-one personal relationship setting, where shame is often revealed in the narcissist's vulnerable moments. In the group setting of a workplace, the narcissist will act differently, withdrawing to avoid conflict and regulate their anger and shame. Not only do they fear consequences of their anger but narcissists are also more sensitive to public perception than individual perceptions.  From the article:

>When employees experience anger due to workplace circumstances, it can lead to withdrawal behaviors that can affect their peers and overall productivity. Withdrawal can look like more absences, longer breaks, or a slowdown in responsiveness. This response is known as an “avoidant” anger response and is more common in the workplace than an “approach” response to anger. If individuals use the approach response, they are more likely to get into conflicts bringing their behavior to the attention of leadership and leaving them vulnerable to discipline or termination. Research has found that when narcissists and those with narcissistic personality traits perceive self-threats, they respond by psychologically avoiding or distancing themselves, hoping to reduce the resulting emotional impact.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,3,0,reddit3

The pathology develops in childhood, even if childhood abuse isnt the only cause. They are shame-sensitive in all cases. If it appears otherwise, then it is because there are two known facets of narcissism- the grandiosity facet and the vulnerability facet. And, each case weights those two strategies differently. This excerpt from the study clarifies:

>The grandiosity facet of narcissism is defined through enhanced self-esteem, extreme perceptions of self-importance, and entitlement, whereas the vulnerability facet of narcissism is commonly studied through the lens of ego threat, hypersensitivity to criticism, and avoidant self-regulatory tendencies (Miller et al., 2011).

The respondent can't be trusted to predict how they would in future respond to an actual ethnical dilemma if they don't even have a foundation in ethics--both because written scenarios don't accurately capture reality (one of the big reasons history is so hard), and because predicting your behaviors is a function of self-knowledge and forethought which a person without a background in ethics is unlikely to have performed.

I’m sure we can all relate to having had, at one point, a narcissist in our friend group who, after enduring their abuse, were outed from the group.

It’s a fairly well documented phenomenon that, in the early stages of their life, the narcissist will attract a lot of friends and short-term relationships. But, as they get older, that number dwindles, either from their own withdrawl, or by forceful expulsion of the group. The end result being that, the older the narcissist gets, the less friends they have and the more they are surrounded by those who are either too weak (either by constitution or life circumstances - re: a wife, husband, children) to stand up to them, those who enable them, or those who themselves are manipulating them. Narcissists, by their very nature, and the nature of non narcissists, build for themselves a life of illusion and lie - of deception, of having no real friends. They truly live live in a world wherein the power struggle is everything, ala Foucault, et. Al. 

It’s incredibly, incredibly destructive. In the past when Kings and Queens were the norm a single narcissist with too much power could single handedly destroy an entire society.

jb55eco,t1_jb1fybd,2023-03-06 14:49:40,science,"First, a narcissist at work will also be an even greater narcissist at home. So, instead of focusing on work specific clues, you should consider the clues about how you treat a partner at home. If you have none, then look at how you treat friends or other members of the public.

The problem with self-diagnosis of narcissism is subjectivity, even if you are educated about narcissism. Not knowing you at all, we cannot say if you are narcissistic, either. So, the advice given by the previous commenter- to seek a professional diagnosis- is good advice. Even if it doesnt give you the fast and easy answer you were looking for, it is the *right* answer. 

Nearly every narcissist will subjectively deny the known traits, even if their behavior meets the definition. This is because anything which makes a narcissist look bad will result in their denial. The only known trait which you might be able to see in yourself objectively is episodic anger when *you think* someone has insulted you. But you see, this is exactly where subjectivity become the problem. You can easily defend that you should be angry when insulted and how sensitive should one be to insults- an entirely subjective matter. 

Probably the best clue is the opinion of people who know you. A narcissist isn't likely to ask friends to give them a negative review but if you dare, then take it as a strong clue that you need further professional diagnosis if your friends all report that you are sensitive to criticism and react strongly with anger. Even your friends might miss other clues. 

Professionals are educated and trained at fitting the observable clues to the diagnostic criteria. While anyone can look up the diagnostic criteria, it is tricky to know that each sign is or isnt due to another issue. If you had an electrical problem with your car's electronics, you would be equally well advised not to try to start tracking it down with a meter and no knowledge other than how to connect the battery.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,1,0,reddit3

jayy194,t1_jaytarq,2023-03-05 03:39:46,science,"Narcissism is about a lot more than attention seeking. That is their ideal but adverse circumstances of any kind typically result in avoidant anger:

>The grandiosity facet of narcissism is defined through enhanced self-esteem, extreme perceptions of self-importance, and entitlement, whereas the vulnerability facet of narcissism is commonly studied through the lens of ego threat, hypersensitivity to criticism, and **avoidant self-regulatory tendencies** (Miller et al., 2011). 

The phrase in bold describes the withdrawal, in clinical terms. Narcissists withdraw when necessary to regulate the emotional impact of perceived threats. The study is making the distinction between the *avoidant angry scenario* and the *approaching angry scenario*. Healthy personalities will use the approaching style and direct anger with the intent to resolve conflict. 

As for the nature of the insults and their subsequent anger, this passage from the study describes their reason for reacting:

>Anger is an emotion that involves feelings of indignation and occurs when one perceives wrongdoing by another person (Gibson & Callister, 2010; Haidt, 2003). Because narcissists view behaviors that impede their goals as a wrongdoing (Konrath, Bushman, & Campbell, 2006), **ethical leaders, which elevate the group and morality over self-gain, are likely to be viewed as infringing upon the narcissist's self-goals.**

That's because narcissistic strategies are quite unethical- deceit, manipulation, callousness. It isnt about not getting a raise.

Many clinicians will use the circumplex by locating a position for the patient *within the wheel,* to indicate a healthy balance of traits. Designing a list of traits and arranging them on a circular chart helps clinicians better understand how personalities found on opposing positions of the wheel interact and/or conflict.

What is most interesting is that narcissists will seek out those who appear to them initially as having traits from the opposite side of the circumplex, indicating an agreeable and submissive personality that is easily exploited. To those who are so exploitable, the consequences are very destructive to the personality of the abused victim. For those who arent exploitable, there is more conflict but the victim can emerge with their personalities more or less intact, if they handle the conflict wisely. 

To locate the positions of each: psychopathy, machiavellianism and narcissism on the circumplex, I can refer you to [this source](https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~dpaulhus/research/CIRCUMPLEX/chapters/Jones&Paulhus_2011_SITAR_%20chapter.pdf) . You can scroll down to fig. 15.1  where each is represented by letters P,M,N.

For example consider a certain former US President saying he was the greatest person ever the smartest person ever the best at everything. This was an attempt to manipulate people and yes it worked on some people but it was also quite obvious to many others that it was a shallow attempt at manipulation. 

Concealing emotions is not very easy for such people because they tend to react negatively to any kind of negative feedback they throw tantrums. So rather than concealing emotions they tend to express negative emotions when they get upset. 

What you are thinking of is actually more properly machiavellianism. This is a related but distinct dark trait. People high in machiavellianism are excellent at manipulating other people can conceal emotions as needed and generally are quite subtle and duplicitous. 

But that is a very different story than narcissism.

Do you think we pick Americans at random for clinical trials? Of course not. What's important is random *assignment*. That's the part that allows you to isolate the effect of the treatment. It creates pre-treatment groups that are as similar as possible by distributing known and unknown biases equally. Sampling method affects the *generalizability* of your results.

If you want to make a claim about American political beliefs, then you need a sample that is representative of Americans. You might randomize phone numbers or addresses to get a reasonably representative sample. You could also use stratification to replace much of the randomization.

If you want to make a claim about the effect of Flozac™ on the human liver, you do not need a random sample. Most human livers are quite similar, relatively speaking, so as long as your sample has good range in terms of sex, age, and weight, you're good to go.

jb6ye3h,t1_jb6nr1i,2023-03-06 22:09:41,science,"The best way to understand what happens in a comprehensive form is for me to explain that shame-counteracting strategies of the narcissist come in 2 facets: the grandiosity facet and the vulnerability facet. The latter includes the more harmful behaviors of blame-shifting, gaslighting, lies, manipulations, devaluations, insults, criticisms, rejections, etc. While grandiosity is constructive, the strategies of the vulnerability facet are destructive to relating personalities.

As I see it, there are two main effects of exposure: 

Depression.  

1) Blame-shifting is an externalizing strategy to counteract the shame they feel.  Blame shifted to the victim means they will internalize what the narcissist is externalizing. Depression is largely the result of a thought pattern which unrealistically blames oneself for disappointments caused by both external and internal factors. That is what makes depression an internalizing disorder. 2) Devaluations, criticism, insults, and rejections serve the narcissist's purpose for counteracting shame by self-suggesting a favorable comparison of themselves to their abuse victim. This always aggravates the worthless/hopeless symptoms which originate from the self-blame of depression. 

Confusion. 

Whether it seems so or not, each person has their own conception of reality and whether some of those realities reflect actual reality or not is less important than being able to own and maintain a chosen conception of reality.  The problem with exposure to abuse is that gaslighting, lies, manipulations and even blame-shifting leave us confused about the validity of what was our reality, prior to the deceptions, as well as whether the imposed reality is to be trusted. Chronic exposure to this type of abuse leaves us feeling confused, directionless, empty and vulnerable. These effects last a long time after exposure as well, leaving the victim confused about whether or not their abuser was such a bad person, even while consciously knowing they were abused. Those who are able to survive with their personality intact are the ones who hold firm to their chosen reality, in part because that also defeats the narcissist's externalization of blame to the victim; therefore, largely defeating the depressive effects as well.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,1,0,reddit3

Random sampling is useful, but to say that an RCT *must* have random sampling is simply incorrect; what it must have is random assignment.

[Berger 2002](https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/jmasm/vol1/iss1/11/): ""One salient feature of randomized clinical trials is that patients are randomly allocated to treatment groups, but not randomly sampled from any target population. Without random sampling parametric analyses are inexact, yet they are still often used in clinical trials.""

[Elwood 1982](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7082529/): ""Ideally, a complete sampling frame should be constructed, that is, a list of every available subject who fulfils the criteria relevant to the trial. In practice this is usually unattainable in clinical research, and a sampling frame may have to be limited to, say, all the patients who attended a particular clinic""

Random sampling is important for generalizability and even expected in some fields. But it's not what the ""R"" in ""RCT"" stands for, and it's not a defining feature of RCTs. Your claim that Study 1 is not an RCT is simply incorrect.",potatoaster,t2_640xi,1,0,reddit3

Leaders behaving badly: The relationship between narcissism and unethical leadership

Carrie A Blair, Katherine Helland, Bill Walton

Leadership & Organization Development Journal 38 (2), 333-346, 2017

Purpose

Narcissism is often cited as a construct that is likely related to unethical leadership. Still, only a handful of empirical studies have examined the relationship between narcissism and workgroup outcomes, and practically none have linked narcissism to leader behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to use narcissism scores to predict behaviors associated with unethical leadership in a controlled setting.

Design/methodology/approach

Participants completed a measure of narcissistic personality. Participants also completed an administrative assessment center (AC). Qualitative analysis was used to code the behaviors in the AC into dimensions associated with unethical leader behavior.

Findings

Narcissism was related to the display of unethical behaviors during the AC. Scores on the narcissism scale correlated positively with behaviors associated with unethical leadership, including one-way communication, control of power, insensitivity to others, an unrealistic assessment of the environment, manipulative communication, and pseudo-transformational behaviors.


Second, it is important to distinguish between any leader and ethical leadership. You seem to confuse these very different concepts, and assume that any one described as a leader will be an ethical leader. No. That is the entire point of the ethical leadership literature--to examine a subset of leaders who demonstrate particularly ethical leadership as opposed to any kind of leadership which may include leaders high in narcissism or other dark traits.

You are correct noting that narcissism and other traits do predict leadership emergence, though not leader effectiveness, under some conditions, considering the effect size is not that large. For Example here is a meta-analysis: 


Narcissism and leadership: A meta‐analytic review of linear and nonlinear relationships

Emily Grijalva, Peter D Harms, Daniel A Newman, Blaine H Gaddis, R Chris Fraley

Personnel Psychology 68 (1), 1-47, 2015

Past empirical studies relating narcissism to leadership have offered mixed results. This study integrates prior research findings via meta‐analysis to make 4 contributions to theory on narcissism and leadership, by (a) distinguishing between leadership emergence and leadership effectiveness, to reveal that narcissism displays a positive relationship with leadership emergence, but no relationship with leadership effectiveness; (b) showing narcissism's positive effect on leadership emergence can be explained by leader extraversion; (c) demonstrating that whereas observer‐reported leadership effectiveness ratings (e.g., supervisor‐report, subordinate‐report, and peer‐report) are not related to narcissism, self‐reported leadership effectiveness ratings are positively related to narcissism; and (d) illustrating that the nil linear relationship between narcissism and leadership effectiveness masks an underlying curvilinear trend, advancing the idea that there exists an optimal, midrange level of leader narcissism.


However, this is measuring leadership in general and not ethical leadership specifically. As the article I mentioned above describes, when people hire in narcissism become leaders they tend to act in an ethical way rather than ethical ways. 

Just because some people high in narcissism can become leaders does not mean that ethical leaders are narcissistic and in fact the data suggest the opposite.",TargaryenPenguin,t2_2pr84s5a,1,0,reddit3

Yes; and allowing an employee who harms the work and well-being of others to continue working at the institution is counter to that.

> HR is not your friend. HR is there to protect the company.

It's the duty of all employees to benefit, or at least not harm, the company; otherwise, from the company's perspective, they shouldn't work there. Though it might still make sense from the individual's viewpoint; sometimes you just really need that money and can't afford to try to change jobs..

Protecting the employees though is, usually, benefiting the company. This is why sometimes outside investors ruin the culture and environment of the company, as they tend to demand short-term profits over long-term well-being. That tends to slip to unethical leadership style.

> If the company decides that the ""problem"" employee is more valuable (and narcissists are adept at navigating institutional power to fulfill their narcissistic supply) then the person complaining will be managed out.

In a book called ""Hiring for Attitude"", the author(s) call these people ""Talented Terrors"". Superficially, it _seems_ that they make up for their negative traits with high performance, but typically if you actually look at their total impact, it's far into the negative side.

It's a type of a problem hire that ordinary hiring processes are bad at spotting. These sort of people tend to cruise through recruiting processes due to their skill in convincing people and their technical capabilities.

But in truth they turn out to be a burden, and I do agree that they are a burden that is hard to get rid of. It would be ideal to not hire them to begin with, as sometimes a too passive or careful management fails to properly spot how problematic they are and act accordingly.

> I'm happy for you that you have a workplace you have such trust in. Your situation is not the rule for most, perhaos even the vast majority of workers.

No I 100% agree that most employees don't work in as good conditions and with as good culture as they would deserve.

ibld31l,t3_v7mf5w,2022-06-08 10:32:55,science,"Individuals who contract COVID‐19 often experience memory, attention, and concentration problems, even after recovering from the initial illness. A new study from the University of Waterloo shows individuals who had contracted CCOVID‐19 reported significantly more cognitive failures at work.

“COVID-19 is going to be an ongoing part of life, at least for the foreseeable future,” said James Beck, an associate professor in Waterloo’s Psychology department. “It is now common for people to catch COVID-19, recover, and then return to work. Yet, in our study, people who had contracted COVID-19 reported more difficulties at work, relative to people who had never caught COVID.”

Beck and his graduate student, Arden Flow, collected data from a sample of 94 full-time working adults who either had or had not contracted COVID‐19 at least one month prior to the study. Both groups were matched on key demographic characteristics. 

“Relative to the group who had never had COVID-19, the group who had contracted COVID-19 reported more cognitive failures at work, which are defined as problems with memory, attention, and action,” Beck said. 

A second finding of the work is that cognitive failures were associated with decreased self-ratings of job performance, as well as increased intentions to voluntarily leave one’s current job.

In total there were...I think 1900 uses of force and 94 uses of a firearm, from one particular city.

The other city had 3900 uses of force but did not record firearm use.

The millions of calls is useful to see rates of use of force. But that's it, and I'd separate from many of the other conclusions.

The total number of calls is significant, but when most of the conclusions are built from two dissimilar bodies of information (one city was primarily white/black, one was primarily hispanic/white) I'm starting to see that some conclusions of comparison are mostly comparisons between these two cities.

Strangely worded but, if I'm understanding correctly, white officers are 55-75% more likely to use force and 400% more likely to fire their weapon than minority officers when responding to calls in minority neighborhoods.

That seems like a pretty significant finding, though not terribly surprising. Multiple studies have shown the implicit bias people have when viewing minorities.

The police force he was on would recruit people from all over the UK and university graduates on fast track promotion programmes would spend some time in his squad as acting sergeants - which was typically looking for robbery suspects with outstanding warrants against them. 

He also had black colleagues and trusted pretty much everyone he worked with, except for the white people from small towns. They didn't understand how other cultures would act. 

Things my dad would take as 'that's just how he talks' were taken by these people as the person being disrespectful and combative. He also noticed black suspects would be really mean and try to get physical reactions from his black colleagues. 

He found himself diffusing a massive amount of situations that would've escalated way too much if he wasn't there. He had no interest in becoming a sergeant, but he ended up being acting sergeant for a while just to keep these people off of his team.

>In the original study, published on 22 July in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Maryland compiled a list of more than 900 fatal U.S. police shootings in 2015 using crowdsourced databases from The Washington Post and The Guardian. Then, they asked police departments for information about the race of the officers responsible for the shootings. They found black police were more likely to kill black civilians than white civilians. However, the same held true for white and Hispanic officers: Each group of police was likelier to shoot civilians of their own race. That's likely true, the researchers say, because police tend to be drawn from the communities they work in and are thus more likely to have deadly encounters with civilians of the same race.

You can find tons of **recent** videos with gangs of black people beating random white people.  

**Yet incredibly rare with the situations reversed,** gangs of whites beating up random black people in the middle of a parking lot or a park in broad daylight. How many times can you find a video of that happening in 2021?  It's probably none actually.

But the stories or videos of black on white violence won't even make the local news, let alone get turned into media sensations.

It's so rare when a gang of white people attack a black person that when it happened in 2020 it stayed national news for 2 years as it goes through the courts.

hyugup5,t3_t3hu50,2022-02-28 23:51:38,science,"Just a slightly related side notes and stories about working with police:

I was a bouncer/ security at a club in my younger years. I was also a volunteer firefighter. I trained in martial arts with several cops both before and after then getting onto the force. Worked with some really wonderful, patient police officers.

But, I met 4 of the worst humans beings I’ve ever been associated with and 3 of them later became police officers.

A 4th guy was close, but got bounced after lying to police after pulling a gun in a car altercation before he got through the academy. His mistake was admitting he lied, or he would probably be a cop now.

All of these guys bragged a lot about beating people down- Both as bouncers and later as cops. 

Two bragged about beating a homeless man who was stealing change from a parking box where you drop cash to park. They weren’t even cops yet and it wasn’t their parking box. Just doing their part I guess…

One bragged about beating a suspect so bad him and his police buddies had to rotate in and out to catch their breath during the beating. Apparently the suspect was crippled permanently, blinded, and partially paralyzed, had brain damage, crushed skull and they got off free by saying he got their gun. (Apparently he did reach for it)… 

My first day as a bouncer I had to physically pull one of these guys off an unconscious drunk dude that he had pinned down in a choke hold. He (bouncer, later a cop) just kept choking and no one did anything to stop him. He wouldn’t let go…  

At the time (no idea how it works today) cops would take a personality profile to apply for the job. I took same test. The test would ask racially sensitive questions like:

 “you see three Hispanic teens walking down the road where there has been recent car prowling. Give your opinion “A: they are defiantly up to no good” or “B: likely up to no good, C: neutral, D: probably not causing trouble, E: good kids out for a walk…

The correct answer was based on how successful police leadership responded anonymously. No grey areas. If existing cops were racist, then the correct and best answer for a new cop is also racist.  I passed but marginally the first time. I took it again and answered “strongly agree” to every answer the second time and got a 90%+.

With that said you are subconsciously making choices based of what you believe to be a threat when in actuality that's just how things work over there. I've grow up in both scenarios so I've seen both sides on how things work. When I was broke in a broke negiborhood no one targeted me, because I wasn't outside my element. When I went to a negiborhood that was prodominatly white with a small community I stuck out like a soar thumb, and I'd always be targeted, because I was suspicious. A young kid with a house, and nice cars that dresses like he's in the projects. Yep, that's me.

hyu9w6n,t1_hysgnr4,2022-02-28 22:59:19,science,"> Multiple studies have shown the implicit bias people have when viewing minorities.

Interestingly, it looks like in their dataset responding to a call in a majority-different-race-than-you area increased use of force rates for *both* black and white officers ([pdf](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/uof-1.pdf)):  
> ""Of particular interest is the analysis in black neighborhoods, where we flag 14 percent of white officers (65/474) and only 4 percent of black officers (10/274) as using too much force relative to the null distribution....Finally, we note
that this procedure flags roughly equal proportions of black and white officers in the right tail of the use of force distribution in white neighborhoods, at 9 and 11 percent, respectively.""

If I'm reading that correctly, we get 4 results for the fraction of police using too much force:  
 * White cop, white beat:  11%  
 * White cop, black beat:  14%  (+3% higher)  
 * Black cop, black beat:  4%  
 * Black cop, white beat:  9% (+5% higher)  

i.e., there appear to be two major problems driving police violence in these two cities:  
 * (1)  Their white cops are ~2x as likely to use too much force (against everyone) as their black cops.  
 * (2)  All their cops are ~1.5x as likely to use too much force in a different-race neighborhood.  

I'm far from knowledgeable in this area, but it seems to me this is reasonable evidence for (a) community policing to form familiarity and relationships between officers and the citizens on their beats, and (b) better screening for violent tendencies among officers, especially their white officers.

The white officers in these cities are more likely to use excessive force against *everyone*, suggesting there may be a race-specific culture problem in these police departments.  Given the known efforts of far-right militia and white supremacist groups to infiltrate US law enforcement ([link](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/27/white-supremacists-militias-infiltrate-us-police-report)), I can't help but wonder if this PD's problem with excessive force from white officers is indicative of infiltration.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit1

You can find tons of **recent** videos with gangs of black people beating random white people.  

**Yet incredibly rare with the situations reversed,** gangs of whites beating up random black people in the middle of a parking lot or a park in broad daylight. How many times can you find a video or report of that happening in 2021?  It's probably none actually.

But the stories or videos of black on white violence won't even make the local news, let alone get turned into media sensations.

It's so rare when a gang of white people attack a black person that when it happened in 2020 it stayed national news for 2 years as it goes through the courts.

I think we can both agree that white cop violence on minorities is disproportionate and unjust.

But *if* minorities are more violent towards white cops, then all the additional training and racist filters in the world won't get the violence numbers down to social parity.

*If* minorities are more violent towards white cops, and since white cops seem to be more violent towards minorities, maybe the answer is something like having minority-majority local policing forces for those neighborhoods.

Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+(some estimates as high as 20,000) people killed since 2001.

When African American officers respond, the suspect is agitated but feels relatively safe (due to his implicit bias) and can be calmed down.

When officers respond who the suspect perceives as ""white"", his implicit bias kicks in, he becomes erratic, starts shouting that the police target him because of his race and they just want to shoot him. He can't be calmed down, charges at the officers and ends up being shot.

In this scenario, I don't see how the suspect's bias is the officers' responsibility.

It may not be extensible to every part of the country, but I see little reason to believe these two cities aren't comparable to other urban areas.

Case studies are valid forms of research - just not usually hard proof of a wide spread phenomenon.   

The real flaw to this study (and it is a fatal one) is poor external variable control and incorrectly applied statistics.  


Use of force is MASSIVELY dependent on presence of and level of resistance to arrest.   Resistance on calls is something that varies dramatically - but rarely.  
The majority of calls do not involve an arrest or any context likely to produce a use of force.  Some number of calls involve a small degree of resistance in which the most trigger-happy cop would shoot.  That percentage decreases until you get to a very small number of cases in which the vast majority of officers would shoot.  


The study pads the statistical significance by using calls rather than arrests as its unit of measurement.  They are exponentially overestimating their sample size, essentially.    


Here's the best example i could give, because this error is a little complicated despite how impactful it is:

You release 100,000 balloons, but only 8 of them are close enough for me to see them. 5 blue and 3 reds  


I shoot 4/5 blue and 2/3 reds, missing one of each.  Their study is using 100k as the sample size to show a significant connection - when they should be using 8.",Bullboah,t2_7h1u6,0,0,reddit1

It could be that white officers are more likely to be highly trained in use of force (maybe a promotional pipeline issue). When a dangerous sounding call comes in, it might be routed to more violence-oriented officers.

It could also plausibly be that white officers are better trained or equipped for rapid responses. You could imagine a city where white officers drive cars, black officers ride bikes, and Hispanic officers walk. When there's a domestic disturbance, it's probably a toss up what the race of the officer who arrives is. When there is an active shooter and seconds count, everyone drops everything to get there, so the white officers are disproportionately likely to arrive first.

Neither seem that likely, especially the latter, but it's a plausible mechanism.

this wholesome message is accompanied by fun facts like, ""the sex you have after the first time you take a life is the best sex you'll ever have!"" btw, Grossman has never killed anybody in the course of his career, but, that doesn't stop him from extolling the joys of post-murder orgasm to young police officers.

take training that is more fit for Green Berets behind enemy lines, add the militarization of police forces through programs that give them access to military gear, and it's pretty clear what's going on with cops.

so, yeah, they definitely run on fear and a fetishization of murder. it's way more obvious when you notice the explanation for nearly every shooting is ""I feared for my life,"" even when the victim was unarmed and in no position to harm the officer.

Yes, there is. The uniform they wear and the absolute lack of accountability for their actions. It affects non-white cops too. It's not the color, it's the uniform/job. 

>I think his point is that, by only looking at one side of the story, you'll never be able to come up with good policy solutions to fix this.

Of course, you can. America just isn't ready to apply the solutions. You don't have to train millions of civilians to interact with cops; you can train the cops to interact with the civilians. And, most importantly, hold cops accountable for their actions, mistakes and all. 

>I think we can both agree that white cop violence on minorities is disproportionate and unjust.

Yes

>But if minorities are more violent towards white cops, then all the additional training and racist filters in the world won't get the violence numbers down to social parity.

They are not. Because a) there's nothing intrinsic that makes minorities more violent towards cops. If any, we AVOID cops 'cos we know their involvement raises our chances of dying. Period. 

>If minorities are more violent towards white cops, and since white cops seem to be more violent towards minorities, maybe the answer is something like having minority-majority local policing forces for those neighborhoods.

Even in the racist reality where this is true (it isn't in our joint reality), the solution is to fix the cops. Not to fix civilians. You cannot fix civilians if you want cops to stop killing civilians. Of any color.

Further, we also know black people see worse outcomes in our legal system overall.

You'd have to be blind or ignorant to argue that America in the present isn't vastly and overwhelmingly different from how it was in the Jim Crow era. To say that American police is *definitely* racist now because it was racist 50 years ago is about as valid as saying that someone is a whiny brat today, at age 25 because they were a whiny brat when they were at age 3. It's certainly possible, but when things have changed that much, you're gonna need some evidence showing that unambiguously.

Not to mention the part that if the police being racist in the past is enough to condemn them as racist now, then excluding the use of a time machine, how exactly do we fix that? We can't stop them from being racist in the past, it already happened. In some arbitrary time period where police, on average, are not significantly (referring to significance in the statistical sense) more likely to use force against anyone on the basis of race, how would one be able to disprove that argument you're using right now?

>Have you considered that racial bias from white law enforcement is the main driver of this cycle of malice?

>Have you considered that the racial bias of white law enforcement has been powering this cycle non-stop since (at least) reconstruction?

The issue is that statistics generalizable to the present don't clearly demonstrate racial bias from white law enforcement. You can certainly say something about how minority distrust of the government and police originated from racism in the past, however that says nothing about whether or not modern police are responsible for wrongdoing.

>There is also a litany of scholarship AND literature that explore the discourse around policing and the history of policing (esp. of minorities) in America.

As for history, as I've thoroughly discussed here, there's only so much that can be applied to the present.

Regarding modern scholarship and literature on policing, it's simply not as cut and dry as you seem to think it is. Here's a few studies to demonstrate this.

[""On the most extreme use of force – officer involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account""](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22399/w22399.pdf)

[""Ratios of admitted and fatal injury due to legal police intervention per 10 000 stops/arrests did not differ significantly between racial/ethnic groups.""](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27)

[""I find that decedent characteristics, criminal activity, threat levels, police actions, and the setting of the lethal interaction are not predictive of race, indicating that the police—given contact—are killing blacks and whites under largely similar circumstances. The findings suggest that the racial disparity in the rate of lethal force is most likely driven by higher rates of police contact among African Americans rather than racial differences in the circumstances of the interaction and officer bias in the application of lethal force.""](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/703541)",CyberneticWhale,t2_15w3vy,1,0,reddit1

The issue is that not all drug crimes are equally likely to result in an arrest. For instance, cases of dealing drugs are likely more likely to result in an arrest than recreational use. Cases of recreational use that people call to complain about are more likely to result in an arrest than cases where no one calls to complain.

This presents confounding factors. If black people are more likely to sell drugs, or if black people are more likely to be reported for drug use, (for instance, because black people are more likely to live in cheaper, more densely packed apartments where something like marijuana smoke would be more likely to disturb neighbors) then that could explain the disparity without police bias.",CyberneticWhale,t2_15w3vy,4,0,reddit1

That’s a simple, direct example. Think about all the violence in media were blasted with daily. For many minorities, violence and crime are glorified and portrayed as the “way out”. This creates a feedback loop on both sides where cops are freaked out by it, and the “general public” emulates violent behaviors, which in turn freaks cops out more. It’s not rational. It doesn’t have to be. It’s just how brains work. Threats of violence short-circuit the brain and are weighted *extremely* heavily wrt decision making.

hyv5lk3,t1_hyuywng,2022-03-01 03:04:28,science,"(Hey, I'm back at my computer. Let's see...)

The argument people are trying to make with that stat is that it's more dangerous to deliver pizzas than it is to do things like answer domestic violence calls and perform traffic stops. But there are a lot of problems with that approach. Leaving aside the fact that the overall fatality rate doesn't have any relation to the police-shooting rate:

First, pizza delivery drivers are probably carrying some cash and aren't usually armed, so there's some incentive and no deterrent to robbing them at gunpoint. Those two factors alone skew the comparison badly enough to make it almost useless. (Really, there aren't any other jobs that you can compare to law enforcement jobs, because no other civilian jobs include ""You might have to shoot somebody"" in the job description. So it's hard to say that cops are doing it wrong unless you want to compare them to other cops in the same situations.)

Second, it's a bad stat. Every citation trail that I can find that starts with ""Pizza delivery guys"" leads to citations like these, which combine pizza drivers with *every other type* of driver. That includes big rigs on the freeway, the UPS guy, traveling salesmen (apparently), etc.

[https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/1002500001](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/1002500001) (#7, Driver / sales workers and truck drivers)

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) (Page 3, Driver / sales workers and truck drivers)

(I'm looking around for more reliable and specific stats now, because this pizza-delivery thing is the proverbial dead horse, but nobody really collects data on that. Just anecdotes and emotional examples. Weird.)

Third (and this might be repeating myself), it's conflating two situations (traffic deaths vs violent attacks) to pump up the bad stat, when the argument about police shootings only has anything to do with the second situation. For clarity, the stats above? A few mentions are made that 75% of those were traffic fatalities, and 25% were due to assault or other violent acts. Which is what a cop, triggerhappy or not, would be responding to with a firearm.

&#x200B;

My point here is that *some* cops and some departments are definitely triggerhappy and / or racist, and others just need better training. And some others are doing things just fine. But using the pizza delivery driver argument isn't proving anything at all.",headhouse,t2_zcwko,1,0,reddit1

Logic is applied to determine what to study, how to conduct a study,  how analyze results, build critiques to falsify, etc. 
    
The scientific method itself is only supported by logical analysis. 
     
Also, social science is subjective analysis of data. Just showing some source making an argument is not definitive.

You are absolutely correct, but this is not what I’ve said. I doubt you did this on purpose, but this ended up acting as a strawman for the majority of your response. 

So let’s just go ahead and list every strawman you’ve used for the sake of our discourse: 

>	You’d have to be blind or ignorant to argue that America in the present isn’t vastly and overwhelmingly different from how it was in the Jim Crow era.

>	To say that American police is definitely racist now because it was racist 50 years ago..

>	Not to mention the part that if the police being racist in the past is enough to condemn them as racist now

When you go back and read my original response, you will find that you are arguing against points that I’m not even making. 

I explicitly stated RACIAL BIAS instead of RACISM. 

Racial biases (or any categorical biases) are normal! The hypersensitive culture we currently live in largely ignores this nuance. 

We all have biases based on our experiences, education, childhood upbringing, environment, etc. These biases also affect (but do not always determine) the way we interact with the world and the people in it.

My first point (regarding your original point) was that because these biases always exist (and have always existed), it doesn’t make sense to draw up a hypothetical where racial bias DOESNT exist as a way to prove your own point. 
Don’t you agree?

My second point WASN’T suggesting a “cut and dry” proof of fact like you suggest here:

>	Regarding modern scholarship and literature on policing, it’s simply not as cut and dry as you seem to think it is. Here’s a few studies to demonstrate this.

My second point was actually:

>	>Is this definitely the case? Who knows. [regarding whether or not police and minority communities share equal responsibility for the statistics mentioned in the article]

>	The people in these communities know. Their parents and grandparents know. Their great and great-great grandparents especially knew. And they’ve all been saying this for generations. 
There is also a litany of scholarship AND literature that explore the discourse around policing and the history of policing (esp. of minorities) in America.

This point negates the notion that this sort of thing (regarding where the responsibility lies) is unknowable just because you don’t know it yourself (which so often is follwed by: “so therefore there’s nothing we can do *shrugs shoulders*”). The people affected know this intimately, and so do the many historians and academics who specialize in this area.

When I asked the following questions, they weren’t hypothetical:

>	Have you considered that racial bias from white law enforcement is the main driver of this cycle of malice?

>	Have you considered that the racial bias of white law enforcement has been powering this cycle non-stop since (at least) reconstruction?

I legitimately want to know if you’ve even considered this. 

Because if you haven’t seriously asked this question for yourself, and if you haven’t engaged with and explored this part of the discourse (literature/academics/the community), then you’re missing an enormous and invaluable perspective. 

There are throughlines of history that inform everything we experience. I find it unsettling how easy you toss out history as it has no significant impact on the present at all. 

Nevertheless, this is probably the best point you’ve made that doesn’t rely on your strawman:

>	You can certainly say something about how minority distrust of the government and police originated from racism in the past, however that says nothing about whether or not modern police are responsible for wrongdoing.

This is correct. Minus the “wrongdoing” part. The disparity here is that in this particular study it was found that white cops were substantially more likely to shoot and use force than other cops in minority communities (this is hardly controversial). 

The point is NOT that history makes modern police responsible. Is that history informs the specific types of bias that white cops may carry on their shoulders when they police these communities. 

Responsibility here plays a role AFTER looking at the outcome. Thus, I’m pushing back against the notion that these communities are as equal to blame for this disparity as the specific white cops who often engage regular citizens with upscaled violence (as compared to other cops). I would even go further to opine that this responsibility should be heavily placed on the cops in these situations rather than the communities they’re responsible for protecting.",Hreed1,t2_fmpkm,1,0,reddit1

This is a bad example because you're asking two different questions:

* What % of sixes come from white dice?
* Are white dice more likely to roll 6 than red dice?

The first would be a valid question to ask after the fact, but because you chose the number of dice to begin with, you have predetermined the conclusion to the first question. The second question is a properly constructed test, with the exception that one red die is too small a sample size. You'd probably want 2-3 at minimum.

The report also found that black people were far more likely to be stopped for “reasonable suspicion” (as opposed to actually breaking a law) and were three times more likely than any other group to be searched, even though searches of white people were more likely to turn up contraband.

> A study of police activity between 2012 and 2016 in Springfield, Mo., commissioned by the city’s police chief, found “substantial disparities in the rate at which African-Americans were stopped, and that the disparities increased, from 2012 to 2016 in Springfield. Some of this disparity is attributable to the fact that African-Americans are stopped for investigative purposes than would be predicted given their overall proportion of stops.” The report also found that “when African-Americans are stopped they are more likely to be searched and arrested than would be predicted given their proportion of stops and searches,” and that “it does not appear that the disparity in searches for African-Americans is attributable to a greater propensity to be in possession of contraband.""

> A 2013 Justice Department study found that black and Latino drivers are more likely to be searched once they have been pulled over. About 2 percent of white motorists were searched, vs. 6 percent of black drivers and 7 percent of Latinos.

> According to the Justice Department, between 2012 and 2014, black people in Ferguson, Mo., accounted for 85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations and 93 percent of arrests, despite comprising 67 percent of the population. Blacks were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched after traffic stops, even though they proved to be 26 percent less likely to be in possession of illegal drugs or weapons. Between 2011 and 2013, blacks also received 95 percent of jaywalking tickets and 94 percent of tickets for “failure to comply.” The Justice Department also found that the racial discrepancy for speeding tickets increased dramatically when researchers looked at tickets based on only an officer’s word vs. tickets based on objective evidence, such as vs. radar. Black people facing similar low-level charges as white people were 68 percent less likely to see those charges dismissed in court. More than 90 percent of the arrest warrants stemming from failure to pay/failure to appear were issued for black people.

Apologies that I misinterpreted that. In a lot of contexts, I've heard ""Racial bias"" and ""racism"" used in basically the same way.

That being said, do you have any evidence that these biases actually create a significant enough difference in behavior to be the cause for this? Because those studies I shared seem to be evidence against these biases playing a significant role in modern police behavior. 

>This point negates the notion that this sort of thing (regarding where the responsibility lies) is unknowable just because you don’t know it yourself (which so often is follwed by: “so therefore there’s nothing we can do shrugs shoulders”). The people affected know this intimately, and so do the many historians and academics who specialize in this area.

Unfortunately, the human brain takes a lot of shortcuts and heuristics, so perceptions don't always align with reality. Lot's of people thinking the police have racial biases and thus are more likely to mistreat minorities doesn't necessarily mean that it's true. It certainly warrants looking into it, however in order to actually prove that to be the case, you'd need hard data.

Like I said, there's certainly plenty to examine with regards to the effects of racial bias throughout history on minority communities, however if the question we're trying to answer is ""Do modern police treat minorities differently on the basis of their race?"" then there are limits to how accurate answers purely from history can be in answering that question.

History certainly impacts the present, however the question is if it is relevant to the question we're trying to ask.

And on the note of the question we're trying to ask, I think it's worth clarifying what exactly that question is. It seems here like you're referring to blaming as in a moral judgement.

Whether the problem is that all the actual cops are actually racist, or, whether the job naturally attracts racists *because* there is such an known endemic of unrestrained police violence towards specifically visible minorities, and has thus become attractive to racists, is immaterial.  I mean, I feel pretty strongly that the answer is both, but whether or not it is, doesn't matter.  The very existence of this systemic problem, is naturally proven by the fact that it is steadily getting worse, under the same conditions, over a sustained period of time.  Maybe the racism is all just an accident *because* of the way we do policing, and none of the actual cops are genuinely culpable.  I doubt it, but maybe.  That still means we *desperately* need to change the system of policing, if it could naturally lead to a bunch of non-racist cops non-deliberately killing tons of specifically visible minorities purely through its systemic structure and culture.

The sample size is spread out over 3 to 5 years, and has so few events that asserting that it was ""white officers"" responsible vs just a few bad officers or new officers, or some other factor cannot be evaluated.

In fact, the validity of the conclusion is different if it is 3 years or it is 5 years.  We are given a range (I assume) to make ""first city"" and ""second city"" hard to identify. If your turnover rate is 15% or more ([Turn over rate for police is typically high](https://www.zippia.com/police-officer-jobs/demographics/)) so the size of the officer pool for the study is very different at 3 years than 5 years.

What I'd want is enough events over few enough officers to support a group explanation.

Implicit bias measured how exactly? We know the IAT provides no construct or predictive validity. There are no other tools, at least to my knowledge, that deliver on said validity. We cannot simply assume that implicit bias is the underlying cause of the differences found in the study.

But let's also say the turnover is 20% per year.  If the sampling was over 3 years, the total officers involved is 1600 officers.  Or 5 years the total is 2000 officers.

Now I just picked numbers out of a hat to illustrate my point.  Because the ratio of officers to events and the depth of involvement in events matter.  But the study doesn't give us this data.

The city has 250000 people. On average, you'd have 2.5 officers per 1000, or 550 officers.  The city is in the top 20 for homicide though.  The could have 1000 officers.  And they could have a higher turnover rate 

We are not told.

In summary, asserting group behavior trends of a large population with rare events opens the door to other explanations such as physical fitness, alcohol and drug use, family problems,  ADHD, etc.

I'm not sure race must be assumed to be a good explanation for very rare events In a population. Other explanations were not addressed.

As for focusing on fewer officers, surveying traits of officers involved with events relative to the total population is needed.  We know they are more likely white. But are they more likely alcohol users? ADHD? Lower education? From single parent homes? Heck, are they shorter? Lower ranked?  Who knows?

Even in theory this isn't true. Cities have very different needs from their policing, and training can vary widely. It's one of the more common issues facing the application of understanding of policing from one area to the next. Extrapolating the results of this study to other cities then absolutely fails to control for any of these factors.

If you believe the first, then the population of white officers matters, and the number of events per particular officer matters.

If the latter, I will grant you are right.",PaulSnow,t2_lxci8,1,0,reddit1
hzb7pwc,t1_hzb4v5e,2022-03-04 12:58:39,science,"From the Abstract:

>Estimates indicate Black (Hispanic) civilians are 55 (75) percent more likely to experience any force, and five times as likely to experience a police shooting, compared to if White officers scaled up force similarly to minority officers.

The assumption here is that the white officers are making the decision to scale force more quickly than minority officers, resulting in more events.

Just using interactions as the basis of comparison is powerful, but not sufficient to eliminate some understanding of the officer pool involved.  If a small number of minority officers are always taking the calls, then they will have a stronger relationship with the community than if a large number of white officers are taking the calls.  

I don't think just using interactions as the basis is enough to eliminate impact of the officer population on the results.",PaulSnow,t2_lxci8,1,0,reddit1
hzfaxrq,t1_hzb7pwc,2022-03-05 06:56:16,science,"Your objections kind of seem to be jumping around and we still haven’t resolved the issue you have with turnover rate. Is it or is it not true that having a larger pool of different officers who have interactions that contribute to the data is better than having less? Because what seems clear to me, is having as many different officers as possible having different interactions would be preferred, the same way it would be in just about any other conceivable study involving statistics like this. I’m just not grasping how you came the the conclusion you seem to have come to. You now sound like you’re saying the problem with this is there could be a small amount of officers who know everyone they’re encountering and that’s affecting the outcome here. How did you come to that conclusion, and why would that contribute to your claim about higher turnover rate?",,,1,0,reddit1
hzgoe04,t1_hzfaxrq,2022-03-05 15:55:14,science,"Yes, I am jumping around a bit; my objections are increasing the more I look at this.

Yes I still believe that the rate (3 to 5 years is quite a bit of spread) and the number of officers involved (not given) matters in calculating the confidence level of the assertion that White officers due to being white and dealing with minorities are more likely to use force than minority officers.

The paper gives confidence numbers to the data collected, but not this assertion made in the abstract.

First of all, we have in city 1 1.2 million calls, and 1300 instances of force and 94 cases where a gun was discharged. Force was thus used in 1 of 1000 calls, and a gun fired in 1 of 12,800 calls.

The quote from the paper in discussing these rates: 

>""This suggests that the type of white person attracted to the police force is *systematically different* than the typical black person when it comes to likelihood of using force."" \[emphasis mine\]

If you are looking for *systematically different* traits, you have to know how likely are are to find these traits in white people *as a group.*

To push this to the extreme, if only 1 white officer was involved in taking the calls, you can speak to that officer, but clearly not white officers as a group because 1 officer isn't a group.

If there were 100 white officers involved, and a majority over this period was involved in use of force, then now you might be talking about something systematic.  One might still question if 100 white officers in one city in the top 20 for homicide is enough to generalize about white officers in the large.

If there were 1000 white officers involved, and only 5% of them over this period were involved in use of force over the average, then again, *that doesn't speak to any sort of systematic*  issue with white officers, but a possible sub group to be concerned about.

If there were 10,000 white officers involved and force used was not concentrated on a small number, but the average officer using force did so at something low number close to 1, (i.e. unlikely to repeat use of force) then you have to wonder if something else is involved, because while the incidents are higher with whites, a particular white officer isn't prone to repeated use of force.

And all the while, in any encounter, you have two populations.  One trained (one would assume) in pretty standard behaviors as an officer.  And given the low number of incidents, the assumption of training across the board seems fair.  The other is the public who is already a subject of a 911 call, and might in fact react more violently to a white officer rather than a minority officer.

Do we have any data about racial tensions in the city?  Have they had racial riots or protests?  Would that impact the study?  How would that show up in the numbers rather than the idea white officers use force quicker?  (I'd contend the repeat rate gives some insight, which again is easier to see or not see with a larger body of white officers responding to the 1.2 million calls)

In order to support a charge of *systemic issues with white officers*, the paper has to demonstrate the expression of a behavior *over a population of white officers,* beyond what might more likely fall upon white officers, or be due to a small set of white officers.

To summarize why the officer population size matters to demonstrate systematic issues with white officers:

* Do they have enough white officers involved to generalize over the group?
* Were incidents spread over the group enough to indicate group behavior?
* Were incidents repeated enough with some individuals and not with other members of the group to indicate just being white wasn't causing the population to react to the white officer?

Problems they have in the study:

* Low event counts create large confidence intervals
* Big increase in very small numbers can overstate the problem
* Generalizing racial groups with small populations creates a very high bar in calculating the confidence intervals
* Not defining the population size or period of study strikes at ability of the study to assert trends in a racial group
* No discussion in the study about how the numbers gathered can actually be applied to white officers in general to support an assertion of a systematic problem, and the confidence intervals around that particular assertion.",PaulSnow,t2_lxci8,1,0,reddit1

dja8f8c,t3_6itgnh,2017-06-23 04:45:29,science,"It makes sense if you know anything about the business of a small independent farmer. Basically, it is a very long term investment because the profit margins on farming are usually very very small. You may be spending a million dollars on seeds, fertilizer, chems, equipment, insurance, maintenance and upkeep every year in order to operate a small farm. However with that gigantic yearly investment, you would be overjoyed at earning $50K off of it at the end of the year, most years you will make less and are only really surviving because you also garden and grow some of your own food, fix your own house, cut your own wood for heat, and take side jobs like excavating or logging because you already own most of the equipment. You will likely do that for 10, maybe up to 20 years until your farming actually results in a significant pay day. It is a bit of ill-fortune for other farmers elsewhere suffering but fortune for you because you happened to plant the right crops the right year in the right fields that somewhere else resulted in terrible harvest yields or the result of natural disasters like hail, flooding, droughts, ect. So prices rise say 7% on your crop due to those factors, 7% of 1 mil is $70,000 of extra profit. Im sure you can imagine how nice it would be to double or more your salary for a year.

Of course it has it's downsides too. That same farm might after that result in you losing 20 grand a year for 10 years. If you can't cover $200,000 in the scenario, you might be forced to sell your farm to some corporate dicks at year 9 for $180,000 and not even have a home anymore. 

You could also try and keep financing the farm on that land for literally 30 years of your life and never turn a profit through no fault of your own. Imagine how terrible that would feel. You try harder and harder every year to save every penny and every harvest you are still poor and stressed. 

Plus it is rural, more solitary lifestyle. Many people can't stand the isolation. I mean you aren't completely isolated, but this isn't 100 years ago where your road has 50 farms on it each with 5-10 people on each.

The ONS which authored the report asks why some professions have a high suicide rate. They give three reasons: that low wage, low prospect jobs encourage low self esteem; that depressed or unstable individuals seek out certain professions; that knowing methods of suicide or having access to them enhances successful attempts.

They don't receive benefits, and frequently end up on living off taxpayers one way or another for the rest of the year.

It's the only way to be able to afford buying all the seed and fertilizer at once.  

Some people get crop insurance. It's helped us before when a particularly windy storm knocked over like half a field of full grown corn. You can also sign contracts with seed companies to mitigate some of the risk. For instance, you sign up with Pioneer to do X acres in a certain kind of their seed. Pioneer would give you enough seed for the X acres, you plant, harvest, and store it until they want it. They pay you so many cents per bushel of grain stored and then pay you a premium that varies depending on how good the yield was. The contract you sign dictates the minimum premium they can pay you per bushel and it'll change based on yield (I think). If I understand correctly, if the crop fails somehow (doesn't sprout, etc) the company eats the loss. It kind of guarantees you'll make some money, but if the market price is high, you're locked into your contract so you might not make as much money as you could have if you shouldered the whole cost.

---

...[Comparing suicide rates between different countries] would only be experimentally valid if we could experimentally decrease gun control in other countries and see if the suicide rate goes up. You understand why, right? The societal contributions to suicide between countries, especially very disparate countries (like US and Korea) makes their background suicide rates somewhat incompatible for comparisons. 

The quote you added is from the author of the [Breitbart article], not from the authors of the paper who say (emphasis theirs):

>the effects of different firearms policy interventions on suicide remain poorly understood. **Thus, the committee recommends further studies of the link between firearms policy and suicide**.

In the same paper they also say;

>The risk of suicide is highest immediately after the purchase of a handgun, suggesting that some firearms are specifically purchased for the purpose of committing suicide.

[Another paper on the topic](http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/sites/actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/files/Reducing%20a%20Suicidal%20Persons%20Access%20to%20Lethal.pdf) says all this (emphasis mine):

>**Means restriction is one of the few empirically based strategies to
substantially reduce the number of suicide deaths**
Reducing access to lethal means saves lives when
people who cannot readily obtain a highly lethal
method either attempt with a method less likely to
prove fatal or do not attempt at all

>**First, many suicidal crises are short-lived**. A survey of
people who had seriously considered suicide in the past
year found that for about 30%, the suicidal period
lasted under an hour

>**Second, the method people use in suicidal acts
depends, to a non-trivial extent, on its ready availability**.6,7

>**Third, the proportion of attempts that result in
death \(case fatality ratio\) varies dramatically across
methods, ranging from a high of 85%–90% for firearms
to a low of 1%–2% for the methods most commonly used
in attempts—medication overdoses and sharp instrument
wounds**. 8 The lethality of the method readily
available during a suicidal crisis therefore plays an
important role in whether the person survives an
attempt; intent matters, but means also matter

>**Fourth, approximately 90% of attempters who survive
a nonfatal attempt will not go on to die by suicide
thereafter**,9 **a finding that holds true even in studies
focusing only on medically serious attempts, such as
jumping in front of a train**.10 Therefore, helping people
survive periods of acute suicidal risk by reducing their
access to highly lethal methods is likely to help many
people survive in both the short and long term

So the important take away, one that I've never tried to obfuscate, is that it makes sense to limit access to high-suicide-risk individuals as a short term solution to preventing that individual's likelihood of dying from suicide. Yes, many people may in fact go on to try a non-firearm method, but almost invariably the chance of success will drop significantly, and therefore the overall odds that they survive in general increases significantly.",Miami_Vice-Grip,t2_pg9em,1,0,reddit3

It seems as though the availability of firearms is a major risk factor for suicide, since firearms account for only about 3% of all attempts, but nearly half of all the fatalities.

djalo7v,t1_dja3vwg,2017-06-23 12:57:18,science,"no, actually in this particular case, correlation *is* partial causation...

We know this two ways: 

first, logically:  it is easier to kill yourself with a gun than practically any other method.   (if you take pills, you can change your mind and call poison control.  If you decide to jump off of a bridge, you need to drive there first... which again, gives you time to change your mind.  If you shoot yourself in the head, that is usually it.)  

second, statistically:  we also know that women (for all sorts of cultural reasons) usually choose methods like pills over guns if they decide to commit suicide.   (while men choose guns--IF they have easy access to one.)  Therefore, while women and men make equal numbers of suicide *attempts* (statistically), men have a higher rate of death from suicide.  This is (we know) primarily because of the changing-one's-mind midway through the process... i.e. the gun-factor.   (men who do not have easy access to guns have equal rates to women.) 

TL/DR:  many of not most suicide attempts are impulsive (in moments of extreme despair and/or depression) not extensively pre-planned.  Gun access dramatically *reduces* the odds of surviving  such a bad moment, and correspondingly impulsive (bad) choice.

Margins on what we grow aren't large enough to hire much outside help with the size of our operation.

Also, we only have so much equipment. With my dad, uncle, brother, and little cousin working, pretty much everything that can be running at any one time is running. It was that way pretty much 100% of the time when me and my older cousin still lived at home.

The main reason the days are long is because you have a limited window of time to get crops in and out. In the spring you're always going full tilt because you never know what the weather is going to do. It may pour like crazy and drown everything out and you may have to replant, which will obviously take a lot of time.

Not at all. We all have *some* degree of control, and *some* degree of external influence. So it becomes a matter of which part becomes dominant in your life. 

So for all of us, there will be some ""factual"" amount of influence from external sources and internal will. A person born in poor circumstances and working a low-end job will have a relatively high level of external forces deciding their outcomes. A person given more chances in life will have a higher degree of choice in their outcome in life, so they'll have a relatively higher amount of internal control. I don't know if there's any objective way to measure how much control is internal and how much is external, but there will still be some effect there.

Beyond that, a person can *feel* like they have a lot of control over their life, while others can feel that they don't and they just get swept up in their circumstances. These feelings will probably be correlated with the above mentioned ""actual"" levels of control, but it probably wont be bound by them.

Personally, I feel I have a fair bit of say in where I end up in life. My circumstances have been helped a lot by a good starting point in life, so I don't expect I'll ever end up in a truly miserable situation. But whether I manage to do well in life, financially, socially and romantically, or if I just end out mediocre, that's pretty much up to me.  ",ahhwell,t2_51ecz,3,0,reddit3
dja2a5n,t1_dja1j38,2017-06-23 02:21:55,science,"I don't know if motivation is the best example to use to understand Locus of Control unless you're delving pretty deeply into whether or not a person believes that they have control over what motivates them (in your example, eating when they are hungry would strike me as a classic ELoC concept because hunger is more or less out of an individual's control - although people with a strong ILoC might even argue with me on that). 

Take the example of a job interview: the prototypical ILoC response will be to believe that they have the power in that situation. *They* are in control and *they* are the ones who ultimately decide (through their performance or lack thereof) whether they get the job or not.

By contrast, the prototypical ELoC response is to point to factors that have nothing to do with them - are there tons of other applicants, do they have an ""in"" by knowing someone at the company, is the interviewer in a particularly good/bad mood that day, is the economy good or bad, etc.

Ultimately, the answer always comes down to a little bit of both being true, and psychologically speaking, an imbalance in either direction is probably unhealthy. That said, I feel like US culture *strongly* favors the notion that ILoC (""I control what happens to me!"") is ""strong"" and ELoC (""Things happen to me that I have no control over!"") is ""weak"" and ""making excuses,"" but I don't have any particular research to back up that assertion.",Seigneur-Inune,t2_gpz2x,12,0,reddit3

djbybzq,t1_djawqu8,2017-06-24 05:58:01,science,"Does all of this LoC philosophy take into account determinism and similar concepts? I am a determinist, myself. That seems to fall into the ELoC category, and I'm just wondering if this philosophy is actually addressed at all.   

From my point of view, the ILoC is an illusion. What people mistake for control is simply a situation with more variables. More money means more possible things to spend it on, more time means more possible activities, more friends means more things to do, etc. But that just means the outcome is harder to predict, it doesn't mean we have any more agency over the eventual impulse our unconscious mind puts forth.   

Humans and everything we've imagined, so far as we can tell, are still dictated by the same fundamental forces that dictate the behavior of the various particles to which we've assigned so much meaning; the very same particles we *are*. We've found nothing measurable that makes us special compared with other matter. In spite of complexity, we're subject to the same, invariant presence of cause and effect.   

People with an ELoC did not control the circumstances under which they were born; socioeconomic status of the parents, climate, time, etc. They did not control many factors that allowed their survival; food availability, weather patterns, whether or not someone decided to murder them, etc. And they didn't control the factors going into decision making; past experiences, role models, genetic predispositions in personality, etc.   
  
It can be argued control doesn't exist at all. Hopefully this made sense. I've been ingesting exotic solvents again.

Perhaps the message to the world is that they say ""you can control your life"", but the more you get into it, the more you realize what they're saying is this:

Out of the things that you CAN control in your life, they are only internal to you. Your emotional reactions and your decisions, what you decide to focus on, how you spend your time, etc.

You can never control others emotional reactions, decisions and what they focus on. This would be an ELoC, and people might argue this, but we all have free will and while there might be heavy enough influence to make it seem like control, if at any time someone chooses to not do something, they can. That being said, I find the heavy influence of things like advertising to be dispicable and predatory, and recognize thaf some people could benefit from help instead of just being told ""its all in your control!"", and lots of entrepreneurs and others in this area would agree.

You also cannot obviously control the weather or the seasons (not speaking about global warming, which I believe IS under our control), conflict, death, and so on. And I believe and many PD folks believe this is where many people have an ELoC: they spend time watching news and doing things that affect THEM, by making them sad or feel anxious to think about, but are entirely out of their control. And here PD folks would also suggest having an ILoC and saying hey, if this is outside your influence of control (such as conflict happening somewhere in the world), then you have to let go of that.

gmzi9pr,t3_lhs2t6,2021-02-11 21:25:56,science,"Since this is a link to an article that links to the study, here's the Abstract:

>Diversification is a widely proposed policing reform, but its impact is difficult to assess. We used records of millions of daily patrol assignments, determined through fixed rules and preassigned rotations that mitigate self-selection, to compare the average behavior of officers of different demographic profiles working in comparable conditions. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians. These effects are largest in majority-Black areas of Chicago and stem from reduced focus on enforcing low-level offenses, with greatest impact on Black civilians. Female officers also use less force than males, a result that holds within all racial groups. These results suggest that diversity reforms can improve police treatment of minority communities.

And here's the link to the study: [**LINK**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/696)

Also, figure 5 has some interesting results. In predominantly black and predominantly white areas, black officers stopped less people and used less force (10-20 less stops per shift). But Hispanic officers stopped at rates much closer to white officers. And in mixed areas or predominantly Hispanic areas, there wasn't nearly as much of a reduction in stops by black or Hispanic officers, and stranger still the effect we see seems more pronounced for black officers.",NoUntakenNames,t2_jofu7,75,0,reddit4

gmza0hl,t3_lhs2t6,2021-02-11 20:27:01,science,"This was very interesting.  Go to figure 5 in the actual paper to see some of the basis of these statements below.
>Looking at data of comparable working conditions over 100 shifts, the researchers found Black officers make 15.16 fewer stops and 1.93 fewer arrests than white officers on average. They also use force 0.10 fewer times than white counterparts, on average.

0.1 fewer TIMES over 100 shifts for use of force.  That's not 10%, that's a numerical 0.1 fewer times over 100 shifts, that's 0.001%.  But when broken down by predominant ethnicity of the neighborhood, it becomes even more interesting.  Very curiously, the data does not provide any analysis on how the race of the officer's numbers differ based on neighborhood ethnicity.  For example, do white officers make the same approximate number of stops regardless of neighborhood?  I see white vs. black officers contrasted here, but not white officer in black neighborhood vs white in white neighborhood.  We should be looking at consistency as well, which will give us a better feel for racial bias.  We'd also need to correct for violent and petty crime rates.  I would not be surprised to see violent crime enforcement to show little difference across the board, but you'd probably see more volatility for petty crime.

Some interesting analysis, but needs a lot more research.  Would love to see this carried a bit further.

Turns into these percentages

In the course of a 100 shifts during the same month and in the same neighborhood, black male police officers make ~2 less arrests. And, that is roughly 20% less than white male officers in the same 100 shifts? So, a black dude is making 4 arrests/shifts and a white dude is making 6 arrests/100shifts?

It’s pretty easy to draw parallels between gun violence and a lack of proactive policing. Too many young kids are dying in gang-related gun violence that could be prevented if the perpetrator were in jail in the first place. That’s certainly easier than trying to control illegal guns that are already in circulation.

>To assess the impact of diversity in law enforcement, we draw on newly collected data, assembled through years of open-records requests, that allow us to overcome long-standing limitations. These include officer demographics, language skills, daily shift assignments, and career progression. We link these files to time-stamped, geolocated records of the same officers’ decisions to stop, arrest, and use force against civilians. After aggressively pruning data to maximize analytic validity, we compile a panel of 2.9 million officer shifts and 1.6 million enforcement events by nearly 7000 officers covering the years 2012 through 2015. Most notably, we leverage fine-grained information on daily patrol assignments, which vary exogenously on the basis of fixed rules and preassigned rotations, to examine how officers of different groups behave when faced with comparable circumstances and civilian behaviors.

If they conducted stops at the same rates as white and Hispanic officers, would the rate of stoppage of black citizens scale proportionately?  

Are they more comfortable stopping black citizens in certain neighborhoods?

Half of 15,000 is 7,500. 7,500 is 0.015% of 50 million which means about 0.015% of the black population is responsible for half the country's murders. 

So what intelligent assumption could you make about the ethics of an entire race of people based off 0.015% of them?

When black officers make stops/arrests/use of force, they are disproportionately directed at black civilians compared to other officers. As a blatant example, if the white officer and black officer had their stats flipped, many people would draw the conclusion that even though they make less arrests, white officers target black civilians more while being more lenient with white ones. But you still make a good point and we can still compare their use of force with stops made. We get:

>Black officers use force against blacks in 0.5% of stops  
>  
>Hispanic officers use force against blacks in 0.7% of stops  
>  
>White officers use force against blacks in 0.7% of stops

It does appear that black officers are slightly less likely to use force here. But, Hispanics are just as likely to use force against blacks as whites. The title is blatantly pinning whites as the abnormal one, when the outlier is clearly black officers. The title says hispanics make ""far fewer stops and arrests"", when the data shows *slightly* fewer stops, and *more* arrests than whites.

(From the actual study):

Mean use of force per 100 shifts is only 0.27. Hispanic officers used force 0.30 times and white officers 0.32 times, while Black officers only 0.16 times. For white officers, 72% of those instances where against black civilians; for hispanic officers, 70%; and for black officers 88% of those instances were against black civilians.

The only takeaway here seems to be that whites and hispanics are more likely to use force during a stop than black officers. Which may sound like a story... except you have to stop and ask yourself ""does the use of force happening less than half a percent of the time sound like a problem?""

It doesn't. The difference between 0.16 and 0.32 times out of 100 stops might be ***relatively*** big, but when you zoom out it's negligible. Less than one half of one stops out of 100... no matter which race, sex, religion, gender, etc. you want to slice it.",rayluxuryyacht,t2_iy7co,0,0,reddit4

In these contexts, I very much do have the assumption of shared experiences with other White travelers, regardless of their country of origin.

The idea behind ""White privilege"" is that most, if not all, White people do have significant overlap in life experiences in terms of tangibly and intangibly benefiting from their Whiteness. Whether it is something they are readily willing to acknowledge is another question. Just as it can be difficult to discern whether an individual has been treated poorly in one single incident because of his or her skin color, so too it is difficult to discern whether an individual has been treated favorably in one single incident because of his or her skin color. However, over time the accumulation of incidents would pretty clearly point in the direction that Whites do have the shared experience of benefiting from their skin color, just as Blacks have the shared experience of being treated worse because of that same factor.

hw7nwxv,t3_sobfma,2022-02-09 11:32:01,science,"A new study from the Texas A&M University School of Public Health suggests the air quality inside homes may not stack up against air quality inside office buildings.

The pilot study, published in the journal Atmosphere, delves into indoor air quality and health outcomes in people working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers measured indoor air quality in both the offices and homes of employees in 2019 and 2020 and evaluated their health outcomes during those periods.

Air pollution indoors is most often linked to building materials and the activities of people living and working in those buildings. These pollutants include volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from carpet and furniture, paints and other chemicals as well as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and mold.

Prolonged exposure to indoor air pollutants is associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes, from headaches and dry eyes to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. These outcomes have driven significant work into improving office building indoor air quality. However, the percentage of people working from home has grown dramatically over the past two decades and skyrocketed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning home indoor air quality can be considered a workplace health issue.

Taehyun Roh, assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Genny Carrillo, associate professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Texas A&M School of Public Health, along with colleagues from Houston Methodist Hospital and Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, analyzed indoor air quality in an office building between May and July of 2019 and then at the employees’ respective homes between June and September 2020.

>Simulation with a system dynamics model revealed that the implementation of **energy efficiency measures in public buildings has a major impact on indoor air quality**, leading to an energy efficiency/indoor air quality dilemma. On the one hand, energy efficiency measures in public buildings reduce both national energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, but on the other hand they **reduce indoor air quality thus causing losses in productivity for building occupants**. If mechanical ventilation is used, indoor air quality is improved and productivity is increased but this comes with increased energy consumption. The simulation results show that if ventilation is operated according to national building standards, total energy consumption in public buildings increases by 1.3 % in 2014 and by 2 % in 2040 (orCO2 emissions 7050 t/year) compared to the situation where there is no mechanical ventilation. If the implementation of the energy efficiency measures is increasing at higher rate, the difference between both alternatives is increasing more. In schools the key goal of education is improving individual outcomes as Hayward, Hunt and Lord \[12\] have emphasized in their research. The priority should be buildings that achieve sustainable development and yet meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

This pilot study assessed workplace IAQ and SBS symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in academic administrative staff members whose workplace changed from office to home due to the pandemic. Low-cost sensors were found suitable for in situ and continuous IAQ monitoring due to their simplicity, speed, and data accessibility. This study found that working from home may cause greater health issues for employees due to poor home IAQ, emphasizing the importance of the interventions to improve the home IAQ. One of the recommendations to enhance IAQ at homes can be achieved through behavioral changes such as opening windows and doors unless the outdoor air quality is harmful. Another approach is to provide remote workers with portable air purifiers with HEPA filters, particularly in locations where appropriate ventilation is difficult to attain. Lastly, integrating these strategies with smart building technologies would maximize the health and wellness of building occupants.

TLDR 
Office buildings have better monitoring and quality control over air than at home but that could be fixed by…. Opening a window…",,,1,0,reddit1

hw9xh8i,t3_sobfma,2022-02-09 20:56:48,science,"I have lots of thoughts on this. 

Most offices fail all measures of sustainability and environment care. Air conditioning is a serious part of that. They often simply circulate air after cooling it. Less than healthy oxygen levels… indoor chemical emissions from modern plastics and floor coverings, all swirling around. So you would ideally need a gas filter, not just a particle filter. 

The filters are… pretend filters, that only collect the largest particles. The ones I have seen take large quantities of water to clean. 

Where the office draws air in from outside, meaning it’s not simply concentrating microscopic dusts and chemicals that are more or less dangerous when inhaled over long periods, things are better, but there’s usually a limited filter on that too, so while the particulate levels are lower, and the oxygen is higher, carbon dioxide lower, and while the noxious emissions from plasticers and particle boards and glues and synthetic carpets and paints and all the other indoor modern materials are reduced due to the small quantities of air brought in, overall, the air quality is still terrible. 

The only time this is acceptable is when the outdoors air quality is worse. That is common when there are factories or power plants or mills burning coal, or using industrial chemicals, such as in nations that are major manufacturers. I’m not considering natural dusts from desertification as toxic or moulds and spores and pollens as pollutants, as the key to a joyful life is to recognise the massive value in being able to tolerate the conditions we evolved in over many millions of years. Face masks can be used if you’re allergic to natural dusts and airborne organics from flora.

Also, anywhere that cars travel at medium to high speeds, they create dusts from brake pads, from tyres contacting road surfaces, from exhausts (most catalytic converters are limited as to what they can do for exhausts, and it’s still a toxic poison that’s emitted). Those dusts are what’s brought into the buildings as ‘clean air’. So air pollution is a critical issue also in all suburban and urban regions. 

The outcome, the inhaled pollution, it’s a contributor to health issues, and wherever there are air conditioned buildings using legacy technologies and roads that have typical cars and other heavy vehicles and start/stop traffic, even where air is drawn in from outside, you’ll see long term health consequences that become especially prevalent in older age when experienced people are most valued and important, and when their lifetime of work and effort is suppose to culminate in a happy and healthy retirement that allows them to enjoy life, rather than suffer through health consequences. 

The way to overcome this is to have lightweight transportation using modern materials. Bicycles etc. or cars and motorbikes and scooters that go at slow speeds reducing tyre dust. To keep the vehicles inside or undercover so the tyres don’t prematurely perish from uv exposure. If cars, they should be slow moving to reduce dusts also, ideally of a much more lightweight design and self-driving. Between the slow speed and lightweight design you have less need for heavy brakes and tyres, and can use far lower weight batteries and you have less wind resistance, the self-driving means a slightly slower transit time is fine as one can do other things during the journey. 

Also, planting out cities where dirt is exposed. Wherever there are trees and plants, especially long grasses and weeds, you have a reduction in dusts from exposed dry soils and plants that help. So the use of chemical sprays to control weed growth on dirt surrounding trees or other flora isn’t a sound use of labour resources. Best is to control the weeds through planting grasses and creepers and small plant species that can crowd out the messy random weeds that might cause issues from more severe allergens or might not provide year-round cover during dry periods. 

When working from home, the way I managed air quality was to put a fan in a window drawing air in from outdoors and stand and sit in front of it. This was because after all considerations, the overall higher quality of air was outside, and no affordable technology was able to overcome the risks from emitted chemicals of a toxic nature and problems with paints, microplastics and microfibres and other dusts and danders from dust mites (arachnids) and insects that in my particular case were assessed (non-scientifically) as a greater health risk. The house didn’t have screens and it was unaffordable for me to install them as I had debts. I also didn’t have any renewable energy options, so I relied on direct on-bare-skin ambient air circulation to keep cool and happy in 30-35 degree heats while working and active. As my air quality was from outdoors, my need to maintain time and energy consuming cleaning was lower, so overall the environment appeared ‘dirtier’. 

Things today are different, but only if you have income. But it’s possible to do much with limited incomes. 

Thanks to the competitive manufacturers in China and other nations, low cost goods can be used to screen a house or unit, low cost air quality sensors are available, that include primitive forms of chemical detection. Air conditioning is improving, heat exchangers are more efficient and use less materials and renewable energy sources are available, and you can purchase low cost carbon offsets elsewhere or support health or conservation initiatives if your energy isn’t renewable or is polluting (though sadly Energy companies are sometimes too blind to see that they need to clearly state to the public that their energy is damaging and destructive, and that they can’t afford or are able to address those issues timely, so recommend the consumer to a variety of options to aid society elsewhere).

Also masks are now readily available at low cost.",xeneks,t2_yhw55,1,0,reddit1

Step back and look objectively at this article.


One building with eight employees were looked at. Not a very massive or in any way defining scale of data here.


The headline is intentionally pushing the idea that working in the office is better for you.


They ignore very obvious points like breathing all the fumes in rush hour traffic or the loss of about 2 hours a day solely in commute, loss of sleep. This list goes on.


So the article could spend the entire wall of text arguing against working at the office and I'd still say it is pushing the opposite narrative.

hw8uqhp,t1_hw84dma,2022-02-09 16:58:43,science,"Outside air is going to remove C02 but it can only fix PM problems to a point. For example, during wildfires you cant just take outside air, There are 2 days a year in Ontario when the smoke is so bad we have to close windows. But some locations just never get real clean outside air, like near a desert where sand constantly blows.

 I track C02 as an indicator of how ""fresh"" the air is in my apartment and cracking some windows usually brings new air (with 400ppm co2) pretty quick. My apartment only has 4 rooms and they all have windows. There is no need for large fans but until I started tracking C02 and PM25 I had no idea that my space was like that. And of course your air PM25 just goes towards whatever the outside value is. Im convinced my outisde air is worse than the average for my city because how close I live to a highway.  


So my point is that you dont need an HVAC system you just need some basic tools to make smart decisions. And like everyone is saying, a filter is prob a good investment, its a really easy fast way to just take all that air you are already breathing and polish it up, no matter where it was coming from its probably got a bunch of PM25 and these cleaners really do scrub that right out",timmeh87,t2_4h6j2,3,0,reddit1

dg2ihkf,t3_64j2vt,2017-04-10 12:18:12,science,"Hi Professor!

So, it is an interesting stigma because one of the things we are told as graduates or incoming graduates is that we need to be the absolute best candidate we can be which requires us to 1) take on more degrees and courseloads and/or 2) become interdisciplinary in our work and training to the point we lose focus.  

At the end of the day, at the end of the day, I am given the impression that graduate students are forced to ""overcompete"" with each other which leads losers to be overqualified because they are forced to find jobs related to their dream positions but don't necessarily require all that expertise.  Attach the stigma that those who take those jobs will quickly leave as soon as a better opportunity opens up, and you have a recipe for a lost-lost cause for many outgoing graduates nowadays.
 
Mentors are doing their best to train upcoming apprentice and junior scientists into being as competitive as possible for future positions.  But I remember my boss saying to me that P.I.s need to start taking birth control.  That they're training and overtraining students for jobs that just aren't there.  I get the idea that science should be choosing the best and the brightest, but that doesn't fix the main problem: 1 dozen best and bright candidates, 1 position.

What do you think about this birth control idea?  Given that many tenureship applications and other university obligations force the academic pipeline to remain flowing, would you think that this could be a reasonable fix if universities were to shift paradigms and essentially implement more rigid quotas on incoming graduates?  I think this might shock many labs who rely on student research, but if it will essentially improve employment prospects for newly-qualified researchers, would this be a reasonable solution?",feedmahfish,t2_6g43u,25,0,reddit2

Past research has shown that when employees perceive themselves as overqualified, they are more likely to search for a new job. Those who are objectively overeducated for their jobs also are likely to change jobs more quickly. Finally, there is a positive correlation between perceived overqualification and turnover intentions. This could be because they are bored but also because they have the qualifications to actually leave.

My own research as well as that of others also has shown that there are conditions under which feelings of overqualification do not translate into higher turnover. For example, in a study conducted in a retail setting, we found that empowerment plays the role of a buffer. When employees have autonomy, and when they feel that they have the ability to influence their work environment (rather than being expected to take a passive, cog-in-a-machine approach to work), their turnover rate is no different from others. So ultimately it may come down to how companies treat their workers rather than their qualifications when they decide whether to stay or leave. ",Berrin_Erdogan,t2_16xyib,30,0,reddit2

This is an interesting question – I am not sure if there is an objective reality of being overqualified. There are more objective looking metrics to be sure. For example, those in labor economics and education literatures often look at the difference between one’s education level and education level required by the job. These metrics assume that everyone at the same education level is equally qualified (disregarding differences in content and quality of education) and also assume that everyone holding the same job title ends up performing the exact same duties. 

Self ratings and other ratings of overqualification have moderate overlap. For example, in an ongoing project, my research team found a correlation of .35 between self ratings and coworker ratings of overqualification. Personality traits play a role (including narcissism), but also the individual may be in a good position to see their own skills and job demands as well. I would say that each metric has its place in the study of overqualification, with self ratings being more important to predicting job attitudes and turnover, and other ratings predicting selection decisions, performance ratings, and other people’s reactions toward the focal person.

At the same time, what you are describing is a particularly severe case, which is not often studied in academic research. What we know is that receiving emotional and social support from friends and family matters. Negative effects on job attitudes often can be buffered via job autonomy and having a high-quality work relationship with your manager. Oftentimes, holding a job that is several levels lower than your skill level leads to status deprivation, so having other outlets off the job where you can meet your status, competence and growth could potentially be helpful.

dg2radn,t1_dg2ny1a,2017-04-10 15:35:11,science,"Unfinished PhD here, also worked many years as a lecturer. When my Masters initially went belly up I worked for a while full time in cafes. Then part time during some of the PhD. Then, when  my health took a turn for the worse and my sick leave ran out, worked in cafes again until even that proved difficult health wise. Now chronically ill, on disability pension, no formal employment. Not as qualified as you, but I'm very familiar with the existential terrain.

At first, it was extremely demoralising not being able to pursue my interests and do the work I was allegedly trained to do. It helps if you have a supportive, stable family situation even if your finances are in trouble. I didn't. Seriously, I think a lot of people should consider psychological counselling at this point, or take solace in religion, or whatever it takes not to have a full-blown crack up. Pro-tip: avoid excessive use alcohol or drugs at this precarious stage.

The second challenge was that the hospitality work required a lot of physical effort, and the unfamiliar routines were at first mentally taxing too. It doesn't help that you feel stupid for not being able to remember the price of a sandwich or latte or whatever, and your colleagues may even go out of their way to treat you like an idiot. Some may resent your previous education or work background, that's just a fact of life in these cases. You will probably feel your brain atrophy in the first few months, thanks to the repetitive tasks and lack of stimulation of the kind you are used to. 

I want to say: keep reading books and articles in your field, keep talking to your former colleagues, keep thinking about your interests every opportunity you can get. (Weekends etc.) But in the beginning, depending on how taxing your hospitality job happens to be, you may not have enough energy left over.

Fortunately, if you manage to look after your physical and mental health during this time, that doesn't last forever. Eventually your new job will become more routine and automatic, and as a result less mentally taxing. It might be physically tiring still, but even that  will improve as you become more physically fit from all the standing. Working as a barista in a busy cafe, my arms got a lot stronger too; so your body adjusts within limits. Some of the customers you meet actually enjoy being served by someone with a bit of cultural or educational capital, they find it flattering to their sense of their own education. Use this to your advantage in your new career. If your bosses are smart, they'll know that it's a drawcard that you have which other employees might not. You might even get promoted, or have your pay increased, for this reason.

Nevertheless: as soon as you can, energy levels permitting, turn your former career into a hobby. You'll still feel wistful about not being able to take it further (in the immediate term), but it's best not to indulge that feeling. Banish any thoughts of status anxiety, nevertheless. It doesn't help.

My own predicament is obviously a lot ""worse"" than many, in that I may never return to academia on account of my health. (I was in a field with no commercial applications, so academia was my only real option.) However, I've really managed to turn things around existentially. Within the limits afforded by my health, I now do research from home that is related to the field in which I used to operate. It's more as a hobbyist, and not quite as intensive or demanding as writing my dissertation, but I'm having a great time with it. It's even liberating being able to dabble, and switch focus from time to time, working on smaller projects without worrying about deadlines. I even started a blog, where I put up my work. Truth be known, I have actually improved my *knowledge of the field* in some key areas, now that I'm not so myopically focused on my narrow PhD topic. Some the *skills* related to my field have also improved, as I look over the work I did years ago and spot mistakes that wouldn't have occurred to me previously. 

Now that I've been forced out of the Ivory Tower, I'm even taking an interest in the knowledge gap between experts in my field, and interested lay people. I get on social media and meet laypeople, get heckled by their questions, and embrace the challenge of closing the knowledge gap. (That's really how the blog began.) I'm still in contact with some of my former colleagues, including one of my thesis supervisors. There's plenty to talk about in this regard.

Finally, you have to admit, there are a lot of downsides to academic life. The career track isn't always that wonderful. The deadlines, publish or perish, the politics, the compromises, the hours. It's pretty sweet being liberated from such things. ",grass_skirt,t2_8amdu,6,0,reddit2

Self ratings are more relevant to explain the person’s own attitudes and reactions to the job, whereas other ratings are more relevant in predicting decisions made about the person (such as whether to hire the person).

The idea to study overqualification came as a result of my conversations with the HR director of the company, where they mentioned hiring many more college grads than in the past. I started reading on this topic and found out how little it was studied in management and industrial/organizational psychology at the time. This was in 2008 or so, so it was timely! 

What I found most surprising is how little we actually know about this topic, and how confident hiring managers seem to be that we know a lot.

There is some qualitative work on this subject, and there are a few assumptions companies seem to be making: They would leave quicker, they would ask for more money, they would be a challenge to manage, they would act superior to coworkers, and there is something wrong with them (why are they interested in this position?). There are many jobs where hiring surplus skills at a discount would be great and these skills can be utilized for the benefit of the company. Other companies may be right to be sensitive to this issue (what if this person comes, leaves quickly and takes my clients with them?).

Intelligence is an interesting topic. Most overqualification literature examines having qualifications such as education, training, experience and other skills that exceed job requirements. At the same time, there are a small number of studies that looked at “cognitive overqualification” which is having intelligence and cognitive abilities that exceed what the job requires and utilizes. It is moderately correlated with perceived overqualification, and is related to job attitudes and performance. So it is definitely an important concept, with implications for organizational behavior.

Abstract

Chitin, the second most abundant biopolymer in nature, is available in the seafood industry's waste streams. In this pioneering study, chitin from waste shrimp shells was processed into chitin nanocrystals and nanofibers (Ch-NCs and Ch-NFs) for evaluation in the cement paste. The results show Ch-NCs delayed the final set time by up to 106 min, likely by electrostatic repulsion of cement particles, but Ch-NFs imparted only a max 78-min delay. Furthermore, the viscosity of fresh cement paste increased with Ch-NFs but did not significantly change with Ch-NCs. These different outcomes are attributed to more mobility of Ch-NCs rods versus the Ch-NFs network. In addition, nanochitin forms at 0.05 wt% of cement significantly increased 28d flexural strength by ∼40% and compressive strength by up to ∼12%. The encouraging results of this study indicate the promise of nanochitins in tailoring fresh and hardened properties of cement-based materials for target applications.

iiqdv2o,t3_weit16,2022-08-03 02:44:58,science,"The fact that these are biodegradable, as well as the potential quality control aspects gives me cause for concern. I'm not saying they can't be effectively used, but there are aspects of concrete that make me skeptical and in the best case it will require years of testing before it would be widely accepted. Worth noting it appears this testing was in mortar cubes, not concrete. Cement and concrete are not the same, and the properties in mortar cubes do not necessarily correlate predictably to concrete (this cuts both ways, some of my gripes below in concrete may not even be issued, though some could also be worse in concrete).

Concrete is porous and the more common mixes will absorb water and air. They are also alkaline, which may be relevant to how this stiff performs over time. I would be concerned that some of the benefits may be compromised as concrete ages if these things break down. We're talking 40 year service life being common, and sometimes more, and the potential for damages being costly in both money and life/safety.

Yes, sometimes longer set time can be a benefit in some applications, but it is far more common that concrete producers are trying to do the opposite, speed it up. Long hauls would be a time they are hoping to slow down, but those tend to apply to remote areas where it would be harder to get this material in the first place (and other options are available and established). Hot weather is another time longer set would be helpful, but if they are talking vicat goes up by 100+ minutes that is about double, and in hot weather you need just a little longer; too much and your water of convenience disappears, workability goes away, drying shrinkage occurs, etc. (Yes the crews complain they need more time but a better solution is to add manpower to be able to do the work in less time so that proper curing practices in place sooner^(/s, in that anyone familiar with concrete knows these are laughable expectations))

The strength benefits sound good, but again other products including wastes from coal power or steel production also increase compressive strength; fibers or reinforcement can have greater impacts on flexural strength.

The article talks about chiten, but that calcium carbonates make up most of the material. Well cement plants have easy access to calcium carbonate as most are located right by limestone quarries. In fact it is already added to cement and US markets are finally transitioning to Portland-limestone cements that use more limestone and reduce carbon emissions about 10% relative to ordinary Portland cements (which can still include lesser amounts of limestone). 

Again, it could be doable but there would have to be much more research before producers are going to accept it/add something new that could negatively affect their products.

Finally, yes concrete is responsible for significant portions of CO2 emissions, but that is partly because we use a lot of it. We use a lot of it because it is strong and durable. When looking at lifetime emissions related to concrete, that actually means it is greener than many alternatives (and for things like buildings there are other benefits, such as lower operating emissions associated with heating and cooling; when considering lifetime emissions of buildings the operating emissions often dwarf the embodied emissions of the structure).",palmej2,t2_47gipy3s,1,0,reddit3

They saw a 40% increase in strength in how the concrete can bend and a 12% improvement in the ability to compress it.

the press release doesnt say how much portland cement they can substitute out for chitin. the paper doesnt really suggest replacing any cement. the chitin is added at 0.05% by weight of cement. this is not a very clear way of describing the formula, in my opinion. it would suggest that for 94lbs (43kg) of portland cement (a common unit in the US ) theyre adding 0.05lb (23g) of nanochitin.

iisn8im,t1_iiqbppq,2022-08-03 15:48:34,science,"We already have a range of options for concrete strength and select the one that is most economical.  If 12% more compressive strength meant 10% less concrete in the world, that would be great.  But beyond my skepticism that dumping shrimp shells into concrete would ever make it to market in any widespread way, my experience is that a non-standard mix for concrete would need to be substantially less expensive (20%?) to gain wide-spread adoption.

Also, the concrete itself is only one part of the cost of using concrete.  Forming, installing rebar, etc. are all fairly labor intensive and probably make up the majority of the cost of any given chunk of installed concrete.  (This breakdown is something a concrete contractor would know.  I don't.) Reducing the volume/weight of the installed concrete on large-scale projects would have an appreciable cost savings, but probably would not significantly reduce the labor costs to set up the formwork and put in the rebar if it's only a 12% increase in compressive strength.  A 10"" thick concrete foundation wall is not 10% less expensive than a 12"" thick wall for a typical building because it has close to the same formwork, rebar and labor.

I am not opposed to making concrete better (and particularly to finding ways to reduce the carbon emissions associated with it!) but there is a constant stream of baloney thrown at the problem (""just shred X and toss it in!"" is something that gets press-released pretty regularly) with none of it ending up being adopted, which leaves me a bit cynical about this story.",tomdarch,t2_6nyeg,2,0,reddit3

Any seafood that’s wild-caught also comes with “bycatch”—other fish and sea creatures caught up in the nets that aren’t intended to be caught. Bycatch is discarded, but not necessarily still living after the whole process. Shrimp apparently has the highest bycatch rate. The naturalist said that the number was for every one shrimp, nine other creatures are caught/killed (I just did a quick Google search to verify that number and saw some better and some worse ratios out there, so not sure the exact number, but it’s not good).

So is farming shrimp any better? No, but for a whole different reason. You’re avoiding killing the bycatch this way, but shrimp are typically farmed in areas like mangroves, and that destroys the area/ecosystem there. Mangroves are SO important for so many reasons, there’s just nothing good about losing them to shrimp farms.

iiq1imj,t1_iipr2ou,2022-08-03 01:12:10,science,"No.  A different test is used in the oilfield, it rather 2 different tests.  These test are fortunately very well defined and absolutely critical.  If a cement job goes wrong on an oil rig it can cost a lot of money and cause a phenomenal amount of environmental damage.  Everyone involved uses the same tests and methodology because the cost of failure is so high.

The first one is the consistometer which basically measures how thick the slurry is given a specific heating regime.  The regime will be designed to roughly simulate the actual heating observed by the cement given downhole conditions and expected shear rates
 When the cement has hardened this is called the thickening time which is a bit misleading as at this point the cement is a solid, it just has no significant strength.  You want this time to be the length of time it will take to mix and pump in place plus a safety margin.  For measuring the compressive strength you use a UCA (ultrasonic cement analyser). you use the consistometer to condition the fluid for how long you think it will take to mix and pump, transfer to the UCA which uses ultrasonic transmission to determine the compressive strength.  Usually you want this to be over a certain value as quickly as possible so you don't have to wait on the cement.  Nobody likes waiting in the oil industry.  It costs money.

It was quite fun to be honest.  There are a huge range of additives required and they can interact in different ways with different cements.  We ended up using certain sugars for a lot of retarders (massively cut back with inert filler).  The one sugar we settled on was really good and gave a real nice right angle set.",koombot,t2_gbtnr,21,0,reddit3

iirju7y,t1_iiqa08d,2022-08-03 10:33:43,science,"Cement is the binder in concrete.  The remainder is ""aggregate"" (sand and gravel).  When you add water, the cement recrystallizes with mostly long skinny crystals.  That's what locks the aggregate in place.

You need a certain amount of water for the curing process to go to completion.  So fresh concrete is often covered or watered to keep it moist.  The reaction slows down as it nears completion, so the strength rise is fast the first few days, but can slowly continue for months and years.  

They commonly measure the strength at 28 days, because that is a typical time by which they want to put loads on it in construction.  But for other jobs they will measure it at shorter or longer times.  How you measure the strength is by pouring one or more test cylinders at the same time and out of the same mix as your project.

The results of this research are incredibly unsurprising. Scientists have known about the connection between injection wells and earthquakes for a long time. Because fracking has become such a political issue, you will see a lot of people try to distinguish between the actual hydraulic fracturing technique, which does not cause quakes, and wastewater injection, which does.

d7zw2qu,t1_d7zk526,2016-09-24 06:54:31,science,"I worked in the oil and gas industry in the Barnett Shale area, northwest of Fort Worth through 2012 and 2013. My family lives in Boyd, Texas, and some of the worst earthquakes in the state were in that region; Boyd, Decatur, Haslett, and, especially Azle.

While I joined the industry because the money was good, and they were in the middle of a natural gas boon, I found the conditions in which they would drill and produce appalling. I have a background in science and chemistry, though I ended up graduating with a degree in advertising. They didn't care; as long as I could mix chemicals and not mess up too badly, I could get a job with no experience and start out at $75k with a company truck I could use for personal recreation, no questions asked, as well as a company credit card for almost all of my meals. Fresh out of college, it was a dream come true.

The amount of salt water, or brine, that's lifted with these natural gas wells is staggering. In this area, wells would dot the landscape, with up to a dozen drilled on a single pad, and the pads being a quarter mile separated. In Wise county alone I can recall 1,600 wells with just our account with Devon. I bet there were probably 2-3 times that number total between all of the natural gas companies. 18-wheeler trucks would line up, preparing to pull the water produced from these wells to bring them to the disposal wells 24 hours a day. And, let me tell you, the water that's drawn from these wells, is not tap water. Highly acidic, salty, and most often, saturated with what was called 'condensate' (hydrocarbon chains that were too saturated to become natural gas/oil) causing the water to be flammable and explosive. You can imagine the corrosive effects these had on giant steel storage tanks built out in a pasture. Legally they had to be behind containment walls in the event of a failure, but any rain or shifting of soil rendered these useless. Landowners would often try to fight these gas companies when their cattle would try to drink the water and be found dead near the wells, but the money they paid them was too damn good, I guess.

The EPA is a dirty word in this industry. They're just a bunch of hippies that are trying to stop us from doing our jobs, or so the workers would say. The entire time I was there, I had a horrible feeling of guilt that I couldn't justify or shake off. Thankfully, I found another position before the price of natural gas crashed, and before I got too deep into the horrible, careless act that is fracking and saltwater disposal. They don't think the earthquakes could possibly be caused by fracking. The simple people that work the rigs and production pipelines are too concerned with earning money for their family's welfare than to worry about what it will do to some plants or rabbits. To them it's just a job, and God is the one who makes earthquakes and if people weren't so sinful, we wouldn't have so many (actual quote from a coworker at the time).

Without this industry, Wise county, and I'm sure many others, would have hardly any industry to speak of. Odessa/Permian wouldn't exist and Houston wouldn't be nearly the city it is now, we're it not for the oil and gas industry. It's hard for the people her to admit their fault, just as it is for most Americans to go without gas-powered cars, or coal-generated electricity.

In fracking you drill straight down with a large hole, then when you get to the layer you want to frack, you drill small holes out in all directions. Those holes are then blasted with a mixture of water, lubrication, and other chemicals. This causes tiny cracks to become larger cracks that more oil can flow from. 

Problem is that this lubrication mixture is very hard to clean up. So what do these companies do with it? Well many of them will just put it all back into this massive well when they've finished getting oil out of it.

So we're leaving massive amounts of lubricants in the crust and are then surprised when said crust starts to shift. ",Zaldin89,t2_dugre,-1,0,reddit4

What may be causin the earthquakes? - faults are everywhere, most inactive. The crust has enough energy to fail or fault everywhere.

Basically they don't move and cause earthquakes because the frictional resistance is higher than the stress the fault is undergoing. 

To answer your question, the problem they are encountering is that they are pumping the effluent in at too high of a rate, causing large releases along the previously inactive fault structures. If the earthquakes it is causing were small then it wouldn't be a big deal. Since there have been some at magnitudes of 4 and higher, it has become a much bigger issue. Overall, it isn't really releasing stresses that are increasing with time, it is reducing the frictional resistance along the fault structure and reactivation previously inactive or minimally active faults.

I guess the big moral question is actually, would oklahoma have had a big earthquake before waste water injecting? And I think most geologists would agree with me and say no, no it would not. It's not an active system and it is pretty far from the plate boundary (California). It isn't impossible, just very unlikely.


Also, injecting water into rock doesn't increase the stress the rock is under. It just makes the rock easier to break with the current stress. So (my opinion) most of these earthquakes probably wouldn't have happened if we hadn't 'weakened' the rock.  ",chipuha,t2_b878r,1,0,reddit4

Injection wells are just one way to dispose of produced water (not crystal clear drinking water, full of salts and emulsified hydrocarbons, and nasty shit) produced during the production of oil from an oil well.

Even if an oil well isn't frac'd, it will produce a fuck ton of water. Typical numbers for our operations are nearly 1 million barrels of water used in a frac, and then 3-4 million barrels of water produced over the economic life of the well to recover ~1 million barrels of oil.  The most economic way to dispose of the water is typically just to inject it down another well. In areas where freshwater for fracs is a rare commodity, though, the produced water is typically filtered and then used for frac'ing.

If injection wells were outlawed tomorrow it would not stop frac'ing. It would just make producing oil slightly more expensive and compel operators to recycle the water they produce from oil wells for fracs rather than injecting it and sourcing new water.",,,9,0,reddit4

The oldest operating reactors are Oyster Creek in New Jersey, and Nine Mile Point 1 in New York. Both reactors entered commercial service on December 1, 1969. The last newly built reactor to enter service was Tennessee's Watts Bar 1 in 1996.

Even the newest reactor installed in the US, the Watts Bar 1, is a Pressurized Water Reactor or PWR  (as are most nuclear reactors used globally). Because water acts as a neutron moderator, it is not possible to build a fast neutron reactor with a PWR design.

Fast neutron reactors can reduce the total radiotoxicity of nuclear waste, and dramatically reduce the waste's lifetime (from tens of millenia down to a few centuries). They can also use all or almost all of the fuel in the waste. These reactors can also use as fuel much of the plutonium waste from older reactors that is currently being stored, as I understand.

Research and development for nuclear energy programs faces significant public opposition nationally and globally, so progress is slow.",ChrisS227,t2_b694d,44,0,reddit4
d7zlzii,t1_d7zkn40,2016-09-24 00:44:56,science,"Grad student studying Nuclear Engineering here. There are a variety of modern reactor designs that overcome/mitigate the controversies surrounding nuclear energy, but America is still mostly running on the older designs, because the NRC has to make sure you're not going to cause another Fukushima and because it's really, really expensive to build an entire new nuclear plant. The cheapest reactor design is the one you've already paid for, after all. 'Fast' reactors, in particular, leave less spent fuel behind, since they burn more of it--some U-238 gets fissioned alongside U-235, assuming you're using uranium fuel instead of a plutonium or thorium cycle.

> The reactors we have now are the equivalent of still driving a model T because people think going faster than 20 mph will kill you.

We know how to use nuclear energy in a much safer manner, with modern designs. Fukushima was not state-of-the-art: it was Generation II+, and even so, it had to be hit with an earthquake and a tsunami to fail catastrophically. New nuclear plants being built are usually Generation III, and our most modern designs are Generation IV, which are probably going to pop up in China in a few years. Among the Generation IV designs are gas-cooled reactors, which you really have to try your damnedest to get any radiation out of, and molten salt reactors, which have a much more visible hype on Reddit.",,,18,0,reddit4

Since it has contacted oil, it will never be safe for drinking, and making it safe for other processes is an extremely expensive process. So operators drill another well away from the first and pump the water downhole. It serves a dual purpose: first, it's good for storage and second, it pushes the oil toward the original hole, which helps production.

[Wastewater injection has been in widespread use since the 1930s](https://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells).  It's been regulated by the EPA since the 1970s.  There are currently 6 categories of waste injection wells, categorized based on their functions, which allows for consistent regulations based on class.  So engineers, scientists, and regulators generally consider injection to be a safe and effective way to get rid of hazardous materials.  

(The word ""hazardous"" there has a pretty broad meaning.  For example, injection wells are often used to dispose of brine -- saltwater -- that's naturally found in the ground and often produced in oil and gas wells.  You don't want the saltwater contaminating your freshwater supply like aquifers and rivers, so you just inject it back into the ground.  Saltwater is natural, and it's not inherently dangerous.  But it still qualifies as ""hazardous."")

A lot of this stuff about earthquakes is overblown.  To a seismologist, an earthquake is an earthquake.  But most of these earthquakes are properly categorized as micro-seismic events.  They're 0.8 to 3.0 on the Richter scale.  They occur underground, and most of them probably aren't even felt on the surface.  They still count as earthquakes, but they don't cause any surface damage or injuries.

So most oil and gas engineers and scientists -- and the EPA and other regulatory agencies -- think wastewater injection is fine because it's both safe and economical.  They don't oppose it, and they're the experts in the field.  

So you certainly *can* oppose wastewater injection because of earthquake risks.  That would be consistent.  But people don't have to oppose it.  They can think the downsides are reasonable in light of the upsides: cheap energy, jobs, etc.",mattymillhouse,t2_8619d,12,0,reddit4

 You clearly have no idea how many wells are out there, hundreds of thousands. I wouldn't be surprised is there is million+. Waste water isn't produced just from the drilling process. We are currently drilling the fewest we have in decades. Like the guy you replied to already said. Waste water is a by product of oil and gas production period. As long as any wells, at all, are being drilled there will not be less waste water. You would have to cease drilling and some production entirely to reduce waste water.

The produced well will be flowed for years before it's not economic to do anymore. I will say that in conventional wells there is a method of injecting called flooding used that does replace volume on a field wide scale. Although this is not common place in shale wells yet. EOG resources appears to be pioneering the method now in the eagleford, but even that is in its infancy.   

The produced water does get injected in many cases. It gets produced from the formation where it was for millions of years and injected somewhere else entirely. In a well designed and regulated injection well the water gets injected into, say an old field that has been depleted already and can handle the volume without exceeding the state that it was for millions of years before it was depleted.

The team then went further. Using computer simulations, and the bulging ground as a constraint, the researchers found that over time the wastewater seeped away from the injection point and boosted water pressure within the tiny spaces in the surrounding rocks—a parameter scientists call pore pressure. Eventually, the expanding front of increased pore pressure reached fault zones and triggered quakes between depths of 3.5 and 4.5 kilometers, Shirzaei says. The team’s models suggest the pore pressure in the rocks along the fault zones increased to a level that has been large enough to trigger aftershocks to major quakes elsewhere in the world, he notes.

d7zun22,t1_d7ztw22,2016-09-24 05:42:10,science,"Well, for one the chemicals used in fracking are kind of irrelevant to what you are talking about outside of ground water contamination. 

But really what you are talking about is a problem of volumes, so fracwater is no different from produced water in that case. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting some volume of water into a fault and pressurizing or even lubricating it, making it easier for movement to happen. The majority, the vast majority of this volume is produced water. Water that flows out of the well with the oil and gas being extracted. Water that has been in the formation for millions of years. Before the oil and gas was even formed. In a typical shale (fracked) well you are lucky if 40% of the volume produced is oil or gas and not water. 

Contamination of ground water actually isn't unique to fracking. And conventional well can leak too. And gas in the water isn't from chemicals. It's from gas. That comes from the rock being produced, not anything that gets pumped downhole. Additionally contamination of fresh water aquifers by produced water would be the major concern. But again this is from brackish undrinkable water (from the produced rock flowing into a fresh water aquifer in such high volumes that the water is no longer fresh.) That is why surface casing rules have been in place far longer than the fracking technique has been common place. To protect the ground water, not from ""chemicals"" but from produced water.  

So, it's not really the pressures and chemicals that make frack water different. It is the extent of the wells, as you said. The fracking technique has opened up sooo much production of oil and gas and water (again, water the has been in the produced rock millions of years, and is orders of magnitude higher in volume than fracwater) that mismanaged injection wells have become an issue now more than ever.

One thing to know about oil wells is that water is bad. Oil and water don't mix so they compete in the well.

But you are definitely thinking about this issue critically and asking good questions to try and understand the issue, so I applaud you for that. 
To be honest, what you are saying makes 100% sense at face value. If you remove volume from something you would expect that volume go somewhere based solely on conservation of mass. Like, why wouldn't the ground sink a little if you are taking millions of barrels out of a rock? And the reason that doesn't happen all the time is that not all the volume in the rock is incompressible and immobile. Because there is gas and oil with ""gas"" in solution in the rock It can maintain a constant volume, with a lower pressure in the interconnected pores than before. What you are saying can in fact happen, although I can't think of any examples I have personally seen or heard about. You gotta think though, oil production has been happening looooong before fracking became prevalent. So if this were a major issue, why would it not already be well understood and talked about?

There's nothing special about ""fracking wells"". They're drilled just like any other well, and yeah unless you live in Iran or something where the oil is literally pooling in the sand around you, that means you drill through water tables.

The frac fluid isn't injected until the well is drilled completely, cased with a frac-specced steel casing and then cemented between the casing and the surrounding bedrock to seal the well from all the formations around it. Then to check that the cement is set properly they run a special logging tool called a cement bond log that will show the quality of the cement bond. Only then, once the well has been completely sealed off from the rocks that are not of interest, is the frac fluid injected.

Unless you mean fracs that fracture vertically, through entire rock formations and connect oil/gas reservoirs with drinking water aquifers - in which case I don't agree that this is something which happens routinely if ever.",chuboy91,t2_6o4de,3,0,reddit4

>In 2014, in collaboration with Neurolab, which is directed by cognitive neuroscience professor Giuseppe Iaria, we designed a study to understand how a single night without sleep would impact people’s ability to understand the emotions of others.

>We used this test to measure empathy in a group of university students. First we tested everyone to understand how empathetic they were normally. Then we had a group spend the night in the lab where we kept them awake by playing board games, socializing and watching movies. After they had been awake all night, we re-tested them and compared their results to students who were sent home to have a good night of sleep.To do this, we developed a computer test that shows participants images of people in negative, positive and neutral situations. For example, we showed people in pain, people laughing and dancing or people just sitting at a table. We then asked participants to first describe what the people in the photo were feeling, and then how strong their own emotions were while looking at the pictures.

>Our findings were clear: Sleep-deprived students felt less empathy for people in negative situations than students who had had a good night’s sleep.

>But is it only extreme sleep deprivation, like staying up all night, that triggers this change?

My doctor warns me about taking Ambien too many nights in a row will make me sleep dependent, so for several months I switched to weed to sleep. Worked like a charm until I noticed that the weed wasn't hitting like it used to. I guess it was a tolerance to THC, because I could hang with Snoop Dogg as much as I was smoking.

Doctor recommended Benadryl, and/or valerian root in combination with THC, but those things just give me the 'twilight sleep' feeling. Mind is still racing. I think that part of my problem with the weed is what I'm using: Wedding Cake. It's big on couch-lock, low on psychotropic effects, and that may also be part of the trouble.

I do suffer from restlessness (eg restless leg syndrome, but often affects my entire body). Can make sleeping near impossible at times.


I'm usually disconnected emotionally. It's something a lot of people who know me or work with me have mentioned on occasion. I often find it too tiresome to deal with.

hiuy6ox,t1_hisbw71,2021-11-01 07:14:15,science,"Source: Disabled previous Firefighter, Flight Paramedic, SWAT Paramedic.

EMS and Fire agencies are chronically short staffed and have been for decades. The issue is the low pay and benefits. Over 70% of Firefighters in the US are volunteer, as an example. Though, even in areas with sufficient workers, agencies have little incentives to move away from 24 or even 48hr shift days. It lowers overhead costs for the department for a number of reasons. The effect it has on the employees are not cared about as a general rule. Its a meat grinder industry that turns out plenty of new recruits who are statistically unlikely to work 5 years in the field and will likely leave the field with lifelong mental health issues, the treatment of which will not be paid for by the agencies. Suicide rates in first responders are insanely high. Anecdotally, I went to 11 funerals for coworkers last year, all suicides. Being emotionally cold to others is the least of our worries.

More workers will always be needed in this field but it will likely never equate to more sleep for them. When financial concerns outline that the minimum number of staff be on duty at any given time, it will mean a lack of sleep.",Marshaze,t2_10jalw,1,0,reddit1
hiuy6yx,t1_hisbw71,2021-11-01 07:14:23,science,"Partially. The other thing that’s needed in the US is education on when to call 911 and what it’s used for. 

For example, went to the same residence three times in a weekend because an elderly man wanted to be carried upstairs because it was time to go to bed. He’d call each morning because it was time to go downstairs. When we got there he was laying on the floor by the stairs. The fire department had been called even more than that to assist him up and down the stairs that weekend. His adult son lived with him and the two of them refused to entertain a conversation about a nursing home. His adult son was very capable of assisting him upstairs but refused. 

Nursing homes have also figured out that they can call 911 to supplement their staff and then start paring down staff to save money. Out west it’s become a huge issue in certain states where the fire departments will go to a nursing home 10+ times a day to do anything from changing bandages to lifting/moving patients. Lobbyist groups for the nursing homes help use the money saved to line the politicians pockets and keep the system in place. 

We can’t refuse to go to a call when someone calls 911. Once we’ve made contact with a patient, we can’t leave their side or else it’s legally abandonment. That means there can be a cardiac arrest next door but we’re stuck with the first patient regardless of the complaint. A fun game we play on shift is “count the cars in the driveway.” We’ll get called out for something simple, elbow pain for example. There will be 6 cars in the driveway but everyone has this misconception that you’ll be seen faster at the hospital because you called 911. If you call 911 for elbow pain, and at the hospital someone drives up to the front door having a heart attack, the heart attack is going to a room first while you go to the waiting room. I’ve dropped people off in the waiting room more than I’ve taken them to a room.

Therefore the fewer hand overs you have , the fewer mistakes you will get.
Ergo, instead of having 3 shifts per day you can massively cut the error rate by only having 2 shifts per day.

I don’t know if this argument has a basis - but presumably there have been studies run showing that the errors from sleep deprivation by having fewer, but longer, shifts are outweighed by the errors from handovers that would happen if you had more, but shorter, shifts.",ImBonRurgundy,t2_112r4h,0,0,reddit1

He did everything just short of accusing me of being a drug seeker. It took me 20 minutes straight of talking to him to try to convince him that I was telling the truth about my symptoms. I have never been treated worse by a grown adult in my life.

If anyone here is thinking about all this and it seems like things are hopeless, a good psychiatrist is supposed to run a full-on interview with you before they diagnose you. They should be asking detailed questions about your entire life, and screening you with questionnaires. Any interview where they dismiss you after 10 minutes is not valid. It takes at least 30 minutes to diagnose this condition and rule out a lot of similar-looking conditions.

If it still feels hopeless, it's very expensive but you could go over their head and get a neuropsychological evaluation for ADHD. That's where a therapist administers tests to you for like 6 hours straight to see how your brain functions. Some psychiatrists actually require this to confirm your diagnosis, and I don't agree entirely with that unless it's clear the patient would be able to afford it, but it is a verification process that not a lot of people know about until it's ordered.

Barring that, search for doctors with high reviews in big cities. Rural areas have a lot more doctors who will be dismissive and work out of outdated versions of the DSM.

hisay93,t1_his5chb,2021-10-31 17:26:49,science,"TL;DR - Adderall. Lots of useful medication info below

That's a really good point. You might not even need to take a stimulant for it. Although stimulation medications are the most effective treatment for ADHD, there are other non-stimulant drugs that work very well in some people. Strattera is one of those. It acts similar to an antidepressant, but it works on one specific chemical norepinepherine in a specific part of the brain. It works very well for some people, but not for everybody, because it doesn't affect dopamine (more below).

If you did happen to eventually need to try a stimulant if that didn't work and other types of non-stimulants didn't work, I'm seeing people talk about how Vyvanse is a much more mild experience compared to Adderall - that it's easier to fall asleep on Vyvanse and it doesn't key you up the same way. There are many other options though, so don't despair if it's not for you.

I've just been diagnosed in July, and I'm on Adderall XR (generic) 25mg once a day, and I really hope to get on name-brand Adderall next month. When I tried something similar to name-brand Adderall instant release 15mg in the past (5 separate times), it made me \*SO TIRED\* that I fell asleep one of those times. But it also gave me energy that I really need to function normally.

**The #1 piece of advice** I can pass to anybody right now is that the generics do not act the same as the real brand-name medications. The brand-name medications are much more effective at quieting down my internal monologue and making it easier to pay attention when people are talking to me. Highly, highly effective. My intelligence went through the roof, and my depression was immediately reversed when I took that instant release. And Adderall XR has no good generics, even the Authorized Generics don't work as well.

The cool thing is that stimulants affect us differently from typical normally functioning people. We're not likely to become addicted to them like average people, and they really slow down our racing thoughts and relax our minds and bodies. To me, Adderall is a much more effective medication than any and all antidepressants and sedatives I've ever taken. The most chill of chill-pills.

What it is, is that our levels of action of neurotransmitters called dopamine and norepinepherine in the brain are so low compared to average people that we're so understimulated that we can't relax or focus. Dopamine is responsible for feeling conscious and relaxed and in-the-moment and good about things that entertain you. Norepinepherine is responsible for getting you active and ready to get up and do things. Dextroamphetamine (an active ingredient in a lot of stimulant medications) helps increase the availability and concentration of dopamine, norepinepherine, and serotonin in our brains.",,,21,0,reddit1

hit0l30,t1_hisvxdt,2021-10-31 20:25:18,science,"You might want to reconsider that. If any stimulant makes you sleepy, that's like a 100% clear indicator of ADHD. It happens in a large amount of people with ADHD who have a sleep deficit, but not all of them. It does not happen in neurotypical individuals.

Rationale: Stimulants stimulate you. If you take a stimulant and it calms you down, that's because you were understimulated - it brings you up to a normal level of calmness. That means you have a lack of dopamine in the brain. That means you have ADHD. This is general info, not directed at you or me, but this lack of stimulation may be difficult to notice if any other stimulants are involved like nicotine or THC. Remove all stimulants from your body, and if you're non-functional, that's ADHD.

If a neurotypical person takes a stimulant, it goes beyond that because they were already at a normal functional baseline of dopamine in the brain.

Coffee:  Makes me jittery and uncomfortable. Heart palpitations at the amount I need to have any effect on me (400mg+).

Totally treats my Restless Legs Syndrome, which also happens in all my other muscles throughout my body, especially the upper back pain - just gone. Much better than any anti-anxiety medication for me. Complete opposite of jittery and uncomfortable. Calms down my symptoms of OCD because I can get my life on track in every way. Reverses my social anxiety disorder.

The hemp-based stuff isn't quite as strong as the cannabis-derived CBD oil, but it does pretty well and you can take as much as you want (and it's legal everywhere). Just make sure it's full spectrum.

What I hate is that I'm in a legal state, but nobody carries the low-THC, cannabis-derived stuff anymore, because everyone just wants to get high (even at the medically-oriented shops; they used to carry it, but they couldn't sell enough).

hisrj2w,t1_hisktok,2021-10-31 19:22:48,science,"So, I have gone through the gauntlet when it comes to some of these medications. My issues aren't as extreme as narcolepsy, but given the chance, most days I'm capable of falling asleep sitting up if I decide to close my eyes for a bit.

By and large, Modafinil had the least side effects (for me), with a decent positive effect. It doesn't amp me up or cause hypo/hypermania. I don't notice much in terms of anxiety like some medications. It doesn't have a heavy withdrawal price if I miss taking it or run out at any given time that I've noticed (compared to other medications, at least).

The worst I have to say about it is how benign it feels. If you take too much, too late in the day, you will not fall asleep. It's not an amped up, got-things-to-do, got-everything-to-do!, feeling. It's a quiet buzzing of electrical activity that doesn't want to stop. It's like insomnia. Being tired, knowing you're tired, closing your eyes, and nothing happening. You're just laying there awake, with your eyes closed, and you don't drift off anywhere, let alone to sleep.

If I set an alarm an hour before I want to wake up (4:30-5:00am), take 100mg, then go back to sleep, the next time I wake up (6am) my brain is buzzing, awake, ready for the day. I may take another 50-100mg in the morning. If I'm feeling especially tired, I may take 200mg in the morning, maybe another dose if I remember to do it before 11am. But even though I may take up to 200mg in the morning, I won't take 50mg at 3pm in the afternoon if I want to get to sleep by 10pm. It -will- linger, and keep me up. If I miss it in the morning, I don't take it if I want to fall asleep within 10 hours, regardless of the dose.

I haven't experimented with large doses (though my normal amount may be considered large to some, I don't know). It took some getting used to knowing when I could take it so that it wouldn't mess up my sleep schedule, but after I figured that out it worked out pretty well.

Idk if this random comment on this random chain will help anyone, all experiences with medication are different and other people's experiences could vary widely from this. But this has been how it works for me.

-- Edit --

As an added side note, even though I deal with hypersomnia, if my sleep schedule gets messed up by staying up late or sleeping in, it can make it difficult for me to fall asleep at my normal time over the next few days. I have tried benadryl and unisom, and even taking half a pill they knock me out and make me feel like crap the next day.

Melatonin works wonders. I have a bottle of 5mg pills. If I want some help falling asleep, I might break one in half and take it an hour or two before I want to go to bed. If I -need to sleep in an hour-, then I take a whole one.

I don't smoke, and if I bought a 6-pack of beer, you'd probably find a couple still in the fridge 6 months later. I don't know how these things interact with anything I mentioned above.",AmInedible,t2_4477e3ad,1,0,reddit1

They're hitting REM sleep, although it can be severely fractured due to an underlying sleep disorder. And people can't stay awake for weeks at a time.

In college I was always sleepy, fell asleep in some classes there, too.  I would start hallucinating before falling asleep, dreaming with my eyes open.  I used to fall asleep at my night shift job too and I would wake myself up but not be able to move.  Like, I couldn’t physically make my eyes open.  

My senior year I started getting really frustrated that I wanted to pay attention during lectures but just couldn’t.  I suspected ADHD because it runs in the family and was also dealing with depression. I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with both.  The ADHD meds helped a little with being sleepy all the time but one of the things I kept bringing up was that I felt like I dreamed too much at night.  

My doctor finally referred me to get a sleep study.  Turns out I had narcolepsy.  I had something like 27 wake ups during my night sleep test and never went into deep sleep.  I fell asleep very quickly during the daytime tests.

Also I was sort of a bad patient on it.  I would take it but not be ready to go to bed so I’d fight the sleepiness so it wouldn’t work as well.

hiti36u,t1_hitfxzi,2021-10-31 22:39:24,science,"Yeah, generally there's two types: 

(There were some questions here, so this isn't *just* in response to your comment)

Full spectrum, which uses an extract of all the compounds in the plant. That can even include the chlorophyll, although many filter that out for taste these days.

CBD Isolate, in which they chemically extract the CBD into its pure form, and then add it to a carrier oil (or a vape, or whatever).

CBD on its own is good for some things (like anxiety, and probably seizures), but when you want the muscle relaxant and pain-relieving properties, then those extra terpenes and cannabinoids are really what work best (they are even stronger when all used together; it's called the ""entourage effect""). Actual cannabis has more of these compounds, and in greater quantity, but even with hemp-derived products it can make a difference (sometimes you have to take bigger doses).

I actually think that five CBD is a combination of the two; full spectrum extract with some extra CBD added for strength. 

I've tried isolate in the past, and it didn't do much for me. I hope that someday cannabis will be legalized federally so that we can get more of the cannabis CBD products; I suspect that people that use CBD are just going to the CBD stores and probably don't really know the difference.",abx99,t2_6kew9,2,0,reddit1

I got my single covered scan at 9 weeks, didn't even get another one when I slipped and fell down the steps at 7 months landing on my belly (had a severely sprained ankle, crutches are super fun when hugely pregnant). 

But I was ""lucky"" in one way - I suffered post-partum hemorrhage when I had my daughter so I got to stay for 2 whole extra days rather than get kicked out less than 24 hours after birth (for a while there they were basically shoving moms out the door a few hours after giving birth). 

My best friend had a baby the year prior to me, was sent home 18 hours after giving birth. She hemorrhaged at home a week later due to retained placenta (would have been caught if she'd had the usual ""let me check your uterine tone"" belly palpations the couple times it's done that she wasn't there for) and lost over 50% of her blood volume.

jfw5fui,t1_jfv02dd,2023-04-11 23:10:34,science,"The standard of care in most developed countries is very good without third trimester ultrasound. Women in proper antenatal care will have regular clinical growth measurements, fetal heart rate checks, blood pressure measurements, blood and urine tests and swabs for bacteria. There may be benefits but the benefits may not outweigh the costs. It’s one thing to say that it will reduce undetected breech by 71%, but what is the rate of undetected breech?

Let’s run some figures, not to conclusively answer the question but just to illustrate how it might not be clear cut:

Here’s a study from Australia https://ranzcogasm.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157.pdf which found that of the few percent of women who have a breech baby, only 2.2% of them were undetected. Let’s round that up and say it’s 1/1,000 women who have an *undetected* breech under current treatment. Now let’s add a routine third trimester ultrasound for every woman, and we’ll assume that that catches all the undetected breeches (although in reality some babies will be head down at ultrasound and then turn). How much is an ultrasound? When you factor in equipment, staff time, facility costs, liability etc $100 would be not a bad round number to mess around with. It might be more, probably not much less. So $100 for every women, and we are saying perhaps 1/1,000 will have an undiagnosed breech. So that’s $100,000 spent for every undiagnosed breech prevented.

Is that the right way to spend the money on women’s health? That’s a complex question. Every undiagnosed breech won’t end in disaster. At minimum it will generally create a high pressure situation for the mother and the medical staff to make quick decisions and deliver the right care.

Even if it a patient comes in active labor a sole presentation ultrasound takes 15 seconds to do.

C-sections have their uses and it's definitely nice to have the option, but *25% of live births are not emergency situations requiring a c-section*.

I get that equipment used on horses may not be approved for human use, but that seems like a drastic gap in availability and ease of use, so why wouldn’t human doctors have easy access to similar equipment (albeit likely at a higher price point)?

The machines can be tweaked and dialed to increase penetration, even different transducers can be used. However, this is often at the expense of image quality. They're constantly carefully navigating that balance. 

Additionally, in high body habitus patients sonographers will have to hold up the pannus of the patient with the wrist with which they're holding the transducer. This is not an inconsiderable amount of weight. 

In roughly one-third of all pregnancies the mother is pre-pregnancy obese. My wife is a high risk perinatal sonographer and none of her roughly 40 patients last week were below a pre-pregnancy BMI of 50.

Edit: One thing to try is if you have a mouse, move it away to the side at a distance as if you were pretending to scan someone.

The hospital stay though is ballpark $16,000-$20,000; so pretty much you're going to hit that $3,000-$5,000 deductible that year regardless assuming you confine your pregnancy to a single insurance year.

I mean alright, of course if you're 100 miles away from a proper hospital then fine, but distribution is proximal and not the ultimate cause. Most of it is an effect of poor planning on infrastructure and investment to ensure far flung areas are properly served.

For example in a public system none of the services are expected to make much money so they can cross subsidise low population areas. It's one system so its all connected. In a system like the US where it's private, no single area should be making a loss. That means services will be withdrawn much sooner than in a socialised system where costs are spread out and profit is a secondary consideration.",XihuanNi-6784,t2_12n7mq,4,0,reddit2

My question is not most directly related to your project, but I feel your input may be valuable to all; what in the universe is the driving force for rising sophistication of matter? First it's seemingly the gravity, energy gradients, entropy that drives the formation of heavier elements. Cycles of star systems, all guided by fundamental laws create more sophisticated chemistry through time. And eventually this sophisticated chemistry approaches a transcendent point, where self replication, mutation, and evolution begins. No longer is sophistication governed *only* by various types of fields and gradients, but it maintains an ability to hold on to structure that evolves into greater structure through time. And there is even one more transcendental step that our terrestrial lineage of evolution has already went through-- the ability to communicate and not confine the evolution of sophistication to a Darwinian-type mechanism, where time is a heavy dampening factor. And I can continue my progression into the next probable transcendence point, but I don't mean to preach. I hope I have written enough to guide you to answer my question. I tricked you perhaps... my question may be the ultimate question which I expect no concrete strictly scientifically defensible answer for. Purely I am interested in your outlook on the universe.

Great question! This is still one of the outstanding issues in planetary science. The first isotopic analysis of a cometary coma was performed during a flyby of comet Halley by the Giotto spacecraft. These data suggest that the deuterium (heavy hydrogen)-to-hydrogen ratio (D/H) of the comet is much larger than that of the Earth’s oceans, by roughly a factor of two. Subsequent measurements of D/H ratios in comet Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake using radio astronomy appeared to support this result. The D/H ratio of the Earth seemed more consistent with the water found in carbonaceous asteroids – which is usually locked up in clay minerals. Recently the Herschel Space Observatory revealed an ocean-like ratio in the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2, reopening the debate. We [performed experiments]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063311002455) that show that the D/H ratio in the vapor can be very different than in the comet nucleus. So, bottom line, we still have a way to go to determine whether comets or asteroids delivered the water for our oceans.",dslauretta,t2_dvy3e,139,0,reddit3

While this is not my area of expertise I will provide a high-level answer. Mars probably formed further away from the Sun than the Earth and incorporated higher levels of volatile elements (those elements that like to stay in the vapor phase at lower temperatures). One element in particular that could affect the chemistry of the core of Mars is sulfur.

Asteroids contain a wide range of minerals and chemicals. Many of these are similar to those found on planets such as silicates and oxides. However, the interiors of some asteroids are chemically distinct from the planets and many minerals are found only in meteorites (fragments of asteroids that land on Earth). In addition, carbonaceous asteroids contain a wide range of organic molecules such as amino acids. These minerals and chemicals formed very early in the history of our solar system – either through condensation in the protoplanetary disk or during geologic processing in the asteroid interior.

The baseline science requirement is 60 grams (about 2 ounces) of asteroid regolith. However, we also have to be able to measure the amount of sample collected before we stow the sample collector in the return capsule. We measure the moment of inertia of the spacecraft both before and after sample acquisition. It turns out that this technique has a measurement uncertainty of 90 grams (3-sigma). Therefore, our sample collector (TAGSAM) is required to pick up 150 grams of material. Under optimum conditions, TAGSAM can pick up two kilograms of material.

We have the capability to attempt sample collection three times. However, we hope to get enough sample on the first attempt. The second two are backup options in case the first attempt does not pick up enough material. 

Spectral analysis of Bennu suggests that it is similar on composition to the very rare CI and CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These rocks are rich in organic compounds and water-bearing minerals like clays. 

We have science team members that are dedicated to studying the asteroid geology of Bennu. We are particularly interested in the processes that form regolith and cause it to migrate along the asteroid surface.

Target selection for OSIRIS-REx was originally driven by engineering constraints. First, we decided to use a Lockheed-Martin heritage spacecraft. That meant using solar power and trying to keep the thermal control system relatively simple. Using solar power limited how far out into the Solar System we could travel - setting a limit of 1.8 AU on the aphelion of the target's orbit. The thermal control limit constrained how close to the Sun we could go - limiting the perihelion of the orbit. Together these two constraints defined the semi-major axis and eccentricity of potential targets.

The next constraint was the total energy of the mission. We needed a target with relatively low delta-V (total change in velocity). We also needed a trajectory that limited the re-entry velocity of the Sample Return Capsule - since we are using a heritage design from the Stardust mission. These parameters limited the inclination of the asteroid orbit to less than 10 degrees.

These orbital constraints rapidly collapsed the number of potential targets to around 200 asteroids. The next constraint was on the size of the object. It turns out that asteroids smaller than ~200 meters tend to be rapid rotators - some spinning once every minute or so. We used absolute magnitude as a proxy for size - dropping the number of potential targets to about 20.

The final criterion was driven by science. We wanted a target that was likely to be rich in carbon and water - a carbonaceous asteroid. Of the twenty or so targets that met our dynamical constraints - only five were known to have low albedo and therefore likely to be carbonaceous. Bennu rose to the top of the list based on the extensive ground-based data set - particularly the fantastic shape model information that had been obtained from the Arecibo and Goldstone Planetary Radar telescopes.

There are three lines of evidence that constrain the average grain size on Bennu. First, in addition to the shape model, the radar astronomy also provided information on the radar polarization ratio. Basically, we transmit a beam with a specific circular polarization and measure how much of the returned energy comes back with the opposite polarization. These data show that the transition to radar roughness occurs at a scale smaller than lowest radar wavelength - 3 cm.

Next, we used the Spitzer space telescope to determine the average thermal inertia of the surface. Lower thermal inertia values mean smaller grain sizes. These data suggest that the average grain size on Bennu is on the order of a millimeter.

Finally, the asteroid shape reveals a prominent ridge at the equator - suggesting that there is loose material moving around on the surface and collecting at the geopotential lows (the valleys of Bennu) - which lie at the equator. ",dslauretta,t2_dvy3e,16,0,reddit3

We plan to make a direct measurement of the [Yarkovsky Effect]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQtj0RhimZY).

We can measure this from the ground but the signal-to-noise ratio is low. We will get a much more accurate measurement by tracking the spacecraft in the vicinity of Bennu. In addition, using our thermal emission spectrometer, we will get spatially resolved information on the total amount of radiation emitted from the asteroid surface as a function of the time of day.

I have been working on this mission concept [since 2004](http://dslauretta.com/2014/03/06/ten-years-of-spacecraft-design/). It took seven years to convince NASA to select the mission for flight, so we have been working in earnest since May 2011. Sample return occurs in 2023 and we have an additional two years for sample analysis, so end of mission is in 2025.

Space exploration satisfies the innate human desire to explore and discover new lands and new opportunities. It supports fundamental scientific research into our origins and our destiny. Engineering challenges that are solved for space exploration often find their way into consumer products that make our life better. Space assets are critical to our modern society, providing weather information, telecommunications, and defense support.

The classic model for solar system formation predicts a chemical gradient with distance from the Sun in the solar nebula (the cloud of gas and dust from which our solar system formed). This model does a great job of predicting the basic chemistry of the planets (rocky planets near the Sun, gas giants in the middle, ice giants in the outermost region). Together with my graduate student Jade Bond, we applied this theory to extrasolar planetary systems to predict the composition of planets around other stars. One of the most interesting results – we predict that ~20% of extrasolar planets are carbon-rich (as opposed to the oxygen-rich planets in our system).",dslauretta,t2_dvy3e,11,0,reddit3

cgt67us,t1_cgt44sg,2014-04-15 17:55:37,science,"Not my writing, but Someone had a beautiful answer as to why an average person should care about such scientific discoveries. 

Imagine you woke up naked in a field, in the middle of nowhere. You have no idea where you are, or how you got there. What do you do? First, you'd probably go into survival mode; you'd look for the basic necessities to sustain life: water, food, and shelter from the elements.

Once you had everything you needed to stay alive, and you knew that, if nothing else, you could at least remain in your current location indefinitely, you might start to wonder what in the hell happened: one minute you're bouncing around Reddit, the next you're bare-ass in the middle of nowhere.

After you come to grips with the reality of the situation, you'd probably want to try and figure out where in the hell you are. You might try and look for clues from your environment or maybe a constellation you recognize, or perhaps you decide to do a little exploring around the immediate area, to see if there's anything around that could give you some clue as to where in the hell you are.

Let's say that your efforts reveal that you're in the middle of Africa. Once you've figured out where you are, you only have two choices left: stay there and simply exist as long as you can, or attempt to get back to civilization; either option has it's own risks.

If you chose to stay where you are, then that's essentially it for you, you now know how your future will play out: you'll remain at your current location until you either die of old age, or your area becomes unable to sustain life. Either way, the game is over for you; your entire existence becomes about survival, and you're just running out the clock until, at some point in the future, you cease to exist.

Maybe you decide to try and leave a message for someone to find in the future, maybe you're content to simply fade off into oblivion, either way, your fate is sealed.

Now let's say you decided to try and get back to civilization. Since you know where you are, your logical next step is going to be to try and figure out someplace to go, and then of course, how to get there. Now you have a goal, something you're striving towards. Life ceases to be about mere survival and becomes an epic journey to get you where you want to go.

This is the timeline of humanity. We woke up with nothing, on a little rock, in the middle of nowhere. We figured out how to survive, and we struggled to come to grips with our own reality. Then we started exploring, trying to find out just exactly where we were in the Universe. Now we're faced with the same choice: exist, or move on.

You ask if it's something that a ""regular guy REALLY needs to know"", to me it's the most important thing he/she needs to know: that humanity chooses more than an existence of mere survival. That humanity chooses to move forward and keep exploring and expanding. To know that, even though we might never make it, at least we're making the effort. That we have hope.

The alternative is to simply run out the clock and wait to fade off into oblivion.",grizzlez,t2_9xsqu,12,0,reddit3

So follow up question(s): what do you make of the viability of such proposals/how high up are they on the NASA-approved protocols for asteroid deflection?

NASA doesn’t have any approved protocols for asteroid deflection . . . yet. Most of the work in this area is theoretical. There is a great article on using Yarko to deflect an asteroid that was published in [Wired last year](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/painting-asteroids/). The closest NASA has come on this topic is the [Asteroid Redirect Mission]( http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/initiative/#.U017Kcc2zaY), which proposes to use a bag or claw to grab a small asteroid and propel it back to Earth with rocket engines.",dslauretta,t2_dvy3e,11,0,reddit3

cgt7jve,t1_cgt6jjv,2014-04-15 18:38:43,science,"> I do have another question though in regards to this: if you did find the building blocks of life in the asteroid, is it possible that Bennu was an asteroid generated in the hypothesized Giant Impact with Earth and Theia in the creation of the moon? If so, could life have started on Earth and been sent into space on this asteroid; or did Earth have the wrong conditions for the formation of life at this time? In other words, is there a way to prove that the building blocks did not come from Earth first?

We have done a lot of work to infer the origin of Bennu. Its current orbit is highly unstable and it will either collide with a planet or the Sun in a few million years. It is most likely a collisional fragment of a large (~100-km) main belt asteroid that experienced a catastrophic disruption ~0.7 – 2 billion years ago. It was delivered to near-Earth space from the inner main asteroid belt via a combination of Yarkovsky-induced drift and interaction with giant-planet orbital resonances. 
The question of Earth fragments in space is intriguing. It is certainly feasible that chunks of the Earth with fossilized life are floating around out there. One idea that I have heard is that such remnants are likely preserved on the surface of the Moon, making lunar exploration an attractive area for studying the ancient Earth. To date, we have never identified a meteorite that originated from the surface of the Earth.

kp7fqvz,t3_1akflni,2024-02-06 17:45:18,science,"> The research, led by UCL in collaboration with the University of Southampton and Queen Mary University, London, analysed the work and sleep patterns of over 25,000 men and women between 2012 and 2017.

> The researchers found that compared to people who worked a standard 35-40 hour week, those working 55 hours a week or more had the poorest sleep – including short sleep and sleep disturbance. Short sleep is defined as less than seven hours a night and sleep disturbance as struggling to fall asleep within 30 minutes, waking up in the middle of the night or early morning, and a self-rating of poor-quality sleep.
>
>Those who worked most or all weekends and nonstandard patterns, like shifts, also experienced sleep disturbance, and either short sleep or long sleep – more than eight hours a night.

My memory is becoming a blur and days just blend into one big muddled mess. Every week I fly trips that take me through multiple time zones and I lose a day going west. Takeoff at midnight on the west coast. Fly in darkness all night to Asia. Land in late or mid morning the next day. Exhausted and need sleep but it's now daytime at the hotel. Try to get some sleep on my layover (it's very broken and restless even though im beyond exhausted). Then takeoff the next day just as the sun sets. Fly all night eastbound through all the timezones again. Gain a day again. See the sunrise  2/3 of the way back. Land afternoon the day before (since I gained a day) back in the US. Drive home to see the sunset once more as I unpack. In certain times of year I can see a sunset and sunrise and sunset again within one flight.

This has destroyed my circadian rhythm. Your body cues off of light for that. It takes me a couple days to adjust to normal passage of time and light on my days off, which is just in time to do it over again. Every week. Over and over and over. Year after year.

I then get 16 shifts a year off for ""Free"" to make up for the fact that we only get four days off between sets and never five. (So that's before my vacation which is essentially another 16 paid shifts). Since a full set of 4 off ends up being 12 off, and I get 8 total sets off, I feel like I get a ton of time off, but...

I also pick up a ton of overtime, last year I hit my own personal record and worked a lot. So the time off ends up being turned into extra money. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes I'll just take the time off, but I can choose.

For me though sleep is important and if that means sacrificing elsewhere I will do it. I am in bed early before dayshifts, and make sure to get 7-8 hours in between or after nightshifts too.

On the positive side, having days off during the week to do things is super useful, and the amount of days off I can get if I choose not to work overtime at all is really nice too. I don't really want to go back to working five 8 hour days mon-fri ever again.",Shamensyth,t2_45hwu,1,0,reddit4

All they report (buried in the discussion at that) is that of the mothers tested, 39% were positive for THC. So whatever method providers use to suggest testing is apparently pretty good.

I previously worked as a project manager rolling out everything from small practices to revamping University Of Michigans health system. That one made me re-evaluate a lot. The difference in the standard of care, including the quality of hires and workplace professionalism, was just lower WITHIN THE SAME SYSTEM in black and brown neighborhoods. Not a little bit. A lot. This included obstetrics and pediatrics. The callousness that folks in the hood received in my presence was wild.
However, I do give some leeway to providers working in a community with drug culture present. I remember one specific clinic in Ypsilanti that had an obvious trap house outside the parking lot normally full of guys and dogs outside. When nurses or doctors had to park outside the gate, they would sprint in as to not be attacked or accosted. Perfect mindfulness would still have you be objective in those situations but they are human. All those folks are getting drug tested that day, and not very many white folks live out there

Black pain being ignored has always happened.

More recently Serena Williams spoke about her medical concerns being ignored by doctors. Her body feeling good is her whole career and the doctors thought she had to be exagerating how it felt.

Edit: it has been brought to my attention that the popular narrative about Sims is not 100% true. Here is a link where you can come up with your own conclusions. As a black woman it didn't get rid of all the ill I will have towards the man but I do respect the truth.

jcarjaz,t1_jca4po5,2023-03-15 14:41:26,science,"The big thing is you have to worry about opioid withdrawal in the baby, and that's a great point. 

In a healthy baby you wouldn't give almost any medications so it wouldn't be an issue. In an unhealthy baby you may have some concern with cumulative effects like if you use a benzo and the patient has opiates on board - it could cause more sedation than expected. Neonatology isn't really my area, but I would be pretty surprised if you were using a drug like that in a brand new baby and that baby wasn't intubated, though, and once you have the airway secured then it's irrelevant. The concern with excess sedation is that we could lose the airway, so once you have an advanced airway, you're okay.

Edit: withdrawal is definitely an issue, healthy baby or not, though. We slowly wean addicted babies down from opiates with lowering doses of morphine. But a utox won't tell you if they're addicted. It'll just tell you if they've had any opioids in whatever time period that opioid shows up.

But sometimes they lie about things that can effect their care. So the testing is there to protect the patients and the fetus.

Also patients are stupid. When they come into an ER they may say “I had a hysterectomy”. But that they really had was a oophorectomy or a salpingectomy. Which means they can still get pregnant. I’ve heard first hand accounts from physicians that have had that happen. Also, patients lie about their sexual history. Maybe she’s in a lesbian relationship now, but she’s cheating with a man.

But at the end of the day if a doctor provides care and harms an unknown fetus or misses an ectopic pregnancy, they get sued. It doesn’t matter that a patient LIED, the doctor is still liable. And the liar of a patient will happily sue them. So malpractice insurances also requires doctors to practice according to standards of care and guidelines. Those include mandatory testing for every woman with a uterus that has entered puberty. 


Here’s an article explaining why marijuana can effect care.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952818018318026

>The multi-systemic effects of cannabinoids and their pharmacological interactions with anesthetic agents may lead to serious consequences. Low doses of cannabinoids have been associated with increased sympathetic response (tachycardia, hypertension and increased contractility) with high levels of norepinephrine detected 30 min after use. High doses enhance parasympathetic tone leading to dose-dependent bradycardia and hypotension. Severe vascular complications associated with cannabis exposure may include malignant arrhythmias, coronary spasm, sudden death, cerebral hypoperfusion and stroke. Bronchial hyperreactivity and upper airway obstruction are commonly reported in cannabis users. Postoperative hypothermia, shivering and increased platelet aggregation have been also documented.

Here are a couple more.

> **Abstract**
> 
> Concerns about the use of child labor in West African cocoa production became widespread in the early 2000s in many high-income countries. In 2015 in Ghana, 91.8% (or a total of 878,595) of the children working in the cocoa sector were involved in a form of hazardous work. Child labor in cocoa production is not just a symptom of poverty but also a contributing factor, as children often forgo a formal education to work in cocoa orchards. Current Ghanaian law prohibits child labor, but, with many cocoa households living in poverty, child labor becomes a necessity for survival, and as such, current child labor laws are rarely enforced. Therefore, an effective policy that eliminates child labor could compensate farmers by providing an economic incentive. In this paper, we develop and calibrate a farm household model to estimate the cocoa price premium necessary to eliminate child labor from cocoa production while leaving the farm household welfare unchanged. This welfare-neutral price premium removes the negative effects of eliminating child labor for the farm household. Varying degrees of child labor exists, with certain forms posing a greater risk to children’s wellbeing. The results show that eliminating the worst forms of child labor would require a cocoa price premium of 2.81% and eliminating regular work (non-hazardous work but over the maximum hours allowed for a child) and the worst forms would require an 11.81% premium, which could be paid for by the well-established Ghanaian Cocoa Marketing Board. An incentive for the Cocoa Marketing Board to pay the price premium and monitor and enforce this policy would be the ability to differentiate their cocoa as child-labor free and not lose market share to countries who cannot currently certify this practice.",nick314,t2_36hoc,4,0,reddit2

eqbmgq4,t3_bxyb48,2019-06-07 23:48:27,science,"I work in the cocoa industry in Ecuador and most farmers are very poor, we need higher prices in general to support development and reduce poverty. It is some what questionable whether Ghana and Ivory Coast will end child labour with a commodity price increase since they may not nesesarily pass on the increase to farmers in country since their cocoa boards control the prices that farmers receive.

In Ecuador we have a free market to for cocoa and when the commodity price goes up the farmers get more, but the price they receive is not great in most cases, I work with specialty cocoa that can get a higher price and the farmers make more money working to harvest at the right time and our processing plant ferments and dries to a high quality standard so we can offer a superior product but the fine single origin market is still too small to benefit more than a few percent of farmers. The commercial price should be higher and the fair trade price is not exactly fair its a 15% bump in most cases which is still not much.

Will consumers pay more for mass market chocolate? Is that really the question? When the average cocoa content is less than 30% in a lot of bars a 50% increase in cocoa costs wouldn't translate to a 50% increase in chocolate cost most mass market stuff would only go up maybe 15%, part of the cost could be borne by manufacturers. 

Another part of the puzzle is sugar which is never really discussed, why can't producers in the tropics export sugar? The USA produces too much high fructose corn syrup with public subsidy and imthe Europeans with beets and it damages our potential to have a basic export industry. The sugar subsidies in developed markets suffocate developing economies and its a disgrace.
	
An increase in the cocoa price would be a positive thing for a lot of smallholder farms. Here in Ecuador 800,000 families depend on cocoa as their primary source of income and a 50% increase in price would make a great difference to people who generally live on the borderline of extreme poverty (three or four dollars a day is quite common to live on for a family of six).

The business model is generally exploitative with the cocoa farmers receiving on average 4.2% of chocolate billing despite it being the key ingredient of chocolate the cocoa farmers often can't afford the final products. A rise in cocoa prices would generally benefit millions of small farmers in the tropics.

At Galería Cacao we do things differently and pay above market rates and while we have only been operating a year we intend to share profits with our associated farmers and while we believe we can make a difference by focusing on artesanal low bitterness cacao of high value unfortunately the model will not yet scale to help the majority of farmers.

Coffee has had a lot of progress with specialty varieties and gotten higher prices for some farmers but everyone with a conscience in the industry knows that we need to see a rise in the price of the commercial standard grade products so that farmers can lead decent lives while producing the raw materials for your luxuries in a sustainable manner.

James Hoffman has written on reforming the contracts in the coffee industry and I think we need something similar in cacao.

The normal earnings for smallholder cocoa farmers could be as low as a thousand dollars a year, supportkng your kids through school on that money is not easy.

Check out www.galeriacacao.com if you're interested in supporting small cocoa farmers and buy single origin made in country chocolates where possible, since I don't want to just talk about my own stuff I have to say I love Wiñak chocolate they were available in whole foods not sure if they still are but great chocolate and a great organisation of small kichwa farmers also operating here in the Ecuadorian Amazon.",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,1,0,reddit2

The price chocolate is at now is simply a societal discount we've enjoyed our whole lives, and as such we've been buying it for less than it actually takes to produce, once you factor in the human cost of slave labor. The price hike won't be a new penny-pinching increase for extra profits, instead it will be an end to the consumer money-saving discount. Framing and perception is everything though, and no one will interpret it like this in practice. But it should be pointed out to complainers that this would not be costing them more money in a literal way, that they were instead saving money on chocolate over last 20, 30, or 40 years.

This is the issue people don't want to address. Child labour is a tragic thing that should not be happening in this day and age, but it is. And there is for a reason. People are willingly working these jobs. It would be great if we could just make the companies pay a living wage, but that's is not going to happen, not in the short term anyways.

These kids, people in sweatshops in general, are doing it because it is their best option. If we make the cocoa industry no long employee children, what happens to these kids. They don't just get carefree childhoods, they don't get to go to school. They have to find other jobs. They are working for pocket change they can spend on weekends, they are working for their families livelihood. it's tragic that they have to do that at such a young age, but that is the world we find ourselves in. If they can't work in the Cocoa industry they will have to find other, less desirable jobs.

No, they are out breaking road stone with hammers under the noonday sun instead; or worse..

This hapless study estimates how much the child's labour is worth to the farmer, and then - again, a magic twinkle - money somehow replaces the hands lost. What, though, actually picks the cocoa pods? 

Thought experiment: the cocoa price rises. Land consolidation follows as the weaker producers sell out to more mechanised producers.

eqbk5tw,t1_eqairtv,2019-06-07 23:34:42,science,"An increase in the cocoa price would be a positive thing for a lot of smallholder farms. Here in Ecuador 800,000 families depend on cocoa as their primary source of income and a 50% increase in price would make a great difference to people who generally live on the borderline of extreme poverty (three or four dollars a day is quite common to live on for a family of six).

The business model is generally exploitative with the cocoa farmers receiving on average 4.2% of chocolate billing despite it being the key ingredient of chocolate the cocoa farmers often can't afford the final products. A rise in cocoa prices would generally benefit millions of small farmers in the tropics. 

At Galería Cacao we do things differently and pay above market rates and while we have only been operating a year we intend to share profits with our associated farmers and while we believe we can make a difference by focusing on artesanal low bitterness cacao of high value unfortunately the model will not yet scale to help the majority of farmers. 

Coffee has had a lot of progress with specialty varieties and gotten higher prices for some farmers but everyone with a conscience in the industry knows that we need to see a rise in the price of the commercial standard grade products so that farmers can lead decent lives while producing the raw materials for your luxuries in a sustainable manner. 

James Hoffman has written on reforming the contracts in the coffee industry and I think we need something similar in cacao. 

The normal earnings for smallholder cocoa farmers could be as low as a thousand dollars a year, supportkng your kids through school on that money is not easy.

High end bars would be in the 35-60% range for cocoa content, I think, and cost maybe $3-5 or so per bar. At the high end of that range, rounding 47% cost increase or cocoa to 50% for simplicity, you would have a $5 bar with 60% cocoa content, meaning $3 of the cost of that bar was all cocoa.

Once the shop, your governments sales taxes, the distributor and the factory take their cut often the share for a $5 luxury bar that goes to farmers will be as low as 13 cents or just 2.6%

Edit because of all my comments here this has highest visiblility:

Fairtrade really hurts the smallest of small holders as the paperwork burden exceeds the value of their production and will lead to higher prices only for larger farms that rely on occasional casual labor and don't offer any employment security or decent pay. Most cacao farmers in the world are small holders and a lot of these schemes (especially organic) just benefit big companies and not many others.

 The unintended consequences of fair trade certification is likely to be turning smaller farmers into landless laborers.

A lot of organizations teach the farmers better farming practice and improve yields, but there is no accountability unless someone is there year round.

Also get the big companies like Hershey’s to only buy fair trade and actually enforce it. If cocoa beans weren’t so region specific I’m sure it’d be easier to control. Not only that but beans from regions that are pretty war torn and that use child labor are VERY low quality, like Congo beans, so less people buy them to begin with. Peruvian beans are pretty good, but after receiving a lot of awards (and a LOT) of help from manufacturers that bought them for the fair trade status, they started raising the prices and holding the beans hostage as a way of saying “we know there aren’t many large scale fair trade farmers, so we will inflate our prices.” A lot of medium sized bean to bar manufacturers had to stop using them because of the price. Either reverting to the cheaper (Congo type) beans, or going for the super expensive super flavorful beans. It’s a struggle right now to find the right price point between quality, quantity, and morality.

Edit: We use to source from more than 4 countries, slowly that number went down to 3, then 2, and now only one. We couldn’t maintain a price of $5 with quality beans, and that was at a production max of roughly 20k bars a day. Everyone trying to be ethical about it is either suffering in quality or limited by their scale and price.

The industry has identified the problem, now we need geopolitical enforcement which is very hard to push for.",japanfrog,t2_12kvpk,2,0,reddit2

eqax2bh,t1_eqardc9,2019-06-07 21:04:13,science,"TL;DR: the price has nothing to do with what it’s made of.

When you’re a massive chocolate corporation chocolate costs very little ingredients wise and most of what decides the price is what people are willing to pay. Furthermore for decades chocolate companies have been putting less “chocolate” in their chocolate for decades. Put simply though, the primary ingredient in most commercial chocolate is sugar, which you can buy from a supermarket for about 6p per 100g, which obviously does not factor in how much cheaper it is when buying in bulk. Most chocolates commercially also aren’t chocolate enough to run properly through machines and will contain an emulsifier (usually soy lecithin) and even the more “premium” brands have started to do it. Milk (or at least milk powder as cocoa is a oil and milk is mostly water so they don’t mix) is another common ingredient. Milk powder from a supermarket is about 8p per 100g. Hell most companies then ALSO use palm oil to cut the costs of palm oil. The most expensive part of the chocolate is the cocoa solids (the butter and mass) but again, it’s bought in bulk and not much is actually used and the stuff that is used is then mixed with cheaper ingredients. The ingredients are super cheap. Normally you could then argue labour makes it expensive but honestly no because it’s all mechanised to a high degree which cuts out the wages considerably, and as mechanisation improves the degree they’ll save increases again. Advertising is still a big issue for businesses but they don’t pay children to advertise the product anyway, and “we don’t use child slaves” is a pretty good advertising line as it is. The entire chocolate bar is extremely low cost to produce, even more so at a large scale. The idea that they can’t possibly shoulder the burden of not using child slaves is ridiculous.",super42695,t2_15hlwj,12,0,reddit2

However as you may understand, when both parents are working on the harvest, they have their children also help out so they can keep an eye on them because these are dangerous mountains with not good places for children to play. For the children, it is lighter work than the parents, mainly picking up hazelnuts from the ground as they're being harvested manually by their parents.   
Because the harvest is done in summer time, there is no school for them to skip out on, so no real good place to dump your children while the parents work.  


So by the definition, yes, it is child labor. Internationally there was a big stink made out of the hazelnut farming practises. However even if you raise their hourly wages to be more than sustainable, the parents of the people would still somewhat force their children to do the labor. Currently hazelnut farming is barely profitable for the farmers as is so they can not increase the wages. The higher ups in the chain refuse to pay more for the produce while the prices are actually going down. In return, hazelnut farmers just produce larger and larger quantities, flooding the markets even more and driving the price down even more.  


In return, hazelnut brands/producers make disgusting amounts of profit by exporting them to other continents such as Europe. The price per 2 pounds flies to about $15 dollars per kilogram. If you notice, simply adding specks of hazelnuts to a chocolate bar increases the price of a bar from anywhere from $0.20 to $0.50. That is not even the price per 3 pounds of raw hazelnuts. So somewhere, someone is making a disgusting 3000% profit and it's not with the farmers.",ThePhantomPear,t2_xy6mv,7,0,reddit2

Ferrero Rocher: recently went Fair trade, said by 2020 they will be 100% certified. Seems like they're good.


Ghiradelli/Lindt/Sprüngli: all under the same corporate hat, [they have their own page about sustainability](https://www.ghirardelli.com/sustainability) and what they do, but they also choose to forgo the fair trade 3rd party stamp so I'll leave that to discussion.


Hersheys: same as Ferrero, 100% certified by 2020. Surprised me but yep.


Toblerone: big fat no, they aren't certified and don't even have their own thing going. Won't even disclose where their beans are sourced from. 


Cadbury: straight up abandoned it's fair trade labelling. [But they have some sort of private program like Lindt&Co](https://www.cadbury.co.uk/cocoa-life) that says it ""partners closely with fairtrade."" So once again, dunno exactly, but they do seem to be emphasizing partnership with fairtrade so maybe an issue related to their growth?


Godiva: On the same 100% certified by 2020 claim, [also a page for their own program](https://www.godiva.com/godiva_cares/godiva_cares.html) so like Hersheys they should be looking good soon. Emphasis on should.


Nestlé: apparently a couple items like their Kit Kat line are Fair Trade, but apparently this is only a whopping 2.5% of their stock certified. I'd say an unsurprising pass.


Mars: apparently they're the ones who started the whole ""100% certified by 2020"" thing that we shall soon see the results of. Seems like a lot of the stuff is already certified, so looking good so far.


Milka: Not fairtrade, but into that cocoa life thing Cadbury is in. Personally I'm suspicious, but that might just be me.


Ritter sport: dropped an ultimatum to a number of their farm sources to get fairtrade certification. Another on the hopefully soon to be completely certified.


Honorable mention is Theo Chocolate which was founded entirely to be organic fair trade and has been growing, guarantees everything is above board so they might be a good alternative  depending how far they've spread. Personally I've not seen them.


So not all hope is lost if FairTrade is to be relied on, some of the big names are already on and a number plan to be within the next year so we can hope.

I work in the industry and I know that the commodity price affects farmer income massively, raising the price of bulk Cacao 50% would increase incomes for millions of small farmers throughout the tropics and only cost a few cents a bar of chocolate.

Single and fine origin chocolates made in country don't always benefit small farmers but they generally do, there are some deficiencies in the system and not everyone is an honest operator unfortunately but that said there are a lot of positive projects that I know of in the Ecuadorian Amazon, I have a lot of respect for what Inalnapo is doing over in loreto and I've seen progress. Tsatsayaku is producing some great quality cacao here in the Amazon which is a real challenge and we have some great factories that help small producers turn their own cacao into chocolate for distribution abroad, as our market grows more farmers will participate in these newer models which generally do pay higher than market rates or at least provide competition in what can often be a monopsonistic environment with few buyers and many sellers.",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,29,0,reddit2

So the actual numbers are that the local buyers we compete with pay 20 to 25 cent a pound fresh and we pay 60 to 70 cent according to maturity of the beans, (less if over ripe).

If you want to compare to the dry commodity price which isn't exactly fair since we only buy fresh and we have to dry it, losing 65% of the weight in the process we can do thst as well.

So if I lose two thirds of my weight I'm paying 70 fresh that means I'm paying 2,10 dry ignoring my 10 or 15% extra in loss to mold (can't sell you the moldy cacao or you won't be so impressed with the chocolate).

Now $2.10 a pound dry is equivalent to about 4620 a ton and the current market price is about 2500 you might add on 300 if it was fair trade but still these not numbers that farmers get but the price for dry cacao in Port, thst means there is a packaging cost, those jute bags aren't free nor is the gasoline or diesel used to take the product to market the use the vehicle or the driver...

Now since I sell my product mind of expensive I know I'm not doing so well if I measured the metric of % of sale price going to the farmers but since we are still a start up and not cash flow positive until the end of this year (only been operating a year now) we aren't in a position to share profits yet since there are none, we have seven workers who all make above minimum wage and rent to pay not to mention the bills in the factory to get our product processed so we can control distribution and hopefully make more are not small bills, I'm in a lot of debt right now and very lucky to have this opportunity if it all pays off I'll be able to share half the profit with the communities we work with and make a much bigger difference but for now any one is welcome to come to misahualli and ask, I've had some people turn up just because local farmers have spoken highly of us and the lady who sells fruit and veg in town says businesses is much better this year since people have money in the off tourism season.

Also I only don't do any where near your scale, we will just about do ten ton this year and that's not even a month of your production.

The child labor problem is pretty big, I just fear it will be a stick used to hit tiny farms as much of the paperwork is just impossible with productions of small holders with less than an acre of local varieties that don't exactly yield the most... If a farm only produces a sack of dry a year how can we pay the registration and documentation fees? Most chocolate is still mass market cheap crap and raising the commercial price is the best thing that could happen for small farmers. 

But yeah I am kind of surprised about your experience and I know larger organisations in the coast in Ecuador that might be able to help out, please email me at m (@) galeriacacao.com to see if I can get you some nice flavor beans at a good price with your certs.",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,1,0,reddit2

The closest I can see is the following: 

>The hope of the policy prescription put forth in this study is to incentivize the elimination of child labor. Ideally, producers would take the premium they received and invest in their children’s education or make investments in their orchards to enhance future productivity. There is the real possibility that producers would simply take the price premium, invest it into more cocoa acreage and use more child labor instead of less. However, given the fact that all cocoa is sold to the COCOBOD, they have the authority, if they choose to use it, to monitor the elimination of child labor. This would be a monumental task for the COOCBOD to monitor its producers to ensure that each producer who received premiums for child-labor free cocoa abided by a set of guidelines.

Essentially they seem to be arguing that the COOCBOD is capable of implementing (unspecified!) policies which could lead to a reduction in child labour.

You may pretend that such people do not exist, but it does not change the fact that your forcing of the standards of the prosperous first world nations does not always do good for the people for whom you deny the human right to paid labor.

Those people's living standards are harmed by you supporting the denial of such a human right, under the guise that reducing people's options could ever be, on its own, an exercise of human rights. In reality, it's nothing more than playing nanny for other people, with no consequences should you be wrong about ""what's best"" for third world impoverished families and their children. 

Children having to do labor is a problem which will be solved one day--but not by legislation, rather by prosperity increasing throughout the world permitting for no child to have to waste any time which could be used for education, instead wasted to earn wages to pay for necessities. And until that day comes, legal or not, there is a demand for wages from child labor for impoverished families, the supply will be met. And forcing such supply underground probably hasn't done the labor rights of those children very good...

Since most developing economies with cocoa farming are composed of large numbers of subsistence farmers who are essentially fixed in their occupations due to lack of alternative employment and having already invested in the planting of the trees (takes a good year and half of not three to get a harvest going) The farmers being owners generally really do depend on the market price for their earnings.",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,4,0,reddit2

This is a really important exception that most people in the industry would probably shy away from but here goes:

Since most cocoa is produced on tiny smallholdings, by farmers who own their own plots of land and have planted their own trees, during the harvest season it is normal for the children of the family to help out with the harvest, they are learning skills they will need in adulthood and in most developing agricultural communities it is seen as normal and expected that children help the family and not be lazy, most of these families will not have television, maybe not even electricity, let alone Internet in the house. The main objective shouldn't be the complete eradication of any child labor but the elimination of exploitation of children for cash or goods in kind, ie no selling children, bonded labor, slavery in whatever form is not OK. But children helping the family farm is more or less unavoidable and it would probably be you imposing your cultural norms if you think that its wrong to get kids to help seperate beans from muciliginous pulp. But yeah also don't want the kids missing out on school either so it is a complicated issue and there definitely needs to be a better system, but to get there we need more money in the whole system, down in the tropics the problems are significant. 

Education may be a no brainer to you in your nice comfortable rich country, even if you are poor the state will mostly provide you with your basics... OK maybe the USA isn't quite so well developed with the whole social safety net like most advanced countries but even so its culturally the norm to get a high school diploma and its seen as useful because it is.... But down here maybe it isn't so much like that and school mean spending money on the bus and books and things and some people just don't have the money.... In Ecuador state assitance for mothers is 50 dolars a month and actually we have oil and export businesses and we aren't as poor as ghana or ivory Coast.... I can see how some families see short term financial gain as preferable to long term doubtful investment in education when employment is almost nonexistent and the kids will likely end up doing the same things as their parents and farming increasingly tiny plots as the family land is subdivided..... When you say the problem is deep-rooted, yea it's down to the bedrock, the whole system was set up by colonizers back hundreds of years ago to benefit a tiny minority and things are still the same in most places.

At Galería Cacao we monitor school attendance but it's not easy or free for us to do that and we are lucky to be able to get decent margins on our products but in commercial bulk cacao the margins are tiny and the farmers live in extreme poverty. The system needs a price bump and 5% on chocolate bars could raise farmer incomes 50%",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,2,0,reddit2

These are super super poor regions where before jobs came, it was absolute poverty. Over time with these crappy jobs they can start building wealth. They slowly develop infrastructure. Even basic things like gettting a bike and paving a road is a huge step in infrastructure development.

There's also actual slave labor where the kids come from someplace else because they were lied to about getting part-time work where they could make enough to eat and go to school as well and then are prevented from either going to school or going home.",,,2,0,reddit2

-second to that. They often wind up with more children than one or two parents can support. So the kids gotta pitch in.

Child labour is not totally a 'big evil corporation forcing poor parents to hand over their beloved off spring' problem.

It's deeply entrenched with other economical and social issues within that country.

Since they are borderline extreme poverty cases often the transport to school, theunch, the pens and paper and everything else required can be prohibitively expensive so they might not want to spend the money on the education if they cannot afford to send the kids they have to stay home, in which case it makes sense to put them to work. 

Since harvest days are often every two weeks on a smaller farm they might take the kids out of school on those days to help in the family farm.

Now if their cousin or brother or some one has a slightly bigger farm maybe there is opportunity for some occasional casual labour or on a larger farmers that contract workers for piece work (harvesting one hectare is paid at a fixed price in some parts) if the head of the family gets a job like that they may well take the kids to help and avoid more days of school due to the taking advantage of the rare earning opportunity.

eqc4vn2,t1_eqc225l,2019-06-08 02:50:01,science,"I love Pacari because they opened the route for a lot of innovation here in Ecuador and gained a lot of respect for our local industry that has made it possible to make great chocolates here, I don't know if my business would be possible without the multiple factories offering top quality processing equipment and highly trained chocolate professionals in the country. I worked in the extractive industry when I first came here thirteen years ago and the business services thst I depend on to make chocolate wouldn't t be as many or as good if it were not for Pacari. They pay their employees well, they produce technically great chocolates and they do a very large volume of product for an Ecuadorian producer, whether they pay great premiums for quality I don't know and I doubt any one would tell me, I just published my own numbers in another thread and I don't think your supposed to do that. 

Since 99% of our cacao goes out in dry beans I don't really want to criticise anyone who is making chocolate here, everyone is benefitting farmers even if they aren't trying because ultimately making chocolate here means more money in the local economy and our main defect is capital, we need more investment in fermenteries and drying facilities as well as roasters and conchinh machines, the path to high farmer payments is diversification of products and specialisation and specification, there are some nice new machines that are quite small and can do a good job of processing cacao to chocolate, it's possible in thirty years every farmer makes their own bars of chocolate or at least has access to processing options and can sell direct to consumer. The Internet is letting me talk to you from the head waters of the amazon in moments and while the older generation of farmers may have problems with literacy and technology if farming is to be a decent occupation it will require the next generation to become small businesses selling finished products direct to consumers. Unfortunately single origin chocolates aren't a big enough industry to support scale yet and many doubt it ever will be big enough, but yea I support pacari. 

I love their single region bars, the Esmeraldas 60 something percent one is one of my favourite chocolates and its a bargain for the quality it is. Their Piura Quemazón bar is also very special, sad that its not Ecuadorian cacao but whatever.",GaleriaCacao,t2_3jwvts1p,9,0,reddit2
eqd5lfz,t1_eqcfitr,2019-06-08 08:54:37,science,"Yea um so normal processing is on the floor or the side of the road with unpaid family labor and zero infrastructure cost. You might think its ""goofball"" artisanal processing but it's actually just that a clean environment costs some money and some is a lot more than zero and we do a long ferment because its less bitter and less astringent like this and allows people with health conditions to enjoy it without sugar, let's us make 85% and 92% content bars that are exceptional and still more money is ending up in farmers pockets. 

I wish I could just make decent chocolate and you'd pay me more because I pay the farmer more but you know unfortunately the world don't work like that and if I produce mediocre product I can't expect to get top dollar prices, if this is going to work for me and the farmers then I need to produce something really good and be a decent person in sharing the profit from my efforts, I don't have to commit to sharing profits with the farmers but I will, I don't have to publish my location or tell you where I source from but I do and you can come here any time you want and ask any and they will tell you we pay significantly more than any one ever has and we've made a difference in an area where a significant proportion of the population lives in poverty. 

Shows why most people in the industry don't like to share info like this. You actually have zero idea of what goes on or what those processing costs might be in actual dollar terms and yet you think you can make a case for me spending more on operational costs than farmers, do you know what normal costs are? Like maybe 100 or 2 a ton? It's usually quite low whe. You dry lots of product on the floor cheaply and without any care, that's all cool if your gonna roast the beans a lot and kill the flavor but whatever, so maybe that's fine for your standard cacao but we are trying to produce minimally toasted cacao with a higher natural phytochemical content that are flavoursome and more beneficial to your physical and mental well being. It's a different product.

I'm sorry it's almost 4 am and I continue writing on my phone, I'd like to offer to send you a few bars from my own and other businesses so you can try some amazing fine flavor chocolate that has natural flavors of fruit, nuts, wine, milk, caramel, lots of great things, made just with cacao and sugar or if you don't do sugar I'll send you amazing 100% that isn't at all bitter or astringent from some criollo beans we got planted last year and are just about to get a tiny harvest, there is a lot of variation on cocoa beans and when you start with amazing product it deserves a decent treatment. 

Even if I spent more on process than the farmers, which I don't, that shouldnt matter, I'm voluntarily paying more to farmers.

The cost of making chocolate is not that high if you’re not looking to make gourmet chocolate, on average during an 8 hour shift a 100g bar can be made up to 200.000 times. At least that’s the case where I work. I work at a gourmet chocolate factory though, where chocolate sells for 2-4€ per 100g but most of the money is turned into profit. It costs us about 1€ to make the chocolate. If it‘s not a gourmet brand, I can very well imagine it only costs 20-40 cents to make the chocolate if not less. Chocolate is absolutely not expensive to make since it is very easy to mass produce but since it’s a luxury product many brands tend to increase the price by a large margin.

 Also, here in Germany there are strict regulations for how you can label packaging. If it is in any way misleading it may cost the company a lot of money, to the point where it actually burns a hole in their pocket.

If it's a multi-national corporation do they have more ownership of ensuring approriate sourcing then a much smaller company given the signifcant impact a larger company would have?  There's an interesting thought experiment.  Hypothetically, if executives did face jail time, they would do what they need to do in order to avoid it.  They would ensure production lines met their stringent standards and would not do business with farms that did not meet these standards, thus economically rewarding businesses who don't use child labor.

eqd9zkk,t1_eqd8cnf,2019-06-08 09:26:44,science,"Essentially here's how the economics of it works:

* The business researches the best price to charge, and charges it.
* If they COULD increase the price by a cent and make more of a profit, they would. One extra cent times a million pizzas is a LOT of profit.
* However, there's a great deal of psychology to take into account. People likely prefer seeing certain prices (for instance, $5.95 instead of $5.96).

So the business is not charging higher prices (even a few cents) because it would likely affect demand in some way and decrease pizzas sold. If they could charge more without decreasing demand, they would.

Note my original opinion (society should be structured such that they do give the health insurance, as 14 cents as a cost is such a low cost). I'm just saying that a profit-maximising entity may not want to increase costs like that.",maniacal_cackle,t2_6eqxj,-1,0,reddit2

It’s easy to judge from the comfort of the US but the families there may be making rational choices. It wasn’t that long ago that children working the farm was commonplace here.  

As for processes to avoid child labor, there are many already in place for a variety of social responsibilities, some voluntary and some by law. One legal example might be with what was done with wood from the Amazon that big boxes like HD have had to navigate.  A voluntary one might be many of the practices Walmart has put in place for suppliers that source in China.

I work with electric vehicles, and after a couple years a company I'm working for has accumulated a substantial set of bulging, failed cells which we'd like to recycle. With lead batteries this would be simple -- a number of places will take them, paying about 17 to 20 cents per pound last time I checked.

With lithium cells though, there's only one place I've found in my city that will take them at all, and they don't offer any value for them, which is a bad sign if you're thinking about the market for recycling the materials. I have no serious reason to be certain the cells wouldn't end up in a Chinese landfill somewhere.

And while you might not care to get anything back for your handful of blown 18650s, these are 200Ah cells that cost about $250 each when new.

The project is now four years old and I've been with them for close to three.  I've heard stories from the older colleagues that did this same project in Iraq of a very large lithium battery fire after a few guys pulled the tabs to discharge them and threw them back into the containment.  I've personally amassed tens of thousands lithium batteries for shipment, separation and consolidation, and then shipment by air to Germany for recycling.  The only fire that I've had to respond to was a small pallet sized fire that started the same way the 'hundred thousand lithium battery fire of Iraq' started (The fire department let it burn itself out).  I have a few drums of lithium batteries currently in my hazardous waste yard with a Class-D fire extinguisher on-site.  There were probably a few million of these batteries out here used by the Army before our year-long consolidation, shipment, and recycling effort finished last year.  (They're in such supply because they're 30% lighter and last up to ten times longer than their Ni-Cd / NiMH counterparts).

I understand that academic science is far way from any practical application, and that to get funded labs need to publish. Do you have any point of view on this gap between industry and academics ? Do you think that current publications miss relevant experiments or even metrics to get closer to what is important in the industry ?

I can answer this! Lithium ion batteries work best between 30% and 90%. For the most number of charge-discharge cycles you want to keep it between these figures. 

However, that's not very practical for everyday stuff like phones and laptops, so in that case it's best just to charge them as often as possible; the worst thing you can do to a lithium battery is run it all the way down.

Leaving a new smartphone to charge all day (as recommended in many manuals still) is pointless, as the phone stops charging when the battery is full. After that it will just sit, fully charged, doing nothing. It's a holdover from the days of ni-mh and ni-cad batteries.",,,98,0,reddit4

UL has specifications on li-ion battery behavior requirements. There are a few variants, look them up. 

A lithium battery typically has a protection IC. This IC is usually a fet gate control and comparator for several values. If the voltage is above 2.8, the temperature is below the safety cutoff, then the FET is on and conducts battery current. The FET also has an on state resistance which is used to measure current - if the current exceeds a certain value, then the FETs are latched off while the load is too high.

There are more advanced techniques, but the additions will likely deal with things like state of charge, cell balancing, system integration, etc. The above is the basic function of a cell protection circuit.

Charging with a standard USB power adapter is inefficient and slow because it was never designed for Li-ion battery charging at all.  It was designed to supply a modest amount of power to electronics - and the electronics used that limited power to control charging of batteries inside them, balanced with the power they needed to run their normal functions.

1)  I think the ultimate limitation is cost.  Materials and designs exist for many different performance targets - but currently are just too expensive.   If lithium ion batteries were really cheap - we wouldn't worry so much about cycle life in an EV, we could just replace them on a regular basis.
2) I am not an expert on recycling, but there are several large companies that have invested in recycle streams and (from what I hear) this is economically feasible at scale.
3) It depends on the target power/energy you want.  There is probably a niche for the composite approach you mention.  But there are good high power batteries out there if you need more energy than a supercap.

Most devices have battery management systems that set the voltage limits to ensure the device hits the specified cycle life.  A battery in a hybrid electric vehicle operates over a very shallow state of charge range - to yield hundreds of thousands of cycles.  A plug-in hybrid operates over a wider state of charge, with a target cycle life of a few thousand.   A full EV battery will need to use as  wide a state of charge as possible and balance energy density (driving range) with the target cycle life.  2) Great question - with batteries, the answer is often ""it depends.""   It depends on the source of the degradation.  Think of it in terms of performance.  You need a certain capacity out of the battery and you need a certain power from the battery across a range of states of charge.  People are most familiar with capacity fade due to loss of lithium - when your 6 hour laptop battery now only lasts 2.  However, power fade is also a big problem - and it can be caused during storage, particularly at higher temperature.  As this occurs, your battery might be able to deliver the target power when fully charged - but when you are only 30% charged it can no longer do so.

The common consensus is that the common reasons for catastrophic battery failure (venting, leaking, exploding, etc) are because of the following reasons but are not limited to what you mentioned:

- Mislabeling or defective batteries - As you said. Mislabeling and improper quality control of batteries allows them to be utilized for applications or discharge levels that the battery cell cannot handle.

- Hard shorts - The positive and negative connections of the atomizer both come in contact with the positive pole of the battery. Usually due to a short 510 positive pen on the atomizer, combined with a hybrid-style mod (where the atomizer makes direct contact with the battery). Can be prevented by only using compatible devices with protruding pins to prevent the positive/negative making simultaneous contact.

- Unintended contact - Damaged or removed battery wraps. Pocket change, keys, etc. Make sure the battery itself is protected from making contact when it's not meant to.

My question for Dee - with the growth of vaping drawing additional attention to battery failure being a potentially dangerous problem, how would you make policy to ensure that people get batteries true to their advertised specifications? And how would you go about educating the public about proper handling and usage of batteries?

-Check the plastic wrap around the battery, if you see bare metal poking through the wrap, replace the wrap    
-Make sure you know the amp limits of your battery. Pulse ratings are not to be used, look for continuous discharge limits and stay below that. This is mostly for Mechanical mod users.  
-If they make a tv, they make a good battery - LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic are all reputable and trusted manufacturers. Do not buy rewrapped batts ""designed"" for vaping, at best you're paying more for a battery I mentioned above, at worst you're getting some no name brand with a low amp limit that's just waiting to fail.    
-Don't buy batteries with the word fire in their name.  
-If you use a mod that requires more then 1 Battery, you need to ""marry"" the batts so they will only be used together and then alternate their position in your mod after every charge/discharge cycle. The reason for this is that one batt usually suffers more draw then the other when paired. To make sure one batt is not over loaded more then the other, we alternate their position.

d0s0svh,t1_d0rz859,2016-03-08 13:59:29,science,"I can answer that, i personally use lithium ion batteries in my experiments and devices, i create electrical doodads for costumes, this goes from LEDS to soundchips and recently i've made a smoke vaporizer that uses a 50/50 water/glycol style evaporation this requires heat, and what better way to mimic smoke generation than using the same technology e-cigs use to vaporize their scented nicotin stuff.

They use a nichrome or kanthal wire in a coil to heat up a patch of cotton soaked with the goods, Now nichrome and kanthal both are actually very fancy names for something called resistance wire, which basically has a much higher Ohm value than normal copper / tin wire. Higher Ohm means that it will inhibit the amperage draw and turn it into heat. If you keep it short enough for amperage draw to still be significantly high, the wire heats up significantly in return.

Obviously the longer this wire the better off you are in terms of safety, but the wire will get less hot and take more time. which is not very ideal for vaping.

Through my testing a Li-ion battery at max capacity can put out about 16/12 amperage in full short mode. Now this causes it to heat and blow up fairly quickly, Safely i'd say it should only be outputting 2/3 MAYBE 4 at max on a full-time active basis. But since you're only vaping for maybe 5/8 seconds holding the button you can safely draw 8/9 without the battery heating up.
The more you increase the Ohm of the resistance wire the lower this amperage is because V=I*R (Ohms law) which can be used as I=V/R We know our battery is nominally 3.7V, An average nichrome wire (depending on gauge) around the wick in an e-cig is 2 revolutions. which comes down to about 4/6 Ohms. so it becomes 3.7/6 = 0.61 Amps 3.7/4 = 0.93 Amps.

So in conclusion absolutely safe, even if you held the button full-time.

What i'm doing however is not very safe because i'm using 8 of these wire configurations in parallel. but in turn i've been adding more batteries in parallel which balances the individual battery draw to about 2 amps.

You do not have people taking Ohms law into account. They will end up pulling too much power from their batteries which is never a good thing. 

Some instances have been noted of vapers carrying loose batteries in their pockets with loose change / keys. The danger in this is completing a circuit through your change / keys and shorting the battery, causing a vent to happen. This can be fixed by purchasing a battery case to hold your extra batteries. 

Some manufactures will wrongly display their specs or mislead customers as to what they can actually push. This relays back to point one and can be very dangerous. ""If the company doesn't make TVs do not buy batteries from them"" is a common phrase.

d0scv9r,t1_d0s07xf,2016-03-08 19:03:20,science,"Almost every story of an ecig battery exploding comes from one of two situations, and they're both user error. I'm not sure if you vape, so I'll explain everything assuming you don't. Sorry if you already know what I'm talking about

Situation 1: the person keeps a loose battery in their pocket and it shorts on keys or loose change or the metal button in the pocket seam. The small piece of metal on the top of a battery (positive side) is the positive connection, obviously, but everything else is the negative connection, even the part still on the top of the battery. That's what the wrap is for, but wraps get damaged over time. This can make it very easy for one piece of metal like a quarter to touch the positive and negative of the battery at the same time, cause a ""hard short"" where electricity flows almost completely unimpeded at an insane amperage and sends the battery into thermal runaway, which is where disasters strike. 

Situation 2: The person uses a hybrid connection with an incompatible atomizer. The part of an ecig the connects the power device to the part that actually vaporizes the liquid (or atomizer) is called the 510 connection. There's a positive pin between the positive end of the battery and another positive pin that runs to one end of the coil wire. The negative connection is the actual threads of the 510, which surround the 510 positive pin and are separated by an insulator. 

On a hybrid 510, there's no pin between the bottom of the atomizer and the battery, so the atomizer pin directly touches the positive connection of the battery and the circuit gets completed on the negative end of the battery. A lot of atomizers don't have pins that are long enough, or they have floating pins, and the 510 threads (again, the negative connection) can also touch the positive end of the battery. This also leads to a hard short. These connections are used in some mechanical mods, meaning there isn't a chip to regulate the flow of electricity, it's just a circuit completed by a switch, so there's nothing stopping the battery from discharging very very quickly and entering thermal runaway. 

Less commonly, people using mechanical mods may also build coils with too low of a resistance and draw too many amps from their batteries. I only say less commonly because it's unlikely for a battery to enter full thermal runaway this way, but it can likely vent (the positive cap will be damaged and battery fumes will be expelled.) This can be dangerous but often does not lead to an explosion unless those fumes are ignited. 

In the community we always encourage users to put battery safety first. Nowadays Situation 1 is by far the most likely due the cheapness and performance of regulated devices, not as many people use mechanical mods anymore. The only danger then is that people are using batteries that don't have amp ratings high enough (largely due to unscrupulous companies rewrapping batteries with higher amp ratings printed on the wrap than is actually the case) or that the battery shorts out while not in the device. 

Hope that helps!",AaronToro,t2_864so,2,0,reddit4

It can certainly do so by a small amount in self-charging hybrid type vehicles, but for plug-in vehicles, they are still charged using the electric grid, which is mostly powered by fossil fuels.  If all vehicles were to suddenly become electric, that would create an even greater demand for electric production, likely resulting in more fossil fuel based power production to meet that demand.  Essentially, instead of that fuel truck pulling up to the local gas station, it'll be pulling up to the local power plant.

Ethanol is also a great example of passing the buck on emissions rather than eliminating them.

d0smqd0,t1_d0slcmw,2016-03-08 22:41:25,science,"Depends on the engineer.  In the hardware world, especially for something like embedded devices, power is the almighty thing that they obey.  You can't go over a certain thermal/energy consumption limit when running full bore.  The guys developing processors care deeply about this.  They usually set a line and then design the hardware to work at that line.

The guys designing the phone's hardware depend on the design specs of the individual components.  Usually it is pretty much only the processor and display that they care about (and usually someone else is providing those to them).  They simply pick the parts that meet the requirements they are trying to hit.

After that it is the software.  Sure, software can make or break battery life, but primarily it is the OS that ultimately holds all the knobs to make that better.  It depends on the manufacture, but more Raw OSes (think, nexus/cyanogenmod) don't have very much overhead at all.  It is the user installed software that can really suck down the battery.

Cost certainly comes into play in the hardware world, but honestly, most hardware is dirt cheap.  Hardware engineers don't generally have the same freedom as software engineers do when it comes to things like ""This language is nicer but eats more power"".  They are pretty much at the point of ""You can choose Verilog or VHDL... good luck"".  Which is like having the choice between C and pascal (only worse).

Now in the software world, many developers don't care at all about application power consumption or performance.  They may care a bit about responsiveness.  So you are right in saying that they can choose slower languages for convenience.  However, for simple data displaying apps, even slow languages can run and finish really quickly.

This is why around the 1970s, with the crushing of labor unions, left-wing political parties, & the social democratic New Deal wing of the Democratic Party (which had always been a ruling class party, but had at least been under enough pressure from the working class from 1945-~1970 that it would accept some concessions & reforms), with the emergence of neoliberalism as the establishment consensus, the political elite of both parties— representing the monied interests of the ruling class— began dramatically rolling back the labor victories of the New Deal, & the  standards of living of working class people began to plummet right up through the present, with the neoliberal wing pretty much entirely consolidating power over the Democratic Party, implementing very conservative policies, in the 90s with Bill Clinton’s New Democrat/Third Way movement. 

Rebuilding labor organizations & left-wing (IMO crucially pro-democracy, anti-capitalist, left-libertarian forms of) resistance is the only way we will ever shift the balance of social forces back in favor of the working class majority & consequently improve the lives of most of the population, placing human wellbeing, the common good, the interests of the working class, the social ecological survival of the species, & higher values of democracy, freedom, above the profits & power of the ruling elite & their corporations once & for all, dissolving the class divide that has led to such horrific human consequences & finally moving forward on the project of human emancipation which the values of the Enlightenment imagined, but was never able to realize through liberal capitalism because of its class-hierarchical, exploitative nature (a nature which, as extreme inequality grows less & less maintainable, can only be sustained through increasing authoritarianism, with the ruling class using the power of the state & propaganda/indoctrination as their means of preventing the people from overcoming their rule).",Sex_Drugs_and_Cats,t2_f37tz,2,0,reddit1

1. Kroger, union rules were super restrictive and moving up was near impossible unless you were a non union manager. To become a manager you have to leave the company for 1 year then come back and apply. There were also lots of rules and restrictions in how the job is done. Minimum wage was $4.25/hr the Union paid $8/hr and $300 a month was taken out for union dues. The insurance included was useless 60/40 split with a small cap. 


2. Fred Meyers Different union pay was $10.41 per hour, due to family I received medicaid. I still had to pay 15% of my income to get the union insurance (no opt out). I never saw another benefit.


3. Several attempts by unions to convince me I needed a union for my tech job. I was making $28/hr and had ok insurance. After the big paycut everyone got they setup strikes and tried to get us to go union.


I saw no point. I made decent income for my lack of college or official training and had freedom to come and go as I pleased as long as my work was completed on time.



1 of the tech companies I had worked for went union. The rules were oppressive from comments from former co workers. The union was disbanded by the employees.


Today I make over $40/hr doing roughly the same work (although I have more experience now). I can still come and go as I please as long as my work is done. I also have awesome insurance that covers just about everything for very little cost and I get a raise putting me in the $50+/hr rangebnext year.




I am sure for some industries they are quite good and important, my opinion is they take in money, provide very little and do just better than worst case with lots of restrictions and in a way keep areas poor as there is little growth opportunity, because companies cannot modernize without adjusting the union contract.

I find a few methodological errors in this paper. 

1. The word ""responsive"" is not proper, the study doesn't measure dynamic shifts on poor/rich voter preferences, rather it is about long term preferences. E.G. is the congressman more likely to vote in favor of policy X/Y which group 1 or 2 prefers.

2. The study does not appear to adjust for the absolute wealth of a district. There is generally a pattern in most states that higher absolute wealth increases tolerance for redistibutive policies. This is simple math, the richer you are the more you can tolerate redistributing without wrecking your economy. 

Neither of these are deathblows to the paper's credibility, and it does seem to show unions are strong political forces, but the headline is a bit clickbaity, and obviously linking to something without free access is just plain rude.",anti_dan,t2_t72w9,1,0,reddit1

Fundamentally, politicians typically react to campaign backers over any other group or individual, due to the disproportionate impact they have on their re-election chances. (A great study of this is “republic lost”)

Trade unions often act as significant campaign contributors, so feed into this unequal system where contributors sway politicians’ attention. 

my query really sits on whether the presence of trade unions genuinely shifts the balance of power from vested interest, or actually just continues this process. 

With the UK Labour Party Falkirk scandal, and the election of Ed Miliband as leader, I’d argue that indicatively it did not.

We decided globalization was a good idea and we can't really go back to regional markets. I understand that when a company is valued at a big number everyone wants to get a piece and float all boats, but the supply chain costs *most* companies are beholden to for generating capital is hard to reduce without some unpalatable trade offs. 

Tech is probably the best place to extract wealth and feed it back into the rest of the economy because valuable intellectual property, and low physical goods demands, means diverting capital wont sink the company the way it would for say a car manufacturer or food provider.

Because of this tendency towards monopolization (Corp ownership is just in stocks) ownership can monopolize. This leaves a single laborer in a bad position because they HAVE to compete but wages are driven by demand. 

But if labor monopolizes, you have a greater position to counteract the demand side pricing. 

But eventually, even with outsourcing, automation becomes more attractive. 

But a corps continued existence is demand based, there is a huge incentive to get liquid capital in the hands of demand.

fzpcvya,t1_fyu19vq,2020-07-30 06:15:06,science,"Very few people ""quit their jobs to rely on welfare programs"" according to all the research we have seen on things like UBI. Generally the three groups of people who do this are people who quit in order to raise their child, people who quit in order to go to school or some type of trade education or skills training program, and people who decide to start a new business or creative endeavor. So if we did something like a UBI for four years and those three groups of people quit their jobs for four years, then we'd have more kids getting to spend time with their parents, more skilled people coming out of education programs, and more creative and business experiments. These are all pretty good for society and the economy, and it's likely that these people wouldn't stay out of traditional work in any case. A parent might go back to work once their child starts kindergarten for example. A student would once they finished their studies. A creative person or entrepreneur might if their new project didn't turn out profitable.

So none of these are really so bad as fallback options. Yes it would be better if they were more stable in knowing that they would have a guaranteed amount of money in terms of paying their rent for example, but for a new program it's not like everyone would immediately trust the system would last forever anyway.

(Also most police officers don't actually live in the community they police - but that isn't here or there).

They're asking that the responsibilities of the police - such as mental health checks - be regulated to better suited professions, and that communities take advantage of the many, many ways to prevent crime instead of just heavily enforcing the law. Detectives will still exist, (better trained) people will still exist to deal with dangerous suspects.

Some people want to abolish the police, but I don't even think they mean ""abolish the police tomorrow"". Police forces almost always top the budget for municipals, and what people want is that instead of paying for an often arbitrary, racist and corrupt agency to be given that money, that money go towards improving the community - community centers for kids to have a safe place to be in that cuts down on gangs, better education so people can improve their lives, better funded social workers, better funded community health centers, etc etc. 

What Trump is doing really has nothing with the defund movement (outside of his excuse), and I don't entirely get why you think they're connected.

forc496,t3_g90fza,2020-04-27 17:48:37,science,"Reasons employers \*can\* benefit from unions:

* Fair wages, established by consensus rather than predatory behavior by an opponent remove the adversarial nature of hiring someone on, starting them off on the wrong foot.
* In the event wages are reasonable, able to afford life, so rather than being exhausted from a night at the laundromat, being able to afford a washing machine.  This results in workers having the mental and physical energy to put towards work.
* More likely to have work-life balance on their time.  Being able to visit a dentist, rather than suffer through dental pain.
* Given management is intrinsically adversarial in most corporations, employees having a non-adversarial environment they can share with coworkers where management isn't there.  No need to organize or coordinate outside activities to keep employee cohesion.  Lack of risk of bungling such.
* Lack of risk of termination to employees, which typically results in backstabby abrasive self-protective behavior.  This leads to better teamwork.

Reasons unions \*can\* suck for employers:

* Bad faith contract negotiations suck.
* Unable to get rid of bad people who act in bad faith.
* Lazy atmosphere can emerge and persist where employees spend most of their time surfing the web for personal purchases, making personal calls, using social media, or thinking about things like camping or their next vacation.
* Union dues and overhead is just another expense.

Fact is though, unions actually rely on the success of their businesses as well, so while they \*can\* be adversarial, it's beneficial for everyone if they're not.

Marx was fascinated by capitalism, and didn't necessarily hate it, but correctly identified certain issues, and the exploitative nature of business owners and the imbalance of power in their favour. Which is why he concluded that workers collectivizing (and, he surmised, eventually coming to own their means of production) was the only way to avoid these issues long term. Many labour unions have roots in Marxism but never quite made it to the point of taking over the means or production unless forming a co-op.

Likewise, the economy of scale necessary to provide the cheapest possible product for the masses is also the purview of monolithic entities.

Lest say I have skill and experience in a particular role, there’s 5 companies hiring for that role, the ones with a Union are probably paying a higher wage/benefits and therefore attracting more applicants.  More applicants means a better choice of the best ones.  Meanwhile those low paying companies continue to justify low wages, saying staff aren’t productive enough to be worth more, because those productive ones took the higher paying gig.  Similarly, the higher paying employers can place a higher standard on their workers because the workers want to keep that higher paying job, if the others try to hold employers to a higher standard then those employers move on to a place that’s easier work for the same wage.  

Unions protecting poor employees is a whole other issue, and shouldn’t happen with a strong union.  Seems like the average Union should be opposed to a handful of low performers disrupting the morale of the remaining members.  I think what really happens is that bad managers scapegoat the Union, “they won’t let me reprimand him” or “the union says I have to do it this way”.

Keeping low-productivity staff around actually sucks out the average/high-productivity employees' morale.

It *always* happens when unions are strong. Unions care about seniority more than anything else. They're scummy when they are strong, doing things like hiking their dues right after they bargain for a raise, such that the workers themselves haven't seen real wage increases in decades.

And it's not like you have a choice to not join the union either, because it's effectively closed shop - you don't get officially hired after your 2 month trial period if you don't join the union. So it's not like it's a weak union.

fot84pk,t1_fosxiw6,2020-04-28 04:07:30,science,"The good thing about unions though is that their stance does not change. A for employee union, will always focus on the employee. But what happens when Mr. pibb retires and his greedy son in law Dr Pepper takes over (I bet his doctorate is in some dumb topic that doesn’t even relate to the industry)? Before, HR may have been for the people, but now it’s concerned with silencing problems rather than fixing them. And with Dr Pepper in charge, he doesn’t want to hear wind of a union, else you’ll be fired for unrelated things (showing up to work late, despite never being late). Ultimately, even if you have a good HR, it’s still a good idea to have a solid union in place.

In addition, unions can provide services to the company that the company may have otherwise not had. A union can provide training to employees that goes more efficiently than HR may have been able to have provide, as well as more in depth training, due to the nature of employees working with employees. Such examples may be that an HR can get roles established and basic training, but the union has an employee doing that same task that can train you 1 on 1 in order to help you get started and up to speed faster. 

Furthermore, unions can help in the selection process for skilled employees. See unionized trade jobs, such as electricians. People can join the union without having work, and then be recommended to contractors. This is useful to employees and employers. 

Next is a level of job protection that many people aren’t offered. Many states are right to work states, where you can be terminated at any time just because (my first ever manager told me this while hiring: “Now just know that this is a right to work state. We all need our jobs here, and corporate has ways of shutting down places that decide a union is a good thing, so if you want the job, and you want to keep the job, don’t mention them.” This wasn’t a manager trying to scare me, this was a manager who just wanted to keep his own job). 

Finally, you have preset wages. Having decent wages set up in advance is useful from both the companies end and the employees. It negates the need of wage negotiation for new hires, as a union can effectively say “hey this is what everyone should start at” and no new employee should feel like they are getting a raw deal. Additionally, knowing that you are receiving an unfair wage, the union can band together to help you get a fair amount of pay. Such examples can include wage discrimination between people of colored and women in the work place. Unions are key in preventing such actions from occurring.

So yes. While you may not require a union at that exact moment, a union is like a hundred dollars in your back pocket. You’d rather have that hundred dollars when the world goes to hell than not have it.

Thats still not fully accurate. A lot of times the employer, more specifically the manager, aren't following the steps outlined by the labor agreement to start the termination process. Across the board, the only thing Unions do in terms of terminating workers is that they make the process longer but not as significant as the popular notion (more record keeping, take specific steps to outline infractions, etc.).

I think this correlates with the 'Middle Management Syndrome', wherein corporate culture follows the questionable norm that you *must* be promoted if you do well. Consequentially, the people doing good work will keep being promoted **until they stop doing good work**... which means the natural outcome of this mentality is a management layer where everyone is doing a bad job.

As anecdote to an alternative, the (IT) company I work for doesn't have middle management or 'ranks'. There's the GFs (the people who founded the company, and serve as the public face and 'diplomatic contact' towards high-value customers) and employees. Technically there's Project Leaders, too, but they are on the same level, in both personal attitude, payment and privileged, as any developer.

Think that companies won't take away benefits? Think again. In the post war era, many companies often provided medical insurance. Some even paid the full price for it. Since the union busting of the 1980s, business did their best to prevent them from providing insurance. Look at Papa John's, for example. They made sure that their employees worked less than their policy to provide Insurance. You had to work, IIRC, 38 hours a week. Employees were often scheduled about 30 hours, so they were part time and didn't qualify for insurance. 

That's a worse case scenario. Even unionized companies used that ""part-time"" phrase to short-change their workers. AT&T, where I was a steward, often did that. I was a call center employee, and a large number of ""part-time"" employees were actually working 40+ hours a week. One of my team members did that for the 5 years I worked there.

Ye, this kind of structure only works if the employees fully accept the notion that there is no 'advancement'. But as I outlined, 'advancement for the sake of advancement' is inherently counterproductive. And if your employees desire to feel accomplished or confirmed in their work, there's other ways to achieve that than throwing pointless promotions and 'Executive Lead of Executive Offices' titles around... like actually treating them well and in face-to-face telling them that you appreciate their work.

Another fun tidbit about our company: Every project team is eligble to have one 'team event' every three or so months. The team decides, and anything (within reasonable price range) goes. This can be attending a sports event, the classic bowling evening or just a night in a bar. The company pays all of it. 

Additionally, each team has the right to demand their associated GF to eat with them once per month, usually in a local restaurant or beer garden (basically an open pub / restaurant combo in a more casual setting). Aka, you can drink a beer with the top-level guy and chat over any topic that you might want. And yes, the GFs actually do answer any team that calls in that right (albeit obviously most teams don't really have the need to do that every single month... we had like 5 of those dinners last year, fun times).

It sounds like some gilded-age nonsense, but [the core thesis of the judgment](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-ebay-domestic-holdings-inc-v-newmark) has been upheld in court within the last decade.

The problem is, it doesn't do that, at least not consistently. The real outcome is that things like paying dividends end up being treated as a bigger priority than anything else, even the continued existence of a company.

Are all sunscreens (assuming same SPF) equally effective?

As a smaller start-up CRO, does your company have its own vivarium facilities to perform in vivo studies in-house, or is that stage of drug development carried out by other larger CROs?

If you do, can you speak to the challenges of establishing a new live animal facility, IACUC, AAALAC certification, and approval by the various state and federal regulating agencies?

If not, how do you convince a client to contract their in vitro work with you and in vivo work with another CRO, vs. having all stages of development and testing done by a single CRO that is able to provide both?

* **Framing:**

    * There has been a lot in the popular press of late about how a new wave of general purpose robots (both hardware and software) able to learn and adapt will eliminate all kinds of jobs.  Of course one class of job that robots (without hard AI) can never eliminate is the Entrepreneur.  Further, an other consequence of the coming robot revolution that it may soon be much more possible for a single person to start up a company with few or no other employees, but rather rely upon robots for a number of ancillary functions (legal, benefits, physical plant maintenance etc).  Thus while robots may reduce the number of traditional jobs they may also increase the opportunities for entrepreneurship.

* **Questions:**

    * When you were starting out, how much value would you have received from not having to worry about all of the ancillary aspects of running a business and just focus upon developing your product and pitching it to customers?

Awhile back my dad got really, really bad poison oak. Like bad enough for him to have to go and get some heavy antihistamines and some kind of steroids to keep it contained from spreading and to eventually go away. 

The problem is, before he went and got the medication, he had run amuck through our entire onslaught of anti-poison oak/ivy stuff, and had essentially contaminated it all, not to my knowledge. 

So i end up using some tea tree oil that he contaminated, specifically near my nether regions to get rid of a lone chigger. So, by doing this, it being in my nether regions, and it, uhh, being so very sensitive and sweaty, spread like wildfire. So now its basically everywhere below my waist. The weird thing is though, is that its dormant. As in, it doesnt itch. At all. It only gets irritated after i get out of a shower. And even that is brief. 

Ive tried using tonnes of different at-home methods for getting rid of it but nothing seems to work. I just recently ordered phenolenated calamine lotion and i'm hoping that will do something.

The things I wish to ask you, is what do you know about the pathology of, and potential for treatment of chronic eczema? As someone who grew up with severe nut allergies, and asthma, I've found out first hand over the past couple years that it can trigger eczema as well. Since then I've been in a not so pleasant ride involving the eczema slowly spreading from my elbows to the entirety of my arms, causing itching and scarring, as well as some patches on my forehead, around the eyes, and around my mouth/chin area. Classically these types of skin problems are treated simply with a topical steroid, but that doesn't treat the pathological root of the disease: which seems to be sort of a perfect storm between autoimmune function and environmental factors; and such a treatment has many negative long term effects.

What can one do to identify and minimize exposure to the causes and triggers of eczema, and what kind of skin care products should we be looking at to help strengthen the skin and build a resistance in the interests of remission? What can be done to help heal the skin from the effects of previously suffered disease? Also, what do you think of using something like olive oil to condition the skin, scalp and hair?

In addition, I have several ideas I wish to begin pursuing with the potential of going into a high-tech based scientific products/services provider.

The lack of information or misinformation about the epidermis is pretty wild. Most dermatologists have gone to the lengths of prescribing anxiety and other medication related to mental health as a method of coping. Since there is very little they can do.

Or if these conditions might be caused by impractical grooming routines and possibly even excessive use of products containing unnatural ingredients and chemicals on a daily basis.

I had responded to this during the formal hour - but it seems with my internet issues, my response was not posted.
There is a rich diversity of botanical material that comprises molecular entities that might have beneficial effects, of one sort or another, on our skin. However, one of the issues that we wrestle with when considering such natural extracts is the intrinsic variability in the samples. The concentration of compound that is active in the extract (or compounds – in many cases there is a combination effect) will vary from one plant to another, from one harvest to another, from one processing and storage method to another. It is rare for a botanical extract to come with any assaying of the nature and concentrations of its active principles, at the discrete molecule species level. 
Hence we are not surprised when encouraging results with one sample are difficult to reproduce with another.
From your description, it sounds like this would be a drug product, subject to the rigors of the FDA approval process. Part of this entails demonstrating safety and efficacy, but part also entails demonstrating, under the chemistry manufacturing and controls “(CMC”) requirements, the reproducibility of the product.

The consensus in the scientific literature is that for a molecule to be able to permeate to a substantial degree through the skin, it must be small (less than some 450 Da in molecular weight) and slightly lipophilic (with the log of the octanol-water partition coefficient, logP, of around 2-3). If you look at all of the passive transdermal drug products on the market, the drugs within them conform reasonably with these criteria. We do work with molecules outside these traditional norms, and for at least some we have reasonable success, but these are at best peptides, <2k in molecular weight.

There are several reports describing the transdermal permeation of much larger molecules, even proteins. There is no consensus on how (or even if) this can happen. And, if such permeation is detectable, the ‘utilization’, that is the proportion of the compound in the formulation that is described as becoming bioavailable is small. 
For collagen with a molecular weight north of 100kDa, then, the odds are really stacked against being able to permeate the skin, intact, to any significant degree. Hence, until we see definitive data to the contrary, I remain unconvinced relative to transdermal collagen delivery. 

Our skin is intended to be a good barrier; if there were ready diffusion of molecules of that size, we would be leaking collagen all over the place.

Rather, there is an MPE, or much more typically, a combination of MPEs (which we term multiplexed MPEs, MMPEs) that works best for a given active. And that combination will usually not work nearly as well for a next active.

I do now appreciate better how important the people aspect is. In any start up there will be tough times, times when you are away for long hours from family and personal interests. If you are not working with people that you trust, respect, and enjoy being around, it can make those hours considerably less enjoyable. That is not unique to a start-up environment, but in a start-up you are usually more able to choose who your colleagues will be. Choose wisely.

If we know that delivery of a given molecular agent into the dermis, or into the vasculature for systemic availability, will have a beneficial physiological effect, yet the intrinsic permeability is very low, then use of an approach like a derma-roller or a microneedle array might be suggested.
This argument, though, would not necessarily apply to a product that is intended for application to intact skin. If you apply such a product to abraded or punctured skin, how would you know which types of molecules in the product would now move in greater quantity into the skin?

As chemists, we appreciate that different ingredients in formulation may react with each other and the rate of this reaction will almost always increase with temperature (about 2-fold for each 10 degree C temperature rise).

But unfortunately, thicker ointment is indeed better and messy so perhaps do this before bedtime. Another thing is the possible contribution of skin microflora and the role of antibiotics to get rid of some staph bacteria that may be leading to persistence and recurrence. Swimming in chlorinated pools or dilute bleach baths can be helpful. If you are getting immediate steroid rebound effects, also consider asking your dermatologist about non steroidal options like Elidel. But moisturizing is very very key.

Because I had a similar issue when I initially tried going into multimedia as a career. For me the problem was that doing my hobby as a job basically clashed with all the things that I liked about my hobby and that I was confident about, but if how I perceived my hobby had lined up more with how it functions as a job I might not have hated it as much. If that makes sense. Like, I don't feel as confident making stuff that's dictated by someone else and I don't do well when having to create stuff on a schedule with deadlines. So it made something I usually enjoyed and did well at exhausting, and made me constantly compare what I thought would work or what I wanted with what was demanded of me, but if I was the type of person who enjoyed a challenge in that area and did well on a deadline I might have done better. 

If someone did rock climbing as an activity where they focused a lot on safety and just having fun then they might not do well in a job in, say, rescue where it's dangerous and tense and they're out of their element despite performing familiar actions. But maybe they could do fine in a safe lab environment where they can focus on getting results because it's something they're more comfortable with? Alternatively, what if what they like about rock climbing is the thrill, and they're good at going up against a problem and conquering it? Then could they actually do well in a rescue type job that compliments that?",Ppleater,t2_7qn8v,3,0,reddit4

f30qrr6,t3_depwlm,2019-10-08 18:45:55,science,"IIRC the classic maxim for life-work balance is to find three things to which you can apply yourself; one that makes you money, one that gets you exercise, and one as a creative outlet. 

Seems like a lot of people have been tossing out the same half-joke of “what if the scientist is a geologist.”  That doesn’t matter if you’re able to pursue the aspects of the other hobbies that fulfill their respective purpose.  The fact that a geologist is climbing rocks isn’t particular meaningful if the geologist is fully applying him/herself to the rock climbing pursuit.

Many people find burnout with excessive overlap between hobbies and career because they get caught up in the business aspects of their hobby in the course of their work. Then you don’t enjoy the free time hobby of the same kind of pursuit. That’s the whole point of this article and anyone who is laughing it off and distancing themselves from it with pithy irony are doing themselves the greatest disservice.

For anyone who comes across this and is struggling with that balance, for any number of reasons, I can empathize. There are all kinds of reasons that life makes finding this balance difficult. But the best things in life can be found in the active pursuit of them.  Try what interests you as a possible hobby, don’t expect to be great at it when you’re new, and find something that speaks to you in some way.  Rounding out your life to support a hobby and balancing it against responsibilities is what life is all about.

Basically, I'm less willing to use my extra energy or time on work when I have the opportunity to use it on something I find more fulfilling (and I doubt I'll find a career where this will change in relation to climbing).

Perhaps I get anxious less at work when presented with a difficult situation, since I've developed good coping mechanisms for high stress situations over the years (focus on what you're doing and you will more likely be okay).

That being said  I'd happily take a mountain rescue job (the skills transfer over) if it paid well, but it would likely spoil climbing a little in that dragging bodies out of canyons and crevasses is very grim.",,,1,0,reddit4
