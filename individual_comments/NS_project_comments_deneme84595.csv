Men and women should be equal in ALL ways. I think that feminism used to be needed when women weren't allowed to vote and so on. Now it's become pretty extreme in some cases to the point that I knew a lot of people that didn't believe men could be hurt by women or didn't have the right to even disagree with a woman. People I knew (other feminists) would jump down my throat if I disagreed with something like that. I wasn't a real feminist if didn't believe all men are bad and things such as that. There are places where women are seen as lesser than men in  and those issues need to be addressed of course but the people I've seen most set on the fact that all men are pigs or whatever aren't much of a victim of sexism 24/7 like they seem to believe. Sure there will be sexist people. There's probably always going to be some asshole in the world who thinks one sex is lesser than the other but that should not mean that a persons entire gender is to blame.

We have brothers, sons, nephews. We have male significant others who have been abused by other women. Why shouldn't we care what happens to them?

(note: we are poly-amorous, so there's no jealousy or cheating in this example). My bf's other gf has a baby son by another man. When she gave birth, she was exhausted, but adamant about not circumcising. She had to say ""no"" to every person, five times each, after every ""benefit"" they came up with. At one point, a nurse started to take him to circumcise against her objections. She was so out of it (she had a difficult pregnancy and birth), at one point she just started to repeat ""don't cut my baby"" over and over. She's still mostly a feminist, but when she finally got energy, she was pissed about how they were pressuring her to do it. Her feminist mind went the direction of ""of course, being female, they assume I don't know what I actually want."" But the idea that baby boys have a right to bodily integrity is part of men's rights. 

As for selfish reasons to care: if marriage gets to be too risky, what man will continue to marry? Lots of women want to get married. Plus, despite the stereotypes, a lot of us are honest about what we want out of a man, and ""feminized"" is not there. 

Personally, I went through foster care. The foster mothers were worse to me than the foster fathers. The foster sisters were worse to me than the foster brothers. My biological mother was the reason for the foster care, and my biological brother was the one who protected me throughout foster care.

Equality of outcome, I think, is a fine idea but ultimately unrealistic without creating the very same problems we are working to resolve. I believe men and women are different, and that is okay.

As long as the men have the opportunity to be vets and women have the chance to be programmers I don't care so much about the end result. 

I believe the only way to ever get equality of outcome would be to introduce quota's and promote one gender over the other which is just the exact sexism I think we are all trying to avoid.

For all the people who still believe that feminism started out as a ""moderate"" movement, please take a look at the article ""What moderate feminists?"" By Carol Iannone
Vol. 99, Commentary, 06-01-1995, pp 46.
Available online at http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/fem/MODERA.html

A revealing excerpt:

These new gender feminists, who now rule the movement, ""believe that all our institutions, from the state to the family to the grade schools, perpetuate male dominance,"" and their view that the ""personal is political"" makes them ""impatient with piecemeal liberal reformist solutions and leads [them] to strive for a more radical transformation of our society than earlier feminists had envisioned.""

This is a nice, neat formulation which at the very least serves the purpose of allowing some criticism of some aspects of a movement whose fundamental premises--that our society's treatment of women was/is unfair, unjust, inequitable, and that the standard feminist remedies were/are self-evidently right and proper--no longer seem even to be a matter of debate. **The problem, however, is that the idea that the contemporary women's movement began in moderation and was then deflected and corrupted by a turn toward radicalism cannot survive critical scrutiny.**

Take Betty Friedan, the ""godmother"" of equity feminism for Sommers and many others. Looking back at her writings, and especially her most famous and influential book, The Feminine Mystique(1963), we soon see that Friedan ""godmothered"" the movement in more ways than one. While it is true that she did not deploy the quasi-Marxist jargon of oppression, gender antagonism, and patriarchy that would later dominate feminist discourse, she did inaugurate the pattern of hyperbole that came to fuel the movement after her. It was she who managed to make the condition of the postwar American woman seem one of soul- strangling asphyxiation and spiritual death. Indeed, for Friedan, submitting to the traditional feminine role was nothing less than an embrace of nonbeing:

It is urgent to understand how the very condition of being a housewife can create a sense of emptiness, nonexistence, nothingness, in women. There are aspects of the housewife role that make it almost impossible for a woman of adult intelligence to retain a sense of human identity, the firm core of self or ""I"" without which a human being, man or woman, is not truly alive.

It was also Friedan who helped initiate the now ever-expanding tendency to blame the most personal and complex of the ills of life on social or political conditions, and to remove them from the realm of individual moral character (thereby abetting our transformation into a society of victims and ""survivors""). On the basis of very little hard evidence, she identified ""the problem that has no name""--that is, the malaise and discontent among some educated upper-middle-class housewives-- and blew it up into something of massive proportions urgently demanding society-wide solutions.

And it was Friedan who helped define that useful paradox so beloved by activist leaders, whereby unhappiness, anger, frustration can be seen as signs of health, inasmuch as these reflect a rejection of the status quo, in this case the bitter void to which women were consigned. (This conceit persists in a great many films and plays, like Plenty and Tom and Viv, about neurotic bitches whose very neurosis supposedly bespeaks greater authenticity than that possessed by the walking dead around them.)

From this premise, Friedan launched like a booster rocket into her  biggest hyperbole of all:

In a sense that is not as far-fetched as it sounds, the women who ""adjust"" as housewives, who grow up wanting to be ""just a housewife, "" are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camps--and the millions more who refused to believe that the concentration camps existed.

What follows must be quoted in all its demented detail to be believed:

In fact, there is an uncanny, uncomfortable insight into why a woman can so easily lose her sense of self as a housewife in certain psychological observations made of the behavior of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. In these settings, purposely contrived for the dehumanization of man, the prisoners literally became ""walking corpses."" Those who ""adjusted"" to the conditions of the camps surrendered their human identity and went almost indifferently to their deaths. Strangely enough, the conditions which destroyed the human identity of so many prisoners were not the torture and the brutality, but conditions similar to those which destroy the identity of the American housewife.

In the concentration camps the prisoners were forced to adopt childlike behavior, forced to give up their individuality, and merge themselves into an amorphous mass. Their capacity for self-determination, their ability to predict the future and to prepare for it, was systematically destroyed. It was a gradual process which occurred in virtually imperceptible stages--but at the end, with the destruction of adult self-respect, of an adult frame of reference, the dehumanizing process was complete. . . .

To old prisoners [those who had been imprisoned for some time], the world of the camp was the only reality. They were reduced to childlike preoccupation with food, elimination, the satisfaction of primitive bodily needs; they had no privacy, and no stimulation from the outside world. . . .

It was said, finally, that not the SS but the prisoners themselves became their own worst enemy. Because they could not bear to see their situation as it really was--because they denied the very reality of their problem, and finally ""adjusted"" to the camp itself as if it were the only reality--they were caught in the prison of their own minds. . . .

All this seems terribly remote from the easy life of the American suburban housewife. But is not her house in reality a comfortable concentration camp? Have not women who live in the image of the feminine mystique trapped themselves within the narrow walls of their homes? They have learned to ""adjust"" to their biological role. They have become dependent, passive, childlike; they have given up their adult frame of reference to live at the lower human level Of food and things. The work they do does not require adult capabilities; it is endless, monotonous, unrewarding. American women are not, of course, being readied for mass extermination, but they are suffering a slow death of mind and spirit.

Despite the qualification in that last sentence, Friedan ultimately does not shy away even from that aspect of the analogy:

If we continue to produce millions of young mothers who stop their growth and education short of identity, we are committing quite simply genocide, starting with the mass burial of American women and ending with the progressive dehumanization of their sons and daughters.

I am antagonistic for the purpose of rooting out your motives. You claim to be redeemed from the evils of feminism although your dialog suggests you still have lingering indoctrination.

Case in point, your last reply is trying to defend the following statement you made:

>Plus, despite the stereotypes, a lot of us are honest about what we want out of a man, and ""feminized"" is not there.

You distinctly included yourself in the whole 'a lot of us'.  You are implying you know exactly what YOU want out of a man.  This perpetuates the view of men as wallets or pack mules or whatever utilitarian need a woman might have.  

Language like 'what I can get out of [this]' is very suspicious.

Then a little later you say:

Here you are back-pedaling, working some PR damage control.

I don’t see that the existence due to the intersectionality of class and gender statuses of a few powerful women in a historical context such as the holocaust negates the need for and relevance of feminism particularly where sexist attitudes towards women were enshrined in law.

When that's what's emphasized, I agree with you. I buried that comment in the middle of my post. It was an acknowledgement that some women will claim to want a man that it turns out they don't actually want anything to do with, and a reminder that some of us don't do that.

""Here you are back-pedaling, working some PR damage control.""

NO. Again, the bit about what makes a man beautiful was not in the same paragraph as the bit about me knowing what I want out of a man. That is because the two are not related. Someone else decided to skip over the fact that there's six sentences and a paragraph break between those two points to link them together when there wasn't meant to be a link.

""You claim to be redeemed from the evils of feminism although your dialog suggests you still have lingering indoctrination""

I am willing to believe that there might be some lingering indoctrination. I was on the fence about feminism, thinking it wasn't needed, until my parents forced me to go to a women's college that I didn't want to go to. So, four years, it kinda steeped in. It's been 12 years since then. For three years I kept mostly to myself. Then for 9 years I followed a bunch of anti-feminists and MRA's. For the past 3 years, I've been limiting how much I follow it, because the whole mess is depressing and I have enough trouble with depression without seeking out new ways to hate myself.

My motives for the initial post were this: I wanted to point out reasons why a woman might be against feminism. That was the entire motive. I've never understood the female propensity for having secret motives. I don't understand saying the opposite of what is meant. I don't understand hidden meanings, and I sure as hell have no clue how to hide anything that matters.

eenbuzi,t1_eel55fi,2019-01-21 22:08:08,MensRights,"Or, the person who insists that <me stating that I know what I want in the previous paragraph means that the next paragraph stating men are beautiful only applies when men are giving me what I want> is deliberately misrepresenting what I wrote, and I'm just trying to set the record straight.

I was taught that when you change paragraphs, you change trains of thought. That if it's the same train of thought, it should be in the same paragraph (exception if two characters are talking in the same train of thought).  I also have a bachelor's in mathematics. My hobby is prgramming. In math, a negative sign is a ""small detail"", yet it completely changes the meaning of an equation. And god help you if one single character is out of place in programming. You can't even mess up capitalization in most programming languages. So small details matter to me. 

Just like the small detail of the difference between 85 men and 85% of men. Linguistically, it's a tiny detail, just one character, but numerically, it's a huge difference. Or the difference between the day before her 18th birthday, or the day of her birthday. It's a small detail in the grand scheme of things, but in legal matters it makes all the difference in the world. (use of her because nobody is going after someone who has sex with a boy the day before his 18th birthday, not because I think it matters in one case and not the other).

I made a post intended to demonstrate the various reasons why women might take the side of the MRM. I am a woman who often sides with the MRM for a lot of isses, I wrote in first-person plural. My side intention was to help some men feel better about themselves. I see a lot of men saying that women are more beautiful than men, inside and out. Saying that men are ugly. So I wrote about the beauty of men. Personally, I think human bodies are ugly, especially the genitals of both sexes, (in typical female double-think, I am totally turned on by those ugly bodies. I don't understand it, but there it is) but I find the human spirit beautiful. So that's the beauty I wrote about in men. 

The entire reason the bit about men's beauty was the last part of my post, and in a separate paragraph despite how short the preceeding paragraph was, was to emphasize it being a completely different point to the rest of the post. And then someone goes and connect two separate points, eliminating the disconnect that I deliberatly indicated by my choice of paragraph breaks, destroying the message my post was intended to have. I had to defend against that cherry picking that everybody gets so upset by, and now I'm being told that a paragraph is a ""small detail"". 

So that there's no confusion, this post is meant to do three things:

1. show that a paragraph is not a ""small detail""

2. show that ""small detail""s can have huge impact on meaning

3. clarify what I intended by my initial post that started this whole thing

>I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded. There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. 

I want you to read very carefully for a minute. If you think the administration is not aware of what this teacher is doing you are dead wrong. By allowing it to happen for as long as the teacher has been doing that class, the school is willfully indifferent. That is implicit support and why willfull indifference is a thing under Title IX.

You say you aren't worried about retaliation but here is the deal. There are many ways a school can fuck with you. The teacher has the backing of the administration if she is getting away with this. Be very careful. When it comes to Title IX issues (which this is) it is like dealing with HR at a company. **Rule of acquisition number 48: The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife.** I have personally been down this road and see some similar mistakes being made here.. This is a topic of study for this professor. If you think that a short email and a quick talk will fix her thinking this way about men you are wrong. She will just do it to another person the next semester at best.

If you are in the USA and *actually* want to do something the *worst* thing to do is tell the administration. It is a conflict of interest for the school to find it discriminates against men. They don't do it. Have you ever read a news story showing a school investigated a professor and found they discriminate against men?

If in the USA you can file federally through OCR for free. I can point you to the website for filing and Title IX legal manual for reference if you choose to. Violation of Title IX is a federal issue. Let the OCR's lawyers represent you rather than hoping the school does the right thing. OCR has binding resolutions that force the school to do substantially more. Once you file, your protection against retaliation goes way up. From what I have read the general idea is that the burden of proof is shifted to the school to show an adverse action was *not* retaliation, rather than you needing to prove it was.

If I was about to, or wanted to file federally the last thing I would do is tip the entire case into their lap by dumping evidence to higher ups hoping the people who support this teacher will suddenly do the right thing. Establishing patterns of discrimination via OCR is useful for people who come after you. Also, more cases like this going to OCR helps set the tone and inform OCR this is a real issue across the country that we care about. OCR looks for case patterns. If we don't file, we arent changing the narrative. Hit me up if you want me to point you in OCR's direction.

Because I believe for example that the societal beliefs around motherhood, having babies by a certain age, staying home to raise children, and the stereotype that women are fragile have led to less women going to school and working. 

As well as the societal beliefs that men should provide, work hard, and financially take care of their family, and the stereotype that men are tough and the shouldn’t show any emotion have led to men being the majority of the work force and education system.

I.e. They are encourage to be classically feminine, and males classically masculine. One takes and one gives.

Today, we also encourage women to enter the workforce. The difference is that men are still expected to be classically masculine - workhorses, catering to women, and such. You can see how shit this situation is, right?

To add, males have 2 years compulsory imprisonment in the form of military service, so women get a great head start. In my school, teachers already say that fresh grads will get poached by the companies; meanwhile males are carted off to serve and twiddle their thumbs and do fuck all.

- more likely to be homeless

- given less access to low income healthcare, and have less government funding to research their healthcare

- given less access to homeless housing

- in some countries, are conscripted against their will

- in some countries, have a higher state pension age

- treated more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I live in Estonia, and it isn't that bad in here. We have 4 largely sex-orientes goverment organizations (I'll use direct translations for sake of simplicity):

**Defensive Alliance (DA)** is largely male oriented goverment military organization, though (as far as I know as 15 year old) women can also join. It is kind of military for Estonia, but it is ONLY used when we need to protect our country. It is an organization where everyone 18+ can join, and do not get paid for it. There are annual military excercises, where everyone joined MUST take part of, or they'll be fined. In the meantime, you'll be normal working citizen, not a soldier.

**Female Home Defense (FHD)** is pretty much same like DA, unsure about excercise part. They are ones who make food and that stuff. Only females can join there.

**Young Eagles** is our Boys Only organization. It is a preparation for DA, and covers most important topics like map, navigation and forest survival/camping, also military/forest/group discipline. For 13+ boys there are some controversial topics which I won't specify. I am a member of Eagles.

**Home Daughters** is the Girls Only club. Preparation for FHD. Don't know alot about what they do there.

Nobody has started complaining about the ""sexism"" of those organizations, just like there haven't been alot of feminism cases, if any at all, in Estonia, so it isn't as bad here as I see people complain everywhere else in the world.",,,9,0,reddit3

https://qz.com/671633/hillary-clinton-takes-a-stand-for-women-in-prison/


“Mass incarceration’s impact on women and their families has been particularly acute — and it doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” writes Clinton. The US is home to 5% of the world’s women, but imprisons 30% of the women incarcerated worldwide.

As we can see here : 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm

women make up only 9% of the US prison population.  The men in prison in America are also imprisoned at much higher rates than in any other country.  As Jim Jefferies joked - 'The land of the free has the largest percentage of non-free people in the world'

You can see from the bbc table, that the US is imprisoning men at 6x the rate of the rest of the world too.....  So why is Hillary only focused on the 9% that women make up of the prison population?

Not a reliable figure. In the third world, circumcision is not usually on babies. In the first world (North America), where neo-natal circumcision is common, the ""hundreds"" figure was obtained by assuming all unassigned male-over-female neonatal deaths to be due to circumcision. More careful studies have put the North American rate at about 20 deaths per year out of an incidence of about one million circumcisions annually.   



To preserve credibility, MR should omit the ""hundreds"" nonsense and instead argue that those 20 deaths (and an unquantified number of serious botches) are completely unnecessary given that the benefits of the elective procedure are ambiguous.",Mens-Advocate,t2_o4u60,3,0,reddit3

It's one thing to say men face social rights issues, but it's another thing entirely to say that they are institutionally disadvantaged to women overall.

Baby girls in China are literally abandoned or killed by their parents because boys are preferred. Female genital mutilation is done for the sake of keeping women faithful to their husbands by ""disabling"" them from feeling sexual pleasure. Women in the middle east literally are commanded BY LAW not to do things like drive, or even just dress the way they want. 

I get that there are many issues men face, but please, please don't delude yourself into believing that all feminists are out to get men and install a matriarchal society where men suffer for the sins of their fathers. That is not what the majority of feminists want, and as men we shouldn't try to make ourselves out to be the ""bigger"" victims, because in the reality of this world that just makes us out to be people who long for the old days when women everywhere had fewer civil and social rights.

It depends on what part of the data you are looking at. If you’re talking about men as a group, you have to include all men.

Men are equally likely to be smarter and equally likely
to be dumber than women statistically. Talking about men as superior makes you wrong because we also have all the dumbass in the world, which is why our averages are equal.

""IQ has nothing to do with success""

never said it did. please stop putting words in my mouth.

IQ is merely a measure of how well a mind can solve problems, not a measure of their motivation and discipline to solve problems on a regular basis and therefore derive success


also, 80% was an exaggeration because Reddit. here is my source and an explanation of the actual figured though( not far off)

http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/PAID2011.pdf

In table 3, the one with the consistent participants, at the age of 16 boys had an average IQ of 101.461 with an sd of 15.235 and girls had an average IQ of 99.681 with an sd of 14.085.

Though the difference in standard deviation is small, such differences can have a huge effect on the number of outliers.
For example, in the model where IQ follows a normal distribution for each gender (mean 101.461 for boys with sd 15.235 and mean 99.681 for girls with sd 14.085), one would expect nearly twice as many boys as girls with an IQ above 130. To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model.
These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean. For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.


In closing, even if men disproportionately occupy the retard spectrum of the bell curve, they also disproportionately occupy the genius spectrum. and geniuses are the ones who change the world and innovate and discover and invent. therefore men are the dominant force in the world.  evidence for that is all around you. who invented the device you're talking to me on right now? the internet it uses? the satellites/towers/optics it transmits information to?   name 1 female innovator of antiquity and there are 20-40 men for every 1 female, which backs up the statistics(even though they need no backing up)",RetortsLikeAristotle,t2_2cqouh12,2,0,reddit3

It’s not so helpful when the brain doesn’t finish developing until 25. It would be more accurate to see the same test for fully developed adults to start categorizing gender.

A 2-5 IQ point difference is something but basically pointless.

If you were to pick at random, you would have equally likely chances of a man being a dumbass as well as being a genius. You have statistically the same chance. 

So where you are correct, is if you were asked to pick who is more likely to be the genius between a girl & a guy, then yes you would pick a guy. But that’s a different question than asking who is smarter. Because in this case the average is the same, so it doesn’t matter which gender you pick. 

The answer changes due to the fact that your analyzing different parts of the data.

So at 16 years old, 2:1 ratio of guys to girls at 130 - which is 2.28% of the population. Which is 1.5% male and .77% female of the population.

And a 6:1 at 160 - which is the 0.001% of the population. Which is 0.000833% of the population for men & 0.0001666% of the population for women, I don’t think they are statistically relevantly to include in random tests for determining who’s smarter.

We can dive deep into semantics, but that is not really my point here. The whole point of this sub is to make people aware of men’s issues and share together the burden and suffering that men uniquely face and make it important. We are trying to build support and help people take men’s issues serious because men are often an afterthought. We are expected to handle the dangerous sides of life. And we do matter and our issues do matter.

While I understand your frustration and want to point out the delusions of feminist rhetoric, believing men are superior and deserve to be worshipped is what got us in this hot mess. We don’t need to be talking
about who’s the superior sex or who’s more important We need to gain support from both men and women in the issues men face. Because right now, all discourse is completely dominated by women and men need a voice to share their thoughts and feeling and frustrations. Women think that because men perform at the top level across the board mean that all men live lives like that — but we don’t. There are men who operate at the lower levels of intelligence and get looked down upon, there are men who have to risk their lives everyday, there are men who have to deal with mental issues and are more harshly treated because of it. 

When we have discussions with people who aren’t men activists, we have to think in their perspective and give them things that they can empathize with and support us. We won’t get women who will day ah yes, men are smarter and therefore deserve more respect or prestige.

Because one man disagrees with your worldview, you assert than men, collectively, do not understand history? That's one big fucking leap. 

>Let me ask you a question, were men in the past privileged or not?

Not particularly. What makes you think they were? Most *people* in history have lived quite shitty lives. Men and women. How can you quantify suffering? Did women in the past need to go and fight in wars? No. Did they need to do all the back-breaking manual labour? No. Did your grandmother die of black-lung from working in the coal pits? No. So what privileges do you imagine the common man had?

>Men are far overrepresented in the STEM field.

Uhh, technically no. If you take the proportion of degree holders women are over-represented in STEM positions. If you take the proportion of college students women are over-represented because there are more scholarships available to them. Men are more common in the STEM field because they choose the subject more often than women do but they're not over-represented. You can't mandate career interest, unfortunately.

Q: Do you think that babies should be protected from genital mutilation?  What about circumcision?

Q: Should we have more women in board rooms and CEO positions?  Where is the outcry about getting more women into garbage pickup, road construction, sewage work?  

Q: Should people get special treatment based on their gender, or should everyone be treated the same?  Should people get special treatment based on skin color?  How about beliefs?  What about height? - Most people feel that people should be treated the same, but they don't actually know what ""the same"" means.  then bring up affermative action, the draft, women's only grants, etc.  How is that ""fair"".

Having said that, I think you’ve answered a few of the key points, but it needs refinement.

Congress:  Ask them why there aren’t more women in STEM, despite all the push with  programs and funding to get them there.  Answer: Most women aren’t interested in those fields, so they don’t pick them. They have this quirk that all humans have called, “personal preference.”  Conclusion: There aren’t a majority of women interested in running for political office either.  Certainly doesn’t mean women are oppressed from positions of power (Margaret Thatcher, anyone?).

Poor Media Representation:  How?  When have you seen any show in the last 20 years make fun of a woman the way men are stereotyped as being idiots (which you mentioned).  What exactly do they mean by poor media representation?

Reproductive Rights: You’ve oversimplified it a bit, but one thing to point out is that women have every right to decide if an unborn child lives or dies (regardless of what the man wants), and if she keeps that child, the man has to pay (regardless of whether he wants to be involved in that child’s life or not).  Ask them, “So tell me again what reproductive rights you DON’T have that men DO have?”

Otherwise not bad. Try to keep the hate out of your remarks though.  That just lets them know that you’re frustrated.  Always be calm and level-headed.  Bonus points for infuriating them with your calm demeanor.

Yes rights issues exist that are specific to a given gender however I feel the focus is best placed upon human rights and the rights of children which by their nature must be applied without prejudice including gender. 

Ensuring our laws gender neutral is a good starting point.

Some examples

Female genital mutilation laws and all that they represent and protect should be rebranded as simply human genital mutilation laws. If we can not extend protections to children equally regardless of gender what hope do we have achieving it with adults?

Mandatory conscription into military for the purpose of wartime effort. This has been one of the most damaging elements to men historically in terms of perceived worth or in this instance a sense of disposability held by societies. 
Countries such as Norway, Sweden and Israel have made conscription gender neutral. Don't underestimate the impact of this change, feminists who represent the most toxic element of their initiative can take comfort that equality has been afforded and women during the next wartime effort can die in equal numbers to men. 

Don't lose sight of the fact that gender equality and neutrality has always been the end game.",,,2,0,reddit4

It’s true that they could order a female condom online, but it’s only 79% effective, so 21 out of 100 people can get pregnant and that’s a lot. I know that there’s plenty of other contraceptives, but they can get expensive, have side-effects that are too much for some (bloodclots, stroke, depression, suicidal thoughts, death, etc.) and aren’t 100% effective. There also is the fact that some people get raped and end up pregnant that way, so even being abstinent isn’t 100% effective. I know that not every pregnancy is due to rape, but still pregnancy happens even with the best preventative measures. I think that it’s wrong for people to use abortion as birth control (for example: getting one every month or so instead of being safe when possible), but getting pregnant due to pure ignorance as you honestly weren’t taught properly in school or by your parents, getting raped, having a medical condition that can harm you, the baby or both, an accidental screwup like forgetting to take your birth control one day, etc. are valid reasons to get one. I luckily have never been pregnant and never plan to be, but I can still imagine how horrifying it would be for me if it happened and I am in no way mentally capable of being pregnant. I know everyone has their own view on it, but I literally can only see being pregnant as having a parasite like the one from the movie Alien. I can’t handle the thought of anything growing and being inside me and feeding off me like that.

Also, what another commentor said, you definitely can and should bring up that women have more reproductive rights than men as they can choose to be mothers or not, while the men can’t. I think that unless a man is never told about the pregnancy and that it’s their child, then men should have a time limit where they decide whether or not they want to give up their parental rights. If they decide to give up their rights, then they can’t be forced to pay child support and should not be called a deadbeat dad nor any other names. If they choose to not relinquish their rights, then they should take care of the child. I also think that each parent should automatically get joint custody where either one parent has the child for one week and the other other has them the next, or one parent has them for 3 and a half days and the other has them the next 3 and a half days. No child support involved, but each contribute equally to school, food, clothing, etc. The only thing that could make it not joint is if one of the parents is unfit or something. I just hate that I personally know many men that have “joint” custody and yet only see their kids every other weekend and pay for all their expenses.",EgalitarianGirl777,t2_y48lv0l,1,0,reddit4

f60jesu,t3_dpqta1,2019-11-01 14:32:43,MensRights,"Here are some add-ons:

Gender pay gap - The gender pay gap is based off of misleading statistics as the actual percentage is based off of the total earnings between men and women without considering any variables. Even if it is true, no business would ever hire a man if they knew they could get away with paying women less. If you have ever been in an economics or accounting class, you would know why that is.

Congress - You could either run yourself (since AOC was a bartender), or actually vote for the women who run. It really shouldn't matter in the long run because what they plan on doing when they get the position should matter more that what is between their legs.

poor representation - I really don't understand why they have a problem with this considering women had starring roles ever since the creation of movies (Dorothy from the wizard of oz for example). Even if they weren't in lead roles then, that certainly isn't the case now as we have many action movies that have female protagonists (they also seem to convieniently forget about chick flicks) and video games ever since the NES days (Metroid, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil etc.) so why are they harping on about this oh so pressing ""social injustice""? And no, men don't like female protagonists solely on the basis of her being female. There are plenty of TV shows and movies that are guilty of the ""mary sue"" trope which was made in response to females being commonly written as side characters in the older movies and they went from too nerfed to too overpowered that they would have next to no character development as it would seem giving a woman any weaknesses to overcome is hateful.

Other than that those are good arguments.

f5z4uus,t3_dpqta1,2019-11-01 00:13:16,MensRights,"I think you are going about this the wrong way. First of all, don’t confuse sexist women with feminists. Feminism often gets a bad reputation, but men’s rights issues are feminist issues as well — not “rebuttals” to them.

I want to reiterate that last line — men’s issues should not be used to silence women’s issues. When the wage gap is brought up, you are not rebutting it with:
-the homelessness gap
-the workplace death gap
-the child custody gap
-the suicide gap
These are all the results of sexism. Women get paid less (and men die at work more often) BECAUSE OF GENDER INEQUALITY. The fact that women technically can work construction on high steel (just as an example), there are very real societal reasons why they don’t. This is what feminism tries to address.

I don’t really know what you mean by the media representation point, so maybe you could clarify?

Lastly, there is no abortion debate. There is only an attack on a woman’s body autonomy. “Life begins at conception” is what’s called a red herring. It’s a distraction and is completely irrelevant. 

Here’s an example. If a child and mother are in a car accident and the child needs a blood transfusion from the mother, the mother has the right to refuse. The mother has the right to let her child (or husband or neighbour or anyone else for that matter) die in front of her just because she doesn’t want to have a needle stuck in her arm. No one has the right to harvest blood from a body that does not consent to donating it. This is not a “clump of cells” this is a healthy living child. 

To take this a step further, if the mother dies in the accident the doctor is still not allowed to take her blood or any organ because the doctor does not have her consent. A donor card would be required because consent is not assumed. Putting an unborn child’s life ahead of a woman’s choice is not only giving the fetus more rights than a person, it’s also giving a woman fewer rights than a corps.

An abortion is not about “killing the child” — another red herring. It is about removing the child from the woman’s body.",mavesticks,t2_a5rk8,-1,0,reddit4

Recently, one of my friends from high school (I'm in college) shared an Instagram story containing a Tumblr ss of a teacher saying how they narrated to their students (in very truncated form) what was essentially a gender-flip (students didn't know this) of the Lion King (which they had voted as their favourite Disney movie) a little earlier, and saying then that the students described it as awfully boring and a chick-flick. The teacher then revealed the fact that it was indeed a gender-flip of the Lion King. I replied to her story by pointing out why the anecdote was essentially half-baked feminist rhetoric (didn't use the word 'feminist'): the narration was too truncated to sound especially interesting, therefore it wouldn't matter if the gender was flipped (only the chick-flick part would be different) how boring it sounded.

According to the data given by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, worldwide, 78.7% of homicide victims are men, and in 193 of the 202 listed countries or regions, men were 

more likely to be killed than women. In two, the ratio was 50:50 (Switzerland and British Virgin Islands), and in the remaining seven – Tonga, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Latvia and Hong Kong – women were slightly more likely to be victims of homicides compared to males. A 2013 global study on homicide by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that men accounted for about 96 percent of all homicide perpetrators worldwide  and 79% of the victims (see the chart below). The homicide rate is per year per 100,000 inhabitants.

If women wanted women in office, all they'd have to do is vote for them.  It is women who put men in office, and those men often cater to women and women's interests.

Our female / feminist controlled Congress acts in much the same way for women as the ""patriarchy"" is supposed to work for men (except the ""feminarchy"" actually exists).

Examples of laws that women / feminists have influenced with their disproportionate political power include: 

* sexual assault laws (where women legally can't be prosecuted for raping a man)
* domestic violence laws (where male victims are arrested instead of their female perpetrators)
* marriage laws
* divorce laws
* child custody laws
* welfare and taxation (women have consistently voted to expand welfare and government benefits to themselves, which are paid for by male taxpayers)
* education reform (leading to, for example, female school teachers giving male students lower scores for the same work)",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,9,0,reddit4

They’re tilting the decks in their favour and know it. Why do you think the pile-ons are SO intense when someone points out what’s happening?

And far too much of it falls into the ""watch my show because you *should* enjoy it just because I'm so persecuted and I'm under-represented in media and life is so much harder for me than for most people, but also fuck you for daring to think you can sympathize with me because you're the problem and you can't possibly understand my suffering, but still watch my show and call it brave and inspiring and genius"" milieu, which is, quite disappointingly, a thing.

Sex Education on Netflix is insulting. The female characters are toxic, constantly putting down the straight, male characters, which is somehow supposed to be endearing. Even when they blatantly show their toxicity, they blame *their own behavior* on the mythical ""Patriarchy.""

Gillian Anderson's character is disgusting. She invades her son's privacy incessantly yet guards all information about herself like her life depends on it, and instead of calling her on this hypocrisy, it blames male characters and makes them look bad to divert focus and just forgets all the horrible stuff she does. How about when she actually starts a serious romantic relationship and goes out of her way to hide it and lie about it to her son, who lives in the same house and sees her every day? No, no, nevermind that, back to what the men are doing wrong. She even tries to publish a book about her son's deepest secrets, then says she was writing it to get closer to him. Then why did she try to have it published!?!? What did *that* have to do with getting closer to him? Really, it was just so she could prove what power she had over his private information, but the show completely forgets about that and lets her off the hook. When her gathering of the students'  secrets through her *confidential counseling sessions* with them leads to all the kids' private stuff becoming public, it also gets blamed on a man. No, no, pay no attention to the fact that she collected it at all in the first place so she could write a book about it. Quick, look what that bad man is doing!

And the Maeve character is ridiculous. The show continually tells you how super, incredibly smart she is. Why she's practically the greatest genius of all time! Well, it's a good thing they constantly tell you that because you would have no idea from anything she ever says or does. Her choices are endlessly stupid, but, no, really, she's just so underappreciated. And, also, she's totally oppressed by the ""Patriarchy."" That's why none of her behavior makes sense.

I don't even want to get into the ""struggle"" of the nonbinary characters. Gay men in real life have been violently attacked and even murdered for being gay. But the nonbinary people in this show are oh-so tragically persecuted because they're politely asked to adhere to the dress code of the school they chose to attend and because they're shown a sex education video that doesn't include them, though exactly what that means is unclear since they still have the same reproductive organs as the other students.

And that show is just one example. I can't stand Disney's Marvel shows. The superhero shows on the CW got real old real fast. They've become about representation and whining and not quality entertainment. I want good TV, regardless of the color or gender or sexuality of the characters. The new Queer as Folk is overly pluralist garbage with selfish, irresponsible characters who want recognition just because they're not heteronormative. But what do they do that's actually worth recognizing? And, really, as if real people's groups of friends are so incredibly diverse, making sure to include as many types of people as possible.

igfi9u9,t3_w0jwdi,2022-07-16 19:28:00,MensRights,"> Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

Top Gun: Maverick is telling a story that is not available to audiences right now, and therefore the movie is able to capitalize – with record-setting numbers – on that huge, unmet need in the marketplace. Considering how ""Maverick"" stands out among its contemporaries, isn't it strange how all these supposedly ""diverse"" shows are exactly the same? If you stop and consider the last few years, it's clear that this ""diversity"" push only gives us predictable and repetitive content (note: I feel it would be wrong to refer to such boring and lazy products as ""art""). Well, the reason for this is that Tinseltown is applying ""diversity"" at the wrong level, by trying to fit the concept into individual stories. Simply put, companies could employ the same racial mix of acting talent if they filmed Black Panther (all-black) and Peter Jackson's LOTR (all-white) as separate films, but instead they are idiots and choose to make two movies that have identical racially-mixed casts to try and achieve the same end result. There's actually a term – level confusion – for this common type of mistake in mathematics and statistics, because of how easy it is to do when dealing with groups of objects. Our brains and language naturally don't deal with multiple levels of things, so we get confused and believe things that are impossible. And speaking of impossibilities: ""diverse show"" is actually an impossible construct for the type of diversity they want to achieve (mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an average, or variation from a median/mean, when the sample size is ""1""). I mean, if you could have a ""diverse show"" – a contradiction in terms, but let's say for argument that such an impossible object could actually exist in reality – then all you would need to do is clone and repeat that show, and you would successfully create a ""diverse"" industry. It's madness. If your presuppositions lead to the conclusion that all shows must be identical to each other in order to achieve ""diversity"", then you're doing something terribly wrong.

Unfortunately, I doubt this problem will be fixed anytime soon. People in Hollyweird lack the intelligence and long-term thinking required to apply diversity properly at the **industry** level, like they should be doing. And even if they could see their mistake, the problem is that they aren't strategically applying these quotas – and monitoring/measuring to find out when they are no longer needed – to combat actual attitudes of prejudice and injustice across the vast realm of arts and culture. No, they are doing it out of blind cowardice and a selfish, personal fear of being labeled an ""istaphobe"" of some kind. Just look at the recent way the GoT and Friends creators are bending over backwards to apologize for the ethnic ""homogeneity"" in those shows.

The dilemma is that apologizing and showing weakness like that only leads to more attacks and shakedowns of their business. Mature, strong leadership at the industry level would result in a much different response to any such attempts to slander these existing properties (and by proxy to try and stain the entertainment business as a whole). Imagine this statement instead from some overarching body or group: ""The entertainment industry remains committed to telling a diverse range of individual stories, whether primarily white or black, male or female, straight or gay, and more, including mixed casts of those groups as well, whenever the particular narrative being represented means it is appropriate to do so. Telling good, genuine stories means confining the setting to a specific time, location, and group of people, and we know this will – in time – give us a wonderful, diverse range of individual shows that will be very different from each other. As an industry, we are dedicated to telling a story for *everyone*, whether that is based on identity, socioeconomic, politicial, religious, or other group traits. We support the individual stories told by *Friends* and *Game of Thrones*, in the same way we celebrate all the distinct and personal creations in our industry.""

If these ""adult pretenders"" fail to stand up to the bullying, and don't fix their ""diversity incentives"" to stop discriminating against white males like yourself (though I hear that black males do get largely similar treatment...unfortunately, having a black female allows a company to check *two* ""protected class"" boxes on the budget refund calculator), then the industry will eventually die and be replaced (see the recent rise of Japanese anime/manga, South Korean TV dramas, independent content creations from YouTube, etc, Bollywood films, and more, as the beginning of this long-term trend).",RoryTate,t2_ghli7,4,0,reddit1

If you’d like to go further down the rabbit hole, look into *who* invests into companies like Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet (YouTube/Google), and other publishing companies. 

One principal culprit would be BlackRock (which, ironically, I bet you haven’t heard leftists criticise), the single largest and most valuable entity in history, who owns Vanguard among other things. They use something called an ESG score to decide which companies to invest into - this score ranks companies based on their environmental consciousness, social issue awareness (read: diversity quotas) and governance. In other words, companies are literally being paid to discriminate against white men. It’s not just BlackRock which uses ESG either, dozens of other multinational banks and investors use it in order to facilitate the “woke agenda”.",4damW,t2_6hg8nb4j,4,0,reddit1

It's infuriating in multiple ways. I could do a whole essay just on the insanely hypocritical, self-important, insipid, agenda-skewed, reductive, and manipulative sins of Good Trouble, which is a spin-off of The Fosters, which ended but was popular and almost as bad. But the biggest thing is how it does that thing I see under-represented groups do that I absolutely hate: attack their own allies. Or would-be allies. It blames and insults the very people they're simultaneously asking for sympathy and support from. It says ""you *have* to support me because you owe me, but, no, you're not supporting me *enough* and also it has to be in exactly the way I tell you to, and you have to flog yourself while doing it, and I'm not going to support you back because you suck, and don't you dare notice the people I hurt when I feel like it because I'm allowed to do that, and, by the way, you're welcome for my allowing you to do my bidding.""

It's the kind of thing that actually drives supporters away, and I can't stand how pleased it is with itself while being a terribly-written show. But my roommate watches a lot of stuff without noticing how awful it is. Some of it has been stuff we watch together, though.

Woke-ness ruined American Gods. And another adaptation of beloved Neil Gaiman material is clearly continuing the trend. I'm a huge fan of The Sandman comic, but I saw the trailer for the new Netflix series and said, nope, I'm out, before it even starts I'm out.

And it's not just American shows. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, from Australia, has a feminist bent, but the main character is mature and fairly well-balanced about it, and the rest of the show is fun enough without making woke tendencies too much of a thing. But the spin-off, Ms. Fisher's Modern Mysteries, set decades later with the niece of the previous show's mc, goes completely into ""men are dumb brutes and women need to do everything for them and are the only ones who know anything yet men have all the power while women are deprived and oppressed because Patriarchy"" territory.

hbitrq4,t3_phffry,2021-09-04 02:17:09,MensRights,"Yes I love how it’s “men” who oppose abortion.  The large number of women in the “right to life” movement are conveniently airbrushed.  

The “debate” (such as it is) is not about men trampling on a “woman’s right to control her body” but about whether a woman’s rights trump those of a developing foetus: and the appropriate cutoff time where abortion rights should stop or be restricted and the terms where it can be allowed after that time (ie the child has an incurable heart condition and no chance of living if born, is brain dead, birth could endanger the mother’s life etc).  

These are societal questions.  We don’t say with DV that a man can murder his wife as it’s a “moral question for the couple”.  Couples can argue, and it’s their personal issue.  But as a society we draw the line at grievous bodily harm (unless the man’s the victim apparently).  And it’s this that the argument is about.  It’s why you get so many women opposing abortion, a supposedly “women’s rights” fundamental.  

I think the truth is that feminists in general do not want the discussion as they are pro-abortion, and just want it to be settled as legal and available.  Casting it as “nasty men” seeking to control women is just a shutdown tactic.  Also feminism regards anything they don’t like, or isn’t exulting women, is “patriarch”, and therefore men controlling women.

Later, when there is a baby on the way, women can decide to have an abortion as they wish. THE FATHER'S AGREEMENT OR SIGNATURE IS NOT REQUIRED, he has no say in it. So currently ONLY women have reproductive rights in this country (US). Same with parenting rights, women can take away men's children from them for life if they wish, in a divorce.

hbwu9z4,t1_hbj5f9b,2021-09-07 09:21:21,MensRights,"I don't think it is that messy at all. In fact it is quite simple.

We just have to look at this on the basis of reality, not on the basis of political declarations and mandates. So here goes:

No woman can give birth without a man's sperm. The sperm came from ***his*** body, and was part of his body. As a result, the child's DNA is half of that of the father's. So the child is half his. Accordingly, he should have exactly ***equal*** rights in deciding about whether to get pregnant, when, whether to have an abortion.

The feminist (and generally female) distortion is this: somehow, the uterus being occupied for 9 months and the woman going through labor, this fact somehow, in their (incorrect) view, gives ***all*** parental rights to ***her***. I cannot fathom on what basis. The child is half the father's. It is his body, too. How come only she has ""my body, my choice"" rights?

What we have to be realistic about here, is the role of the uterus. It is simply a delivery mechanism that Mother Nature settled on millions of years ago. All mammals reproduce the same way. Every female sheep or goat gives birth by the same automatic mechanism. Without any big hoopla. It is an involuntary and automatic process.

But in a human society women and feminists somehow distorted this into giving 100% of parental rights to the woman only. On who knows what basis. It is an arbitrary and human-made decision that has no relation to reality. We need to get over this view, the sooner the better.

Really, it is that simple, you know. As in ""equal rights"", you see. As in equal reproductive and parental rights. As in it is half his baby, and his body, and his choice, equally.

I thought ""equity"", ""equality"" and ""equal rights"" are what feminism was ***supposed*** to be about.

hc05afa,t1_hbz8hxg,2021-09-08 01:07:30,MensRights,"OK, I misunderstood your claim but this is even more bizarre. When was the last time anybody could ""force"" a woman to give birth? As it stands now it is exclusively the woman's decision whether to have an abortion or not, the father has no say in it. This is not about making abortion illegal at all. I am for sure not for making abortion illegal, just the opposite. I think this planet has an overpopulation problem and the last thing we need is more babies.

What I am saying is that either 

(a) if women have all the reproductive rights, such as they alone make decisions about getting pregnant or not and about having an abortion then the they should have all the reproductive responsibilities, too. I.e. the father should not be responsible for a kid he didn't agree to have. 

Or, 

(b) the father has 50% of reproductive rights and 50% of the reproductive responsibilities (but not 100% like now). In this case, however, an abortion cannot go ahead without the father's signed agreement. This is not forcing the woman to undergo pregnancy, this is simply half of the reproductive rights. If both of them agreed to the pregnancy then only both of them can agree on an abortion. The women should not be allowed to arbitrarily change her mind about her agreement with the man.

This would also incentivize women to think hard and long before getting pregnant, such as lying about being on the pill etc. and make a man a father against his will.

It is simply about equal reproductive and parenting rights. As in ""equal rights"", you know. Isn't feminism ***supposed*** to be about ""equality"", ""equity"" and ""equal rights""? Equal rights includes reproductive and parenting rights.

Right now, ONLY WOMEN HAVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, at least in the US, men have zero (0) reproductive rights. This must change, that's all there is to it.",,,1,0,reddit2

Or

\- OK, go ahead without his permission but then a judge and lawyers have to work out a penalty in form of some sort of compensation for him for ""pain and suffering"". She would owe a significant amount of money to him, as decided by a judge or agreed to in a settlement.

The general idea is that there will be a consequence for a woman who arbitrarily changes her mind and violates an agreement with the man. Namely, because such a sudden change of mind does cause a significant amount of mental pain and anguish to the man who fully expected to become a father and had a promise that it will happen. Essentially, he is robbed of a fatherhood he wanted, had an agreement to get, and was prepared to raise the baby.

Remember when the current US president introduced the violence against women act?  Legislation specifically for women.  It became a little more sane before it got signed, but the intention was clear.  Men are violent, women are victims.  When Hillary boldly announced that women have always been the primary victims of war, the left didn’t do much.  Boys are falling behind in both school and college, but all we hear from the left is how women need more advantages in education.  

The part of the left that is focused on individual freedoms is not very strong these days.  The part of the left that wants to dictate behaviors and society is.  The terminology is confusing, because conservative talking heads have managed to put a negative connotation on “liberal”, but I divide the left into liberal and regressive.  

The left and the right in the US’s two party system are both focused on extracting value from men while blaming them for things.  The right hates poor men, the left thinks men have an unfair advantage (especially in areas where men don’t).

Anyway abortion DOES affect society as a whole.  For one thing, women do not administer abortions to themselves.  They have to go to a clinic, and have medical staff perform the procedure.  More fundamentally, it’s a question of when when a foetus deserves to be considered a life.  No one has really resolved this.  

For me, one of the issues with this is the clear double standard that feminism has.  Once a man has had sex with a woman, if she gets pregnant and keeps the child, he’s totally liable for financial support until the child turns 18.  But feminists also claim that she should be able to have the child aborted at anytime prior to birth if she chooses (“my body, my choice” remember) and the father has no say at all.  And they claim it’s equal, and the woman doesn’t have greater rights!  Spillar actually claimed that men have full rights as he could wear a condom, and they should have a discussion prior to sex.  Somehow I think she (and you) would be apoplectic is a man said the woman has a free right to choose as she could have used contraception, and they should have had a discussion prior to sex as to if he’d support her and any child for 20 years!

> Men are violent, women are victims.

While this may be the public's general opinion, the act did not state this. Yes, I'm aware of the Duluth Model, created 40 years ago by a group of like 5 radical feminists. However, you can't say that the violence against women act wasn't a huge step in the right direction. It helped reduce and prevent stalking and violence against women. That's what it was made to do. And domestic violence is heavily one sided. Men are way more likely to kill their targets. 

>The part of the left that is focused on individual freedoms is not very strong these days.

Elaborate? The left supports abortion, which supports women's individual freedoms to bodily autonomy. The right vehemently disagrees. The left advocates for free speech, like burning an american flag in a protest, while the right whines and says it's un-American and virtue signals ""free speech"" and complains they can't say the n-word and commit hate crimes. The paradox of intolerance. If you're tolerant of anything, you open yourself to oppression. 

>the US’s two party system are both focused on extracting value from men while blaming them for things

That's why we're pushing women into the workforce and military, right? 

> The right hates poor men

And women! And transpeople! And Atheists! And Muslims (especially muslims!). And don't tell me that the right loves women because they want women to bear children and be stay at home moms where they do all the housework while the man goes out and does the dirty jobs. 

>the left thinks men have an unfair advantage (especially in areas where men don’t). 

No, the left agrees with intersectionality, which directly opposes your statement ""the left thinks men have an unfair advantage"". The left *does* think men have an unfair advantage in most cases because that's what the data shows. That's not to say that individual men don't have advantages. Only that simply men *statistically* have an advantage. 

>This sub is the most visible point for men’s advocacy on Reddit

I would have to strongly disagree. This sub is a place where some discussion about men's issues happens, but it's mostly about hating feminism and leftists. This sub has a *deeply* fundamental misunderstanding of what third wave intersectional feminism even means. Feminist subs talk about men's issues all the time (the exact same issues, and others, you talk about over here), and I'd be willing to bet you never go to those places to even see.

And she calls that “equality”!  How is it any different to saying the girl should go on the pill or “keep her legs together”?  It’s the same!

Very  frequently not the case.  The regressive left is very vocal about things that can't be said.  

>That's why we're pushing women into the workforce and military, right? 

With special privileges for being female.  Always.  Women (who are already advantaged in education and corporate work environments) continue to get benefits men aren't allowed to have.  My last job had not one,  but three, company funded groups for women, and zero for men.  

>And don't tell me that the right loves women 

I'm not a fan of traditional roles, but historically those roles have out-competed every other cultural option.  By a lot.  I'm not here to defend the right, but I can see they have a valid perspective.  The very religious families I know are highly organized and frequently manage to raise exceptional children.  That some people thrive in highly structured environments like church and civic groups shouldn't come as a shock.  

>No, the left agrees with intersectionality

An idea that might have some merit in theory, but always fails in practice.  Black women have much better outcomes than black men in education, but feminists always get caught up on the math.  They consider being male an advantage, so black men don't get consideration.  That people call intersectionality ""oppression olympics"" is not unfair, because that's how it usually works.  Much like feminism is about equality in theory, but strictly advocacy for women in practice.  

>The left *does* think men have an unfair advantage in most cases 


It really doesn't.  Besides the educational bias I've already brought up (and have absolutely experienced with my own children), the court bias for women  is six times stronger than the court bias between white and black.  Women entering the workforce in major metro areas out earn men. 

>it's mostly about hating feminism 

That's a valid position.  Feminism gets a lot of things wrong because of it's core assumptions.

>Feminist subs talk about men's issues

They really don't.  A running joke around here is how many innocent questions have led to bans in feminist subs.  You get to post here, though you might get down voted.  MRAs are frequently banned from feminist subs (sometimes preemptively).  It's hard to have a discussion when contrary opinions aren't allowed.

In practice, no.  This is the ugly part of the horseshoe theory, both ends are in alignment.  The left and the right agree on many issues, to the detriment of men.

>Hypocrisy? There’s zero hypocrisy in that quote. It’s a statement of fact that the “my body, my choice” movement is to protect women from being told what to do with their bodies when those choices only affect the women. Something like vaccine mandates are due to the affect that not having a vaccine has in everyone else. They are very different things.

So you are ok with being told what to do with your body. That means the ""My body my choice"" thing with abortion is bullshit. As for saving lies, dropping abortion should save how many babies' lives? Something like 6-800k babies are aborted a year? So you don't care about saving lives, either. It seems you merely want to kill the unborn and don't really care about bodily autonomy.

>And yes, it IS true that laws against abortion make no difference between an abortion due to sexual assault versus one due to “convenience” as you and your fellow “Christians” are claiming with zero evidence. Those laws merely acknowledge the age of the pregnancy and nothing else.

I'm not Christian. Again, you try to shift the conversation to whether or not people believe in God. Another sad argument. Furthermore, nearly every pro life person I have talked with has agreed we could make exceptions for rape or incest, definitely make exceptions for pregnancies that pose a life risk to the mother.

Right, so it's not ""sexual assault"", is it?

>And before you say ""she shouldn't be having sex"" or ""should've used protection"", sure, those are ways to prevent pregnancy but things happen. 

Yet when it comes to whether or not a man gets a woman pregnant, he is told to keep it in his pants. This is the argument here. A man having sex apparently consents to fatherhood. A woman having sex does not consent to motherhood. Why is it different? Why do people tell men to keep it in their pants or they are responsible for any children, but don't tell women the same?

hbjorw7,t1_hbi9yrs,2021-09-04 08:03:15,MensRights,"That’s a valid argument for a rape victim (real rape, not I changed my mind after the event).  But most women have abortions after consensual sex.  Is it that different to forcing a man to take on 18 years of financial burden?  A woman can always put a child up for adoption with no legal ramifications on her too.

The issue is not really about men vs women, or “the religious” vs the irreligious.  It’s at what point does someone become a person with the most basic of rights.  A young child is virtually as dependent upon its mother as a foetus is.  But we’d never dream of allowing women to had infants or toddlers over to some killing centre to be euthanised because they can’t cope or feel the kid deprived them of sleep or gets in the way of them enjoying their lives.  Does this apply to the unborn?  And if so, does it always apply?  Does it suddenly kick in at 6 months?  Or does it “slide in”, with steadily greater restrictions for each week after say 3 months until only the most serious of considerations can justify it?

These are legitimate questions for society as a whole, and don’t just belong to women much less just the feminist movement.  For one thing, whilst a woman may decide to have an abortion, others actually perform it.  So already it concerns more than just her.

Apparently this is the mainstream feminist position.  But you can’t say this is inequality, not even justifiable inequality!  There is no area in life where women have advantages over men in any way shape or form according to Spillar!

Girl goes to a nightclub to get laid (and many do).  Doesn’t take precautions.  Hooks up with some guy who went for the same reason and also doesn’t take precautions.  

If she gets pregnant, she can do what she wants, regardless of his wishes.  He can want her to have an abortion, but if she refuses he’s still obligated to pay her child support for 18 years.

No, neither the left nor the right agree with it. It was put into place by a very small group of radical feminists. 

>A good law is universally applicable.

This is a completely meaningless platitude. Many laws are very specific. 

>And either ignores or actively opposes male bodily autonomy when it comes to circumcision.

This conversation isn't about circumcision. Stop trying to weazel your way out of supporting taking bodily autonomy away from women. Both things can are bad. Both things require different conversations. Stick to the topic at hand, please, and address the fact that you don't care for the mother's bodily autonomy. 

>The regressive left is very vocal about things that can't be said. 

As in? I also hope you know that there are limitations to the First Amendment... and not that you actually read what I wrote, but as I said before, I hope you understand what the paradox of tolerance is. 

>who are already advantaged in education and corporate work environments

While this may be true in some places for grade school, many men choose not to go to higher education these days. 

Source for the advantages in workforce? I've already listed many things the workforce is in favor of men. And the only women that the workforce is really good for are women that aren't planning on having children, which isn't a whole lot. Hell, most workplaces will shaft you as a woman when you have a child. Maternity leave is also a joke because it's so short, and yes paternity leave should exist, and liberals are the ones fighting for this, while the much of the conservative right is vehemently against it... because of their belief in traditional gender roles. 

>My last job had not one, but three, company funded groups for women, and zero for men. 

Great anecdote, but this is not representative of the workforce as a whole. 

>those roles have out-competed every other cultural option.

There is zero reason to believe that traditional gender roles are the main contributing factor to a country's economic success. Besides, just because people believed in traditional gender roles doesn't mean that they actually lived it. Plenty of people's family trees are broken when they get their DNA tested. There are also a multitude of factors including unregulated capitalism (good for countries and rich people, not so much for the working class or the poor) and our political system that allows for lobying and regulatory capture.

Just because there was a small sliver of time during the 1950s and 60s where you could buy a house and 2 cars with a bushel of blueberries and a gallon of milk doesn't mean that ""man work, woman take care of house"" is responsible for that. 

>>They consider being male an advantage

No they do not. They do not say that ""men always have the advantage"". This is literally the *opposite* of what intersectionality teaches. Black women may have a certain advantage over black men in certain situations, and it may be reverse in others. It depends on the context and the reasons for that context. For example, black women are ranked about the lowest in sexual value in the dating world, while black men among the highest. Asian men are also among the lowest desired in the dating world, yet asian women are among the highest. Black men are sexualized and desired while asian men are feminized and rejected. 

>Women entering the workforce in major metro areas out earn men. 

Again, you can't make universal platitudes like that. Women that are career focused, and not interested in starting a family make more money than men do in some instances. Men are still more likely to get a raise if asked, get promoted, and hired for certain positions. 

>Feminism gets a lot of things wrong because of it's core assumptions.

Don't leave me hanging. What do you think those are? 

>They really don't.

Yes they do. 

> A running joke around here is how many innocent questions have led to bans in feminist subs.

That's because most of these ""just asking questions"" are loaded questions and/or asked in bad faith. The questions I've seen that are genuine and not loaded do get answered, and the discussion is always in favor of rights for men. Again, I'm guessing you don't frequent feminist subs often. 

>MRAs are frequently banned from feminist subs (sometimes preemptively)

Which is a problem with reddit as a whole, but the main, public facing feminist subs are not guilty of this (at least that I'm aware of, since I post in both MRA subs and feminist subs). You may be talking about some niche feminist subs that want a safe space, which is a little childish, but let's not pretend that this is a huge issue. 

>Reddit admins have explicitly stated that they won't act against misandric subs. 

No, that's not at all what they said. Ther only reason some redpill and incel subs were banned was because of pressure from the news media. Incels were going around killing people and reddit didn't want that association. /r/spez probably didn't even give a shit, like he doesn't for many things, until the media and his advertisers got involved. There's no reason to believe that there is a male or female bias on this website. There are many subs from both sides saying hateful things to the other. 

>The legal system has a different set of assumptions towards women. The different standards are frequently defended by feminists.

I am telling you that discussion of sexism in the courts is a frequent topic in feminist circles. I don't know what else to say. This is just absolutely true, and the only explanation I have that you don't believe it is because you don't have civil, good faith discussions with many feminists.

>Right, so it's not ""sexual assault"", is it?

Not in every case but, it's also not ""being a whore"", is it?

>Yet when it comes to whether or not a man gets a woman pregnant, he is told to keep it in his pants. This is the argument here. A man having sex apparently consents to fatherhood. A woman having sex does not consent to motherhood. Why is it different? Why do people tell men to keep it in their pants or they are responsible for any children, but don't tell women the same? 

You make some good points for argument here. So let's go one at at time:

*He is told to keep it in his pants: Personal responsibility. If you, as a man, do not want to deal with a child, you should either avoid sex or wear protection. Not only will either prevent pregnancy but they also protect you from acquiring any STI's should the other person have them.

*A man having sex apparently consents to fatherhood: A man wrecklessly having sex without protection and further, choosing to orgasm inside the woman is inviting pregnancy. It's easy enough to avoid the issue of fatherhood by abstaining or wearing protection. To disavow both options completely, and not even bother ""pulling out"" is acceptance of the consequences which may include child support. You were a willing party in what created the child so, you are responsible. Now, should the woman not want to carry the baby to term because she has reasons, what gives the man the right to FORCE her to carry that baby? This should be your question.

*Why is it different? Why do people tell men to keep it in their pants or they are responsible for any children, but don't tell women the same?: I am going to pretend this is a serious query. The woman has no choice. She either has the baby and is 100% responsible since it in fact came out of her, or she aborts it (where legal) and faces the consequences of that decision which includes depression and even suicide. The worst thing that can happen to the man is paying child support. He's not forced to raise the child, not forced to go to parent teacher night, not forced to deal with sleepless nights, dirty diapers, wet beds, nightmares, bullies, temper tantrums, maintaining a safe, clean home with decent food, not forced to cook or clean up after the child, do their laundry, find reliable and trustworthy care until the child is of school age. Shall I keep going? The WORST POSSIBLE outcome for a man in this is paying a few hundred dollars per month in monetary support. What a horrible, horrible tragedy.


>Who is forcing her? Studies show no one is forcing her to have sex, so no one is forcing her to get pregnant. This is where the argument falls apart. Show me where women are being forced to get pregnant, and I'll grab my pitchfork.

Forcing them to have a baby by making abortions illegal. Tell me you are not truly this dense. What studies are you referring to regarding that topic? But to that subject, who is forcing men to have unprotected sex with women and orgasm inside of them? The argument doesn't ""fall apart"" with your contrived bullshit, in fact, it is very much alive because saying ""no one forced her to have sex"" applies equally to men and it doesn't resolve the EFFECT of having sex, pregnancy, which is what we are talking about so stop trying to move the goalposts.

Stop demanding women do what you want them to do with regard to their own health and lives. Any woman having an abortion has ZERO impact on you or society. Proper sex education, access to contraceptives, and legitimate means to get an abortion when it is need should be a part of any civilized society as it all benefits that society. Demanding women have babies when they did not want to become pregnant is the issue and it should not be because it is no one's business but the woman's.

You have to go to national geographic to find a society that hasn't organized around male inheritance and fairly rigid roles for men and women.  I've already stated that I'm not interested in defending it, but it has worked for nearly every culture.  

>They do not say that ""men always have the advantage"". 

They do, you did.  The word always here is a pointless diversion.  Intersectional feminists don't give heat, fuel, or air to men's issues, because they believe men to be generally advantaged.  

>Women that are career focused, and not interested in starting a family make more money than men do in some instances.

Care to guess why?  

>Men are still more likely to get a raise if asked, get promoted, and hired for certain positions. 

Men work more hours, in less pleasant positions, with longer commutes, and are more likely to change jobs to get a higher paying job.  All of those factors get ignored by feminists.  The reality is that men are frequently judged by their earning potential, so they focus on that to the detriment of their personal lives.  

>Don't leave me hanging. What do you think those are? 

There is no patriarchy, a system of control to oppress women for the benefit of men.  There is, and always had been an oligarchy, but that's not the same.

You are a liar. You got called our for your attacks, that voluntarily made, because your argument sucked.

>You speak as if women are evil because they want the same freedom over their healthcare choices as men.

When did I say they were evil? Men don't have these same choices, though. This is an extra choice women get to make above and beyond what men have. Pro-choice love making the argument that if women can't get an abortion, then women have zero control over their bodies, and that's flat out lying.

>That's not an okay thought process and it is one exhibited by those that identify as incels.

It's your thought process that you projected on to me. I never said women were evil nor do I want to control their bodies. Again, this is why you brought the incel argument. To drag the argument away from why women get abortions to me having to defend my character against baseless accusations.  Seriously. What does this have to do with why women getting abortions?  You were wrong, so you call people incels and make wild claims not based in reality.  Like, if I have sex today, will that make you wrong? Lol.  If I don't, are you right?

>I never once addressed your IQ in any way.

No, you just shamed whether or not I can get my dick wet.

>Last I checked, being an incel is not an indicator of IQ, just one of emotional instability and inability to function correctly socially.

And yet, that has nothing to do with whether or not your claim of most abortions are done by women sexually assaulted. So even if true, what does it matter if the person you are talking to is an incel?

>I've experienced plenty of feminists pulling such a stunt but it's usually with the term ""mansplaining"". However, I have also experienced plenty of conservatives do the same with the terms ""liberal"", ""libtard"", ""snowflake"", etc. In fact, it's a common practice for someone who has no argument or support for their argument to hurl insults instead of either providing support for their argument

Yeah. Which is what you did, lol. You make the incel claim to shut people up. You are every bit of a piece of crap as the conservatives who use libtard and snowflake.

>Mandates by any level of government are imposed when such a remedy is proven safe and effective for the public.

So you are ok with the government telling you what to do with your body. A mandate is the government telling you what to do. Just admit you are actually ok with being told what to do with your body as long as you agree with the reason. 

>Your constant argument that these two, abortion and vaccination, are anywhere close to the same or that vaccination falls into the ""my body my choice"" movement is telling of your lack of understanding of all the topics here: abortion, pregnancy, vaccines.

Yes, they are the same when it comes the government telling you what you can do with you body. You may not like it, but it's the truth.

I don't care if you are a grandfather or if you are an incel. I only care about the argument presented. It matters not to me if you are Christian or atheist. You made the accusations and now you try to justify those accusations. Then you try to blame me for calling you out on your baseless accusations. If you don't want to be considered in a bad light for calling people names, assuming their beliefs in God, and lying about things, then don't do those things.

This entire thing came about because you lied about why women get abortions. 

>Actually, none of that is present in any of posts. I am not a feminist either. But the very things you have accused me of seem to be things you practice.

Actually yes, calling people an incel, claiming hypocritical ideas, that was you.  You just got upset when you got called on it.

Men usually work more hours, in less pleasant positions, with longer commutes, and are more likely to change jobs to get a higher paying job. So of course men are more likely to get a raise if asked, get promoted, and hired for certain positions.

How much do they actually fund? How many shelters are there? 

>Attempt to pull funding for these shelters.

That's laughable. Women don't even get a choice with what to do with their own bodies. 

>Believe us, we've tried

I don't believe you've had good faith conversations. Besides, if you actually cared, you'd be on /r/menslib, not /r/FeminismUncensored.

>We were told time and time again that men had little problems with society and any problems they did have, wasn't due to their gender.

Men certainly have less problems than women do, overall, but if you account for race and sexual orientation, among many other things, there are many factors that go into who's ""more priviledged"" in certain contexts. 

>It didn't matter how many sources we threw at them

Which studies? 

>Have you've been the r/AskFeminists

I've never been there. Isn't that where all the bad faith actors go to ""just ask questions"" about feminism? Besides, I just did a search on that sub, and the first few posts that came up were critisizing the Duluth Model. And every feminist I know critisizes it. 

>And the simple fact that this model hasn't been repealed says a lot.

Do you have a better plan to replace it with? 

>what specific advantages do men have over women?

Depends on the community you grow up in. In more religious areas, men have a competitive advantage over their career prospects. Women's jobs are to be walking baby factories that also do house chores. 

Healthcare. Men can get viagra through insurance. Women need to pay for their own contraceptives if they have insurance (in most cases). Women also suffer more in the hospital system because their pain or suffering is often shrugged off as ""hysteria"", as was more common decades ago. Things are changing, but slowly. 

Safety and security. It's more dangerous for a woman to be walking alone than it is a man. Women will avoid parts of the city at certain times. At least the smart ones will. Men have a massive advantage in upper body strength 

Stalking. There are very little laws (save for the violence against women act) that protect women from stalkers, and men make up the hefty majority of all stalkers. 

In the business world. Again, things are changing slowly, but there are many businesses that still have a culture of innapporpriate behavior towards women. We still hear about it with companies you probably give your money to. These occurences are far too common. This can lead to women having a lower wage in many companies. 

It's not always ""what's legal or not"". Culture plays a huge role, too. Just because we freed the slaves doesn't mean that racism is gone.

I offered this study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539603/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539603/)

Being against abortion would hinder a right to bodily freedom, it is not another's choice to make, no matter how much they want to control that right. A right trumps a want/desire and a fetus is not a child. I already said that. If the man thinks otherwise, then he does not respect bodily freedom. 

""Children"" are not dependent on the woman's internal organs to live and when birth happens (in whichever way it does happen), the child has full human rights. The way the man feels regarding an abortion is only relevant if he suffered an injustice that involved his own bodily freedom (such as being raped or his sperm stolen, as examples). Any egualitarian would say the same.

 There will always be people that can't be pleased, but as long as bodily freedom and rights are kept intact, we can minimise the amount of people suffering.

I never said that misogyny isn't more problematic than misandry. I'm saying that misandry is prominent than most people think. If you think a hatred of men doesn't exist, than I don't know what to tell you.

And no, toxic masculinity doesn't exist. You know why? Because i've seen so many things be considered ""toxic masculinity"". Violence, dominance, rape, sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, ect.

The only thing that might be considered ""toxic masculinity"" is not showing your emotions or vulnerable, since the archetypal man is meant to be stoic.

The term ""masculinity"" itself is an extremely vague term that will probably differ from person to person. It's pure gender essentialism and I can't believe you, a male, is falling for it.

From what I understand, it's society's view of what a ""man"" is and how all men should follow that masculine ideal. Any man that doesn't follow it is not considered a ""real man"".

The problem that I have with the term is that it's very open-ended. 

What behaviors are considered toxic masculinity? To answer that, we must lay the ground work of what ""masculinity"" is. But the definition of ""masculinity"" highly differs between person to person. As a result, you can consider anything to be considered toxic masculinity:",,,2,0,reddit2

hdavi4h,t1_hdat5vw,2021-09-18 06:04:45,MensRights,">it's very open-ended. 

Why is that inherently a bad thing? It's a working field, and not like we completely understand all the intracacies of masculinity enough to put a strict definition on what ""good"" or ""bad"" behaviors are. 

Generally, when people say ""masculinity"", they refer to either ""traditional"" masculinity or ""what we (generally, progressives) think masculinity should be"". Traditional masculinity meaning, of course, the masculine archetype/hero archetype. It's more of the primitive, animalistic side of man. 

As a side note, there's a reason why, in all of our ancient stories of the hero's journey, the hero always has fatal flaws. It's not just for creative storytelling. It's a reflection of our observation of that lived ideology. ""The rage of Herecules"" is one that immediately comes to mind. The oldest known human story, The Epic Of Gilgamesh also touches up on this toxic masculinity (and even has a bit of self-reflection about the destruction of the ancient forests - the endless logging of our old growth forests has been going on for thousands, and thousands and thousands and thousands of years and I think the Old Cedar Forest of Lebanon is all that's left of it - and that's currently being logged as we speak). 

The masculinity that adacemics and scholars vouch for try to account for these flaws in traditional masculinity. It's a case of ""if we change our perception of masculinity (and feminity, but masculinity in general holds much more politial power around the globe), then we can create a society where there is much less bullshit.""

I know many people (both online and personally) that subscribe to the idea that we need *more* toxic masculinity (toxic masculinity exists as a superposition in these people's heads - it both doesn't exist, but convienenly does when they want it to) because ""men are becoming weak"", and their response to that is to overcompensate and be toxic assholes all the time.

The ""gender pay gap"" is concocted this way. You group all men (say, in a country) together and find the average yearly earnings.  You then do the same with women. Then you find that PER YEAR men make more money than women.

What this odd way of calculation, instead of the real calculation of comparing men's vs. women's wages FOR THE SAME JOB, WITH THE SAME CREDENTIALS, PER HOUR - which would show ZERO difference (it is actually illegal, by the law, to pay differently for the same job per hour based on gender) - so this PER YEAR TOTAL INCOME comparison is designed to HIDE (not show) the truth that men make more money per year because of two things:

1 . Men work far more hours per year. Something like 6 weeks worth of working days. So, of course, they make more money because they work that much more and that much harder.

2. Men often choose jobs that are dangerous, dirty, physically strenuous and very stressful simply because the pay is higher under such conditions. Women not only work a lot less than men but they choose comfortable ""air conditioned"" jobs in offices, even though they pay less.

So the difference of yearly total earnings is down to WOMEN'S OWN CHOICES. But should you do the proper comparison: same job, same qualifications, per hour, you will find ZERO gender-based difference. And that's EXACTLY why feminist propagandists choose the bizarre ""yearly total earnings"" comparison because that hides that facts that men work a lot more than women and they have much harder jobs that are consequently better paid.

So Rule 1 of feminist reporting is: lie. If reality contradicts your intended conclusion, lie and make a completely different and misleading claim that hides the real reality behind it.

Could you please not spread such lies intentionally?

I would add that it is of course par for the course, if you are a feminist, to BLAME MEN FOR WOMEN'S BAD DECISONS.

So women make a decision of having it easy - shorter hours, low stress or effort. Then it backfires, naturally, in the form of lower per year earnings. THEN YOU BLAME MEN FOR IT.

Feminism, really, is this kind of shit. This society should really get away from it, shun it, ban it, whatever, just take it out of circulation, by all legal means.

If you buy the feminist lie that women are these helpless little innocent and shy things who don't dare to open their mouth loudly and demand things, then you may have never seen typical modern feminist women in any situation, including work situations. They are, on average and with exceptions, the most aggressively demanding people. They generally don't as much as ""ask"" for things as DEMAND them. A very common mentality is that ""women deserve"" more than men because ""women have inherent value"" unlike men.

That of course is just their lunacy and delusion. Bullshit, a woman's life is not worth one red cent more than a man's. The reason why they simply CLAIM, without any basis, this kind of idiocy because they are convinced that getting pregnant and giving birth is some kind of superhuman achievement. Well, news for them. No, sheep, goats, cows, whatever, mammals in general including humans, give birth all the time with no hoopla whatsoever. Mother nature took care of it, it is the commonest everyday thing. And, by the way. there is no pregnancy and birth without a man's sperm. Yes, half the DNA of the baby comes from the man, the father. Moreover, the real problem we have is exactly that of too many babies dropped on the planet out of wombs. There is an overpopulation problem on this planet, in case women or feminists missed it. No, you are not doing any favor to me, or to anybody, by dropping yet another unwanted baby on this planet. I couldn't care less. So no, objectively women don't have any ""extra value"", they just give that to themselves, out of pure narcissism, as if it was something real. They really should wake up from their narcissism and smell reality.

Anyway, shyness of women as the reason for the - non-existing - ""pay gap"" is the last thing I would ever buy. The real reason is that men (a) work a lot more than women per year and (b) men do, on average, much harder jobs than women. ""Shyness"" has nothing to do with anything.

Having said that, you may have a different opinion. This is only mine 2 cents, just a disagreement that ""female shyness"" is any reason of anything at all. That's BS to me, but I accept if you see it differently. Especially if you are a man, I would be the last person in the world to say one bad word about you or belittle your opinion.

No, men die younger than women primarily because

1. They are 95% of the homeless (75% of the registered homeless plus 20% of ""rough sleepers"" who are essentially all men). When you are homeless for a long time, you die.
2. No social support for men. There are 2000+ women-only homeless shelters - for that 5%. And exactly zero men-only shelters for that 95%. You do the math.
3. Men commit 75-80% of suicides, for purely societal reasons. Those could change if society changed but that is out of question at this point.
4. Boys are pretty much denied a decent education. While schools constantly privilege and promote girls, they do everything to put down, traumatize, humiliate harm and hurt boys. The teaching methods, curricula, everything is designed for girls and totally ignores boys' needs. So boys drop out and struggle in far bigger numbers than girls. Without education there is no future, no hope. So they commit suicide over time.
5. 60% of college students are women, way overrepresented, 40% are men, way underrepresented. Yet there is an affirmative action system for women - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO HELP THE MAJORITY AT THE COST OF THE MINORITY. As we all know, that's what affirmative action systems were invented for. With this kind of discrimination, men are increasingly excluded from higher education. No degree, no future, no hope. So they kill themselves.
6. Men die 6 years younger than women, yet the vast majority of health care systems, support, spending and research is directed at women - who already live longer. You do the math, how many boys and men this alone kills.

Let's not even go to men having no reproductive rights and no parental rights.

In short: no, men cannot be blamed for their mass deaths. Feminism and feminist public policies and societal conditions kill men in huge numbers.

Blaming men for their deaths, instead of blaming the real reason is the most cynical lie ever, but leave that to feminists.

""Recklessness"" has nothing to do with anything. Just a propaganda lie to deflect responsibility from the real cause of mass death.",,,2,0,reddit3

People are more than comfortable when it comes to attributing shallowness to men as a whole, but attributing negative qualities to women causes them discomfort. I genuinely doubt that a study showing that men have dating preferences that contribute to the loneliness of both men and women would be controversial. And if they are to accept the result of this particular study and several others that came to similar conclusions, they’ll have to accept that there are plenty of women who are perfectly capable of supporting themselves but are still turning down potentially good partners because of their unwillingness to relax their standards, which contradicts the popular narrative that men are the ones with high standards and that men and men alone are responsible for their own loneliness. It also must cause a great deal of cognitive dissonance in those who live by tenets such as “female empowerment” and “release from gender roles”. It’s just more comfortable to assume that men are the ones who are unwilling to engage in relationships with women who earn more than they because their have a big ego and subscribe to traditional gender roles.

Unless you are talking about the natural fact that slightly more boys are naturally born than girls. That has a good reason. Boys are more vulnerable, less resistant, weaker and more susceptible to infections than girls. Well known, men are weaker and more vulnerable health-wise than women (that's why always more men die in a given pandemic, including Covid. Women have more immunity and resistance, that's just how it is.)

I think this is where the majority of complaints about cleaning from partners come from.  Certainly there a some people who are just unbearable slobs and complaints about them are legitimate.  But for the vast majority, it's about differing standards.

And I also wonder about whether women are more likely to complain about it, while men are more likely to just accept it.  In my 20+ year marriage, for example, laundry is generally my wife's job.  She does a good job at it.

But, when I was growing up, my mother washed our bath towels after every use.  That's what I'm used to, and that's what I'd prefer.  My wife is more of a ""hang it up to dry and wash it once a week"" kind of person.  That's a perfectly reasonable standard.

So I approach that as having 2 choices:  I can either get my bath towel washed weekly, or I can wash it every day myself.  I would **never** try to convince her that she's doing her job ""wrong"" and she needs to do it to my standards.  But the same isn't true in reverse.

The reason why in Asian societies there is a preference for boys is simple. In older times there not being any social system to support old people, parents conceive children as a form of ""old age insurance"". The idea being that the children will take care of the parents when they are old. This has two consequences:

1. Parents there traditionally had far more children than in the West, and that's how the huge, billion-plus populations of China and India came about. The Chinese authorities introduced the one-child policy to counter that.
2. Parents prefer male children because they will make more money than females. In India, when a woman marries she joins the husband's family and leaves hers. So no help form there, it is the opposite: a girl is a net loss, they have to pay dowry. A boy, on the other hand, will remain in the parents' family and will bring in earnings to support them. So from the ""old-age insurance"" perspective, boys are the winning choice.

**Philip John Clapp** (born March 11, 1971),\[2\]\[3\] known professionally as Johnny Knoxville, is an American actor, stunt performer, filmmaker, and comedian.

**Brandon Cole ""Bam"" Margera**\[2\] (/mɑːrˈdʒɛərə/ mar-JAIR-ə; born September 28, 1979) is an American skateboarder, stunt performer, television personality, and filmmaker.

**Ryan Matthew Dunn** (June 11, 1977 – June 20, 2011)\[1\] was an American stunt performer, television personality, actor, comedian, and one of the stars of the **reality stunt show Jackass**.

And so on. These are all professional actors and stuntmen! The whole thing was made up by the film crew! As you can see, Wikipedia calls it a ""reality stunt show"". 

The whole thing is total fake! And you believe that this is real. Well, someone has to be really stupid for that. You should have at least looked it up on Wikipedia.

That Jackass movie is clearly a ""feminist movie"". Powerful feminists pushed the studio that made it to come up with a men-bashing movie. The purpose is not to entertain, to educate or to reveal the truth about anything, the purpose is to spread the notion that men are stupid, reckless and cause their own death. Thereby relieving the real causes of men's mass death, the feminists. And you come up with that crap as if a single fake and stunt movie, with a dozen or less stunt actors proved anything about 165 million men in the US alone. That just shows that you buy in wholesale in that propaganda because you like to believe it. It relieves you and your ilk from the responsibility for all those deaths.

BTW, the reason why more male babies are born (51% male 49% female)  has absolutely nothing to do with idiocies like "" recklessness"". It is because male babies and boys are far more vulnerable to illnesses, diseases and infections. Girls and women have a lot more immunity than boys and men. This fact is the main reason why Covid, but every other disease kill far more men than women. This was the case all through history. As more male babies and boys die than girls, the number evens out by the age of 18 (when it is 50-50), just when young people reach their top fertility. Mother nature took care of this, this was the case all through history and has nothing to do with and idiotic feminist movie whose title is ""Jackass"".  The real jackass is the person who watches such crap and believes it. 

Moreover, even without Wikipedia you should have noticed that  those cases were made up with movie stunt tricks. Obviously, it is all movie stunt and special effects because how likely is that the camera is just right there, just at the right time, in perfect view when somebody unknown does something stupid and kills himself. They are all stunt performers. And you base ""social fact finding"" on a made up stunt show. I am sorry but it is so stupid.",,,1,0,reddit3

Yes, stuntmen have surgeries. Because they have accidents, just like acrobats or other circus performers. But 9 (nine) injuries of professional stuntmen somehow proves anything for you? That's less than 10! In a movie where they performed dozens of stunts.

The risk of injury for professional stuntmen is a calculated risk. These stuntmen knew that injuries could happen but the money they got for it made it worth. They probably got hundreds of thousands of dollars for their roles, otherwise they wouldn't have done it

Anyhow, none of this matters. The point is that professional stuntmen do what they do, for the money. Not out of stupidity. And ""Jackass"" was all made up, fake, by the movie crew. And grand total they got 9 indjuries. But none of it from ""stupidity"", they were working as professionals. Absolutely nothing can be generalized to real people and situations from such a made-up thing. Unless you are a feminist who is not interested in the truth but has a pre-conceived (no matter how dumb) notion and wants to desperately prove it, even when the facts have nothing to do with it.

But whatever it is, you are completely missing the main point: a single movie in which everything is fake and made up and stunts are used says ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the deaths of 165 million men in the US alone. Look at the top 10 causes of deaths for men in the US:

2) Cancer  
3) Unintentional injuries  
4) Chronic lower respiratory diseases  
5) Stroke  
6) Diabetes  
7) Alzheimer’s disease  
8) Suicide  
9) Chronic liver disease  
10) Kidney disease

""Recklessness"" or ""being an idiot"" is NOT even a marginally relevant cause of death for men.

Here ""unintentional injuries"" means ""accidents"" which include traffic accidents, work injuries, falls, unintentional injuries by firearms and zillions of other types of accidents. ""Recklessness"" or ""being an idiot"" is not listed.

>  
>[Air pollution linked to 3.2 million new diabetes cases in one year](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/health/air-pollution-diabetes-study/index.html)

It's interesting that on the same page is a link to an article about air pollution causing 3.2 million new cases of diabetes a year. I wonder if the study took account of this?

>Researchers looked at data from 7,065 Canadians who were tracked over 12 years. What they found was that women who consistently worked 45 hours or more a week had a 63&#37; greater risk of diabetes compared with those who worked between 35 and 40 hours a week.

If you follow the link to the study, what they propose is...

>How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?   
>  
>► Promoting the regular workweek of 35–40 hours might be an effective strategy for preventing diabetes among women.

I normally would not have an issue with this as long as women get paid for the work they do, but with this *wage gap* horseshit being pushed as a major agenda item, I'm afraid I'll have to oppose this in principle. If women need to earn as much as men in the aggregate for their to be 'equality' feminist style, then women are just going to have to put in the hours.",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,160,0,reddit4

Working more hours hasn’t been shown to **increase the risk of diabetes** any more than living in a crime-ridden neighborhood *increases the risk* you’ll commit a crime.




Working more hours is *correlated with* an increase in diabetes diagnoses. Just like living in a high crime area *is correlated with* crime, and living in a predominantly gay area *is correlated with people who engage in homosexual sex.*


But working long hours doesn’t increase your RISK. Just as living in a high crime hood doesn’t make you more likely to commit a crime (if you’re law abiding, you won’t) nor does living in a gay area make you more likely to engage in homosexual sex.




Correlation doesn’t imply causation.

##The Facts about the Gender Wage Gap in Canada

The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between women and men in the workplace.

It is a widely recognized indicator of women’s economic equality, and it exists to some extent in every country in the world.

A 2015 UN Human Rights report raised concerns about “the persisting inequalities between women and men” in Canada, including the “high level of the pay gap” and its disproportionate effect on low-income women, racialized women, and Indigenous women.1

Out of 34 countries in the OECD, Canada had the 7th highest gender wage gap in 2014.2 To learn more about economic inequality in Canada, see",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,5,0,reddit4

hkgu7p5,t3_qspala,2021-11-13 15:50:28,MensRights,"US Military service should be compensated greatly but not just with money. Military is typically underfunded despite people thinking it's not. So military veterans should somehow have special influence on the military budget and oversight, perhaps by a special veterans committee or a separate branch of congress for veterans only.

Furthermore, a veteran who is a citizen should be considered a super citizen with special rights, including a vote that is worth 10 times the vote of a normal citizen.

Every veteran should be given a land grant and fully paid new home, or equivalent funds.

Every veteran should never owe Federal taxes ever.

Any military person who lost their life in the line of duty would require an extra $100,000,000 be awarded to military readiness, or some equivalent metric. Military personnel should not die from lack of readiness.

Any military person sent to combat should have a special 500 times vote in one future election of their choice.

A president who sends military into combat must resign within 360 days and a new election must occur to choose a replacement. He/she may run for reelection unless term limited. 

A president who ends a war is allowed to run for a second or even third term, provided that president never started a war. A majority vote by all state legislatures must affirm that the president ended the war honorably and in America's best interest before an extended presidential term is allowed.

I loath the idea of forced conscription. I also loath the idea of slackers and politicians not supporting supreme military readiness in all respects for the purpose of deterrence and dominating quickly and completely if war occurs.

If conscription is needed then it should be required of both males and females. But it must be prioritized to conscript all sons and daughters of politicians and their friends and acquaintances who must necessarily serve in combat roles as a message to the nation that this war is just and neccesary. These few are meant to prevent politicians from sending someone else's kids to war while protecting their own. So their capabilities and eligibility are not as important as ensuring that they are placed on the front lines in harms way as much as other service members.

Next, conscript the famous and the wealthy and all their children and friends. Only then open up conscription to the general public.

None of these politically conscripted military veterans should receive any of the enhanced rights or benefits I outlined, even if they volunteered because they serve only to ensure politicians use our military wisely and judiciously. However, if a politically eligible draftee volunteers for military service two years before any military conflict and the nation is at peace, then he or she is entitled to the normal rights and benefits of a typical volunteer.

These are just good for thought. Any major changes should be carefully considered.",Lollypop_Starship,t2_9ugqfidk,-1,0,reddit1

Here in Denmark you get paid decently for it assuming you do it when 18ish (comparing to what other ~18 year olds earn at least). 

Assuming you don't have an apartment at the time, your only expenses are food. Which is covered by a tax free monthly payment that you're free to do whatever with and there's a cantina that makes decent food for a decent price, So In effect, you've no significant expenses, you don't really have time to spend money on bullshit and half your salary is tax free, and the other half isn't really high enough to be taxed much, so you can very easily save up a good chunk of money. For an 18 year old.

Despite not making an effort to save up, I left my 4 months service with roughly 6400 USD, saved up.

citizens should be voting for this stuff... 

It is 2021 and even here in Switzerland there, I think, is still one Kanton where people have to go to the local Square and be in the physical to vote... so anything is possible.

Not really. For example in britian pressed men wouldn't have had the vote. Voting rights had more to do with the the middle class's ability to cause political instability (the days of may). 

The post WW1 expansion had less to do with the draft (although the fact many drafted men would have lost the vote may have been a factor) and more to do with the war messing up britian's class system resulting in an attempt to build a new social contract. 18 year old male draftees and women under 30 who had served in the millitary would not have got a vote.",geniice,t2_hpyzg,3,0,reddit1

My father did the first weeks to complete the basic training and then refused service. If you refuse before the training they used to pull you into an interrogation and ask really stupendously unprofound questions and a big ton of kafka traps would be used to take any reply as your agreement to stay in service. If you did the weeks of basig training however and then refused on moral grounds or other such reasons then they'd pretty much just let you go. Also, if you don't wear your uniform, you're not a soldier, so you can technically walk out in civilian clothing and there's nothing anybody could do about it, except perhaps put you on trial, which honestly sucks.

I'm considering becoming an activist for this issue, since a draft is not only unnecessary in Germany's political internal and foreign climates (EU plus separate piles of agreements with neighbouring countries to mostly the express benefit of those countries and also non-aggression clauses), but also inherently immoral. An isntitution being able to treat human lives like property is a no.

In general look up British Parliament's Representation of the People Acts. In the 1918 one provisions for ww1 veterans allowed them to vote earlier, otherwise it the voting rights were tied to property.

The link between draft and voting rights is easiest to find in the US. There was a recent thing about getting women registered for the draft. Until a certain time men could pay a fine or send a substitute in stead of being drafted. 

Otherwise look up general draft laws, and the fact that only men need to register for the draft in almost all countries. In Lithuania I had to register when I was 16 (got a summons, went in and registered).

However there is an argument to be made that in most countries only men must register for the draft and your civil rights will be massively curtailed (possibly a criminal offence) if you don't. Therefore registering for the draft is a pre-requisite for men but not women.

In the case of South Korea, they have mandatory conscription for men, who previously had the option to use relevant military experience to gaining credit towards a degree and as work experience on their CV.

k81ggog,t3_17orep0,2023-11-06 06:49:28,MensRights,"I’m still reading this, so this isn’t a proper comment, more an “observation”.

Many (most?) women believe that it’s a “man’s world”.  And feel that we have charmed lives compared to them.  It can be going to a mechanic where the mechanic thinks women know SFA about cars (it’s all too common actually); or it can be “taken seriously at work” or them fearing being attacked.  It’s beyond them that many of the things they experience also happens to men.  They assume it’s women unique cross to bear.

And they certainly don’t consider that guys have issues that women don’t have.  For example a female friend lives in a set of units.  She has a young girl, and one of the neighbours has another girl a couple of years younger.  This younger girl would keep running out at night to play with friend’s child, and the friend would have to grab hold of her and escort her home (she was 4 at the time).  

The female friend complained that her ex (father of her daughter) was just leaving dealing with the neighbour’s child to her; that he wouldn’t go out to grab the girl and drag/carry her home, and would just leave it to her, and how lazy he was and he’d leave it all to her.  I waited for her to finish.  And then quietly mentioned to her that perhaps he was concerned that if he grabbed a screaming little girl who was clearly not his kid he’d be seen as a child molester and challenged, attacked or reported!  She just stood there, and then a flash of realisation came over her face: “You’re right” she said.  “It never occurred to me.  I never thought of it.  But you’re right.”

She is far from a man hater, and I’m aware she’s pushed back on her feminist friend with some of her comments.  She also keeps her ex fully involved in the girls life. He can visit, spend as much time as he likes with her unless she’s got something on.

I will repeat again. Mothers, who are supposed to support their sons, support feminism. A movement which is responsible for the disenfranchisement of their own sons, and do NOTHING to protest it, and in fact support it all the way. There you go. I stated this in my first reply to you. 

I also NEVER said anything about lesbians. You are point blank lying here. As for the ""turning people off."" That is your attempt to hijack this conversation, and derail it so that it fits into your (feminist) agenda. Feminists like you do not want people exposing your misandrist ideology for what it is, so naturally you will use ad hominem attacks like ""you hate women"" to shut me up. Sorry, not going to happen. 

You have already proved yourself to be a mocking person who lacks empathy for men, and call them ""whiny"" when they rightly complain about discrimination against them. You are clearly not here in good faith so you have no place here. Bye.",ApatheticHumor,t2_3w0tuoog,1,0,reddit2

I don't agree with your interpretation of this quote.   It says nothing about **how** men become individuals.  But that women aren't seen as individuals because they can't enter into contracts.

Of course people are going to think and write about things like women not being allowed to own property or enter into contracts.

In other words, someone having privilege means ""to think someone is deserving of a certain advantageous treatment"".

One of the many perverse things Progressivism did is to shift the meaning of privilege to mean ""the position of being in a class holding more authority than other classes"".

That's literally upside down logic, since unlike ""classical privilege"", this form of ""Progressive privilege"" views the privileged class as deserving of chastisement and that its role is giving away its unearned advantages, and it can simply point at someone, see that that person isn't part of the favored ""oppressed"" demographic and conclude that that person has a privilege it needs to use in the service of others.

Their capacity to and the availability of the option to exploit you is something you shouldn't be blind to, and if the two of you get along, it's essential for her to be aware of too so she doesn't accidentally use it, but the simple capacity doesn't mean she also has the willingness to do it.

Usually, vicious women have tells which are visible way in advance, if you pay attention. Notice red flags and see if they're justified.

I'm also concerned that an attitude of ""if a better man comes along, you're history"". Sometimes ""better"" means ""very good for a long time"", so if you don't put yourself in the role of entertainer and keep her with material commodities, then she won't see someone with more of those traits as better. Make it clear to her that you like her because of the qualities she embodies, no matter how good her looks are. And if you have a similar standard for yourself, you'll be good. Cheating is usually expected by people who either would do it themselves or people scared by people who do. It may be not very surprising for people who've given up their striving spirit, but never expect anyone to cheat.

If you're worried about cohabitation being used as a trap, then don't cohabitate. It will be harder to get intimacy with the separation, but no one says you can't live close to each other. Maybe, if you get along well enough, buy neighboring properties. People are entrepreneurial, you could say you value her financial stability, which wouldn't be a lie, but will serve a double role.

I would really appreciate if you approached political philosophy from a more thoughtful and less fearful place. If you want to be against state actions, you need stronger communities outside of those which use the state as an intermediary, and by alienating women, you're not going to do that. Women can be solipsistic and use the state as a daddy state, or they can be community oriented and act in ways which are also beneficial for the men there, and probably other things too. The question is, what do you encourage them to be?

Feminists often rely on portraying anti-Feminist attitudes as threatening (taking their vote/abortion away, etc). This works for the same reason why ""Why does the government want to take away my guns"" makes people distrust the government.

Not those who already hold a clear majority within these institutions. The fact that more women go to college than men is not a problem, the fact that they continue to be offered financial incentives to artificially increase their attendance is.

As for women being able to land a higher paying job your source gives the opinion of one person, who has not done any actual studies on that. And, quite to the contrary of his opinion women are often more like to be hired than men. [source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/14/study-finds-surprisingly-that-women-are-favored-for-jobs-in-stem/) [source](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/how-women-find-jobs-gender-report). As to the gender wage gap as a broader issue it’s prevalence has been largely overstated, at least in Western nations. As we know men generally take higher risk jobs, longer hours and are more likely to ask for raises or find new jobs. In terms of college men generally do select higher paying fields than women such as STEM, despite the extreme incentives for women to join these programs. This does not justify favouring women across college as a whole, as the pay disparities leaving college are primarily due to degree choice, not gender discrimination.

As for family courts you are most certainly incorrect in your assertion that this subreddit is in favour of upholding those predisposed ideas. A few minutes of scrolling would certainly dispel that notion. We absolutely do support the dismantling of the traditional-gender roles in childcare. Yet the feminist movement broadly does not work towards this goal. They may pay lip service to it if asked, but feminist supported policies almost always support favouring mothers over fathers within the family court. Or even in court in general for that matter.

The bottom line is feminism claims to fight for equality, but often the fight is instead for constant increase to women’s rights beyond the bounds of equality as we see in the justice system, education system and many other structures such as the military.

j2bsnj0,t1_j2bfjic,2022-12-31 02:11:25,MensRights,"Okay firstly the centuries long head start “white men” have been able to enjoy. I don’t know about you, but personally I haven’t been alive for centuries. In fact, nobody has. Women and men of the same race are born into families with the exact same financial means. So there is no head start for white men over white women. If you wanted to argue that there is a head start for white people over other races then you may be correct, but that’s another issue entirely.

You seem to be trying to make this a race argument. It isn’t. If you want to offer incentives to underrepresented minorities such as black people then offer them to black people. Not to women. Black people are an underrepresented group, women are an over represented group in post secondary education. I have no problem with offering scholarships to those groups. 

What exactly do you mean we can’t settle the debate on the pay gap because women gravitate towards lesser paying fields? Why not? If men are taking more dangerous jobs and working longer hours they are going to make more money. That’s completely fair. 97% of workplace fatalities are men. Do those men who work dangerous jobs not deserve compensation for putting their lives on the line?

You say that these fields dominated by women’s re underpaid. What is that assertion based on exactly? Just your personal opinion? People know when entering these fields what the pay is. If they choose to enter the field knowing that, then that is their choice and responsibility. 

Gender norms certainly do push women’s dm men towards different professions, yes. But if you want to combat this then combat these gender stereotypes, don’t simply throw money at women going into these fields to artificially raise the number. There is no barrier preventing women from entering STEM and thus no reason scholarships should be given to them. You can’t fight culture and individual choices with money.

No the trend of pushing different genders towards different fields is not systematic discrimination. Those fields are open to either gender to join if they choose. There is no discrimination there and it is certainly not systematic. We don’t underpay those fields because they’re mostly women, we pay them less because that’s supply and demand. Some fields simply provide higher perceived value than others.

If feminism was only fighting against gender norms and promoting a cultural shift then I may support it. But they are instead pushing discrimination within the education system by offering these financial incentives to women but not men, when both parties have equal opportunity to enter these fields. That’s the opposite of fighting for equality.

[Here’s](https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/family-courts-biased-men-dangerous-fallacy-abuse)a feminist article that claims the assertion of family courts favouring women is a fallacy because all accusations and statements made by women should be believed over the male counter-arguments. For a broader picture you can examine movements like the BelieveWomen movement. These movements target not just criminal court but civil and family courts as well, to the detriment of fathers. The biggest issue though is that feminist movements who claim to be for equality prioritize almost any women’s issue over this one, despite it being one of the biggest cases of inequality in the world today.

The men of today are not the same men of a hundred years ago. At birth, each man is born into a family of the same means as their sister. Unlike race, gender is not passed down through multiple generations, but rather decided by random chance at birth. (Excluding transgender people for simplicity) Young women today have equal means to enter these powerful positions as young men. The only favouritism is in the older generation and this is the problem. Young men who have done nothing are being targeted by the feminist movement to make up for unequal judgements made years ago by older men against older women. That’s not pushing for equality that’s going for revenge against a non-responsible party. You say that the goal is not to harm men but that is the consequence. There is not an unlimited amount of resources in the world. In a world of scarcity to give to one group is to take from another, that is an indisputable fact. By giving advantages to women you are creating a system of inequality in favour of women just as the men of past generations did to favour men. 

I agree with you, we should be happy that 50% of the population is able to enjoy equal treatment that they didn’t have in the past. But they have it now, so they should not be further pushing policies to increase their advantage. Even you admit that to feminists, men’s rights are of secondary concern. If one group’s rights are seen as more important than another’s, that’s not a fight for equality. Hence why feminism is not fighting for equality at all.

Feel free to look at some of the posts made by others on this subject if you actually are interested. They are more informed than me and could provide a more comprehensive explanation with other examples beyond the two we’ve discussed.",decentish36,t2_f2l6s417,5,0,reddit3

j2cnjzh,t1_j2chte1,2022-12-31 06:42:53,MensRights,"Why exactly is it impossible for women to become independently wealthy without a degree? Is it because they’re less capable than men? Sounds like you might be a little sexist there buddy. If women are receiving scholarships to go into stem fields then why aren’t men receiving them to go into fields that they’re underrepresented in? Oh that’s right… sexism. Of course gendered scholarships aren’t only for STEM as you so claim but I know you love basing your arguments on false pretences.

Alright let’s look at why. You say gender conditioning and I agree for the most part. The problem is you think the solution is to bribe women into male dominated fields. That’s just ridiculous. You’re just artificially inflating the numbers without actually making any significant difference. It’s treating the symptoms rather than the cause. And as we’ve mentioned, feminists are only interested in fighting these norms through scholarships if they’re for women, not for men in fields dominated by women.

You say that women deserve to be paid more. Based on what factors exactly? Because they work hard? News flash, a lot of people work hard in their jobs. But there isn’t an unlimited supply of money going around that we can give to these people who are working in professions that don’t generate revenue or involve significant personal risk. You don’t want to bring men’s wages down, but you want to bring women’s wages up. Where exactly are you intending to get the money from? It doesn’t grow on trees you know. We can’t just raise wages because you feel like they should be higher. Your assertion that we pay those fields less because they’re dominated by women is borderline delusional. 

As for my sources on the court system I see you’ve pulled the “your sources don’t count” argument. Always good to use when you don’t have any basis for your arguments that have just been proven wrong. I also notice you’ve completely ignored my main point there but what else would I expect at this point. 

What issues in the criminal justice system do women face exactly? The issue of being less likely to be convicted and receiving on average much shorter sentences than men? For the exact same crimes? Yeah seems like that’s a big issue for them. I don’t blast the movement because it’s not doing exactly what I want, I blast it because it is against equality. It fights for expanded women’s rights and consistently works to undermine men’s rights. I know you don’t understand this because you don’t understand the concepts of scarcity or relative change but I’m afraid I can’t teach you basic logical principles right now.  

I don’t believe that one group has to suffer for the other to prosper. I believe in equality. And extreme measures that discriminate on the basis of gender are not a movement for equality at all. You believe we can fix the injustices of the past by punishing the men of the present. You’ve misconstrued my point about scholarships to be only about stem scholarships, which it wasn’t. You’ve ignored or dismissed the evidence I presented to you on court injustices. I hope you’re enjoying this male privilege because I haven’t experienced the slightest bit of it at any point in my life. And based on statistics around deaths, education, conscription and a myriad of other issues most other men haven’t either. 

I don’t believe things because they’re easy to believe. If I did I would’ve remained a part of the feminist movement which is widely popular and has plenty of momentum. I form my beliefs based on evidence and i left the feminist movement because I saw that my beliefs weren’t backed by hard evidence, but rather societal pressure to support the cause. You are the one taking the easy road here and refusing to consider alternative viewpoints because of your own preconceived notions.

Now, as lovely as it is to trade essays with you I’m not going to waste my time arguing with a troll who’s debating in bad faith.

Matthew Moore

More men than women will receive salary rises at the BBC after managers carried out a review of presenter pay to address allegations of discrimination from female staff members.

Nearly 200 on-air staff will be entitled to automatic pay boosts as the corporation looks to impose a clear structure for talent salaries for the first time. The broadcaster was forced to take action after dozens of female staff complained that they were earning less than male colleagues.

However, the “fair and transparent” framework announced yesterday will benefit a larger number of men than women. Analysis by the auditors PwC identified 98 male presenters and 90 female presenters who are entitled to a rise because their salaries are below the new pay ranges for their roles.

The prospect of male presenters being awarded larger salaries threatens to inflame tensions within the corporation at a time when many women staff feel that their complaints about pay inequality are not being taken seriously.

Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC’s director-general, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, will be questioned today on the proposals by MPs. The development comes after Carrie Gracie resigned this month as China editor, accusing the BBC of illegal gender discrimination and reviving the pay dispute.

The PwC review of 824 presenters’ salaries found that the BBC’s excessive respect for established male stars, combined with a lack of consistency and transparency, was to blame for on-air pay “anomalies”. There was no evidence of unlawful gender bias, however: the 6.8 per cent gender pay gap among presenters was smaller than its overall figure of 9.3 per cent.

The worst disparities occurred in lower-profile presenting roles. Among the top tier of hosts and correspondents, the gender pay gap was 0.4 per cent. Some male stars, including John Humphrys, have agreed to a pay cut.

The BBC Women campaign, which represents more than 170 employees, demanded a full equal pay audit. “There has been no transparency on which individuals were included or why,” it said. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said the review’s rejection of gender bias in pay “flies in the face of reality our members say they are experiencing”.

Jennifer Millins, a partner at Mishcon de Reya who is advising several BBC women, accused the corporation of giving “pretty extraordinary” justifications for paying some men more. “This doesn’t deal with individual complaints of discrimination,” she said, adding that the risk of litigation “is pretty high”.

The PwC report found that “too much weight had been placed on the prominence and profile of certain individuals”, mostly male, resulting in instances of very high pay. But pay disparities between those in similar jobs appeared to be driven by “material and justifiable factors unrelated to gender”, such as different levels of experience, skill and market influences. In response, the BBC proposed a new grading structure for presenter pay, with narrower bands and clear criteria. The corporation is proposing a pay cap of £320,000 in its news department.

Although the new framework will benefit more men, the BBC said that a greater proportion of female presenters were receiving increases. About 34 per cent of women in the relevant career bands are entitled to rises, compared with 25 per cent of men. On average the women will get larger increases.

Separately, the BBC said yesterday that 230 pay grievances had been lodged since July, with salaries adjusted in 90 cases. Most beneficiaries were thought to be women. Lord Hall told Channel 4 News last night: “I don’t believe there has been illegality in the BBC to the point where someone said you’re a woman therefore you’re going to be paid less.” He said his reaction on hearing Humphrys make light of Gracie’s pay complaint was “Why, why, why?”",gg2late,t2_fuhb1,64,0,reddit4

dtit219,t1_dtipv54,2018-01-31 15:38:26,MensRights,"There's 3 sections in this article that hold any significance (assuming the comment posted is the full article); 

""There was no evidence of unlawful gender bias, however: the 6.8 per cent gender pay gap among presenters was smaller than its overall figure of 9.3 per cent."" 

""Although the new framework will benefit more men, the BBC said that a greater proportion of female presenters were receiving increases. About 34 per cent of women in the relevant career bands are entitled to rises, compared with 25 per cent of men. On average the women will get larger increases."" 

""Separately, the BBC said yesterday that 230 pay grievances had been lodged since July, with salaries adjusted in 90 cases. Most beneficiaries were thought to be women.""

So excluding the highest paid men still results in a pay gap, and a higher proportion of women are being regarded as underpaid than men, and by a larger amount. 

There are very few conclusions that can be reached from this as we do not have the information, but to say anything in this particular article ""goes against the ""gender pay gap"" myth"" is statistically illiterate. The comment higher up stating the 23% gap in favour of women for senior correspondents does (although that brings back the issue of dealing with the top stars which skews figures) but that's not in this article so I'm not sure why this one is being championed. As if anything it is closer to saying the opposite of the point you're trying to make.

dtjfyvq,t1_dtimi3f,2018-01-31 21:34:44,MensRights,"BBC revenue is fixed, they cannot raise funds themselves and are paid for by the TV License, a flat-rate tax on owning a device that can ""Receive broadcast signals"" (Though a lower rate is available if you are deaf/blind, or only have a black and white color device.)

Until recently it was only for televisions, but they updated the law to cover any device (phones/computers) after they realized that people were accessing the BBC content without paying the license.

Arguments for the license are that it allows the BBC to avoid corporate influence (Dubious, but they are certainly at least slightly more resistant to it.), and to engage in experimental programming without worry for returns and ""Committee"" type thinking resulting in ENDLESS TRASH television like movie franchises often turn into.
More weird flops (Sometimes cult classics), more groundbreaking awesome shit, less consistency. (Bad for investors, but no investors, so there we go.)

Opponents of the license either dislike the notion of taxing this kind of thing, or point to the BBCs political slant as evidence of bias. While the ""Economic bias"" stuff doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, the BBCs bias on social issues is extremely pronounced. 

The BBC was previously forced by its rules to include Nick Griffin from the far-right British National Party on question time when he got popular enough, but notably, they constantly push feminist bullshit and never egalitarian criticism of it, despite polls showing this is entirely unjustified and flies in the face of their mandate that ""Nation will speak unto nation"" and such.

Theoretically, MRAs could sue BBC institutions for this or something similar. At the very least, the constant feminist bias is unjustified according to their charter. Around 15% of content surrounding gender issues would be justified in being feminist, around 15% traditionalist, with the rest egalitarianism that is specifically not feminist according to polls. And yet the largest group there at 70% is entirely ignored in favor of feminists. I'd say traditionalists do get a fair amount of representation, but have to put up with a vastly disproportionate level of feminist opposition on panel shows, news, debates and such, amounting to a token opposition for feminists to draw legitimacy from.

But as to your point, no BBC employee raises more revenue for the BBC than any other. Viewership levels *might* make an impact on wages, if only because the employee can then play hardball and threaten to move to the private sector, but that's not necessarily true in all cases.

But, these kids fucking love me. They’re generally more excited to talk to me than their teachers. Maybe because I talk to them like they’re fellow humans and don’t condescend. Many of them speak another language in addition to English and I like to learn words and phrases to say to them, mainly to show them that their culture is important, and nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of. My mother is Cuban and didn’t teach me Spanish growing up, which I massively regret. So as I’m learning Spanish now, I practice with some kids and they love it. Also learned a bit of French, Swahili, and Vietnamese. Many of them, boys and girls alike, are eager to help me at work and ask lots of questions. I also ask them lots of questions about what they’re working on in school, favorite subjects, etc.

The teachers here also make me feel welcome and appreciated, more so than I would have thought before taking this job. I frequently get cards and gifts. I have over $100 worth of gift cards in my wallet right now from various teachers.

Back to the teacher thing...historically there were few jobs available for women and especially women of color. For black women with college degree, teaching was generally pushed as an available and noble profession. Also as a male and especially as a white male, you had far more lucrative job prospects than teaching.  If there are more women than men teachers then it likely has a lot more to do with discriminations against women than men. You also generally have two types of principals and administrators. Those who came up as teachers and those who have some kind of advanced degree.

I personally think that's because more women have an intrinsic nurturing attitude than men, so women ARE better suited to teaching, which is a job that tests your patience and your compassion.

And what is stranger is that the majority of teachers are indeed women - so that raises the question: why is there such a gender disparity in men's favour in those promoted posts? A lot of it does come down to women choosing family over career but we could question how we could support families better on the whole. 

And you forgot the three other main jobs in schools: cleaners, office staff and dining staff - yes, not all dirty work but mostly badly paid and not well-respected and mostly filled by women. 

I agree that there is a lack of men in teaching/school-based jobs and this is at the detriment to male students, particularly those that already lack positive authority figures/male role models.

Teaching is reproductive and caring labour - less favoured by capitalism because it doesn't directly make money. We need to do more to add value to these roles - it shouldn't just be about supporting women getting into STEM type roles, it should be about getting more men into caring roles. It's a huge shift in attitude needed as to what society and individuals value.

men aren't taught to be criminals, the reality is simply that when natural differences between the sexes aren't(or can't be) swept under the rug, statistical differences arise. 90% of prison inmates being male or the vast majority of workplace accident victims being men isn't due to discrimination against men, just like how 95% of engineers being male, or men making more money isn't due to discrimination against women. these discrepancies don't arise because of social norms or discrimination, but because of biological differences which lead to things like men being more interested in the sciences, men being naturally stronger and working in hard labor, men prioritizing their careers and working more on average then women, men being less agreeable and negotiating their salaries more, men being naturally more aggressive and ending up in prison more. none of these things exist because they are taught, meta-analyses have shown that these differences between the sexes are the largest in northern european countries, which have been trying to push gender equality as much as possible for the past few decades. just because 1 sex is privileged in some regard doesn't mean that that advantage is created by discrimination or society. equal opportunity and equal outcome are very different things.",bahoicamataru,t2_4xt196u5,1,0,reddit1

I'm not defending OP's statement.  I was just curious about yours, so I wanted to see where my district stood.  It's overwhelmingly female, even in spaces where we're often told males dominate (MS and HS education, for example -- the general trope is that there are more male teachers once you get past K-5).

> Are there more female teachers as well? That would denote hiring up the ladder and explain why there are less male principals.

The search tools don't let me filter by sex.  I manually counted (based on names) the sex of the Ps and APs because there were only a small number of them.  I'm not going to count through the thousand+ teachers looking for data on sex at grade level (you'll forgive me for not wanting to dox myself by providing a link to my district's staffing data).  Anecdotally, based on my personal experience and bearing in mind that my kids are still in K-5, there are very, very few male teachers at their schools.  Even in places that are stereotypically male, like PE teacher (one kid has a male teacher, one kid has a female teacher; both kids are boys, so this isn't like sex-based segregation in high school).

My personal experience is that many women prefer me when i'm being a dick. They find it attractive. Also, being homeless is also attractive for some reason. I'll never know why. Agressive homeless dudes are almost always paired up with a woman. They don't have to be tough, mind you. They just need to be aggressive and angry. I see it all the time.

The point i'm getting at is that women like Men. Being masculine *always* includes some level of aggression. Being a Man is another thing entirely and a separate issue. It involves proper conduct. But being masculine is about having that anger and aggression on tap. Women like that. Most do, anyway. There are some who value niceness, but they aren't the majority.

So women are at least accountable for finding aggressive men more attractive. But no one will admit that. It's seen as pathetic to do so if you're a guy, and super reprehensible if you're a woman.

At the least, aggressive men report more sexual partners.

The courts do too. It's becoming almost normal for a drug using/never having a job/lazy women to get full custody of her children over a man who has worked his whole life and has his shit together.

They tend to say how things *should* be, because of that tendency to improve one's environment and support positive change. It doesn't always lend itself to a realistic view of how things currently are.

That being said, your study is a sample size of about 300 or so, taken entirely from college students. The one i linked to is a sample size much larger (5000+ participants), not exclusively college students, and implies the complete opposite point.

**[27 Victimisation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/27)**

(1) A person (A) victimises another person (B) **if A subjects B to a detriment** because—

...   (a) **B does a protected act, or**

... (b) **A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.**

(2) **Each of the following is a protected act**—

...(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

...(b) giving evidence or information in connection with proceedings under this Act;

...(c) **doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection with this Act;**

...(d) **making an allegation (whether or not express) that A or another person has contravened this Act.**

That being said, in both the UK and the US there is still a ton of gender bias in favor of one sex or the other, a gigantic amount. I doubt that there's a university that exists that doesn't offer some level of sponsorship for women going into STEM fields that are unavailable to men.

For example, the concept POSITIVE ACTION: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action

>In Europe, positive action, roughly synonymous with affirmative action, is the promotion of people based on belonging to non majority identity groups in the workplace, educational institutions and positions in society, purportedly without prejudicing the criteria of selection by merit. In the United Kingdom in Harriet Harman's Equality Act 2010 ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

Now, I'm not 100% sure whether this applies specifically to this situation. But people here went all in on complete blanket statements about discrimination (""it's the same for boys and girls""), and now suddenly you are completely certain that this particular section provides the only answer.

Not only was Bruce, now dubbed 'Brenda', still showing interest is masculine toys and behaviors despite heavy encouragement towards feminine toys/behavior, he was having regular visits to Money for updates on his development. During these visits to Money, Bruce was molested and raped, all throughout his childhood.

like this goes for both genders. women complain about everybodies clothes, weight, hight etc but most girls don't even judge people for anything they can't change. like if you don't use deodorant, wear the same clothes (underwear shirt pants etc) everyday, and men do that too. I mean, I wouldn't go near anyone who doesn't use deodorant.

this is right, women can just hug and kiss each other while if you touch another person you are gay/predator, but you can just ignore that. its not a big deal unless they are raping or harrasing you.

what? you are acting like againstmensrights people now. I didn't say that. let me put it like this:

you said

>am forever grateful to see very few women being kind to me, not looking at me and having ""men bad"" through their minds. Even if it's once per week.

which means a few women actually treat you like a human being and most women are sexist. you see the issue here? 

most women aren't sexist. thats just you. 

>And of course it happens to both genders. I never said it only happens to men, I'm just saying that in my experience, in my area, it happens way more often to men.

funny how some dickheads called me a feminist and you are here putting a feminist argument here. my response is (and what I'm trying to say is)

you are making it worse than it acutally is. for example:

>When I wake up and go on social media, every single day, I see feminists shaming men for being alive.

these people get a lot of hate. these people are clowns. most of those people are just trying to get attention and are trolls. yeah, some stupid ass places like reddit don't care about sexism if men are affected, but you can ignore them. by blocking them or searching ""sarcasm"" on google.

>I do ignore and report them. Yesterday was just a bad day and I needed to vent. Big deal?

then thats not a problem. there are a lot of women haters on the internet. guess what women do? (well most women) they don't get butthurt over that. they ignore those retards and continue their day. thats what you should do.

>And I won't ignore something that women can get away with but not men. It's not justice.

and you just ruined it. you just said you ignored them and now you say you won't ignore them. but lets still take a look.

if they aren't getting any hate and people are actually supporting it, you should post it on this sub. and by that I mean don't just rant about it. provide a link and talk about how they are sexist who they are etc. and if we don't get any response from the admins, we can't do much about it. like what are we supposed to do? finger ourselves to death? those sexist feminists are everywhere and all we can do is just watch and call them out on their bs just to get ignored by everyone. 

now the type of people you are talking about (seeing them irl), is bullshit.  
cuz I had a lot of sexist teachers, friends and neighbors (for both sexes) and we usually made fun of them. no one took them seriously.  for the female dating strategy, against mens rights and twox chromosomes subs, we are basically fucked. cuz now we know reddit admins are misandrists and we can't do anything about it cuz tf we supposed to do those people hired a fucking pedo and we had to riot in order to make them fire her. this site sucks.

>And don't judge an entire sub by a single person's post lmao

fgos7ox,t3_ezbsi3,2020-02-06 10:14:00,MensRights,"That is actually bizarre. The Norwegian law, which I think was the first of its kind, mandates 40% for both genders, though of course qualified women are the main beneficiaries. 

I actually think a law like this can be useful, provided you make the quota manageable - say 25% or even varied a bit by industry. There are gains to diversity, and we can manage the trade-offs. Besides, we should keep in mind that we are talking about boards of directors, not executives - it is a part-time role to provide oversight and strategic guidance, where companies have a bit more freedom to experiment compared to when selecting a CEO. 

However, you could also argue that companies are under pressure anyway: an all-male board would look terrible for a company who wants to preserve and nurture its image. Transparency about board composition and an activist media may be enough. 

Of course, we also have companies, though mostly not listed and subject to such a requirement, with few or no males on the board - mostly, I presume, in industries where women also dominate the work force. They should of course be subject to the same requirement. 

I think the problem is not only discrimination against men (which I have a hard time opposing with any fervour, as I would with any policy that would benefit the most privileged in society), but that the main beneficiaries are also some of the most privileged in our society AND that this might lead to an undermining of corporate governance. Qualified women in Norway now often combine board membership in as much as a dozen companies. This not only means that their remuneration is higher, but that they have less time and perhaps conflicts of interest.

I’d argue the few all-female boards would also benefit from diversity (by their own logic), and if the law is vague enough ‘non-binary’ should be enough to check the box, and still let them keep out teh ev1l mens. 

I actually looked up the exact text if the law a while back to make sure this wasn’t being blown out of context, but no - it literally says ‘must have a woman’.

I did not say 'free', but do women have to meet the same standards? There is a huge push to get more women *everywhere* on college campuses, and men are losing employment and jobs and careers because of it. So I don't think it's totally out of line to question whether women are getting equal treatment here as well, and it does not have to be uniform across all school systems or not exist at all.

However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible.Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved.

* https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360

* **National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track**

* **Significance**

* The underrepresentation of women in academic science is typically attributed, both in scientific literature and in the media, to sexist hiring. Here we report five hiring experiments in which faculty evaluated hypothetical female and male applicants, using systematically varied profiles disguising identical scholarship, for assistant professorships in biology, engineering, economics, and psychology. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all four fields preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles (single, married, divorced), with the exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Comparing different lifestyles revealed that women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers and that men preferred mothers who took parental leaves to mothers who did not. Our findings, supported by real-world academic hiring data, suggest advantages for women launching academic science careers.

* **Abstract**

* National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.",tenchineuro,t2_3nrxdp,4,0,reddit4

Evidence: http://i.imgur.com/eUIagWv.png

4) As stated by the O.P she's exploiting gender issues (feminism) such as the debate on women in STEM fields. She keeps referring to the RPG training camp as RPG STEM training camp. (Clearly milking the buzzword STEM)

More exploitation of gender issues:

5) The company that is running the RPG training camp, has an article on this Kickstarter. (Only trying to raise $829??)

6) If she only wanted to raise $829, why is she offering rewards for donating $10k ??

7) Portraying her sons as mean oppressors and throwing them under the bus to make a quick buck (Appeal to misandry)

8) Evidence of her questionable business ethics (Cybersquatting) 

Evidence: http://i.imgur.com/jIduN8G.png


9) Relevant articles from her blog, she seems to think mixing gender issues with crowd funding is a good way to make money, which explains her kickstarter, exploiting her children & gender issues.

Conclusion:

She's a scumbag, clearly has no ethics, is a cyber suqatter and a spammer, exploits her children, exploits gender issues & appeals to misandry to make a few bucks.

Articles in the media about this, they obviously just printed the press release she gave them, without doing any investigating.

Before the last couple of years, if you wanted to do something you had to learn it on your own.  No google, no strangers giving you money, no initiatives directed towards whatever demographic you belong to to encourage you to program.  

Instead, it seems like now we're pampering a generation of youngsters, teaching them not to worry - that there'll be somebody around the corner to give you a hand or help you advance your career.  You don't need to do it alone - you are underrepresented and therefore *deserve* special treatment to get a leg up.  

I think what this mother is doing is setting a terrible example for both her boys and the girl.  Apparently her kids were raised to be misogynistic (by her own admission - them saying their sister can't do something because she's a girl) and teaching the girl that instead of picking up a book and learning it on your own - just appeal to others for help.

She played the victim after some people were nasty to her online, and hit a rome run in her donation drive.

""She runs a website called “Feminist Frequency,” and she apparently updates it once a month or so. Less, actually. The last update she made concerning her project dates back to August 1st, and at that point she’d purchased some 300 video games for the project. She says she’s hired a writer and a producer, but is keeping them “out of the limelight to try and shield them from any potential harassment. When I feel it is safe and appropriate to introduce them I will.”

Hmm… Well, I guess transparency is out the window (because of the misogynists, of course).

Since that post, she’s given a couple interviews, but publicly nothing has been said about her project.""

People so eager to rectify this ""horrific sexist inequality"" that is reality by jumping in to white knight any little thing that somehow seems to relate to woman deserve to get scammed by this. I'm not saying that there isn't a gender bias in the programming world, but you aren't going to rectify that inequality by blindly throwing money at every nut-job woman who sets up a webpage to fund ""female entrepreneurship!"" or ""female child programming"". Or for that matter by getting every man who tells a sexually related joke fired from his job.

What I find most disturbing about this project is that if kick-starter doesn't take it down, we'll be hearing the ""success"" story in the media and it'll be spun like she's a hero of gender equality when in reality she's just out to make a buck. ",dirtpirate,t2_5npht,2,0,reddit1

What this is really about is teaching young people (and their parents as a result) that it is quite OK to disregard rules for personal gain. If the email Susan Wilson posted today, supposedly from a KS employee, is to be believed the issue is greater than one person because it means that KS is actively supporting and encouraging young people to break the rules (and consequently later in life, laws) to support their desires.

Whether this is a scam or not; whether this is a campaign to promote awareness of ""women in tech"" or not; whether it is x or y.. it's not really relevant to the core issue that the KS is in violation of the guidelines and the parent is teaching the child (and other young people and their parents as a result) that it is ok to manipulate the system to server your own agenda.

That's what this should really be about, not some witch hunt.

KS clearly states that projects are not to be used for ""fund my life"" (they even use ""pay tuition"" and ""buy camera"" as examples.. transpose laptop for camera in the latter) projects. They clearly state that it is against the rules to spam people. They clearly state that it can not be used a campaign to create awareness for causes, such as women in tech.

This KS has broken these rules and by allowing it to continue, KS is endorsing and encouraging this kind of behaviour and teaching kids that it's ok to break the rules for personal gain. In a world where this is OK, I suggest you keep close tabs on your bank account because by encouraging children to break the rules for personal gain, we're going to see a lot more fraud.

I still hate it though. This whole ""Women aren't as interested in tech jobs because women are told to not be so interested in tech jobs"" is *complete* rubbish! It's actually damaging, because it's hiding what the actual problem is! The reason why kids, *especially* girls, aren't interested in programming is because most of them don't even know what programming *is*. There's absolutely loads of books and media on science for kids, and engineering for kids, but hardly any at all on programming for kids. I have never met a primary-level school teacher who's ever recommended programming - and it's quite simple to, all you have to do is say ""If you like science AND you like engineering AND you're good at (primary-level) maths, try out Gamer Maker Studio"".

I mean, I'm lucky - I actually started programming when I was three! Back in the days when that was actually possible (QBASIC was easy to make text games with). And then I found out about GameMaker on my own when I was... 12, I think?

That way she has proof that her thesis (that female-centric fundraising has an audience) is correct. 

Also, on another note:   
  
""My parents are into technology as users but my Mom has to hire programmers and developers sometimes for her work. She's really glad I like computers and programming because she says as a business person she feels like she's held hostage by developers. She's the one that got me interested in creating my own stuff on my computer instead of just playing with stuff other people create. She tried with my brothers but they weren't interested.  I think they're stupid when I get to be their age, I don't want to be stuck playing games smart people imagine and create. I want to be able to create whatever I can imagine. ""

My assessment that it's sexist comes from the fact that she's telling her daughter that programmers hold her hostage, and that if her daughter (a female) was a programmer she wouldn't be taken hostage (by male developers).",texture,t2_315pm,35,0,reddit1

1. Neither myself nor my editors received a press release or any other materials from Susan Wilson. We spotted the project on Kickstarter. 

2. I am following up and I've asked both Kickstarter and Wilson to answer some of the questions brought up by the community.

3. Nobody has yet pointed out that Kickstarter reviews and approves all projects before they can be listed on the site. So someone must have decided that it was within the rules. My own personal speculation would be that because Mackenzie is planning to actually create a game, it qualifies as a creative project. 

4.  Yes, the cape idea seemed a little stupid, and apparently all the people that didn't fund it agreed.

UPDATE: Official response from Kickstarter just now: 

""Hi Eric,

Thanks for reaching out. Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. The goal of this project is to create a video game, which backers are offered for a $10 pledge. On Kickstarter backers ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it.

Shame on you guys.

Let's answer each of the points made by Henrik. Bring on the downvotes. Here I go: 

>1) She has her own female only crowd funding website so why is she using kickstarter?
Link: http://www.fundher.com/

1. This is entirely speculative and not at all a ""negative"" point. It's fact finding.  

Let's see what we do know. An interview with Kotaku specifies that the entire point and purpose was to have her daughter embark on her own attempt at learning how to fund a project for herself to eventually make her own game.  

When I was 9 I wanted Nintendo games.  My father wouldn't immediately purchase them for me even though he DEFINITELY had the money for it.  He encouraged me to create a business, in this case a lemonade stand, and attempt to earn money to rent or purchase my own games.  He then taught me business principles after. 

Does it make my dad an asshole that he taught me principles using the coinage and dollars of others? No.  It doesn't. 

>2) She has tried scamming kickstarter with a previous ""project"" which is pretty much the stupidest thing I've ever seen. She was asking for $20k . And I still haven't figured out what the ""project"" is about. Something about wearing towels as capes?
Here's a link to it http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/susanwilson/the-cape-project

2.  Kickstarter is a personal choice to commit to a project.  Remember that; a personal choice.  ANY person can create one.  It doesn't inherently make them an asshole even if they do or do not have money.  Go back to my example of the lemonade stand.  Except let's broaden it to use a more adult version.  Let's say an entrepreneur, successful, wishes to secure funding for a new business idea.  Why are they suddenly shady or a jerk for seeking other means besides going to a bank?  One of the more successful Kickstarters, and one that I personally indulged in, was the Reaper Miniatures campaign.  They even specified that they would be able to do what they wanted; they just wanted to secure more funds for it.  

Video games with REAL footage are placed on Kickstarter.  They're not JERKS for that.  They've worked on it and they're often seeking payment for work they've already done.  

She had a personal business venture she wanted to attempt to fund via crowd-sourcing.  IT seems to be that it's SMART to attempt to do that via KickStarter.  In this case, the project failed.  The product was uninteresting to others.  That's not a scam.  That's capitalism and buyer's choice. 

>3) She's breaking the Kickstarter Spamming rule

3. Oh no.  What a massive crime.  Someone is trying to get attention on a kickstarter that their significant other has done.  Call the fucking Jesus cops. 

>3a) Also evidence of breach of the ""Fund my life"" rule being broken:

3a. Kickstarter has kept it alive and Kickstarter is an autonomous agency capable of following their own rules and even changing them at their own leisure.  This is like complaining to Blizzard about balance changes on a druid in the World of Warcraft: You can provide feedback but you are not OWED change.  They own the site. You own the ability to fund or not fund. 

>4) As stated by the O.P she's exploiting gender issues (feminism) such as the debate on women in STEM fields. She keeps referring to the RPG training camp as RPG STEM training camp. (Clearly milking the buzzword STEM)

4. This is such an OVERUSED and DISGUSTING attack against feminism.  Let's first address the last thing you say. Milking a buzzword?  You just milked Reddit with a post FILLED with buzzwords. ""Exploiting.""  ""Scamming.""  Etc.  That's how human's communicate HIGH level issues with each other.  Your resume is likely filled with words or phrases unique to the subject at hand.  That's not milking.  

Finally, how many people ""milked"" equality for races?  How many people are ""milking"" equality for marriage? It's so contradictory it's a bit unsettling.  You may not understand parts of the feminist movement, God knows I'm trying to learn, but that doesn't mean that a person is doing anything inherently wrong by mentioning.  In fact, it's the right thing to do.  

I've worked in software for a few years.  Just now a year in a private office.  I have met very few females (there have been some) in this field.  There's an imbalance, somewhere, that exists.  Why does bringing that up have to be a bad thing?  Should we allow it to be unanswered and subjugated? Rather, the thing to do IS to talk about it.  If you don't understand it; seek to learn rather than assuming a person is just trying to be a loud jerk nugget. 

>5) The company that is running the RPG training camp, has an article on this Kickstarter. (Only trying to raise $829??)

5. I don't see how this is negative.  It's the cost of the camp and she's seeking more to offset the cost of possibly programming a game. At the most you have a problem that she's exceeding costs.  Then DON'T fund the Kickstarter if it's reached over its limit.  Your dollars are your choice.   

>6) If she only wanted to raise $829, why is she offering rewards for donating $10k ??
http://i.imgur.com/05CeXyu.png

6. Now you're just attacking Kickstarter.  Reaper's only wanted 30k. They obtained 3 million dollars.  Many Kickstarters have gone over their pledged amount.  That's a sign that people want to see something done.  I don't think that people even NEED to apply stretch goals or rewards.  I don't know, though.  Someone can verify that if they'd like.  In this case, the pledge is for the girl to go to camp and then to subsequently create a game.  

>7) Portraying her sons as mean oppressors and throwing them under the bus to make a quick buck (Appeal to misandry)

7. Are you serious?  My brother and I (both males) were thrust into a Gifted education course.  My sister, the middle child who was not, worked her ass off and obtained better grades than the both of us at everything she did.  My parents would point this out as a method to motivate us.  She's not throwing her children under a bus.  She's using an example to show empowerment and to give her daughter something to believe in.  

Do you honestly think she's sitting at dinner scoffing at her boys wishing they were females? Have children, dude. Seriously. I haven't any myself.  I do know for a fact that those colleagues of mine that had have completely changed their priorities to shift to a ""I love my children"" stage.  

Teaching your children a valuable lesson or using an anecdote to press your daughter to action isn't throwing them under the bus.  And to imply she's doing it for herself.  Really? How speculative can you get? 

>8) Evidence of her questionable business ethics (Cybersquatting)

ಠ_ಠ  Reddit.  The only place where someone that you disagree with will be condemned, without significant evidence, of cybersquatting and yet people turn around and pirate software left and right.  

If she cybersquatted anyone then the organization she did that to has legal grounds for a lawsuit and she can be brought to trial.  There, she can be TRIED for her SUPPOSED crimes and judged by a preponderance of the evidence or by answering the ""test"" that is required to prove it. 

>9) Relevant articles from her blog, she seems to think mixing gender issues with crowd funding is a good way to make money, which explains her kickstarter, exploiting her children & gender issues.

9. We've addressed these.  You're really reaching for attacks. She's SUPPORTING Kickstarter and other CROWDSOURCED ventures as a method to provide funding for folks who have beliefs and ideas. How the fucking fuck is that a bad thing?  That's EXACTLY what Kickstarter is; I didn't need three hundred minis from Reaper.  I purchased it because I believe they have a SOLID product and want to encourage them to continue creating them.  I can't paint minis for shit.  (I can post my attempts.  Seriously.  They're awful.)  

>Conclusion:
She's a scumbag, clearly has no ethics, is a cyber suqatter and a spammer, exploits her children, exploits gender issues & appeals to misandry to make a few bucks.

How the fuck did you reach that conclusion?  For question 8 you say ""questionable business ethics"" and then immediately conclude ""clearly has no ethics.""  That's MILKING if I've ever seen it.  ""Is a spammer.""  Uhh....??? ""Exploits her children."" Are you kidding?  ""Exploits gender issues and appeals to misandry to make a few bucks.""  The fuck?

Edit: I see a mother who is trying to teach her daughter the importance of funding something for herself and, to a certain extent, seeing her dreams through despite what anyone says.  Her personal income and her personal politics mean very little.  Should she have spammed? Probably not.  But that isn't a death crime.  It's a mistake we'd all make for our loved ones.  Should she bring in high level feminist politics? Likely not, but, when you're passionate about something that means a lot to you it's difficult to not do that at times.

1. Kid wants to create an RPG to show up her big brothers.
2. Kid asks to go to programming camp
3. Parent asks kid how kid is going to pay for said camp.
4. Parent shows a way for the kid to pay for the project through venture capital
5. Parent helps the kid set up the kickstarter

All in all, not a bad thing to do. The kid learns not only how to build a game in RPGmaker but learns a more important lesson in how startups work and, most important, the understanding that with the right idea that kid is able to be an entrepreneur. ",monkeyhousezen,t2_5uvb5,-19,0,reddit1

Although to be fair, the advent of the internet was a boon to intelligence at the same time it crippled the value of orthodox learning; instead of being limited to going to a profession to train under them (whether in person or through training books), one can just Google what they need to know.

Intelligence has become more modular due to the internet. It's like a giant, universal encyclopedia you can pick up and put down at any time, without requiring prerequisite coursework / reading. If you want to learn how to do something, you simply learn how to do something, instead of going through the various hoops to get to the point where you learn how to do something.

As an anecdotal example, back when the internet was young, I was sitting in a Web Design I class when I ran into a conundrum with \<table\> tags. Well, I could have waited for two years, until Web Design III, where the teacher started *officially* covering table formatting in lessons... or I could search online and figure out how to fix my shoddy HTML in a few minutes, by myself.

c91hlsu,t1_c91gva2,2013-03-24 14:54:25,MensRights,"Thirty years ago, my (small and badly funded) public library had children's books on programming. There was *The Bytes Brothers*, where you had to write a BASIC program to solve a mystery. There was a book on machine code with cartoons showing the movement of information in and out of registers. Besides the library, there were plenty of hobbyist magazines you could learn programming from. My parents couldn't even afford a computer and I was reading those books anyway, and figuring the programs out like a puzzle on paper. Boys are interested in machinery.

When boys fall behind in education, we get told it's because females are better suited to the modern world, we get told it's because of a ""guy code"" where studying isn't cool, and that if boys tried to behave more like girls, the problems of the world would be solved. Programming is one area where boys outpace girls, and one of the reasons is that they put a lot of self-study into it - they don't get help from their parents or teachers, they don't get sent off to camp, they're just very self motivated and figure it out by themselves. And how does this situation get treated? Do they tell girls that they should behave more like boys and put more study in? No, the reason for the unequal outcome must be that girls are being oppressed.",,,9,0,reddit1

c91pwl4,t1_c91peti,2013-03-24 23:00:50,MensRights,"Don't like editing my replies unless necessary, so here's a quick reply instead.

At first, I didn't like the idea of calling RPG Maker anything even vaguely resembling STEM. I messed around with an earlier version of it during my teens (what're they up to now, anyway?) and it was, as mentioned, just a drag and drop interface for manipulating sprites and attaching simplified scripts to them to create an illusion of interactivity.

But at the same time, it's not exactly fair to say that it's not STEM related at all. If we assume videogame design is STEM (under T for Technology), then we have to point out that there's more to game design than just coding. There's graphic design, music creation, plot and script management, research...

Call me a borderline sexist, but my shake on the matter is that if you want to get women into STEM fields, start with what they're already, as a generalization, good at - not at the things that, as a generalization, they're not good at.

For example, there's a study from the 1970s that show that most Star Trek fanfiction (90%) during that time was written by girls, often young teenagers. I'd take this to indicate that *females enjoy creating plots and characters in an established setting.*

Well, plot structure and storyboard management are two valuable skills needed for a good videogame design. Why, during the boom to get girls into STEM, was there such a focus on getting them to code and script, instead of teaching them that they could contribute to a team as a writer?

If they wanted to be programmers, more power to them, but maybe the STEM push would have taken off with more vigor if there had been a campaign of ""You like writing? Ayn Rand's writing heavily influenced the setting of Bioshock, a best-selling videogame. Imagine what *you* could help create.""

If feminists really wanted to push women into STEM, they'd have gotten their foot in the door *easily* by making a push towards emphasizing skillsets that most women already had, instead of their pseudo-campaign of ""Men dominate this field. We should take it over, even though most of us aren't interested in it, because girl power.""

That is to say, a campaign of contribution, not conquering, would have gotten females into STEM fluidly, and poised females to be in a position where if they developed interests in typically male-dominated positions, it would have been a horizontal shift to a *similar* position, not a vertical shift to a *foreign* position.

Admittedly, this is generalization taken to an extreme, but I've known several artistically inclined females in my lifetime, and very few programming inclined females. As an example of the prior:

My sister, when she was ten, had a binder filled with several reams of typewritten story, about a young girl who was magically transported to a world where evil flourished, friends were a bittersweet boon since they'd often die just to protect you, and only a young girl who had no heritage in this world could stand a chance of changing it. She also regularly drew cover art for each chapter, depicting a particularly important scene in carefully shaded pencil.

If that had been a videogame, I'd have played it. Hell, it'd have been counted as a female-triumph in the industry, of that I have no doubt. Unfortunately, she was never encouraged to go that route, and instead went on to become yet-another author stuck in the publishing market.

Now, females that could and regularly did coding and scripting, that I grew up with? I can count them all on one finger without extending it. But if my sister had been inclined to write her stories with a videogame design slant to it, maybe she would have also been inclined to start learning how to code, so she could determine the feasibility of some of her flashier ideas.

Just my two cents, of course.",Mitschu,t2_71pul,3,0,reddit1

I know.

So why are so many people cross with the millionaire? If every aspect of life is regarded as an economic decision, what room is left for ethics? Is business not undertaken by humans? Where is the business rule that says merchants are not allowed to act ethically?

> but then [long term] storing old stuff is also unethical, as you are not using it.

Correct, now you get it.  If someone wants to use it, and you're storing it, then either resources are being consumed both to store the item of yours, and at the same time more are being consumed to create more of the item to meet the demand.  If we accept that at lease some of these resources are both A) finite and B) vital to a high standard of living, then we must accept that by storing the item instead of selling it on, we are depriving someone somewhere of a real need.

I'm confused by your last paragraph.  Let me explain this differently; if six young families want to buy a house at auction, the house will sell at a certain price.

If six young families and two speculators want to buy a house at auction, the house might sell at the same price, or if the speculators are wealthy and keen, it might sell higher.  It won't sell lower though -- the presence of speculators has a net effect of increasing prices.

Speculators are buyers.  They want to sell for more than they buy for, and more often than not they do, IMO.  The net effect is that prices are higher if speculators exist in a given market than if they do not.

I also think that this is more about morals vs. ethics. A single individual is going to have his own set of values that will probably go against the rest of the people (speculators in this case), but as long as there is no actual legal framework to counter his wrongful morals, it is legally irrelevant, IMO, if he is acting unethically or not. Sure, we will tab his as an asshole, but he is within his legal rights to be a total douche.

As for the room for ethics part, it is something that we as a society must strive to build. If we have the image that the shrewd, sneaky businessmen are the ones that are to be praised, and that cheating is the only way to move forward, things are not going to change.

We must also consider that these are uber-competitive people, that will do all in their hands to win and to make money. There are some that do, and they give back to the community. But in my experience, winning and money are the No. 1 thing in the list.

As for your last paragraphs, there are no barriers of entry for that housing market. Who is to say that those two that come in are speculators? What if you really like that place? Should you be stopped by the fact that people that have less money than you also want it? The country is not run under an utilitarian philosophy. 

It's probably late to point this out, but. What exactly are we differing in here? I feel like we both have agreements as to speculating=bad, no speculation=good.

She's a business person and she doesn't see why developers cost so much. Developers are not cheap at $15-60/hr. She and a lot of people don't see why they cost that much. They ask for things that have a lot of stuff abstracted in the background.  ""I'd like to be able to take credit card donations on my website.""  Implementing one doesn't look like a big deal because your just adding a small picture, a couple of dialog boxes and a single drop down box.  She doesn't know or care about the 3k lines of code that went on in the background.  If you need that credit card option, it's going to feel like those people are holding you hostage when they start show you prices for such a tiny addition to your page.  She didn't spend her time learning to develop and build inane things for several years for the skills to do it right.

It's the same thing with repairing computers. Why would a tech charge $60/hr when it took him only twenty minutes to figure out the motherboard wouldn't post and replace it. To the laymen, he thinks the guy just spent those minutes taking everything out of the case, removing half the components, and turning it on and off three-four times.  They think they are being extorted because they 'technically' could have done that-it's just removing some screws and unplugging a few things. They don't know about all the background knowledge and sweat and pain that came before the person could diagnose that quickly.

It's the same thing working with film.  People won't hesitate to ask you to commit to a project that is an easy 60-200 hours for free. They want you to use your own expensive materials.  They don't think what you do requires payment.  They think you just put pencils to paper, you love what you do, and won't hesitate to throw 150 penciled boards at them.  You don't have a life or bills to pay.  You tell them each full size board is $15 a piece and they act like your extorting them because 'technically' they could just thumbnail it themselves.  They didn't spend ten years learning that skill.

That thought is complete.

Now the daughter comes in to the picture. Daughter wants to be a game 'developer.' If she learns the job skill herself, RPG camp, the little girl won't be extorted by people later in life for when she wants to make an rpg. That's the thought process of the girl imagined in those paragraphs.

EDIT: Now think about what the little girl says for a minute. She argues that in creating her own stuff, she doesn't have to play with stuff other people create.  Meaning if she creates RPGs in RPG Maker, she won't need to play games like Dragon's Age or Final Fantasy. She doesn't see the reason in paying a price for those AAA games, they're just RPGs which is 'technically' no different from her own RPG she can make. Her brothers disagree.",,,1,0,reddit1

Purchasing real estate at a low cost and selling high is just a means of investment, you're risking a relatively high amount of money and selling it later after it's been developed is a payoff on your investment. If the value decreases, you've lost your initial investment.

Squatting on a domain name is a get-rich-quick scheme. You risk a relatively low amount of money in hopes that someone else somewhere will do the work to make it a valuable name and then have to pay for the rights to use it since you got there first.

c91ykvc,t1_c91x55k,2013-03-25 07:43:20,MensRights,"> So if I buy gold bars that doesn't count as an investment?

I said ""An investment is buying something"" so yeah it does.  Buying gold bars, however, is not a useful purpose.

You aren't buying them to feed anyone or learn new science or do anything to effect a positive influence or difference on the planet.  You're only buying them as a bet or gamble that you can get some profit for doing nothing.

The profit comes only from another speculator who comes after you, or from buyers who wish to use the gold for practical, ""real world"" purposes like fillings or computer circuits or jewellery whatever.

Note that the speculation increases the price for all buyers, so you're essentially placing a bet that effects the outcome.  This is unethical at its core, but if you factor in the idea that you're then an increased cost -- a drag or drain, iow -- on ""real world"" users then it's unethical in two ways.

Note that if you're buying it for *any other* purpose than to allow time to pass and then sell it, then speculation is only a factor in the purchase.  If you want to use the gold to anonymise wealth or to move wealth in a small physical space or to impress a client or whatever, then that's slightly different.

The core ethical question becomes far more apparent when applied to speculation on grains or fuels in large quantities -- note that commodities are traded in volumes far in excess of real-world existing amounts -- and in by so doing, reckless traders can trigger price volatility and food shortages which can kill people in the resulting instability.

In the earlier post, if you're buying the land to do something that you think other people will pay extra for -- like building flats or removing the forest -- then you're providing added value and that's not ""idle speculation"", it's active business.

The key words are ""idle"" and ""busy"".  Speculators make it hard for useful ideas with low-or-no economic return to take place, since they artificially raise a ""floor price"" of a product.

As a final comment, I believe that it's not permitted to speculate in various commodities in WoW, and probably other mmorpgs as well.  This is because of the unfair advantage/detrimental effect it has on other players.

The only reason it's permitted in meatspace is because the [groups of] people who decide what's allowed are the ones doing most of the speculating.

While yes you own it and you might be using it for as an investment to sell later that land is needed for the economic growth of the area and it's your duty as land owner to build something there for that reason.

c91xfcy,t1_c91wfwo,2013-03-25 05:52:52,MensRights,">Eminent domain and adverse possession have nothing to do with speculating on land. There is (almost, depending on where you are) nothing to stop you from going out, finding an empty piece of land you think will be worth more in the future, buying it, then selling it later.

Eminent domain and adverse possession was specifically developed as a policy in the US to discourage exactly that practice. As the west was being colonized by the US, much of the land was actually owned by European land speculators who were either holding on to land based on expected future value, or as a holdout tactic to increase the value of land disproportionate to its isolated economic value. This became especially problematic with the development of railroads. As a consequence, eminent domain and adverse possession were legal doctrines that became extremely important in the US common law of each state, as state judges expanded the rules of each to allow local citizens to take land from the absentee European landlords. The justification given was that the land was not being put to productive usage, and thus the European landlords were actually engaging in an economically inefficient usage of the land. Thus, the land was seen as ""more valuable"" in the hands of local land users that were in physical possession of the land despite a lack of right of title. So, the thing stopping you from just sitting on land unsupervised and untended is that an adverse possessor can swoop in and sit on the land for X number of years (sometimes as little as five, often as many as 20 years). Also, you are exposed to all sorts of potential legal claims and, depending upon location, the land can become subject to eminent domain, which has been expanded as a doctrine more and more over time.

>As for 'the productive use of resources' - how on earth does that apply to an infinite, non - corporal space such as internet domain names?

A particular domain name, which is a unique resource, is not infinite. There is only one Pepsi.com. I don't recall for certain, but I do believe there is a rule that if you have an established company with a trademarked company name, you can get the rights to domain names that reflect the trademark, even if it is owned by a third party. I'll look it up later. Indeed a [quick search indicates that this is so](http://www.chillingeffects.org/domain/faq.cgi#QID246).

So. Faggot doesn't actually mean gay. It means either a bundle of sticks used for kindling or a person who is not good enough to waste a full cord of wood on. Gays and whiteknights keep it meaning gays by insisting that it does. If we allow it to be used in a broader sense, as I have here, it would stop meaning gays, and return to meaning person who is not good enough to waste a full cord of wood on. Gay or not.

One of the first results was the rather reputable knowledge faggots from The Straight Dope. So I used my faggoty little fingers to click on the link and here's what I found;

I may be wrong. The Straight Dope staff claims that there is no reference at all to ""faggot"" referring to homosexuals in the medieval period that I attributed it to. Their findings are unsure. It could have come from a reference to a nagging woman. Which would make sense. It could also be a reference to the underclassmen who were put into service of the upperclassmen at schools. It could also be a misheard yiddish word ""faygeleh"" often used to describe homosexuals and translating to ""little bird"".

So. It seems the more provable uses are much less politically inflammatory and much more broadly usable. My guess is that gay people prefer the ""burning gays on piles of wood"" relationship because it makes for a more effective sympathy plea than ""Oh, they're calling us annoying women"" or ""Our big epithet means little bird"".

The *mother* has the money, the kid doesn't. I've told my kid a number of times that she needs to earn the money for one of her projects rather than simply shell out the money myself. This mother has taken it one step further and actually engaged the kid in raising venture capital. The next time my kid proposes a project with a significant overhead I may do the same thing.

> This is akin to Anita Sarkeesian asking for 6 grand, then manipulating the shit out of the media to milk her fans for as much as they were worth. Rarely do con artists tell you exactly what they want.

I've made it clear that I think the original kickstarter was a good idea in terms of an educational exercise for the kid. What it's become, however, is a travesty. Sarkeesian's stated goals were originally pretty modest as well and supported by her project plan. What it and she became after the original overfunding is a different conversation.

I think that Kickstarter needs to implement a cap on project funding as some multiple of the original value. That would vastly limit people attention whoring projects in order to get them overfunded by playing on some hot button issue but that isn't something I'm seeing discussed anywhere, least of all here.

inrnuwa,t3_x9ux8y,2022-09-09 19:52:42,MensRights,"Hello, Marine veteran here. Ever since women were allowed into the military they have had lower physical fitness requirements. 

As far as different pt tests for different jobs? It would never work out, you expect too much of military infrastructure. The AVASB passing score for the marine corps is 50 ok. Those chuckle heads can barely run two annual fitness tests, let alone 7-20 varieties of tests. 

There are allowances for age, older you get, the more lax the standard becomes. You still have to run 3 miles, fast, though.  

As far as gender discrimination? Good luck with that. Your best bet to make change happen, would be to find a compelling argument as to why women need to have higher pt standards, and if they can fight that, then the next fight you need to have is to lower the male standard to its female equivalent. Either way this will fuck up mission readiness, if too many female marines fail a higher pt standard, they can't deploy, if males are held to a lower standard, it will cause unexpected labor issues. 


Ultimately however, these arguments have already been made, and the at the time honorable Mr. Mavis of the office of the secretary of defense said ""its OK that women are weak and lack mission readiness, we can rely on them as much as we rely on the men, on the condition that we continue to rely on the men to the same standard as before, while expecting them to pick up the easy to calculate slack that the equally trained women will need picking up after once the going gets too hard.""

Nowhere is ""defacto equality"" specifically defined for this or any other purpose.

I recommend everyone review CEDAW - the [United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-elimination-all-forms-discrimination-against-women?fbclid=IwAR2fUZvdCG6nfG_unHS8ankixh8zUX1zKFdQz1Jezgkxemzc88zlY9o_TmQ), Article 4 (with reference to Article 1).

Article 4:

1. Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved.

In every country that has ratified CEDAW, there will be a Sex Discrimination Act that references this UN Convention. Eg. [Australia](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00002):

""The objects of this Act are:

  (a)  to give effect to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and to provisions of other relevant international instruments;""

The point here is that **the US has not ratified CEDAW**. They are the only country to have signed it but not passed legislation enacting it.

>1. The physical fitness criteria for the selection of female  
applicants for military service are regulated. During fitness  
testing, the same tests are administered; however standards  
and scores are adjusted to recognize biological differences  
between women and men. All remaining selection tests are  
the same.  
Description  
The physical selection test measures the physical potential of the applicant taking  
into account biological differences between men and women. The score on this  
test is included in the overall score of the applicant. A ranking, of the applicants,  
based on this overall score is made up.  
In the case of a limited number of vacancies, the best applicants are recruited.  
Standards for physical tests related to certain functions (e.g. pilot, combat diver)  
are the same for men and women.  
Advantage  
• The test measuring the physical potential of men and women is no longer  
gender neutral.  
• Women are no longer put at a disadvantage, so their chances to be recruited  
increase.  
• Increase of the number of women recruited.  
• Recruitment is seen to be fair and unbiased as the best candidates are  
recruited, regardless of their gender. 

&#x200B;

This makes sense, because when people are being brought into military service, they aren't necessarily going in for a purely combat role. While strength matters, our military isn't engaged in sword-fighting, so there is a practical limit on how big or strong someone needs to be in order to shoot a gun, throw a grenade, or drive a vehicle. While it may be true that women on average may be less capable of say, carrying a wounded comrade out of danger, this is also going to be true of some men.

Let's take, for example, the biggest gap provided in the fitness standards - pushups.

On average men under 30 are expected to hit a minimum of 33 pushups in 1 minute versus just 18 for women.

Taking the heaviest people on the youngest end of this chart: [https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards](https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards)

We are looking at women being as heavy as 227 lbs' versus men being 235 lbs' and as light as 119lbs vs 132 lbs respectively.

That means that both men and women are on average maybe 8 to 13lbs apart? In a combat situation where a woman might have to carry a wounded comrade out of danger, it seems VERY unlikely that someone capable of hitting either minimum benchmark for ENTRY into the military would somehow not be fit enough to do a fireman's carry.

&#x200B;

Basically, while I can see the minimum standards allowing for women to have weaker upper body strength on average in order to be accepted, I don't see these standards as being so VASTLY different as to require a change in pay that wouldn't more reliably correspond to a change in their assigned duties (which would better reflect the specific reason that individual was accepted for). 

These guidelines are broad, but active duties seem, in my understanding, to be quite varied. These are minimum fitness requirements, and the minimum requirements don't seem to be off significantly enough to result in significant differences in individual performance for positions candidates wind up being sorted into.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,3,0,reddit2

But people dont seem to get if you make. 1 not have to be held up to the same requirements. That same bound and trust from knowing the person got your back is simply not that. Cause the nevwr had to prove that the could. So places where people get hurt like on front line in wars. Or figher fights the should be no where in the building where that requirements are needed. 

And even do its already happening and girls just not take serious and why would yea take them serious. If you put a lot of pride in your job. And where you are. And see people left and right have to do 50 procent less. Where you basicly saying 2 off those girls makes 1 of you. And the cant do the job thats requirement off them so you have to pick up the slack.

People say thats not true. But i work os a physical demanding job. And you can call me ass hole all you want. If you get payed the same. You wil do the same job as everyone else. No pick and choose the easy jobs. Cause its simple pride in your work. As a professional. Cause job titles mean something.

Cant say your a plumber. But wont do any of the dirty of physical demanding jobs. You should not be allowed to call yea self a plumber. Thats the simple fact. If you in a typ of job. You should be required to become able to do everything that job requires of you. To be called a professional.

Same way i cant go to woman dominate fields. Like teaching. Or day care. Pick and choose what jobs suits me right. Simple rule tale it all or none. Why the fuck is subpar work acceptable to meat dumb quotes. That often make work for more people. Dubble work loads. And slowly burn out people. Cause you need 2 often 3 of those girls to 
Fill one man. When physical demands a requirement in almost all parts off the job. And all the easy jobs. That people often seem as a small break of back breaking work houre after houre. You dont even have that anymore. But the get payed the same as you. Fucking funny as hell. Who would try there best anymore seeing that shit day after day. Not even talking about most the girls are sick like 8 times a year easly. Not even joking or being mean simply spitting facts. What i have to deal with on a daily basis.

In general, men are about 10% taller and have 50% more mass than women.

But that is in general. Many women can run longer and faster than a subset of men. Some women are stronger than even most men.

Equal opportunity means everyone has the opportunity to do a job, regardless of physical attributes.

Women overall, are not as strong as men, and physical standards for women in the military, just as for men, are significantly higher than for the overall population. Basically women, like men, have to be fit, be capable of running non-stop for two miles, be capable of lifting their bodies. But the standards for women are based on things like shorter legs and less upper body strength. 

Lots of guys make it through basic training requirements who are > 50 lbs overweight at the start. It is amazing how a low calorie, high protein diet and burning 7000 calories a day can radically transform the human body in 8 weeks.

BTW, this argument that women are too weak to do the job goes back > 40 years. It wasn't true then and it is not true now.

44% of women failed the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) in 2021. 7% of men failed. People who fail the ACFT multiple years can be denied re-enlistment. It depends on whether recruitment is high or low, because the military sets requirements for the total number of soldiers.

No arguments to the first layer, but the military has layers. It's a real ogre of a problem, and really, the physical aspect is a distraction. Males excel at carrying casualties and other heavy loads, which is relevant in combat arms to a point. I say to a point, as we are losing more to suicide than casualties in combat. 

The much more important layer is the mind, which is the great equalizer. To those who say the mind is your greatest weapon, I've met too many that choose to fight unarmed. The mind is where real resilience is born and real strategy is formed.

And as for your moaning over why it is that standards are not the same- they are in other ways. For instance, female and male Marines attend the same basic infantry school together and are there held to the same physical requirements. They have to complete the same rucksack hikes, complete the same obstacle courses, complete the same warfare training and manuevers. 

Further, in terms of specific infantry MOS Marines, there are very few female Marines because they are held to the same physical standards and most cannot complete the school training.

But, outside of general fitness and sound mindedness, your ability to carry a fallen Marine or soldier would hardly enter any real life combat scenarios for the majority of enlisted.

HOWEVER, both in USMC basic bootcamp AND infantry school (which all Marines attend and must pass) female AND male Marines must carry simulated fallen platoon members from a prone movement position (that is to say, carrying an actual person on your back while you low crawl) across field lengths AS WELL AS running movements.

People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do.

The military exists today in a state that intends to not be used or seen as a traditional military, but the needs and standards of a military still need to maintained to traditional standards. As far as I can tell, everything should funnel into one of the following:


1. Military standards continue to degenerate due to psuedo-peacetime which turns the military complex into a weak and ineffectual office waiting to be exploited by actors foreign and domestic.


2. Military ground forces are finally replaced with terrifying Boston dynamics robotic drones piloted by VR, Thus eliminating the gender issue, but raising tons of moral and ethical questions. 


3. A real no-shit war occurs, and current politics crumble under the stress, allowing a return to traditional form for the military as they move into a war time mindset. 


One of those three realities with caveats surely.


 (Probably Boston dynamic drones will be piloted exclusively by female marines maybe) 


Or maybe another major, real, no-shit war never occurs again. 


Or maybe we move into an Era of globally warring nation-states in a bid to establish a global hegemony.

I see you've never attended military training where you have to throw grenades. It's part of the US Army basic training. I wasn't aware of this before, but during the grenade throw I became aware of how horribly ineffective the average female is in throwing stuff far away. It's a well known thing.

Let's just say that if our base was in danger of being overrun and females were not issued grenades I'd be happier, for everyone's safety, because of my personal experience. I'm not blaming them. People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do. But rather than weeding people based on gender, they should do that by giving them a test that makes sure that they can throw a grenade properly (the grenade throw event wasn't a test. There was not pass/fail criteria. I don't know why).

I don't doubt that women won't throw the grenades as well as men, but this is a fundamentally different claim from the idea that ANY man would be a better, safer candidate simply because he could out throw a grenade better than any female soldier.

If this is the only criticism you have to offer on my position, I don't find it to be a compelling one. Because my position involves far more than a comment that was fundamentally about the distinction size differences make between modern and ancient warfare. Which I don't see women underperforming compared to men in distance throwing to be the only factor worth considering in whether or not someone is qualified to be a member of the military.

I mean, have you considered that the men who don't qualify are potentially worse at throwing than these women? Some men suck at throwing, some women are great at it, that's why these averages matter.

inr7m81,t1_inq4565,2022-09-09 18:02:49,MensRights,"Fitness is important to the military. It shows discipline, commitment excellence, and shows that the individual takes care of their body. It exists to weed out people who are undisciplined and cannot commit to a goal to achieve it. It helps ensure that enlisted personnel are less likely to experience adverse health conditions. But to test for those things doesn't require a set amount of strength or endurance. On average, women have less upper body strength. That's just a fact. A perfectly disciplined and committed individual woman can be at her peak health and fitness and still not do as many pull-ups as a man. The key is to look at the demographic. Whatever an average woman who achieves an excellent level of physical fitness can do, that should be the standard. They should be at the top of their demographic. A man who performs the same number of pull-ups as an average woman of great fitness is likely well under his own peak for fitness, just based on physiology alone.

Just look at the Army page: [https://www.army.mil/acft/](https://www.army.mil/acft/) Is the purpose of the test to measure abilities? Instead it lists: ""improve solider and unit readiness;"" ""transform the Army's fitness culture;"" ""reduce preventable injuries and attrition;"" and ""enhance mental toughness and stamina."" These things aren't ties to the exact physical abilities of the individuals, but to their overall level of fitness and health.

inuglp8,t1_insm4li,2022-09-10 12:00:58,MensRights,"Sure, but my point about the standards was that they didn't result in a significant variance between recruited men and women. Yes, men will outperform women on average with some of these tasks (like grenade throwing) more often than not, but if the women can reliably throw a grenade over 250 meters at a minimum, they have reached a minimum physical requirement for them to be qualified candidates.

That it's easier for men to meet that minimum physical requirement doesn't mean that this should be an advantage for ALL military positions that might be filled either. There are benefits to having a gender diverse military that outweigh the advantages imposed by gender neutral physical requirements that result in an imbalance of men and women recruited. For example, when the military goes in to occupy an area they will have to deal with the civilians that live in that area. Just like police, there is a benefit to deescalating conflicts that might arise, and some of those conflicts might be more easily resolved because a woman is available to do the deescalating. Not because women are better at de-escalation, but because the civilian might be able to trust or relate to a woman more in that particular circumstance, making a woman the better soldier to use in that situation.

The point is that there is a balance of factors at play, and the complaint that the physical requirements are gendered doesn't mean there isn't a benefit to having different physical requirements if they still allow for the same ""minimum requirements"" for a candidate to be deployed in a specific way.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,1,0,reddit2

Fitness is important, even if actual strength is not, and men are physiologically better at certain things, like pull-ups. So we can't easily say they should reduce the number of pull-ups for men because that will allow unfit men to pass. The goal should be for all fit people to pass and all unfit people to fail. On the other hand, for deadlifts, the standard should really be a percentage of body weight, although honestly, the standards are low enough that a weak man can easily pass them. The minimum for a male under the age of 21 is only 140 pounds.

That's why I actually think a medical exam would be better. They could test bone density, muscle mass, body fat, and cardiovascular health.

inrebyd,t1_inr70uf,2022-09-09 18:47:59,MensRights,"Was that the Marines? I think they deploy more often, which is probably why the age limit for first time enlistment is so much lower? 

The scope of their duties is obviously different. There is a pretty minimal level of physical fitness required for that. Any man or woman who is has reached a great level of physical fitness can manage to get into a truck or helicopter. I mean, did he have to climb up a rope to get in the heli? 

Even assuming that a deployed JAG officer does need an elevated level of fitness that directly translates to performance on a fitness test, does it make sense to hold everyone to that deployment standard throughout their entire time in the military? There is plenty of legal work that needs to be done in the U.S. and in other non-hostile locations. Everyone needs to be disciplined, committed, and healthy, but not everyone needs the upper body strength that they could climb up a rope or jump to catch a moving vehicle or anything else that could come up. 

I'll give you an analogy to firefighters. I see a lot of people complain about lower standards for women who apply because they think everyone should be able to do all of the jobs in an emergency. Now that's not a bad idea- if it's possible- if you have enough applicants that are physically and mentally capable of performing all jobs satisfactory. To be clear, where that is possible, that should be the goal. Where I'm from, that's just not possible. Our fire department is small and mostly volunteer. There are no women, but many of the men are very fat or older. Should they be booted from the department? No! We literally need them, and it's better that they are willing and able to perform some jobs, even if it's not all of them. If the team is well rounded enough, this works out just fine. If a woman wants to join, but she couldn't carry anyone out of a burning building, that doesn't mean she would be useless to us. If she is good at other roles in the department, then that benefits all of us and frees up others to focus on the roles that she can't do. If we had a strict fitness standard, we would not have very many firefighters at all. If you call EMS, and the paramedics can't get you to the ambulance (referencing that story about the guy who fell in a hole that was posted recently), you're really not any worse off where I live. They can't get you out of the hole, but they were the only available paramedics in the county, so you're stuck in the hole either way. You are just lucky that any EMS showed up in a reasonable time.

And if they need saved, it will be far easier for others in the group to save them. And of course, it begs the question- if it’s important that every member of a unit be able to carry every other member of the unit, should we be excluding people that are too large?

If someone cannot meet requirements that are made relative and to their own body, they are unfit.  Making things easier simply because someone is older, or a different gender doesn’t help in the long run.  It just adds more liabilities.

And I never said they shouldn’t be in shape, but that’s a different standard than you propose. A perfectly in shape man and woman will have different physical abilities. Is there anything special that JAG officers would have to do during deployment that would require more than being in shape? My point is that only some military jobs require more than just being in shape, and it doesn’t make sense to hold every individual to that standard if you don’t plan to deploy them. That’s why the Army is thinking of having a separate test for combat positions where the job actually requires specific abilities. It truly may not be enough to be “in shape” for combat, for instance if you have to carry something heavy. You can be fit as hell but too small or not enough muscle mass to do that.

Why does this matter? Why not always pick the best of the best? Well for JAG specifically, I’ll be blunt. The best of the best do not go into the military. There’s too much prestige and money in private practice. Get too strict with the fitness requirement, as in more than is actually required to do the job that needs done, and you make the pool even smaller. More generally, recruitment rates for the military are at an all time low. It makes sense to think more carefully about what level of fitness is actually required for the job, rather than limit applicants to those that would be fit enough for combat or deployment.

I don’t know all the considerations that went into the change, but this new test seems more tailored to abilities that actually correlate to combat ability. That said, there’s an obvious flaw. The standard for the deadlift, for instance, should be a percentage of body fat to actually determine fitness. A man who is 150lbs and deadlifts the minimum weight of 140lbs is obviously far more fit than a man weighing 215lbs who deadlifts 140lbs.

To the second point, I see what you’re saying, but that’s simply not a good approach for modern warfare. For one, there’s little difference between one and four pull-ups. That difference is extremely unlikely  to change whether a soldier lives or dies. If you tighten standards for both men and women (because again, the standards are low), then you lose a lot of soldiers in non-combat positions. At a certain point, you’ve introduced new risks because important jobs won’t be getting done on time. Modern warfare far more complicated than it used to be and is not conducted exclusively by soldiers on the battlefield.

What I’ve been trying to say is that making a standard lower makes it easier to achieve.  If the standard is to run a mile in 8 minutes but then gets increased to 9 minutes, that is objectively easier to obtain regardless of gender or age.  It may still be hard for some people but just because its hard doesn’t mean it’s wrong/unfair and needs to be adjusted.  What is unfair and should not be the case, is having one person have to run that mile in 8 minutes and someone else being allowed to make the cut by running it in 9 because of their gender.  I don’t think thats a necessarily outrageous or incorrect sentiment, and its one I apply not only to running but to any sort of weight training requirements.  There should be a single standard per weight class.  

To add to that sentiment, I feel having the separate standards for men and women, just increases the divide between men and women.  If the men are held to higher standards that make them bulkier and heavier, then the difference in standards is going to show even more.  

As for the non-combat positions the physical requirements make sense and should remain the same for them IF they are in area that there is a possibility for combat.  If they are stationed where combat is not a possibility then I see no problem with there being lower or even no physical requirements, but only if it’s guaranteed that they don’t get deployed.",M4L_x_Salt,t2_5y3atnw3,2,0,reddit2

You said:

""This assumes that the point of the physical fitness test is that it literally translates to required abilities to perform the job.  
It is""

You've changed your position here because later you agree that the purpose is to ensure you're ""in shape."" That does not directly translate to ability to a job. It's like the LSAT for law school. It shows you're mentally ""in shape"" but it does not directly indicate that you have the skills or abilities to be a lawyer or even law student. It just serves to weed out people who are definitely not smart enough to be a lawyer.

  
""Sometimes that is true, but many times, it is not.  
The main PFT is the minimum just to be in the military. You may not have to pull yourself up into a helicopter every day, but you better be able to when the time comes. If you need someone else to help you into a helicopter, you are putting yourself and others at increased risk.""

Someone who is physically fit will be able to do this. You're just looking for someone that is not carrying excess weight in the form of fat and has normal muscle mass. Different gender standards do not effect this as long as they are tied to the average performance of a physically fit person of that gender. 

  
""Men and women simply have different performances for the same level of fitness.  
The tests are based around your own body weight. Pullups, pushups, situps, running: You are only moving your own body weight. A 110 lb woman is not required to pull the 200lb man up, but she needs to be able to pull herself up.""

Well, that's just not true. The Army changed the test to include deadlifts, among other things. And it allows both women and older men to pass while lifting a lower weight. Young men have a higher standard because it's needed. An older man or woman that can deadlift X pounds is likely to be able to lift themselves and has demonstrated physical fitness. A young man that can only deadlift X pounds doesn't need to be as fit and could be overweight or unhealthy, so young men must be required to lift Y weight to prove fitness. Even bodyweight fitness tests, the difference between one and four pull-ups is not that great. If you can do a pull-up, you can pull yourself up when needed.

They will have expended the same about of effort. Yet ask them to do pull-ups, and the man will be able to do more. She will experience the same difficulty at a lower number that he will at a higher number. Therefore, for them to be equal in terms of effort and fitness, it’s necessary to have different pull-up standards. If you have the same standard, the woman will have to work harder and be more fit than the man to pass the same test. That’s all.

The situation is slightly complicated as Switzerland has a lot of treaties with the EU which require it to behave in some respects as if it were an EU member, but it isn't. The reason I'm not entirely sure about this is that I don't know if any of those treaties require Switzerland to implement the charter of fundamental rights. I don't think they do.

I have no idea if Swiss law theoretically prohibits what's being done here. A quick Google suggests they have (reasonable) rules about pay equality. Bear in mind that Switzerland was actually very late to the table with even quite reasonable gender equality rules, particularly regarding the rights of married women, so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have anything on the books.

That said, the country absolutely is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (which is *not* connected to the European Union, confusingly), which absolutely does require equality.

In 2017, about 30,000 men died from prostate cancer, and about 42,000 women died from breast cancer. As of fiscal year 2018, the National Cancer Institute has about $239 million allocated for prostate cancer research and $575 million allocated for breast cancer research. That’s about $8,000 per prostate cancer death but nearly $14,000 per breast cancer death, or 75% more money.

It’s not just prostate and breast cancer. As far back as 1994, medical professionals began to recognize the gap in funding for men’s diseases versus women’s diseases and the effect this had on life expectancy. A 1987 inventory found that 13.5% of the NIH research budget was devoted to studying female-only diseases while a mere 6.5% percent, less than half, was spent on male only diseases. 

It’s only gotten worse since then. In 2017, the NIH spent three times more money on general female-specific research as opposed to male-specific ($4.5 billion to $1.5 billion). In some areas, the difference was even more astounding. For lung cancer, the NIH spent $180 million on female-specific research but only $318,000 on men.",whatafoolishsquid,t2_eqgdo,5,0,reddit3

Men retire older while we die younger. No one counts that in the -debunked- gender pay gap discussion.

\>Women who have never been married and are childless earn 117 percent of their childless male counterparts. (This comparison controls for education, hours worked and age.) Their decisions are more like married men’s, and never-married men’s decisions are more like women’s in general (careers in arts, no weekend work, etc.)

\>Comparing men and women with the “same jobs,” then, is to compare apples and oranges. However, when all 25 choices are the same, the great news for women is that then the women make more than the men. Is there discrimination against women? Yes, like the old boys’ network. And sometimes discrimination against women becomes discrimination against men: in hazardous fields, women suffer fewer hazards. For example, more than 500 marines have died in the war in Iraq. All but two were men. In other fields, men are virtually excluded – try getting hired as a male dental hygienist, nursery school teacher, cocktail waiter.  
\>There are 80 jobs in which women earn more than men – positions like financial analyst, speech-language pathologist, radiation therapist, library worker, biological technician, motion picture projectionist. Female sales engineers make 143 percent of their male counterparts; female statisticians earn 135 percent.

I think the better way to evaluate prostate cancer vs breast cancer funding is to compare research dollars to years of life lost. Breast cancer strikes much earlier in life—average onset around ~40–compared to about 70 for prostate cancer. So in terms of maximizing humanity’s aggregate healthy years, breast cancer should get more funding, but it really depends on what metric you find most important.

ie9chgl,t1_ie99uwt,2022-06-30 00:46:45,MensRights,"The arugment I am making is there isn't a clear distinction where rights start and stop quite often. Especially when you involve a 3rd party.

eg If I sell a pink and a blue bike helmen. I can argue they are seperate products. The kicker being you could rule this illegal under law. But in reality the laws become useless because you cannot win by leglislation and still be functional as a collective. eg the parent company simple creates 2 companies and sells a blue helment in one and the pink in the other paying helment IP to the parent patent holder. Law evaded. Sue? Ok we thrown this down the 10-20 year legal backlog / path and draw it out. Ok so you win? You fine / bankrupt which company? Does this have the intended outcome you seek? eg now harder to buy a bike helment. Everyone suffers and costs go up.. not down in terms of ""safty""

USB-C Cahrge leglislation is much the same. The premisis of the law is to prevent mobile phone charges being discarded. The kicker. There already is 7 standards to USB-C and they are released yearly. So.. Nobody knows what next year will be and each charger is different eg 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5amp chargers. Great now we still discard chargers cause the 0.5 amp can't drive  pi 2 where 2 amps is require or a pi 3 where 3 amps is required. So you can immeidatly see where the bullshit creeps into law. eg the concept original premis is lost then ignore but its implemented anyway cause it ""feels good""

Same deal with human rights laws.... Bit of an oxymoron to have human rights laws but still have conscription/draft in EU countries isn't it? But hey lets get rid of the draft. Ok war starts first thing that would occur is draft reinstaled and the law ignored.

Like some of the major problems with the EU human rights laws basically ain't worth the paper they are written on. So there is no trust no between establishment vs people and that... is a massive massive problem just look at the state of the US right now because of roe vs wade.

Which failed here? The ruling or the fact that the demoncrats didn't ever sign it into law properly (doing their job) for the last 50 years.... which would have prevented this outcome. Nope instead they abused the positions and kep using it as ""marketing material""

As for some simple breaches int he EU

Issue 1. Covid. first things brussels did was close all borders. Preventing movement of people.  Understandable. But also foreseaable. Making the laws a ""problems"" its not like pandemitcs happened before there is exceptions in the law for this.

Issue 2. Human rights laws were broken in multiple EU countries. Strong restrictions of freedoms. Again covid exceptions in the laws were used as the problem was foreseen. But also goes againt the premisis of the law.

Issue 3. Human rights laws once again violated in europe in multiple countries. covid - mandated vaccinations. In completing testing and analyses. Also inside jobs were done for politicla reasons and this is yet to come out fully.

Issue 4. Greece. Over turned referendum during greek debt crisis..

Issue 5. Ireland. Over turned referendum in Ireland. Didn't like the outcome. Voted it twice < 2 year period after extensive false ""marketing""

Issue 6. Spain / Catalonia. Forced agreement. Referendum on indpeendance blocked.

These go on and on in Europe. They apply the rule when it suits them. Makes them up when it doesn't then applies fines as leverage.

More than half the population mistakenly thinks that the quoted gap (""77 cents for every dollar a man gets"", or 81 cents or whatever number is being quoted today) is actually the difference for women in the same job, with the same skills and working the same hours.

In other words, most people don't have the first clue about how crudely the ""gender wage gap"" is calculated.

Often, a picture can drive the point home far better than words. So show them this chart, which should clear up their confusion.

As you can see, the actual ""like for like"" gender pay gap in the UK is just 0.8%, which is a LOT less than the 19% - 23% that idiot feminists are always claiming.

The worldwide average figure for the 33 countries covered in this study is 1.6%.

Personally, **my guess is that last remaining gap is due to women taking more vacation days per year, on average, than men do.** To my knowledge, there have only been a couple of studies done on this topic. Both did find that women took more vacation days (even before they had kids), but the size of the difference varied quite a lot. More research is needed. Vacation time is one of very few personal choices not accounted for in this study, so it likely does contribute to that remaining gap.

1) I've lost count of how many of our clients have explicitly stated (in writing at times) that they don't want any more ""white men"" in their executive ranks, and that they specifically want women.

2) There simply aren't enough qualified women in leadership roles to offset the huge quantity of men. For every 1 woman who has taken a company $0 - $50M in revenue, there are literally dozens of men. It is a pipeline problem. Whether that is driven by societal forces, personal preference, or discrimination is open to interpretation. I don't believe their is wage discrimination in this country, or any kind of pay gap to speak of. 

3) The above practice in point 1 is explicitly and implicitly racist and sexist...mind boggling to me how people don't see the hypocrisy

It's still valid to ask what the 'pay gap' is telling us about gender and the labour market. One factor individuals generally can't control is parental leave - women get far more paid leave than men, which structures the incentives around parental leave such that women take far more time away from work (leading to slower promotion and lower earnings). That's a policy which discriminates against men and women in different ways, and inhibits personal choice. The 'pay gap' is likely wider because of it than it would otherwise be.

So I agree with your general thrust - men don't earn more than women because 'muh patriarchy' (which women have as much to gain from accepting as anyone) - but it's still worth asking whether the way the labour market is structured along gender lines is fair or not. Lots of the policies involved are discriminatory in both directions, and that needs to be addressed.",_Cicero,t2_yh13l,8,0,reddit4

The solution is to implement social and cultural changes, such as paternity leave (to allow men to share child-rearing responsibilities), curbing harassment in traditionally male-dominated education and workplaces, etc. When (most) feminists say ""we need to do something about the gender pay gap"" THIS is what they mean, not that every woman and every man should be paid exactly the same.",rasteri,t2_3b1o6,3,0,reddit4

""Intangibles"" make up a significant component of any assessment of value, particularly on something as subjective as employee performance.

In a world (obviously not *this* world) where the Patriarchy is real and there is a genuine cultural and systemic bias to undervalue women, employers wouldn't correct for this by hiring more women *because they don't believe they are getting a deal*. They believe that the woman they hire for 80% of a man's salary is only worth 80% of the value.

Businesses that pay badly and where the work appeals to women can take advantage of women being more agreeable and wanting more meaningful work.

That's an overall wage gap argument.  On average, even when women do enter into these high paying fields, they typically do not negotiate starting salaries, raises or promotions.  They should, and studies show that when women negotiate, they get higher starting salaries, raises and promotions.

>That said, I can hear what my coworkers say around women, about women.

Are these comments harming those women?  Do the men treat those women terribly?  Is there a place where men can talk about women, specifically in a way that women talk about men?  You know that happens just as much.

>I know growing up women who were interested in it, at my school, were harassed daily.

Were they harassed as much as the guys were also harassed?  Was the harassment intentionally insulting or was it banter?  Did the girls say anything back?  Men use banter and insults to judge if someone is worthy to be in their group.  They also use it to signal attraction.  There's lots of reasons for banter, and some people assume that banter is intentional, sexist harassment.  Those girls quitting sorta proved those guys right.  If they couldn't take a bit of banter, they couldn't take the stress of being in that group.

I'm not saying what they were doing was right, merely, I'm saying there's a reason for banter.  If those girls never had to experience that banter, it could come across as hostility.  I had a girl in one of my computer classes in college that experienced 0 banter or harassment.  She used her cuteness to get guys to do her work for her.  Does that mean that all girls just use their sexuality to get through classes?  No, it doesn't.  Those girls dropping out flat could have found the subject to be boring.  Most girls find engineering type subjects to be uninteresting, which is why they pursue subjects that are interesting.  

I'm not saying harassment or discrimination doesn't exist, it most certainly does, but it is still the least important factor in women's careers.  Women 22-30 in the largest cities make 8% more than men in their own age range.  The only time women's wages drop, is when they pursue motherhood.  If they don't, they end up making more than their male peers throughout their lives.",,,7,0,reddit4

Most families work under some form of communism or socialism. There are communes that work under systems of socialism or communism and they work pretty well.

The ""problem"" with communism/socialism is that it doesn't scale. The systems only work with common ethos, peer accountability, and the ability to ostracize leeches. That's why towns and nations fail under communism: it's very difficult to maintain common ethos, you can't peer account the members because there's too many to remember, and due to that it's near impossible to ostracize them.

We also know when names / age are removed from resumes, we don't get this problem either. 

As to the example, my point is the perception of value, which is how humans do everything. If I showed you a gold Rolex watch, and said it was for sale, not stolen, for 20% of the value, you would pick it up and most likely sell it for a profit. You see the value of the Rolex compared to the price. 

If you see the value of a worker as 40k/yr, why would you pay them 50k/yr? Even if that is the going rate for someone in your field? Again, the perceived value of the person. There is a perception, even in this thread, of women taking more time off, and being a hindrance to the company (even though time off is using either PTO or unpaid time off). Why would it matter if a woman uses her PTO for periods or vacations? but in this sub, it seems to matter. 

So do you think women are seen as less valuable? Can you look at the comments in this sub, realize some of these comments are by hiring managers, and then say they view men and women as equals? 

Hell, i'm downvoted for linking to the study, a study you say is hard to refute, yet i'm downvoted. I would rather us discuss facts, and figure out ways to improve the situation if we can. Again, so far from what I have read, blind hiring is the best.

Personally I can't complain about either as I live in Canada and the welfare state paid for my bus fare to go to interviews and school as well as money for school supplies, clothing, grooming supplies, etc at request when I fell on hard times, honestly without the welfare state I'd probably still be flipping burgers",,,2,0,reddit4

This legislation means that groups are allowed to take a “special measure for the purpose of promoting or realising substantive equality for members of a group with a particular attribute”.

If you are in Darebin please write to the council and ask them how they determine which jobs to apply 'special measures' to? and how many times they've used ""special measures"" to improve the proportion of males in female dominated jobs?

IF they are only using special measures to get more women in male dominated jobs, then that is discrimination in the application of special measures.

hc9olti,t3_pkv09j,2021-09-10 03:27:02,MensRights,"Australia, where laws making discrimination against people on the basis of sex, are simly not enforced when the victims are men. Not a surprise that of the people appointed to the position of Sex Discrimination Commissioner in Australia 100% have been women, and all have concentrated their efforts on women's equity, you know... that equity that only considers the wellbeing and rights of women.

It's gotten so bad in Australian that even the once repected Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), respected for its nonpartisan and objective collating and reporting of Australian epidemiological data, has started selectively reporting statistics to support a skewed feminist view of gender indicators. 

Gender indicators are indicators to aid exploration of economic and social differences between women and men over time, using data from ABS and other official sources. But the reporting by the ABS makes it clear that the agenda is focused on the welfare of women, while completely ignoring the welfare of men,

This quote from the ABS webpage says it all, ""Key statistics - Women’s full time adult average weekly ordinary time earnings were 86% of that of men. Recorded crimes data showed women were five times more likely to be victims of sexual assault than men. For the first time, there was equal representation between men and women parliamentarians in the Senate. These feminist talking points leave out the usual important data, like why using average earnings isn't appropriate (men work more hours and get paid more, its illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex in employment), women ASK to work part time (its not forced on them), and women form more than 50% of voters, and aren't voting for female canidates (so it must be misogyny). OMG. 

The ABS web page continues to selectively report these extremely important gender indicators, but leaving out the more extreme statistics about male deaths in employment, suicide, unemployment, mortality, and poor health outcomes. I guess gender indicators for the ABS are the same ones that inspire #KILLALLMEN, ""all men are trash"". Except now its the reputation of the ABS that is trash.
