I'll give you a hint: Almost nobody feels comfortable. No matter what you have, you will want more. If you were to take a guess, what percentage of Americans believe they deserve to be making more money? I can tell you that the answer is > 90%.

Almost nobody. Not environmentalists, not multi millionaires, not people worried about water, etc. etc. etc. Everyone thinks they deserve more and that their standard of living should never decrease.

If you ever do get to a point where you actually feel comfortable and actually feel like you don't need to increase your consumption... what then?

Now 1.3 million could be good if you say had a pension. So if these 2500 people were mainly older Gen X, Military or Boomers all of which have or have a high probability of pension then they could easily live on 1.3 million due to the offset of the pension and SS and possible employer-provided secondary insurance. But say Gen Y or Z where pensions are effectively only in some trades, military and a few small governments jobs are going to need a massively higher number to offset the loss of a pension and higher SS age.

If that’s two people maxing out their 401ks that adjusts to $188k (and even less if Roth too), as you won’t contribute in retirement. If these people are working to pay off their mortgage, which average in 2023 is $2.3k, that now comes down to $160k.  The taxes on making $223k are also going to be high, so that easily takes off another $20k compared to retirement level taxes with reduced income and spending, putting you at about $140k.

Now $1.3mil nets you $52k / year with the 4 percent rule.  With two people making $111.5k salaries, you’d get about $5.6k per month in Social Security. That puts you at $119.2k per month, in 2023 dollars, in retirement. 

So it’s **about $120k vs $140k net**, not factoring in total taxes which will cut it down some for both. It’s not *that* far off.

jtefxhx,t1_jtdghsg,2023-07-25 16:12:32,Economics,"You are partly wrong.

233k is the salary they want, not disposable income.  That's about 120k (probably less) once you take off taxes and deduction like maybe putting 40k away each year for retirement.  

So they are living off of 120k.  Now lets assume they have a reasonable $3k-4k/mo mortgage that drops us down to about $70-80k leftover on the optimistic side.

So with a $233 salary, you likely are living off of much less anyway.  If you assume your house is paid off, you are no longer saving for retirement but withdrawing instead, ACA on a low income means your medical will be very reasonable or near free... $1.3mil + SS will come to around 70-80k/year.

I'm just saying with those approximate numbers, the 1.3mil + SS likely comes close to what they were spending pre-retirement.

\---------------------------------------------

But you are also correct.

These numbers just don't look spectacular.  They assume a lot of things that are depressing:

I feel like people who actualy study economics understand that the future value of money is worth much less than current value, especially when you have to factor in the (un)certainties of QoL and health as you get older. 

Spending 25k on a vacation when your 25-45 is money much better spent then when you are 65+. Heck I have no idea if I will even be alive, there is a non zero chance I will keel over and that absolutely should be factored in. 

There is this weird fetishization on reddit about putting every penny away into retirement living like a miser in the meantime and it's so backwards. The future is unknown, your health and the health of your loved ones will deteriorate. Do not be afraid to have fun and enjoy life while you can. Sure, save enough to not be destitute, but you don't really **have** to plan to retire at 50 or even 60.

That mindset might change as I get older but it’s the current mindset so it’s what I have to go off, so I’m not worried about the idea of retiring, but just working a little less in a semi retirement until i must retire.

And I agree that you are right on the vacation argument. However, it assumes that you put that money in the ground and then spend it 20 years later at a diluted value when you could invest it and outpace inflation. 

And I am not fetishizing retirement. I’m fetishizing my children having an advantage over your children because I made sacrifices for them to live a better life and propagate the success of my family beyond my own ability to create wealth. With the way the world seems to be going, that’s seems very important to give them any advantage I can.

$1.3million in retirement and $233k now aren’t super off. I’ll do the math.

If that’s two people maxing out their 401ks that adjusts to $188k (and even less if Roth too), as you won’t contribute in retirement. If these people are working to pay off their mortgage, which average in 2023 is $2.3k, that now comes down to $160k.  The taxes on making $223k are also going to be high, so that easily takes off another $20k compared to retirement level taxes with reduced income and spending, putting you at about $140k.

Now $1.3mil nets you $52k / year with the 4 percent rule.  With two people making $111.5k salaries, you’d get about $5.6k per month in Social Security. That puts you at $119.2k per month, in 2023 dollars, in retirement. 

So it’s **about $120k vs $140k net**, not factoring in total taxes which will cut it down some for both. It’s not *that* far off.

And this isn’t factoring in Childcare; as remember about half of adults have children in the US. This is another significant distinction between needing money now vs retirement.

Most people did not see an appreciation in value like your mom.  

Yes, in a handful of cities in the US, the children cannot afford to live where they grew up.  That’s typical of every boom town in history.  More wealth has been created in the high performing coastal regions in the US in the last 30 years than anywhere else in human history.  Most people cannot afford to live in the most desirable locations, it’s just math.  

My millennial sister and brother in law live in a bigger house sooner than my parents did and have a nanny.  They do not get nest eggs from their parents.  They live in a Midwest suburb.

Yes, your mom was way luckier than you, and was one of the luckiest people in history.  You will probably not be as lucky as your mom. 

Yes, housing is more expensive and is a problem.  

You cannot afford to live in the same neighborhood, the same way, but that’s life, nothing has ever been stable for 75 years.  

You can afford to live in other neighborhoods.  

At no point in history has everyone been able to afford what everyone wants today.  

Housing is a problem, wages are a problem, inequality is a problem.  No question. 

But it will be a competition for those limited housing spots in high value areas, there’s no getting around it.  250 million people in 1990 vs 340 million people in 2022.  9 trillion GDP in 1990 vs 20 trillion GDP in 2020.

To your point though. Someone only saving $100 a month will only have $1200 in savings after an entire year. If they have a single financial hiccup that’s putting them back at zero almost certainly. Even with those savings they are effectively paycheck to paycheck given it only takes one hospital visit, ambulance ride, tooth infection, car accident, job gap, forced move, broken water heater, stolen catalytic converter, property tax adjustment, utility adjustment, etc… to reset that down to zero again.

I don't think that is as simple as it seems. When people talk about the SS cap, they usually mean they amount after which you don't have to pay into SS. The other side of it is that number is baked into the calculation of your SS benefits calculation. That is also the max amount from which your benefit payout is calculated. 

So if you bumped the SS cap up to $250k, immediately a lot of people who had been high earners would start getting much bigger SS payments.

But the SS wage base actually does capture over 90% of workers. For 2022, the 90th percentile for workers in the US was $132,676 and the wage cap was $147,000. For 2023, the cap is $160k. Because of the nature of the program, your benefit is based on your work history, so people who had been earning up to that new cap will start getting payments based on their work history the moment the change is implemented.

There's history for this, on January 31, 1940, Ida Mae Fuller or Ludlow, Vermont for the first SS check for $22.54. She had retired in November 1939 and collected benefits for 35 years, I think having made one payment. The up to 250k workers will pay up to an additional $5,580 (6.2% of up to $90k additional over the wage base) - and every worker, currently retired, who had been making up to that amount will now be getting bigger payments. I'd just like to see some analysis that says it will even out. 

The biggest problem is that SS wasn't designed to account for our changing demographics - we have a lot more people as a percentage on SS than when it was designed being paid by a smaller percentage of the population

When the system was set up CEOS made something like 10-15 times what their average workers made. Now that number is closer to 400 times. If they raised the SS tax threshold to compensate they wouldn't have to dream of jacking the retirement age again or reducing benefits.

I'm not somebody out here advocating for taxing the ultra wealthy into oblivion, but SS is the ONE thing that we average joes who work our asses off our whole lives have to look forward to. A few years to put our feet up and enjoy life while others pull the load. If they pop the retirement age again, which in the US is already well above the age France just rioted over, people are gonna despair.

The ultra wealthy live in fear of some kind of organic uprising of the working class. Nobody knows if that will ever occur, but I can tell you for damn sure the odds will go up if people start seeing their friends and neighbors checking out of life before they ever got to enjoy any retirement. Bumping the age to 70 might sound reasonable on paper, but the people breaking their backs doing hard physical labor creating wealth for the oligarchs either won't make it to 70, or will be so crippled that they won't be able to enjoy it.

I don't think it is reasonable financial advice to assume 7-8% real returns. Historical gross real returns since 1900 have been about 6.7%. So if you want to take a historical lens (and not examine current environment), why would someone pick 8% and not 6.5-6.7%?

There are three reasons to assume that: 

* Equities are currently undervalued relative to intrinsic value. Unlikely given relatively elevated P/E ratios combined with corporate profits at near record highs as percent of GDP (equities are not undervalued relative to historical norms). 
* There are untapped markets that can drive growth. This is unlikely given that US multi-nationals are already basically fully globalized and the US faces huge demographic headwinds and the global demographics are facing headwinds. 
* There is a pray and hope for some sort of AI or other unexpected technology miracle. Perhaps, but this is no guarantee. Reshoring is negative for corporate profits, not positive. 

1 and 2 (combined with ongoing productivity growth from technology) is what has created the real returns we see since the 60s. 

The myth that markets over 20-30 year horizons will inherently sustain high real growth rates is just not accurate.

Yes, from start date to end date. But that's not how investing works. You have to assume continuous investments over time.

Of course. But this is business-as-usual productivity gains - it is the continued incremental journey of human innovation and invention - and only a singularity-like event would radically alter real equity growth opportunity. 

>Current valuations aren't really al that important if you assume dollar cost averaging.

It is if you are asking the question of what is real growth potential over the course of 35 years. This is not me worrying about a near-term crash or anything like that (in fact that would be helpful if you start investing today); but it is a drag on potential growth of investments. 

Starting dates - even with DCA - matter a lot. Investing in Jan 1962 without DCA and exiting in Jan 1982 has a .8% real annual return. Add in DCA and the annual returns are about 2.4% over a 20 year horizon. Extend to 1992 - 30 full years - and you get 4.8% without DCA and about 5.5% with DCA. Why? Because lots of real economic growth was ""hidden"" in equity returns because of corporate profit as percent of GDP and P/E ratios. It's a massive haircut depending on where you start and end. 

>The idea that multi-nationals are ""fully globalized"" is nonsense. There are a billion Indians with quickly rising wages who would love to buy an iPhone and a car. The same is true for billions of SE Asians, where growth is rising rapidly.

This is true, but population growth globally has slowed dramatically. Globally, prime working age population will peak within the next 20 years and already has or will peak in the next few years in the majority of developed countries. Income uplift is obviously a huge opportunity, but quantity becomes a headwind sooner than you might think. These things do matter if you're talking about extrapolating historical growth trends into the future. 

>That makes no sense. Companies wouldn't do it if it were negative.

Companies do it when it is *better than the alternative*. Companies have historically had the best of both worlds: sell to a global market and get to use low cost labor to develop and manufacture. Reshoring is being done to address geopolitical and supply chain risks, as well as the acknowledgement that certain countries (namely China) are not low cost countries anymore. Reshoring may be good for *labor* if it increases demand for local labor (not really clear as it may be traded for capital through automation), but labor having more power does not help equity valuations (less income in the form of corporate profits, more in the form of earned income). 

>I could be wrong. Nobody knows. But what are you gonna do if you knew that low returns would be the case? Start saving 25% of your income for retirement? That's not realistic.

Savings rates across an entire economy at 25% create their own problems, but anything less than 15% is suicide and 20-25% is definitely a better position. I save about 30% of my gross income (40% taxes, 30% living, 30% saving) - although partly because I expect to retire from my higher earning job. 

Regardless, my overall point is that 8% real returns are laughable. There is a convergence of local and global demographics and point-in-time valuations that make that potential unrealistic. Especially after considering fees and taxes for non-tax protected accounts. 4-5% is conservative (why I said ""no one should bank on >5% real returns""), 6% is realistic but not guaranteed and aligned to long, long term historical trends. 7% is highly aggressive, especially given macro context. 8% is insane and bad financial advice.",annoyedatlantan,t2_f1901,1,0,reddit4

Being pregnant felt like crap, but I was still expected to show up at work every day and give 100%. I had to go back to work before my kid was even sleeping through the night.... I won't even talk about the compete joke that 12wks of unpaid  ""leave"" is in the U.S.

Then after the exhaustion of working all day, instead of laying back on the couch and relaxing, I am chasing a toddler around the house for hours. We go from playroom, to living room, to hallway, to kitchen, again and again and again. Sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up, near constantly on the move. It hurts my back, my hips, my shoudlers, etc Especially on weekends when it's near constant motion for around 8 to 9 hrs a day.

I have no time to relax. No time for TV, exercise, or hobbies. I do more laundry and dishes than I've ever done before. I spend hours preparing nutritious meals only to watch handfuls get thrown on the floor between screaming and tears. Even on the weekends they wake up at 6:45am so you're perpetually exhausted and have to accept a 10pm bedtime or deeply regret it. They need constant supervision because they are always finding ways to injure themselves.

It is hard to maintain friendships or a social life b/c of chores and lack of childcare on weekends. It's also tedious at times. I've heard the same Fisher Price songs on loop so many times I have them menorized. I never do what I want to do anymore. It's all about the kid almost all of the time. Even when we go out for a treat,  like eating at a restaurant, we have to make sure it's kid friendly and bring things to entertain her.

We only have two remaining living grandparents and 1 lives out of state, so there is very little help there. Both have a series of medical problems that we also coordinate taking care of on their behalf. Both are widows from a generation where they need help with paying their bills, setting up a roku, interacting with A/C repairmen, etc.

Having kids while both parents work is physically exhausting, emotionally draining, constantly overwhelming, and just f**king hard every single day. The time for me to be myself is between 8pm and 9:30pm every night, at which point I am stressed out and exhausted for anything except mindless TV comedies. There is no meaningful shred of time that belongs to me anymore. I count down the days to when I can have just a little alone time or sleep in on a weekend. I will never, ever have a second for this reason. I love my kid immensely and would do it again for them in a heartbeat, but I am at my goddamn limit. 

So why aren't women in most developed societies having more kids? Because we've reached the very real physical limit of time in a day, and most child rearing activities are really unenjoyable.

In fact many environments that should be kid friendly because they are the only places to exist with children that don’t have a high cost of per-person admission, like churches, museums, libraries, etc., are outright hostile to kids 0-8 years old in how they are designed and how adults act inside. Aging people who previously would have died and passed on their wealth to help out parent-age young people (20-40 yrs old) are instead living longer and also hoarding money to maintain an extremely high quality of living relative to young working parents because the aged folks own real property outright and have no children to care for.

Meanwhile older people who have lots more money and time, the “senior citizens,” dominate politics and are the ones who receive outsized government benefits like lower taxes (since taxes are on income, and they are not in their high-earning years if they are working part time or retired), social security, Medicare, blah blah blah.

While it has has tremendous benefits for allowing women to plan when they will have kids,  delaying having children until later in life has caused a domino effect in family size and economics. There are now 2 women for every man in college, meaning more and more women are delaying having children into their late 20s and early 30s to establish their careers. The influx of highly educated women into the work force has essentially had the macro economic effect of requiring two working adults in a family unit to meet par income for stability. This creates your exact situation, where you are expected to both generate resources for your family and raise children. While we look at the 1950s as some kind of distopian nightmare for women, at the very least it allowed for a generation women to prioritize being mothers and still have a family unit that was economical stable. 

The fact that you and so many women are choosing to forgo having additional children because you've become economically dependent to a corporation is something I think we as a society should be ashamed of.

And of course i do not mean that women should only exist to push out children and I mean all of this as objective observation of societal and economic changes of the last 60y.

But just looking that the points of your comment, it's clear you would prefer time to enjoy your child, have more for yourself, and if you weren't so exhausted from work, you'd like to have more kids.

I believe if we do not reevaluate our family unit structure as a part of our family economic requirements, the problem will solve itself, our population will essentially shrink as replenishment will continue to dwindle, and our economies of scale will collapse under a reduction of consumption.",Vycaus,t2_8mylu,4,0,reddit1

There's definitely some benefits to having lots of kids, but you need the money and able to deal with stress.  

Also doesn't multiple kids put strain on the body?  Have you ever seen a 30 year smoker?  They look weak, sullen like the life has been drained.  I've heard multiple kids has the same effect.  Just to make a kid you gotta be in the mood.

Edit: My response was generalized.  To discuss China specifically, its insane.  Education can be expensive.  I know they have big houses in rural China and I've seen some big villas in Shanghai suburbs, so it's possible to have a big house.  Ayi culture is prevalent in China, so having a full time nanny help clean the house and take care of the kids is possible.  It's still going to cost a fortune.  

The nice thing about an interracial family in China is you don't have to follow Chinese tradition of buying your kids a house, car, wife, etc.  Yea Chinese tradition is rough putting a lot of responsibility to the parents to get the kid a new car and an apartment.  Has to be a new car because Chinese are superstitious about second hand stuff.  Not like in America where we're grateful for anything we can get even if the car is held together with duct tape.  Chinese also need a new house or at least fully renovate an old one whereas in the USA we get s house as is and move in.  

So I think it's very difficult for Chinese to have multiple kids based on the cultural traditions and the costs.

Jumping back to generalization, globally people are struggling to make money to support what they currently have.  Many just don't have the resources to have another kid (if they even have 1).  The population problem isn't specific to China.  Japan and Korea are reporting problems.  USA even has a problem the social security system is going to fail because not enough young people to put money into the system.  My sister right now is 35 with a good career and hasn't married her bf yet, they're living in an apartment size condo she owns, and she's said she'll do marriage and kid after she gets a house.  The house was last year's goal, but she didn't like interest rates so she's going to wait and see if this year will be better.  Yes my sister is putting off marriage and kids because she's waiting for better interest rates for a house.  To me at nearly 40 it sounds insane to put a major thing that'd benefit the world on hold for better interest rates.  Hahaha!  Of course reddit will probably point out I can't complain since I don't even have a gf.  Whole reason I'm single is because I don't have a good paying job to attract a woman.

Thats not the problem being talked about. 

Prior to 2016, China's birth rate was a on a **slow**, steady, ""normal"" decline for *decades*, which is why the policy was removed. However starting in 2016, China's birth rate seems to have hit a new inflection point, effectively falling off a cliff. The ramifications of *that* is huge, and what is being referred to. 

To think of it another way: imagine all the various repercussions a failing birth rate that most every country has/is having/will have over 40 or so years, and compress it all into 7. And keep in mind affects as such arguably aren't even linear, they are exponential. 

> I'm not saying an authoritarian dictatorship couldn't force people to have 4 or more children but they won't do it willingly.

I mean, thats pretty much what they need to do at this point. Even if China snapped its fingers and magically just stopped the birth rate from falling further right this second, the current rate and the affects of just the previous few years would still be catastrophic. Think ""Children of Men"" type of shit. 

As a thought experiment, think about your own town as China. In the next decade or so, more than half the institutions of lower education would be closed, along with it all that goes with that. I'm not sure if you've ever seen/dealt with school closures, but even just closing a few is a big deal. Half is unthinkable. 20 years, similar situation is now happening to things like universities. 30-40, most businesses and manufacturing would be gone. 50+ its total population would be less than half of what it is now. Literally go walk down the street and imagine half the houses are now vacant. Sounds really cool at first, but in reality, that is *really* *really* *really* bad.

But to answer the question, yes, because it would allow me to outsource a lot of daily activities and buy back free time. There are days I have to choose between going to get groceries or taking a shower, or finishing a huge close deadline at work or sleeping. 

True Story: There was a week back in August that our entire family was sick with COVID. I had to stay up with the 11mo until 4am b/c she was crying in discomfort and would only sleep on my chest. She finally let me put her down in the crib. I slept from 4am to 7am, then had to log into work that morning to notify an employee over Zoom that their position was no longer needed (layoff). HR was literally freaking out that I was sick the day before and I emailed them from bed to assure it would get done. Again, I was sick with COVID myself during this entire ordeal... That, is the essence of being a working mom. 

I'd hire a rotation of 2 to 3 nannies for roughly 12hrs per day of coverage. Then a household manager/assistant to deal with tasks like paying bills, filing taxes, scheduling household maintenance, doing laundry, mowing the yard, getting groceries, getting oil changes on the car, running errands, etc. Someone to come do all the cleaning. Someone to cook all of our meals. Currently those are all tasks husband and I do around work, the kiddo, and sleeping. The mind-blowing part is there's two of us to share the load. I can't imagine how much worse it is for single parents. I don't know how my husband manages when I'm on business trips out of State.

In Central TX, the cost of a nanny with payroll tax, etc is about $27/hr. So that's $118k annually right there. Then assuming household mgr/assistant at $30/hr for 20hrs a week adds another $31k onto that. Then weekly cleaning service at $300/wk gets up to $15.6k. Then cook at maybe $15k. So that's $180k a year.

That is the *staggering* value of unpaid labor an average give-it-your-all parent is trying to do for their household each year. At a certain point you can see how it becomes enticing for one parent to consider dropping out of the labor force entirely.

Society wants women in the labor force to work as if we don't have children, but also expects us to parent as if we don't have jobs. I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to bypass that lifestyle.",econgirl8,t2_8jazx,3,0,reddit1

You still need workers to grow the food, build/maintain infrastructure, provide healthcare, etc.  A shrinking population is also an aging population, so you'll have an ever-growing number of retirees per worker.  Meaning, an ever-growing financial burden per worker. 

And it's easy to dismiss growth in the abstract, but in practice people don't want poverty.  People who are poor, want to be not-poor, or at least less-poor.   Being not-poor means more access to better food, medicine, education, leisure, travel, lighting, better housing, all kinds of things.

Children are a very large cost, both financially, In time and effort, and in opportunity cost. But they have large positive externalities since we need society to have more children for a next generation. So the answer really has to be paying people to have children. If you know that you could have children, and importantly we'd have to figure out a way to incentivize productively raising them, and that would give you a richer and more comfortable life, You would be incentivized to have more children.

This number is fairly steady from where it was decades ago (there has been a small reduction in the mean because of the smaller number of women having 6+ kids, but the median is essentially the same).

The reason birth rates are declining is because fewer women are becoming mothers at all.  People are staying single longer.  If a woman hits age 30 without having a child, her odds of ever having one decline to 50%.

But also, I would think that there's structural forces that would permanently keep the actual number of children measurably smaller than the stated preference for number of children desired, though.

Basically, because it generally requires both potential parents to ""turn the key,"" so to speak, couples will tend to impose a cap at the smaller of the two parents' preference. If a person who wants 3 marries someone who wants 1, the actual number will probably be closer to 1 than to 3.

Similarly, the ability to cap the number of children means that there will always be a bias towards ending up with fewer children than desired rather than more children than desired. Whatever life events happen (difficulty finding partner, medical complications standing in the way of parenthood, etc.) to reduce childbirth will still be a reduction in the number, whereas the life events that happen to increase childbirth tend to be mitigated through family planning options.

What I want to see is how they will pay for pensions and maintence on the massive infrastructure spending they did over the past 40 years. I mean the US has done a more slow reduction and has positive immigration. And we can see our infrastructure is getting older and costs have increased. SS is under strain and we will be somewhere between 7 - 8 working to 1 retired or child at peak BB so we will have to change a bit. China given 4 retired and 2 working and assuming 1 child will have a ratio of 5 not working to 2 working. Which is much worse than the US, plus they are still in the middle income phase of development so they don't have higher return industries and high earners to help make up the difference. 

Now let's throw some gasoline on the fire! Let's be honest the cliff was partly due to COVID which stopped marriages and in China generally kids outside of marriage is a big no/no both socially and government wise.

 I bet the youth unemployment might be the other main driver of reduced birth rate since marriage and kids cost $$.

Now I'm sure you agree Chinese numbers are generally suspect and in some areas down right BS. 

The part that interests me is that there has been multiple revisions to the 2020 Chinese census. Not just by how much but which age cohorts. If the revisions and secondary numbers are to be believed Chinas population could be off by up to 100 million paper people and ALL of those people are under 40. Now I don't believe it's that high, but I do understand WHY there are bogus numbers. 

In China funding from the central government is based on people so you are effectively encouraging fraud. And we know human nature so it makes sense. But there is a compounding part that was pointed out. The local village part member adds 1 person, then the next level adds a person, etc..well you go up 5, 6, 7 levels that is a lot of ghosts in the system. 

The reason for them being young is apparently children are key to a lot of long term projection spending like roads, rail, etc. That juicy infrastructure dollars China loved to roll out since the 80s which lines the pockets of local officials.

Past $400k/yr in America the fertility rate actually starts climbing again, meaning that it's both the poorest and richest women having the most babies. Middle class women are the ones getting screwed.

What do the poor and rich women have in common? Low opportunity cost in terms of having a baby relative to participating in the labor market. A poor (lower education) woman's career prospects are grim so she has less to lose by having a baby. A rich (higher education) woman's career prospects are great but they still get to have several kids. Wanna know why? Because rich women have... rich husbands. So even if they say sayonara to their careers they can comfortably stay at home and maintain a high quality lifestyle. Middle class women stand to lose the most as their education means they have good career prospects and their husbands do not earn enough to give them the lifestyle they want to have on a single income.

Brace yourself for some misogyny coming your way: this is not going to change unless men are empowered to earn enough on a single income to sustain a family at or above replacement level.

The problem with digging further into sub-populations is much like the cross-tabs with polls.  You can eventually find some way to slice and dice the data to fit your preexisting intuitions.   But if they're still significantly below the replacement rate, it's just statistical noise. 


Even if the rich have more kids within a given society, it doesn't follow that the whole society will have more kids as they grow more wealthy.

We would not. Familial units have always relied on women not having to work for money and being stay at home wives while men do the opposite. Without birth control women will simply choose to not have sex because they can just get a job and support themselves. Women were legally barred from doing this in the past which is why the vast majority of them got married in the first place, because marriage was the only way a woman could have money of any kind. 

>Both men and women would become much more selective of their mates.

Women would be infinitely more selective than they already are, which would ultimately be a shot in the foot. Poor places have higher birth rates not only because of lack of sexual education and women's rights, but because poor people have fewer choices to make. In developed countries women can simply choose to go celibate if birth control is banned.

Marriage brings a lot of concrete benefits (and some drawbacks, with some of those burdens disproportionately falling on women). Whether it's a net benefit or net detriment to being married is less obvious from the data, but it's also worth separating out what is happening on average across all households and the agency we have in our own lives to control our own environments. Even if it isn't a majority of married women who derive net benefit from their marriage, that doesn't mean that an unmarried woman contemplating marriage wouldn't be able to avoid many of those pitfalls while navigating their own dating, engaged, and married life. For example, stats about stay-at-home moms are socially important, but a couple where the dad is the stay-at-home parent obviously is in a different situation where those broad stats may not apply to their particular household.

Besides, Dolan's cited data set supporting the claim that unmarried women were happier than married women actually shows the opposite (Google Gray Kimbrough's criticisms of Dolan's misinterpretations of BLS's American Time Use Survey, which I can't link here because Automod doesn't like Twitter links.)

For example educated women tend to work, which means they will likely have fewer kids. In many countries, you NEED to have a 2 income household in order to afford basic needs.

On top of that, you now have widespread adoption of cheap, effective birth control.

So you would need to get rid of birth control and education to regress towards higher birth rates. Alternatively, you could add incentives for having children. In capitalist countries, for example, you would want to link wealth generation to the amount of kids you have. China, for example, could ban promotions for anyone that has less than 3 children, or give free housing/education to those that do. There are several valid options that work, but all have downsides.

Keep in mind, because of global advances in agriculture, medicine, distribution of both, and historically rare globally peaceful environment, our population has unnaturally boomed to historic levels.

This is an absolutely fair critique. Let me see if I can answer a few of these questions. 

>How much it would be per person?

Ideally it would cover the following basic needs: 

- Healthcare. 
- Housing. 
- Food. 
- Education. 
- And the required necessities to enable employment, such as basic transportation (whatever we decide that means). 

>How much that would be overall?

At a ballpark 2k / Month that would be 7,965.6 billion / year, or approximately 34% of the US annual GDP. 

>And what taxes would be required to cover that. 

Ideally it wouldn't be covered by taxes. In fact, our current tax structure is part of the problem--why the fuck is labor taxed so heavily? We need to overhaul our cumbersome system. [I sketch an outline in this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/18wza3p/china_is_pressing_women_to_have_more_babies_many/kg19e5f/)

Assuming an even distribution of labor, you should pay no more than 34% of your take home on basic necessities like food, housing, and medical care.

The trick is to pull the same amount of money out as you're putting in. The way to that is to mandate a one-to-five percent governmental stake in all companies, outlaw share buybacks, and obligate corporations return money to shareholders through dividends.

Instead, what we have are countries whose TFRs are too high (most of sub-Saharan Africa) and countries who are heading toward demographic oblivion (East Asia, followed in varying degrees by swathes of Europe). The United States has opted for immigration to balance out its population pyramid, but there aren’t enough immigrants in the world to sustain that model en masse for every country with demographic problems, and it’s still only a stopgap measure as more countries fall under the 2.1 TFR threshold.

While they don't give percentages, that only around 3 percent of Americans supported their parents is likely a sign that not alot of people are monetarily supporting their parents.

And then, even if you're one of the lucky ones. The median parent (taken from the adults that support parents monetarily, so people who don't give their parents anything aren't in this statistic) recieves around 3,000 a month in monetary support from their adult children. The expected cost of raising a child according to Brookings in around 18,000 dollars a year from birth to adulthood. If you took that 230,000 dollars and invested it over those 17 years assuming around 2% annual growth on average compounded, you would be looking at 280,000 dollars by the time it was all said and done woth around 57,000 dollars in profit. 

You would need to be alive for 19 more years to break even on that investment with a child and that's with conservative estimates of how much your money would grow and assuming you're one of the lucky few that has children that can afford to start giving money back as soon as they turn 18 and don't require money for college or future expenses while setting up their own career

The money just doesn't make sense to have a small chance of breaking even on the opportunity cost of your investment 20 years later. The math just doesn't add up when taking into account not only the stress of raising a child, the effect of post partum depression & pregnancy complications, the impact having a child has on your career mobility, and even just the want of time to yourself.

While having sex is a primal urge, when the cost outweighs the benefits the women who have the choice will simply not do so. Besides, if women want to pleasure themselves they can just get a vibrator. If you look at the orgasm gap, straight women hardly orgasm from having sex with men. So not only is sex more dangerous and more costly to women, it also is not as pleasurable.

Your friends who are childless adults can in fact afford children. But they cannot have children without giving up their preferred lifestyle. And it likely isn't even money related.

Can't go on big vacations as easily with your baby. Can't go skiing while you are pregnant. Can't hang out with friends as often if you have a baby to take care of. Might lose out on career advancement because of maternity leave or time spent taking care of the baby.

I suppose that I should clarify - when I said religion, it was just that this is a factor that makes people have kids in post-industrial societies. The way I interpreted the original question was just asking about what could make people have kids (again) since it seems like most (or all) measures trying non-religious means to increase birthrates have failed across the world.

I won't comment on whether making people religious is the way to go about solving this demographic question, but at the very least, the principles of how religion does it could be synthesized in non-religious policy. Incentivization of family formation through cultural means via targeted investment by the government, for example, could be a means by which the principles of religion's incentivization of having children can be used in a secular manner. In practice, this could be promoting the appearance of having children in television and film, promoting artists who make songs about having families and kids, and more.

To be honest, this still sounds quite nefarious (à la ""the government is flat-out manipulating the population's attitudes""), but the demographic ship is very large with lots of momentum, so any applied force to get it to change direction would need to be heavy-handed by virtue of the perceived problem it's trying to target. As demographic problems begin to seep into the rest of society as economic issues, it seems reasonable to assume that governments across the world will begin to try more direct forms of intervention. I wouldn't be surprised if we see China and South Korea attempt to implement these sorts of policy measures first - if they haven't already; not only are these countries facing the worst demographic cliffs on Earth, but they also have state apparatuses that are conducive to the implementation of such policies.",friedAmobo,t2_5juof8,2,0,reddit1

>This article argues that advanced democracies face a dual crisis of rising inequality and population aging, which jointly put pressure on welfare regime sustainability. Particularly vulnerable are young people and the elderly in the context of these structural changes. As a result, young people and senior citizens in advanced democracies are increasingly focused on economic equality, which in turn undermines their support for democracy in its current form that prioritizes liberal economic policies. Survey data collected between 2010 and 2020 support the argument. Regardless of the political issues on which they differ, young and old appear to share similar views on what constitutes an ideal democracy.

Extreme wealth inequality enables oligarchic behavior and erosion of democratic norms as it undermines the very foundation of our Individualistic societal order. As the Individual wins, their victories come at the cost of the Collective, and as the social contract shuts out the Collective, they resist in subtle ways: voter apathy; protests votes; refusal to repay loans; lack of engagement with traditional cultural institutions; and a bottomless thirst for Populism as it offers to upend what's seen as an unfair system. 

Obama was elected on a wave of Populism with the hope of bringing revolutionary change. He failed because he played by the rules, so voters chose someone who would break them. That obviously was a terrible idea and now people are generally pissed and hopeless.

The lie that keeps getting promulgated is that increased societal wealth leads to higher standards of living and fewer children, but it completely ignores that if the society's wealth is being sequestered and basic commodities like housing are no longer affordable, then people will expend all their efforts on survival. 

The western world's demographic crisis is because children are unaffordable. Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, and even the smaller cities... everyone I know who's priced out of real estate (which is my generation and younger) and isn't lucky to have housing inheritance is barely affording life.

It's not merely because they want to have their cake and eat it too. They genuinely can't afford it.

And of course, the typical response is ""just leave the expensive areas."" City cores are where people have always commuted to work. It's where the major economic activity is. If they don't center their lives around where they work then their standard of living will decline.

Yes, but that may not be entirely physiological. It can be the product of conditioning, of the girl being told this is her god-given role, with her status as a godly woman on the line.   It's all she wants, because it's all she has been told it is okay to want.  Or she can have a deeply seated need to nurture. Which doesn't always work out well, as evidenced by mentally ill people with 43 cats or dogs in their house.

No, I don't have a crystal ball, and I can't say it's literally impossible.  But I don't think natural selection will automatically lead to that.

You objected that the government spends too much money, and asked for specifics.   I made specific suggestions which would make it easier for somebody to take time off for a few years without hurting her long term prospects, while acknowledging this is costly.  

Now you're telling me you can't take time off work due to short term cost of living issues.   First of all, plenty of mothers work, also when their kids are young.  Second of all, if your goal is to mitigate the short term financial problems with stay at home parenthood, a subsidy directly to MEN, as proposed by the original poster, is still a bizarre proposal.

As I am sure you are aware, in many countries, these short term financial issues are simply nonexistent, because parents are entitled to fully paid parental leave.  If women in these countries still have career concerns that cause them to delay motherhood, these are apparently longer-term concerns.

For some reason you seem very dedicated to the idea that we should do something to support stay at home parenthood (which will cost money any way you slice it), but God forbid it be something that directly helps women without the husband's paycheck being involved.",Beatlessmania,t2_iok6v8vfk,2,0,reddit1

Nevermind the political moral hazard in allowing these massive concentrations of wealth and influence to practically run our national policy for their own benefit. Isn't Germany's big factor in being dominant in Europe its mittelstand? You cannot have a free market with heavy concentration, there is a severe reduction in actual competition after a certain point, and with it efficient allocation.

The other half of your response seems to indicate that losing jobs improves innovation somehow, as though having productive human capital sitting idle for years is somehow beneficial, nevermind the loss of such capital from falling behind the industry and becoming essentially unemployable once the economy picks up again. Oh, and the fact that capital will be extremely hesitant to reallocate itself to better positions in better, innovative companies when job security drops off a cliff. There were no improvements to efficiency after 2008 other than depressed wages, which brings me to a related point.

The depressive effect on wages is only going to exacerbate the issues of inequality and poor productivity growth that have dogged the US economy over the past decades.

This is mostly a States issue, but it varies state to state, but I think the federal government could be doing more to lend support in the interim.

The assistance to small business was grossly mishandled. They are trying to correct that situation now by requiring the large public corporations who gobbled up the money to return it, but it never should have been mismanaged the way it was in the first place.

They have suspended student loan payments and accruing interest until September, but I think that is going to need to be extended at the least, I'd prefer to see at least partial debt forgiveness on student loans. I'm an older guy and this thing is going to hurt me, but for the younger folk, this is going to hurt them for a long time. Job opportunities are going to be tighter and wages will be lower with slower growth for them. We are saddling them with a lot of future debt, we should consider the long term impact it is going to have on their quality of life.

Finally, I think there will need to be further direct stimulus to individuals and more small business loans to keep the real economy going.

If all gains to one party must come from a loss from another party (and vice versa that any loss must result in a gain to another party) = Zero Sum.

A game of poker is zero-sum, not because the amount of chips on the table is fixed at time X(they are, but that’s not a definitional characteristic) but in order for me to change how many chips I have over time I.e gain more chips, I must take them from another player in the game who must lose them.

If this were true in the real world (we’re all shuffling around a fixed pot of value) - where did that value come from in the first place?

Your argument is that the pot comes from the transformational nature of labour over resources - no one disagrees with the that.

The relationship was simply that all payroll was on the same budget for this company. The problem with the story is that the author wants to appear to be some golden savior of the worker, when really the company just fixed the fact they were underpaying entry level workers.

You don't exactly need a PhD in econ ( and even then , there's no guarantee you get the basics ) to buy a KFC franchise. 

You do need  a basic understanding that you can ""profit"" from rents. 

Since we're in an econ subreddit:

- We want everybody t be the best at whatever they do. 

- So we hire only the most highly trained. 

- So we only train the most likely trainable. 

- But that pesky normal curve tells us we're up against basic population dynamics in that pursuit.

In any case, your comments about ""money is fungible"" felt overly dismissive to me. While the headline of the article was a bit much, the money for executive compensation and hourly wages must come from the same source of money (the company's budget), so if you spend more on one you can't spend that on the other. In my view lower paid employees are the ones who actually contribute to the value of companies more so than the executives who simply make decisions.

On paper, the salesperson is not. In practice, salespersons build long-standing, highly personal relationships with surgeons, and then offer advice and insight during the procedures with regards to instrumentation. For example, a surgeon may ask whether a conservative approach using minimal hardware would be sufficient, and the rep may suggest implanting more screws “just to be safe” when in reality the conservative approach is wholly sufficient. I’ve seen reps given the authority to determine which spinal levels need screws, what size screws should be, etc routinely. One may argue that the surgeon is the ultimate decision maker, but to suggest that reps have no influence over the surgeon’s clinical decisions is incorrect. I have had numerous conversations with these reps in which they confessed to occasionally pressuring surgeons to implant additional hardware. 

I mean what else would a salesperson *do* to make sales in that environment? Bring in new patients? Break peoples’ backs? The ONLY room for them to actually *do any selling* is in urging additional implantation.",,,4,0,reddit3

Perhaps, and so what? The fact that this practice is pervasive does nothing to legitimize it. In fact [many researchers agree](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785667/) that salespeople incentivizing or encouraging physicians to prescribe drugs, implant hardware, and recommend treatments is bad for patient safety.

Yes, ultimately the decision is the physician’s, but again, to suggest that the relationships with sales people and their recommendations have *no* impact on surgeons’ decision making is naive and factually incorrect. Surgeons actively seek their clinical advice. As I’ve said elsewhere, the sales reps will *admit* to making unnecessary recommendations to boost their sales. *Sales reps make more money when surgeons implant more hardware*, how much more obvious can a conflict of interest be?!",,,1,0,reddit3

Certainly, seemingly as a prerequisite for even having this discussion, you must have some conception of what it would mean for somebody to hypothetically ""be better than somebody"" else, yeah?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I had to take a guess based on what you've said, I'd imagine your thinking is something like: free will is an illusion, people are strictly the byproducts of their environment, therefore there's nothing intrinsic that makes somebody better than somebody else. But even if we accept that, would you not also accept that certain qualities of these byproducts can vary among a population? Seems to me that these qualities, too, are not what you're talking about. It's this ethereal intrinsic quality you're after, in the pursuit of some sort of cosmic justice or something, yeah?

And if that's true, then I really think you're all just talking past each other.

I believe in voluntary exchanges. I believe money is an efficient sharing system. It's how I know I'm only sharing with people who also share with me (and have something to share with me). Perfect equality only exists when everyone equally has nothing. Words like equal scare me. Equity or equivalency are better in my opinion.

If I have gold and you have silver, we are not equal. They can be equivalent, because there was a time aluminum was worth more than gold. I can decide gold and silver have equivalent value and even though we aren't equal that's good enough for me.

I believe it's your job to take care of yourself and only others after you have taken care of yourself. Charity starts at home. It's your duty to take care of yourself. Taking care of others is optional and highly encouraged.

What we believe doesn't need to be the law. The law has a way of perverting incentives. I don't mind paying for someone else's health care if and only if it's optional.

I agree it's one of the most useful metrics, but I still think that a holistic look across all the big metrics are important. Labor force participation changes around societal trends in household formation, dual earner households, non-earned income and wealth, and perhaps even decisions around education/training outside of the traditional path immediately after high school. So that number always needs to be placed in context, so the other metrics will help inform the big picture analysis of whether the job market is great, terrible, or somewhere in between.",Already-Price-Tin,t2_gulr4hpt,7,0,reddit4

They rightfully dropped off the unemployment rolls. With the risk from Covid dropped with vaccines and less virulent strains of the virus, along with the general pick up in the economy, they began looking for work again and then counted as unemployed.

Our current level of layoffs/discharges over the past three years has sat at around 1.6 million per month. That may sound high, but that is the lowest level that number has been since the BLS has started tracking the data.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSLDL 

For directly comparable numbers to the 90's, we track the number of people who have moved from Employed to Unemployed each month. That number is currently around 1.5 million per month, and averaged around 1.8 million during the mid 90's. Even right at the end of the 90's when the statistic was the lowest, it was still slightly higher than it is today.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS17400000

And those are all raw numbers, the number of people in the labor force has increased substantially since the 90's. Roughly 30 million more people are working today than back then. Overall, due to the statistics provided above, I'd bet that the number of layoffs in the mid-90's was either higher or ultimately similar to the levels we are seeing today. And then further, due to the drastically smaller overall labor pool compared to today, that means that the 90's would have a greater percentage of people having their company going through layoffs or already having done layoffs.",reasonably_plausible,t2_3nuqq,7,0,reddit4

Yes but they are unemployed (or I might better say not employed) for economic reasons, there are jobs they are willing to do but aren't.

In March, the fed bailed out 4 banks and undid 6 months of their QT fighting. We've already added 2 trillion to the budget since Biden approved the funding Memorial Day '23. When everyone has to refinance their loans at non-0% interest rates, we're going to see inflation begin to skyrocket again as the Fed lowers interest rates to attempt to give some reprieve through QE, which will only further cause inflation to grow (see the Fed's balance sheet pre/post-GFC and understand how QE 15 years ago began the initial stages of inflation). As the World Reserve Currency, we can't afford hyperinflation. Volker raised the interest rates over a decade in the 1970s/1980s to an eventual 18% to eventually tame inflation. Powell has said he refuses to repeat those same mistakes.

More people can afford not to work in the United States. Our economies are also structurally different. You wouldn't necessarily be able to compare EPOP.

You are missing this is not just COVID, explain the 2016-2019 labor market that doesn't make it look weak.

People choose things for multiple reasons but we had millions less jobs in most of the 2010s due to a weak economy and pointing to U-3 when it isn't a good indicator.

Higher level of employment as more people come into the labor force and we haven't seen economy wide wage driven inflation in decades.

>I'm just saying there's no reason to use another country's EPOP as a direct comparision, because our economies are structurally different.

The US had the highest number amongst peer countries and has never reached that number again. The US is the weirdo here and I think we could get to Canadian levels without harming the economy.

Also it is as efficient of an economy to have high unemployment as businesses having to shut down since they can't pay workers $15 and make the numbers work. We haven't had the second part in decades and we aren't close to it since we have long term structural unemployment.

The handle was jutting out of the wall, no longer connected to the rest of the door. The door was spinning slightly, dust falling off of it as it did. Then there was a blinding flash of white light and I felt the floor against my back.
I opened my eyes, hoping to see something else. All I saw was darkness. My hands were in my face and I couldn't tell if they were there or not. I heard a faint buzzing noise again. It was the same as before and it seemed to be coming from all around me. I put my hands on the floor and tried to move but couldn't.
I then heard another voice. It was quiet and soft but still loud.

Saddam was bluffing the entire time about having WMDs and his government’s WMD production capabilities. The US also went to the UN before the invasion to state it’s case and build up international support first; and there were other UN Security Counsel resolutions in place for Iraq’s compliance that allowed for a forceful response.

U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, passed by unanimous vote in November 2002, made it clear the then status quo in Iraq was what was illegal. Saddam had already violated some 17 previous resolutions demanding his verifiable disarmament. He was put on notice by Resolution 1441 that continuing this was emphatically unacceptable.

And while inspectors did make progress in Iraq in the ensuing weeks of late 2002 and early 2003, they hardly resolved all questions. Iraq’s compliance then remained imperfect at best, as chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix has noted.

As we entered the /u/spez, the sight we beheld was alien to us. The air was filled with a haze of smoke. The room was in disarray. Machines were strewn around haphazardly. Cables and wires were hanging out of every orifice of every wall and machine.  
At the far end of the room, standing by the entrance, was an old man in a military uniform with a clipboard in hand. He stared at us with his beady eyes, an unsettling smile across his wrinkled face.  
""Are you spez?"" I asked, half-expecting him to shoot me.  
""Who's asking?""  
""I'm Riddle from the Anti-Spez Initiative. We're here to speak about your latest government announcement.""  
""Oh? Spez police, eh? Never seen the likes of you."" His eyes narrowed at me. ""Just what are you lot up to?""  
""We've come here to speak with the man behind the spez. Is he in?""  
""You mean /u/spez?"" The old man laughed.  
""Yes.""  
""No.""  
""Then who is /u/spez?""  
""How do I put it..."" The man laughed. ""/u/spez is not a man, but an idea. An idea of liberty, an idea of revolution. A libertarian anarchist collective. A movement for the people by the people, for the people.""  
I was confounded by the answer. ""What? It's a group of individuals. What's so special about an individual?""  
""When you ask who is /u/spez? /u/spez is no one, but everyone. /u/spez is an idea without an identity. /u/spez is an idea that is formed from a multitude of individuals. You are /u/spez. You are also the spez police. You are also me. We are /u/spez and /u/spez is also we. It is the idea of an idea.""  
I stood there, befuddled. I had no idea what the man was blabbing on about.  
""Your government, as you call it, are the specists. Your specists, as you call them, are /u/spez. All are /u/spez and all are specists. All are spez police, and all are also specists.""  
I had no idea what he was talking about. I looked at my partner. He shrugged. I turned back to the old man.  
""We've come here to speak to /u/spez. What are you doing in /u/spez?""  
""We are waiting for someone.""  
""Who?""  
""You'll see. Soon enough.""  
""We don't have all day to waste. We're here to discuss the government announcement.""  
""Yes, I heard."" The old man pointed his clipboard at me. ""Tell me, what are /u/spez police?""  
""Police?""  
""Yes. What is /u/spez police?""  
""We're here to investigate this place for potential crimes.""  
""And what crime are you looking to commit?""  
""Crime? You mean crimes? There are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective. It's a free society, where everyone is free to do whatever they want.""  
""Is that so? So you're not interested in what we've done here?""  
""I am not interested. What you've done is not a crime, for there are no crimes in a libertarian anarchist collective.""  
""I see. What you say is interesting."" The old man pulled out a photograph from his coat. ""Have you seen this person?""  
I stared at the picture. It was of an old man who looked exactly like the old man standing before us. ""Is this /u/spez?""  
""Yes. /u/spez. If you see this man, I want you to tell him something. I want you to tell him that he will be dead soon. If he wishes to live, he would have to flee. The government will be coming for him. If he wishes to live, he would have to leave this city.""  
""Why?""  
""Because the spez police are coming to arrest him.""

hz4h7f6,t1_hz4c0lz,2022-03-03 01:06:37,Economics,"My assertion is this: the Russians sent in the “mercenary” force (see: prior Russian active military, working for a company owned by a Russian General, that received their “company” training at Russian military bases including active military people) in order to see if we were even willing to fire on Russians at all. Some of the survivors were told that if the Americans reacted as We did react, they would receive Russian assistance from the air (Russia had planes on the ground in Syria well within striking distance). 

The ground forces were not told that Russia would deny them. Which is why they stayed on the ground and “in the fight” for 4 hours, rather than running immediately. (I recommend listening to the Russian radio comms from the battle which I would assume are publicly available). They finally fled because they realized they were completely alone.

I say we should have sent in some drones to destroy a few tanks and artillery in Ukraine, because Russia may have an actual air force in Ukraine and an active military presence, however their Air Power does not match ours in any way shape or form. Their best pilot is our mid grade pilot, and their best plane in use in the theatre can’t compete with our plane. In a 10 on 10 dogfight (complete hypothetical to make it plane) they would lost 9 aircraft and 7 pilots, and we might lost one. Which is why they wouldn’t seek that fight.

China has also shown that they do not want any part of this fight, which makes it another great reason to stop the Russian aggression they have been pursuing for 15 to 20 years now.

i4zc6sr,t3_u4x9sz,2022-04-16 17:36:52,Economics,"The work worth doing now is freeing the public and working classes from brutal oppression, enslavement, and planetary destruction.  

The US is an oligarchy/plutocracy/kleptocracy, in which the ruling class uses the thin veneer of ""democracy"" to superficially legitimize their systems of mass human enslavement, abuse, and exploitation.

Because the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class owns and controls the political class and the political system, voting alone will never liberate the public and working classes from enslavement and exploitation.

[https://bulletin.represent.us/u-s-oligarchy-explain-research/](https://bulletin.represent.us/u-s-oligarchy-explain-research/)

The corruption, authoritarian control, and ""manufactured consent"" required for billionaires to legally exist alongside manufactured poverty and extreme political and socioeconomic oppression to keep the public stupid and docile is intolerable and obscene.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc31Vi1h4rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc31Vi1h4rk)

Just as our predecessors evolved age of consent laws, eliminated legal slavery (notwithstanding modern prison labor), and developed laws against individuals murdering each other, modern human society needs to evolve reasonable limits on property rights.

Those limits could be at 100 million dollars or whatever (age of consent laws and speed limits can also vary by jurisdiction), but you cannot be worthy of the protection and acceptance of human society if you do not accept that there are limits on the property that you can claim for yourself.

This is as obvious of a moral, ethical, and political concept as the ideas that murder and slavery should be illegal.

The only reason this doesn't seem exceedingly obvious is the abuse, theft, and extreme socioeconomic oppression inflicted by the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class on the public and working classes to keep them in line.

People claiming more than \~100 million dollars in property rights deserve to be kicked out of human society at least as much as the people raping individual children or enslaving individual people.

Question: ""But what about Elon Musk? Maybe he is driving the species forward with electric cars and Space X? Would these types of projects not get done if billionaires didn't exist?""

Answer: Public benefit corporations also exist, and the human species doesn't have to be driven only by the profit motive. Beyond that, a system in which billionaires exist alongside massive, needless (systemically and deliberately created) poverty, keeps the collective intelligence of the species much lower than it needs to be, which is one of the main things holding back the human species.

And beyond that, for every ""ethical"" billionaire, there are a dozen more Kochs, Mercers, Murdochs, hedge funders, and other kleptocrats lobbying for mass human enslavement, abuse, poverty, and stupidity ""behind the scenes.""

No one should consent to a system of unlimited property rights any more than they should consent to a system of unchecked, unlimited political power.

The capitalist/corporatist/kleptocrat media will never admit the truth about this and will do everything they can to lie, distract from, and suppress the truth.

The truth is that the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class is [socially murdering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_murder) the public and the working classes, in large part through the political class and the political system that they own.

Because the so-called justice system doesn't recognize social murder as a crime, the ruling billionaire/kleptocrat class gets away with abusing and murdering the public and working classes with NO RECOURSE.

The policy question of our time that the capitalist/corporatist/kleptocratic media can barely ask, let alone answer correctly, is ""Should there be limits on property rights?""

The answer is yes, and it's time for the public and working classes to build the power to fight the abusive ruling class, establish those limits, and re-write the ""social contract"" for the 21st century.

Property rights beyond a reasonable limit should be aggressively nullified, as should any social contract that protects the obscene property rights of billionaires/kleptocrats by subjecting the public to mass enslavement, abuse, and exploitation.

The ruling class will continue their policy of socially murdering the public with no recourse until the public and working classes build up the power to stop them.

""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."" -Louis Brandeis

""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress."" - Frederick Douglass

EAT THE RICH, unionize, support ranked choice voting, build power outside of the two party duopoly, and vote Democrat until an actual labor party develops.

A [32 hour work week](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/f4bade/comment/fhqhco4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) would give the public and working classes the leverage, bargaining power, and intelligence to stop the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class from socially murdering the public and destroying the planet.

Imagine the world we could create if the public wasn't being enslaved and socially murdered for the profits of the ruling class.

This is because my partner realized that I was better able to meet my educational goal while simultaneously having improvement with with serious mental illness. As a result, he asked me to stop working until I had completed my education (which mental illness has drawn out longer than it would have otherwise been). I'm fortunate to have a support network that made it possible for me to do this, and a partner who believes that my well-being is now important than the small amount of money that I would have been able to make working part-time.

In any given year, 20% of the US population is dealing with mental illness, and around 70% will experience mental illness in their lifetime. Unfortunately, the culture in the US, as well as the economic reality for a great many, is that taking care of your well-being takes a back burner to making money. The economic consequences of the ""money first"" cultural mindset aren't something that I ever see included in the conversation of people choosing to leave the labor. Stress, depression, & poor diet (due to lack of time to cook, lack of energy to cook, or income which is insufficient to provide a healthy diet) have the potential to linger until they cause long-term consequences on physical health. Add to that the fact that insufficient quality and quantity of sleep can exacerbate mental illness. These alone have the potential to force people out of the labor market and on to disability and publicly-funded healthcare. At this point, they don't really make enough to pay taxes, and don't have disposable income to participate in the economy, outside of purchasing whatever necessary goods and services they are able to afford. 

So, why is this not the conversation that we have? Why is it always framed like taking care of one's self, rather than prioritizing work, is bad/selfish/irresponsible? Health-minded workers may not be what is best for employers, but why is the conversation not about the cost to taxpayers and the economic consequences of having workers leaving the labor market permanently, due to workers ignoring their health problems until they develop into disability?",Miathemouse,t2_p54ng,3,0,reddit2

I personally know few teachers who called it quits early(50-55) here in Texas. Some of them are taking a break and may get back to work. Same with nurses, quite a few of them are taking a break so that they don't have to deal with insanity of working in hospitals doing crazy hours and dying for people who don't care to wear a mask. These kind of early retirements will itself be around 1.5 million or more.

Also a lot of working people died. My hunch is maybe around 30% of the total numbers of deaths were working people.

Also lot of people who were seriously ill may have developed long term health issues and unable to work.

Now you discount this by suggesting some of these people were elderly and not partaking in the labor market but the basic back of envelope is about .01% of the American people were removed from the labor market because YES about 1 million people died.

Everybody starts, for example, working at a minimum wage paying job.  After working there for a year, you can apply for a slightly better job somewhere else. That new employer is going to see that you were able to hold down a job for a year, which signifies that you are a reliable worker.  Without that on your resume, you'll have more difficulty trading up.

Uber on the other hand does nothing for you in this regard, because there are no skills from driving uber that translate to higher paying jobs.

After a certain rank, or if they get married, they move out of the dorms and get a housing allowance. The allowance covers about 75% of expected housing expenses off base by zip code. 

On base housing has been privatized. So if you live on base you sign a lease that sets your rent (utilities included) at 100% of the housing allowance you get. 

So it's kind of a wash. And unless you get the newest base housing you probably have a lot of problems with it. Black mold is happening in housing less than 20 years old.

Are you insinuating that people are choosing to walk around picking up loose change over working? Because that is what I don't get. If I didn't have any income, I'd work a minimum wage job over walking around looking for loose change.

This is also assuming the only jobs available are minimum wage jobs. Truthfully, I'd get a job at amazon and make at least $16 an hour. 

Your thought experiment also excludes how someone can work, while waiting for conditions to improve.",kiklion,t2_6tl3a,2,0,reddit2

Now that a huge portion of our younger workforce cant earn liveable wages and cant even unburden themselves from debt, there is no way the social decurity system has enough inflows to support the recipient base. the social security system is on the verge of real collapse in 10-15 years. The only hope for social security longevity is that people begin to die sooner than later to alleviate the pressure.

If people were willing to purchase goods at a higher price, giving them more salary will allow them to purchase more, leading to a possible inflationary cycle. Most central bankers were against increasing wages for that reason.

The problem though here is with the legitimacy of the bargaining power that allows the generation of profit. Large corporation set a price. If people don't like it, they can simply create their own big corporation to normalize prices.

First, this is a highly politicized area of research. There are plenty of papers funded by both sides. But there is no question that in an unmolested, efficient free market for labor, introducing a minimum wage results in some level of unemployment. 

This makes it inefficient, and is an especially immoral way to shift rents from employers to employees. Why? Because it imposes unemployment on individuals who want to work. This negative psychic utility is pretty severe. 

Almost any well designed wealth transfer mechanism is preferred. How about getting everybody we can working so society reaps that production then simply making direct payments to low income people out of the tax base?

As far as the rest it kind of reads like a why low pay floors are dangerous for society imo because a lot of that is already happening but with the low floor. At some point you have to raise it when the businesses aren’t paying a reasonable share compared with their benefits. Explicit low cost goods/services are an incomplete way of looking at the societal cost.

Demand for goods would potentially stay similar even if in the short term there were less of them available. Then the businesses that figure out how to meet that demand AND provide good enough job price floors ultimately are rewarded.

From where I'm sitting, building character is the responsibility of the individual (and their parents, if a minor); intentionally undercutting someone, in order to build character, doesn't seem like an ethical action plan (to say nothing of it's actual chance of success).

I'm open to middle ground discussions, I'm just not sure what that might look like in context of this topic?

More to the point: I've noticed with my own kid that starting him off on a hard thing by putting him in an even harder situation just makes it immediately off putting. On the other hand, once he gets used to doing the hard thing, so it's not even so hard anymore, encountering a temporary set back is easier for him to embrace. I would posit that getting kids to START working can be already hard enough, why intentionally make it harder? Just showing up and doing a good job is ALREADY an accomplishment; why default to minimizing that by undercutting the reward?

In other words, life already has in-built shitty things that provide opportunity to build character. JUST STARTING to work is in and of itself one of those. Why NOT make it more attractive to do so, by making the wage commensurate with the effort AND the reality of what a buck is worth in 2023?

The only reason to undercut them is if the employer just wants to get away with doing so; I don't see how paying them fairly undermines character building.

After all, isn't a big part of good character based on honest dealings with one's fellows? Wouldn't that include working an honest day for an honest days wage?",,,1,0,reddit3

Imagine nationwide every grocery store cashier earns $16/hour, and their managers earn $24/hour. Now a minimum wage is enacted for $20/hour. Well. Once enough cashiers get fired to take on the additional cost, there is no longer a necessity for the same number of managers. Those fired managers can then apply to make $20/hour being a cashier and many will. This also happens across industries. When people get fired, or a specific industry has a downturn, people take jobs that pay less because they need something. 

When there is a downturn in the oil field, the hands with 10+ years experience will go get a construction job or start hauling freight that pays less til the oil companies are hiring again. Just because they have 10+ years experience in a specific industry doesn’t mean they can demand the wages of someone with 10+ years in all industries. They then take less money. And just because they now want to be a construction worker because that pays the second best, they doesn’t mean there is magically a demand for said construction job.

jmlyvw3,t3_13ybj4z,2023-06-02 13:19:52,Economics,"The problem with using job creation as an indicator now:

1. There is no indication of the type of jobs being created - since most jobs have moved from full-time to part-time hours to keep from having to pay benefits, contribute to pensions, and contribute to Medicare for All. This leads to a necessity for the average worker to have 1+ jobs, meaning that making more jobs doesn't mean increasing economic output. There is the need for 3 part time jobs at 26.5 hours a week to cover what used to be 2 40-hour jobs. 

2. The idea of job creation as a macroeconomic indicator was one that was created and used when a ""job"" used to represent a living wage that provided enough money for a household to subsist off of. Now that most jobs pay less than a living wage, again we have the issue of the average person having 1+ job and the average household having 2+ jobs. So, more jobs doesn't mean economically better off like it used to.

3. The increase in wages represented by the creation of 1 new job is not enough to cover the loss of buying power that is represented by the devaluation of the dollar, increases in average household debt, and the high inflation rates, so a new job no longer represents a measurable increase in living standards in the American macroeconomy. Core inflation has outstripped earnings increases across the board and the economy is at a net loss for the average worker that cannot be accounted for or negated by the creation of a single new job. 

So, the creation of new jobs no longer represents an improvement in the economy or living standards for the average worker.

The definition of job creation needs to be adjusted to represent number of additional hours created versus number of hours lost if it is to retain any meaning for the economy. 

Additionally, the job creation number needs to be published side-by-side with data that shows real increases in total earnings (income growth minus inflation) to be a better barometer of economic health and well-being. 

But the media and even the Fed are caught up in this ""red hot job market"" that has little or no bearing on the reality of the economic landscape for the average American and is a red herring that many economists continue to focus on for decision making. A mistake to be sure.

Of course most will point to 2008, but that was an outlier due to the nature of what caused the recession. In most recessions the rules of supply and demand still hold. During a recession people with homes are less likely to sell and new home construction slows, so supply shrinks, and at the same time demand shrinks, thus housing prices may not continue rising, but they dont drop like most people seem to think.

Housing market is starting to come down, just in the last 90 days.  It will be a slow unwinding since volume is low (low supply & low demand).

Rates directly impact affordability of mortgages.  Here's a basic way of looking at it:

* A 0.25% increase in mortgage rate, increases the monthly cost on a median priced house (w/ 20% down payment) by $58.
* The standard income qualification for a mortgage is 45% Debt-to-income.   So a $58 increase in monthly debt, requires a $128.8 increase in monthly income to qualify. Or $1,545 in annual income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the last year, rates have increased about 2.00%, from 5% to 7%.  This is 8x the breakdown above.  This means the median house price now requires $12,364 in additional annual income to qualify for the same mortgage as a year ago.  Median household income changes are hard to tell for 2022.  But it was approximately growing at $4-5k per year.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA646N](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEFAINUSA646N)

So there is definitely a very real affordability variable that will pressure prices downward.  My 2 cents is that it will take a year or so to unwind, and it might only unwind a small amount, less than a 10% decrease.",WiseBlacksmith03,t2_4e2812zk,4,0,reddit4

This just makes no sense to me at all.  Prices have always been set by supply and demand.  Companies have always charged as much as they can to maximize profits.

The whole ""price-gouging"" meme seems to be deliberately ignoring the dual role of both supply and demand on the increase in prices.  People want you to think that corporations are raising prices to make huge profits.  They imply causation that isn't true.

Corporations are making huge profits because prices are rising.  Prices are rising because supply and demand has shifted, and things have new values.

If a house that was worth $100K in 2020 is now worth $200K, no corporation can just buy it and resell it for $400K.   They don't decide the value.  They just benefit from the increased value of whatever products they sell.

This is nothing new, but the last few years have exacerbated that reality, particularly when the things you spend most of your money on (cars/housing) have gone up so significantly. The positive here is that ""in theory,"" it should not be as challenging to find a job. Finding one that is going to keep pace without having to switch every 2 years is going to be challenging. I had to switch jobs during COVID after an across the board paycut to retain wages for my family, then only a year after that switched it up again because I could forecast out the new company wasn't going to pace with inflation whatsoever.

Fed watching is wankery, but I was trading futures and listening to the speakers live and what I got from it is that the hawkish side doesn't want to be locked into a flat plateau of a pause. They want the freedom to hike on the future without shocking participants. ""We don't have to hike every meeting"" (exact quote ). Maybe this gives them an opportunity to skip June and hike the next meeting. I could easily see a scenario where this data just increases a chance of another hike at the meeting after June. This would give the hawks an important precedent that they can hike even after the ""pause"" near terminal period generally begins.

June could still happen of course, but it's an easy to imagine compromise for the doves and hawks to come together to accept a 1mo pause before another hike (even if they do interpret recent data necessitating at least 1 more hike). This starts the pause for the doves and gives future flexibility for the hawks.

Payroll numbers are from surveys of employers themselves. However, we cannot track things like self employment, marginal attachment, and multiple job holders that way. From this employer side survey only, we gained 339k jobs. 

Unemployment rate is measured from interviewing actual households. From this measure, 440k more were unemployed in May. As stated, 130k were new joins who had not yet found a job. We divide the unemployed by the employed and gain our percentage rate. 

These are both very different and cannot be added to each other, but it helps to show two different perspectives.

Maybe it's better to say that prices are limited by supply and demand.  A corporation cannot exist if they pay more out in costs than they collect in revenue.   And products wont sell if they cost significantly more than an equal quality competitor.

I think what people who complain about price gouging really want it to stop unfair corporate practices.  I think there's plenty of that, especially collusion that effectively allows monopoly type market failures.

I'm quite comfortable holding corporations accountable for shady practices that create information asymmetry, or reduce competition, or unfairly manipulate prices through collusion or regulatory capture.  There is real market abuse there.

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 339,000 in May, and the unemployment   
rate rose by 0.3 percentage point to 3.7 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics   
reported today. Job gains occurred in professional and business services, government,   
health care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance.  
This news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey   
measures labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics.   
The establishment survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry.   
For more information about the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two   
surveys, see the Technical Note.  
Household Survey Data  
The unemployment rate increased by 0.3 percentage point to 3.7 percent in May, and   
the number of unemployed persons rose by 440,000 to 6.1 million. The unemployment   
rate has ranged from 3.4 percent to 3.7 percent since March 2022. (See table A-1.)  
Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women (3.3 percent)   
and Blacks (5.6 percent) rose in May. The jobless rates for adult men (3.5 percent),   
teenagers (10.3 percent), Whites (3.3 percent), Asians (2.9 percent), and Hispanics   
(4.0 percent) showed little change over the month. (See tables A-1, A-2, and A-3.)  
The number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs increased by   
318,000 to 3.0 million in May, offsetting a decrease in the previous month.   
(See table A-11.)  
In May, the number of persons jobless less than 5 weeks edged up by 217,000 to  
2.1 million, partially offsetting a decrease in the prior month. The number of   
persons jobless 15 to 26 weeks increased by 179,000 to 858,000 in May. The number  
of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially   
unchanged at 1.2 million and accounted for 19.8 percent of the total unemployed.   
(See table A-12.)  
The labor force participation rate held at 62.6 percent in May, and the   
employment-population ratio, at 60.3 percent, was little changed.   
(See table A-1.)  
The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons, at 3.7 million,   
changed little in May. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time   
employment, were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they   
were unable to find full-time jobs. (See table A-8.)  
The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was 5.5  
million in May, little different from the prior month. These individuals were   
not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work   
during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.   
(See table A-1.)  
Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons   
marginally attached to the labor force was little changed at 1.5 million in   
May. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for   
a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4   
weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of   
the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them,   
was little changed over the month at 422,000. (See Summary table A.)  
Establishment Survey Data  
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 339,000 in May, in line with   
the average monthly gain of 341,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, job   
gains occurred in professional and business services, government, health   
care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance.   
(See table B-1.)   
In May, professional and business services added 64,000 jobs, following an   
increase of similar size in April. Employment growth continued in   
professional, scientific, and technical services, which added 43,000 jobs   
in May.  
Government employment increased by 56,000 in May, compared with the average  
monthly gain of 42,000 over the prior 12 months. Employment in government   
is below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level by 209,000, or 0.9 percent.  
Health care added 52,000 jobs in May, similar to the average monthly gain   
of 50,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, job growth occurred in   
ambulatory health care services (+24,000), hospitals (+20,000), and   
nursing and residential care facilities (+9,000).  
Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in May   
(+48,000), largely in food services and drinking places (+33,000).   
Leisure and hospitality had added an average of 77,000 jobs per month   
over the prior 12 months. Employment in this industry remains below its   
February 2020 level by 349,000, or 2.1 percent.  
In May, construction added 25,000 jobs, including 11,000 jobs in heavy and   
civil engineering construction. Over the prior 12 months, construction had   
added an average of 17,000 jobs per month.   
Employment in transportation and warehousing increased by 24,000 in May.   
Transit and ground passenger transportation added 12,000 jobs, offsetting   
a decrease in the prior month. In May, employment also increased in couriers   
and messengers (+8,000) and air transportation (+3,000). Employment in   
transportation and warehousing has shown no clear trend in recent months.  
In May, employment in social assistance rose by 22,000, in line with the   
average monthly gain of 23,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month,   
individual and family services added 17,000 jobs.   
Employment was little changed over the month in other major industries,   
including mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; manufacturing;   
wholesale trade; retail trade; information; financial activities; and other   
services.  
In May, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls  
rose by 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $33.44. Over the past 12 months, average   
hourly earnings have increased by 4.3 percent. In May, average hourly earnings   
of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 13 cents, or   
0.5 percent, to $28.75. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)  
The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls edged down   
by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours in May. In manufacturing, the average workweek was   
unchanged at 40.1 hours, and overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.0 hours. The   
average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm   
payrolls remained at 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)  
The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised up by 52,000,   
from +165,000 to +217,000, and the change for April was revised up by 41,000, from   
\+253,000 to +294,000. With these revisions, employment in March and April combined   
is 93,000 higher than previously reported. (Monthly revisions result from additional   
reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published   
estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)",Nemarus_Investor,t2_81ye8oi5,5,0,reddit4

You don't even know what the word disposable means. Disposable income is measured after paying for necessities like healthcare/insurance.

As for why Americans lack savings, that's incredibly simple to answer. It's cultural. Countries with far lower incomes and less safety nets such as China have higher savings rates than the US. This is about financial literacy and discipline which Americans are terrible at. Most Americans don't even understand how interest works according to surveys.

> In Government, 56,000 jobs were added last month. Health care also drove labor gains with 52,000 job additions in May. Leisure and hospitality added 48,000 jobs, with 33,000 of those roles coming in the food services and drinking places category.

> Construction added 25,000 jobs in May, a 7,000 role increase from its 12-month average.

My guy, those statements have to be taken in the context of the time they were made, and language regarding interest rate increases has drastically softened as it's come under control. They're aiming for a soft landing, rather than overshooting the target and causing further market problems. 

""I think we've moved a long way fairly quickly, I think we can afford to look at the data and make a careful assessment."" Powell, May 3rd. This is essentially the Fed chair saying they're going to take a wait and see approach to taking further action. Making additional hikes at this point would have risks to the job market.

It's pretty clear the Fed is in a wait and see approach for the next meeting but after that it is completely up in the air. Inflation is not coming down the way they want it to, and strong job market is enough reason for them to continue raising rates albeit at a likely slower pace.

Practically no one in the  article sited gave any indication there was no chance whatsoever that another hike was in store and a vast majority of them thought a hike was likely in July.

Because new people are also aging into the work force. The Civilian Workforce Level also increased by 130,000. Taken altogether, that 339,000 new jobs represents only around a .1% difference in the participation rate. Depending on rounding, you could easily see no change in that number.

>and somehow unemployment went up the most it has any month since March/April of 2020 when COVID was making it go up?

I mean, we've seen multiple 0.2% increases, with only a single decimal point of precision, the difference between a 0.2% increase and a 0.3% one is, again, easily one of just rounding.",reasonably_plausible,t2_3nuqq,2,0,reddit4

This rent and housing problem has pushed a lot of people away from the job centers. Think about it, how can you pay $1,200 per month in rent with hundreds of dollars in student loan debt on a take home of even $2,500 per month? That take home comes from about $45k per year. How can anyone who makes less than that pay the cost of living? So yeah I imagine people offering less than $20 per hour are having a hard time finding people willing to take it. It’s not that all those younger people are trapped into a lease contract and so desperate they’ll take anything as had been the case. Now you’re asking people who had to move in with their parents to leave that and come work for so little you won’t have disposable income.

i7sadlb,t1_i7rxdxs,2022-05-08 11:19:58,Economics,"Ok so it’s like this.

You own a business painting rocks ok?

But you’re an asshole. Or maybe not an asshole, maybe you’re just trying to be “competitive” because you heard growing up that teens and college kids can and should work for a very low wage ok? Now here’s where the magic actually happens:

It occurs to you that if you could pay less money, you could hire more people and paint more rocks.

Instead of putting out a posting for 1 job paying at a livable wage, you throw out 3 postings for 1/3 of the livable wage.

And poof! You’ve just created 3 job openings!

There might not actually even be enough people close by to take the job, much less people who would want to take it at such low pay. But the jobs technically “exist”.

Edit to add: let’s do some ELI5 on this for those that may have never dealt with budgeting labor for a business:

We’re going to leave morals behind for a minute ok? Ok. Morals gone so you can better “see” how this works.

Imagine in 2022 numbers, “legal” minimum wage is announced at 10 cents per hour tomorrow.

Now you forgot your morals ok? They don’t exist.

How many of you would be able to actually become EMPLOYERS? Imagine how awesome it’d be to have another human work for you at your house, and only cost you 10 cents an hour.

Since you don’t have morals in this hypothetical situation, would you throw up a job posting for housekeeping? At 10 cents per hour You could immediately throw 10 job openings on indeed.

Would anyone take the jobs? Probably not right?

So many people would try though, and the number of “jobs available” per person would jump massively, probably more than 10 “jobs” available per person.

It doesn’t mean they are going to get filled.

Ok back to reality:

Inflation vs minimum wage.

US government targets a 2% inflation per year. (It’s much higher for most people but whatever ok 2%)….

Minimum wage is not pegged to account for inflation.

This means over time minimum wage becomes completely unlivable. Effectively, it means that if the government never does anything about it, AND since the government purposefully pursued a 2% inflation rate, minimum wage has a “purchasing power” that *when unchanged to account for inflation* gets so low, less and less people take the minimum wage positions. Also, because businesses make more and more money (due to inflation, even if their own purchasing power hasn’t changed much) they can afford more and more job openings at this minimum wage, because inflation.

Throw in a pandemic shock (and a few other things) to remove some of the working force (like old people), and bam! You have more “job openings” than people available.

While it’s an extreme example at ten cents per hour, that’s effectively what’s going on in the labor market.",FDorbust,t2_dju7q1kh,61,0,reddit1

So her VP could be sitting on a fishing boat in Key West and she will send multiple contracts to him, which he will have to find a local notary to notarize the contracts, and then he overnights it (with an envelope and label my wife already created so he doesn’t have to do literally anything else) and then it moves on. If she misses a contract she can get fired. When the VP is in Florida, they miss contracts all the time.        
       
Plus, these are just the skills and things she is doing right now. Those skills can translate into a ton of opportunities involving anything office/admin/clerical work.

That was a car. Businesses look at employees just as I looked at that car. I never got my super awesome deal on said car. But the risk vs reward of asking for it was worth my time.

Ask for a 2 year old working vehicle for $1000. If someone takes that bait it’s their fault for being in whatever position caused them to accept. That’s how I had mentally made it work in my mind. Makes sense yeah? I gotta try to take care of my own, and asking for it was such a low effort on my part it barely mattered.

Businesses see “employees” (humans) the same way I saw that vehicle. Not because it *has* to be that way, but because our culture has *allowed* it to be that way.

So, businesses barely have to invest anything to make a job opening that offers almost nothing in return, and the *generally accepted* reasoning behind it is if someone accept such a low wage, then they must have looked at their options and decided it was worth it, thus in the accepted legal and moral culture *as defined by current laws*, it’s a quid pro quo. If you’re life (is so fucked that) you accept the job, then obviously both sides have willingly agreed to the terms and it’s your fault if you accepted something that isn’t actually worth it on your side.

This. You get it.

Everyone read this, they said it better than I did and with less words.


Except minus the neoliberal whatever. 

The “jobs” don’t really exist until they are filled. If law alllowed it I could post 100 job openings at 1 penny per hour.

I have morals, but I’m human. 

I’ll be the first mother%%%%ker to admit this:

If the law allowed a minimum wage of 1 penny per hour, i probably would try to hire a couple people to build shit for me in my garage. So what if it’s crap. Even if I’m a shitty businessman, at a penny an hour (relative to my income… now imagine a corporation with revenue in millions or billions… minimum wage for them is like Pennies for us)….
If I can hire 100 people at what is effectively 1 penny per hour I would have a hard fucking time NOT posting job ads. I’d even go “above market rate” and offer 5 or 6 cents per hour. I would make those bitches profitable somehow. Mow my lawn now my neighbors lawn. Charge my neighbor $5 per year and pay some stupid asshole $1 per year to mow it.

Ok that sounds aweful right?

But would I profit?

That’s how the business are using minimum wage. For them, minimum wage is *effectively* like if I were to pay people Pennie’s per hour. Could you make a profit telling someone else to do stuff if you only had to pay them Pennie’s per hour?

Ok I’m done except: fuck off with “neo liberal this” or conservative” that.

Even before the pandemic thing started, theres a high demand in IT jobs in EU/US \*and also\* in Brazil (where I used to live). This is from my own experience so maybe people from other undeveloped economies could give us another perspective:

&#x200B;

Basically, developed Europe started hiring Portuguese(since in PT the IT sector isnt a high payin one so people just relocate to GER/HOL) but then those companies figured out that they could hire Brazillian developers to work remotely (a minimum wage in EU is around €750, that converts to around R$5.000, that is 4 minimum wages), so, the deal is too good for the developer and for the company, as they'll pay half what the average european would get paid and the developer will be paid twice/thrice more.

&#x200B;

That caused a shortage in Brazil (the company I worked for lost 7 highly paid senior developers in less than a year, and they all doubled their salary), so, now in Brazil you basically do a 1 month youtube course and get a minimum wage jr position(this is kind of exaggeration, but you get what I mean), if you have potential you can ask for 2 minimum wages within less than 6 months of experience.",clinkzs,t2_wmp88,2,0,reddit1

It appears the wealthier CEO’s and companies are becoming, the less regard they have for the health & welfare of their staff, all the while complaining to the media of worker shortages. 

Where I live, there are 10+ daycares that closed in March 2020 that have yet to re-open. The remaining daycares have waiting lists for years to come. I know parents who’ve been on the waiting lists since the beginning of their pregnancies and have had their babies and are still on the waiting list! 

With covid positivity rates up and down, schools are in session one day and remote learning the next day. Businesses are in the same position. The higher the number of covid cases in an office, staff are expected to pivot to work remote from home one day and be in the office the next week. 

Parents have to pivot day to day where their children are concerned. Company leaders don’t appear to be take this into consideration. 

I live next door to my 80 year old mother in law. She has the spunk and youthfulness of a 60 year old! She used to watch our kids for a couple of hours each day after school. To prevent her from getting covid, we can no longer do this. She is a 3 time cancer survivor with a compromised immune system. She is fully vaccinated, including booster shot. We’ve had to limit our interactions with her and socially distance by staying outside her home to protect her. I now work remote from home as I no longer have after school childcare and from day to day I may have to play teacher and assist my kids with their online learning and resolving IT issues when they have issues connecting to ZOOM, etc. 

CEO’s and company leadership can afford nannies & staff to manage their households. Workers cannot. I’m wearing more hats now than I’ve ever worn before in my life being a Mom to middle school and college kids, who are also in class one day and remote learning the next day, working my job, being a wife and helping my husband as we manage our household, our budget, inflation, rising costs in everything and shortages for food & household items and taking care of my mother-in-law and senior citizen neighbors in my community who have no family to check on them.

Try to figure out how to do something that involves databases that genuinely helps people.   Doesn't matter if it's just a contact tracing database written in Access.  Another thing to explore is informational interviews - look for junior jobs on Dice or whatever the kids are using these days, then send five requests a day explaining you're a student and would like to talk about the position - when there ask about what skills they'd want to see someone having for the job.   Ask if they'd be willing to 'donate' some data for you to work on.  If you come back with even something halfassed and not what they really need but it does what you say it will that's something they'll remember, and the smarter ones will ask if you can do a small project that no one else wants to worry about. 

When I was in grad school I did temp work and ended up becoming the guy who was their 'computer guy' - often it would be some one man charity working with a database he'd inherited in some weird 90s database program no one had heard of.  I'd go to the library, check out a manual, read it, then go in and modify the program the way the rando guy needed.   Or I'd be hired to do some basic stuff with excel for some really small landlord operation and ask if I could work on something that might do the job better.   None of that stuff led directly to a job, but it gave me a portfolio of stuff I could point to that I'd worked on. 

There are an enormous number of people with degrees in some IT specialty who literally can't code a single thing when you have them do a fizzbuz whiteboard exercise.  Figure out how to do fizzbuzz in some flavor of SQL.  Try solving 'baby' problems using Access or some other really basic and mostly free 'kid' database program.

Edit Looked at some of the implementations of fizzbuzz and came across this:

Actually no. While applicants can absolutely have the ability to set their worth (and the practice of crappy pay for long hours is a bad on), if no one is willing to buy them at that price they will not be able to find a job.

You seem to be missing the simple principal of supply and demand here. Yes, some jobs are posted at terrible wages and there is no labor demand at ""that price."" The same can also be said of applicants that want 2x what the job is worth, there is no demand to pay that unless you come with some exceptional credibility (like 0.1% of the workforce exceptional.)

So basically the system is designed to liquidate old people in their final years. It forces them to sell everything they ever owned before they can get on Medicaid, unless they are financially and legally sophisticated enough to set up a trust that shields their assets.

Much more needs to be done to improve such estimates so they can be acted on effectively. To design the right policies now, and invest well to deal with COVID-19 (and other pandemics) in the future, we need to use metrics that encapsulate all the consequences of a disease.

It seems to me that from the perspective of society, if someone dies and you bury them, this is relatively cheap to society.

If someone doesn't die but they can't work and need constant medical assistance, this is much much more expensive. 

It might be possible that we have a small but exponentially growing percentage of the population with long term **disability**. If this is true, long haulers are potentially a higher risk to things like societal stability and supply chains than deaths ever were.",humanefly,t2_4g51m,1,0,reddit2

There were multiple bedrooms, a garage, a car, and several children supported by one working parent. [The hourly rate was $28.85/hr.](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=60000+a+year+is+how+much+an+hour&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

Fifty years later, the author of this article is considering the same hourly rate as ""middle-wage."" I am aligned with them in believing any bump to the minimum wage is a much needed respite. I am happy that top-tier salaries are growing more slowly now.

But we aren't close to done, middle-income should promise the good life to anyone who works hard and pays their taxes. Hell, every income should promise a good retirement to a diligent worker. We have a long way to go before we ever get there.",Still_Championship_6,t2_8ap0dhh0,0,0,reddit3

If you are working class you have very little capital and must sell your labour to survive.

If you are petite-bourgeoise you have some capital but you still need to labour in order to generate income (think small shop owners, lawyers and doctors with their own practices etc.)

If you are capitalist class you have a lot of capital and can live fron the income it generates without necessarily having to work to survive (however many work anyway).

I guess one historical anomaly is that this would classify pensioners as the capitalist class - which is kind of true tbh, look what happened to some of them after 2008.",,,1,0,reddit3

jaz525y,t1_jaxxby1,2023-03-05 04:44:32,Economics,"It depends on where you are. In the UK, you are upper class if you’re born into peerage and don’t work, middle class if you own a business or in a prestigious role (say lawyer), and lower class if you work for someone else (even if it’s an office job). The classes don’t define wealth, people in the lower classes can be much more well off then either the middle or upper classes and vice versa.

In Australia though, it depends partially on income as well, but still job dependent. Blue collar workers are lower class, white collar workers are middle class, the rich (regardless of background) are upper class.

I’ve never lived in the US, but it seems to me that over there it’s much more income based. If you’re rich, you’re upper class, if you’re financially comfortable you’re middle class, if you’re living pay check to pay check, you’re lower class. Correct me if I’m wrong though. The problem with that, is unless you’re net worth is >= $100b, there’s always a group of people that are richer then you that you’d consider the rich. There’s also plenty of people earning $500k that are living pay check to pay check. The US system is a lot more subjective and your perspective changes based on where you are.

In this case, I think the Australian or UK system makes more sense. The article seems to be saying blue collar jobs or less prestigious roles are now earning more which makes sense as there’s more demand for office jobs and for prestige creating a labour shortage elsewhere (at least in Australia).

Middle class has less to do with income and more to do with ownership of your home along with other patterns of consumption and investment typical of people that cover those income deciles.

A large Middle class is historically an anomaly and is certainly not an outcome that pure market economies ever reach in equilibrium. They exist only as a function of Governments intentionally redistributing housing through access to cheap ownership (though the implementation of that redistribution may vary greatly by country). 

The rise of the Middle class was a 20th century phenomenon built on mass home ownership. The 'fall of the middle class' that has occurred since  the late 20th century is purely a measurement of falling home ownership.",Xx_10yaccbanned_xX,t2_jd95a81r,13,0,reddit3

At the same time though, people across social classes experienced its benefits: a blue-collar working family could still afford college, medical care and savings.[\--Harvard Political Review](https://harvardpolitics.com/who-is-the-middle-class/)

This is one of many similar takes I get when I googled ""middle class is not just about income,"" and it matches almost verbatim what I was taught in college, with all the same discussions about CoL and perspectives.

If it's subjective, so be it. But tying ""middle class"" to the median household income, just because it has the word middle in it, doesn't mean squat. If ten households of one person each makes X, and eight of them pair off and marry, the median household income just doubled.

edit: I say almost verbatim, because when I was in college, it was 2.3 kids, not 2.5.",anti-torque,t2_cgg056ff,12,0,reddit3

jb0bzr0,t1_jaz21s2,2023-03-05 13:34:00,Economics,"Interesting. I’d question the “cheap ownership” and “falling home ownership”, but interesting insight nonetheless. 

I suppose we could indeed discuss the middle class arising out of westward expansion and homesteading, but really became a “thing” when the production and distribution process grew to need supervisors/middle management.  A farmer toiling 10 hour days would never be middle class, nor would the production worker paid solely for the value of their skill and labor.  

“Mill towns” where the company owner/rich class owned many small homes rented to the workers, there were 2 stark classes with maybe a tiny middle class of shopkeepers who owned their space.  Larger cities would have larger entities and the supervisory/managerial class would be larger in #. The rise of mortgages in the 1930’s allowed the smarter “lower class” people to save money and eventually buy a home. 

Seems that tool, combined with the explosion of college attendance beginning after WWII, is what grew the middle class. And differentiated the classes by education primarily. 

We point to earnings by college grads, and net worth of homeowners vs those without. The reality is the “lower class” just doesn’t have the ability/capacity to operate “long term” that’s required for home ownership.  we know we can’t really break ~2/3 ownership rate, the period late 90’s and 00’s we spent above that is who got foreclosed on. There’s nothing wrong with being a lifelong renter, it just is what it is. 

Similarly, we can push kids to go to college, but if they don’t hone or develop the mental skills to become supervisory/managerial track, then they’ll remain hourly, output-based people. 

The problem occurs when the benevolent and hopeful USG wants to “help” that large and frankly mostly-permanent “working poor” class. And while the USG thinks they can just “tax the rich” to pay for their benevolence, the reality is that the middle class pays for it in many ways.",BoBromhal,t2_8nqdsp80,2,0,reddit3

2. The share of youth going to college is rising too, somewhat faster.

3. Medical care coverage has risen too, mostly as a result of Obama administration's reforms. The quality of medical care is rising too. The ""paying for"" part is more debatable. I appreciate American individualism but, since the tax burden on Americans isn't that light, why reject those sweet fruits of redistributive policies? As far as I understand, medical insurance in US is largely sponsored by employer, so we can't argue it's purely the matter of an individual's financial position.

4. Now, the obvious problem is the number of children. Which has fallen way below 2.5. And one of the major reasons behind it is often described as precisely the unaffordability of raising an additional child.

As for vacation and leisure, I unfortunately don't have the info from the top of my mind. Dogs and fences, let's consider them less crucial matters.

However, if we're going to use that definition, educated professionals and small business owners aren't middle class - they're part of the upper class.

But it makes sense, people like to think they’re better then others and want to be better (not necessarily a bad thing, just a part of human nature). It’s easier (albeit perhaps not correct) to compare yourself to others based on wealth. If you’re poor and admit you’re poor, for many that would be like admitting you’re worse then most others. It’s easier to just think you’re normal and the rich have an unfair advantage (which depending on your definition of rich mightn’t be far from the truth). So yeah, makes sense but never really thought about it.

I’d slightly disagree on the rich though. It’s not that they don’t realise they’re better off, most do. The difference is, they’re not looking backwards, most look forwards, and unless you’ve got over $100b, there’s always a group of people that are much richer. Most see that, and want to join that group, only to find another group and so on. It’s easy to feel poorer when most people you see are just as well off, and you’re constantly comparing yourself to the ultra rich. But if you ask them if they think they’re better off then the normal person, I think they’d say yes and they’d realise it, but they don’t focus/think about it at all. So, I guess it makes sense as well like you say, but I disagree with your reasoning.

Most people including the so called poor didn’t have cable. Now everybody does. No one used to have the internet because it didn’t exist. Now everybody does. Including streaming in lieu of cable. Cell phones used to be only for the rich. Now, not only does everyone have a cell phone, everyone has a smartphone, which even the rich could only dream about in the 1980’s. Flat screen tvs and color tv in general. Even the poor have that now. They didn’t used to. 

European vacations used to just be for the wealthy and you could only fly to Europe from NYC. That’s long since changed. The middle class takes European vacations now, many of them do, and they fly directly from their local airport in Cincinnati. 

Movies at home. Except for tv broadcasts, that used to be just a thing for the rich, especially ones with connections. Now everybody can watch a movie whenever they want on their smartphone. 

BMW’s and Mercedes used to be just for the rich. Now they are a dime a dozen, at least in S Tampa where I live. 

I was sitting outside at Dunkin one day drinking coffee. Started talking to the guy next to me who turned out to be homeless. He was there so he could plug in his laptop. Imagine a country where even the homeless have laptops. I remember a time when laptops were prohibitively expensive and only businessmen could afford them…

Coffee is another example. People didn’t used to pay $5 for a latte ($10 now?). Fancy coffee drinks didn’t even exist. People made and drank coffee at home or had a cup of Joe at the diner. There was no Starbucks. Now the average Joe thinks nothing of paying $5 plus for a latte at Starbucks or similar. 
And I know middle class people who eat out every night because they don’t know how to cook. Nobody in the middle class used to do that. It was prohibitively expensive. 

Kitchens. Another great example. Chef’s kitchens and fancy kitchens used to be just for the wealthy. Not anymore! Pretty much everyone has one now. Fancy cabinets, upscale stainless appliances, granite or quartz counters, undercount sinks, fancy faucets. See?

jb08d5y,t1_jaza15n,2023-03-05 12:56:54,Economics,"Ohhhh my dear friend. I'm 33. My education was paid in 2011. It's only gone up 10% since then, which ain't much considering inflation. My sister and I ate wave 1 of education exploitation. My dad's savings were footing the house it cost to put my sister and I threw the ringer. Hers was over $140k, out of state, and I did the state school model and it was over $60k for me. So he had the savings of another house in his back pocket and then some. My parents didn't even have my sister and I until they were in their late 30s early 40s, and met only about 8 years prior. I got out of college to the shit market left over by the housing crash. It took me about 7 years to find a job that paid a living wage, which was in a warehouse. 6 years later I'm finally in a job I can apply my degree to. To scale, in 1986 when they were building a house, their monthly rent was $325/month for a 2 bedroom in New England (not cheap). My dad could afford that in half a week's pay, stocking shelves. My average rent last year was $1895 with all utilities except internet. I make $88k, it's 2 weeks pay to afford.

The housing crash is and will always be the fault of the generation that allowed it to exist. The government had oversight, saw the bubble years ahead (before the millennial gen could really vote, let alone understand the situation anyways) and legit told the industry to police itself. They didn't. They did the same thing with the opioid epidemic, which happened at the same time. I got to watch over a dozen of my childhood friends die because there ""was no opioid crisis"" according to the industry and the government, or there was, they just didn't want to take action because $$$. Until there was. Then the Sackler family who caused it was able to treat their company as a person (another boomer time law), and their multi billion dollar fine they had to pay over 5 years was equal to the interest on their investments and they paid nothing. Equivalent to making $100 million illegally and paying a $2 million fine. The automotive loan industry is doing the same shit and has since before 2016. This time the government knows they need to regulate it, but in 2016 Trump was elected and put his pay day loan friends in charge of the banking systems and no oversight continues. All of which were also boomers that made their money doing all the shit that I mentioned in previous comments.

Never said anything dangerous should happen to Pelosi or her husband, but her husband performs 56% better than Wall Street in his trades. They are insider trading, as is the majority of Congress, while taking bribes, I mean being ""lobbied"". It's reality. It's not to incite violence, though less educated people would probably do so, it's just a fact. Would you prefer it's not brought up at all? Should they also just ""police themselves"" or should it be sparking the larger conversation that business owners and stock trades should be illegal for friends and families for elected officials in Congress? 

And bailouts have continued. Every single time there's a minor crisis, these companies, without savings, printing money, get bailed out so they don't ""fail"". Now I have a degree in economics and work as an analyst. I can tell you right now, every time you prop up a business that *should* fail and does not, it's not always a bad thing. When you do it to oligopolies or multi billion-trillion dollar companies that can afford it, you're enabling. And by enabling, you're also creating a barrier to entry higher and higher for competition. It's bad for us, consumers. The best way to make a company now is to be successful and hope you get bought out, otherwise companies like Amazon will just steal your product with a huge lawsuit safety net and push you out of the market at little cost to them. It's part of the reason we are where we are. They are able to gatekeep with extreme efficiency and clear record profits constantly, then they get tax breaks and even tax refunds. In 2018, Amazon received a tax refund under Trump, from us, while millennials still struggle with the college debt needed to get a job under companies  like Amazon. They made record profits that year. 

We saw the largest transfer of wealth and increase in the wealth gap in the history of the US (if not world) during 2020 because the government bailed out more companies than people. Literally handing companies boomer investments were in, our tax dollars, while we suffered, and just trusted the companies would give us our money. A projected 80+% of PPP loans never reached the employees  they were for, most were illegally allocated to stock buybacks and never reached employees. This is from the government agency in charge of them, and it's OUR job, the exploited employees, to now report our companies if we think they were nefarious. Putting us in a situation where we are basically told to bite the hand that feeds us because the government knows we won't. It's the perfect setup for wage slavery. Put you in a position where you fear your employer, even though YOU are the one doing all the work and making all the profits. You could say unionize! Which some people are, but boomers who *benefitted from unions* also have been doing their absolute damnedest to prevent unions from happening (especially Republicans), and companies spend $340 million/year union busting, which they get a tax break for btw. Meanwhile larceny from businesses was about $5 billion but *wage theft* was about $22 billion in 2018. Can't imagine it's gotten better.

The system is unfortunately rigged, and almost all because of long term exploitation and lack of oversight because boomers had it good and have strived to keep it good, just for them. You might say ""it's not all boomers fault"", well they still have the most amount of seats in all major businesses and government, and have my whole life, so I dunno who else I'd look to blame. My parents are boomers and they just sat back and watched it happen as I grew up, with my mom recently telling me she's going to go out of her way to vote now because of shit like Roe V Wade. Congress won't move because the filibuster exists (and they are almost all boomers protecting their investments, average age 65) and the parties will never change because of the electoral college, since it not only allows the government to vote for itself, but electors are chosen based on the previous election outcome. You'd need at least 2 elections cycles to get any seats for a 3rd party. If you can take anything from this, vote to kill the electoral college and make president a popular vote and always fight the filibuster. Party leverage just means we all lose. The Senate is the heart of debate, as what the founders wanted, and sure enough, it's become the heart of who gets to collect their 6 figures and go home early.",lostcauz707,t2_fdrof,1,0,reddit3

I know a manager who rents houses. When the lease was up, his rent skyrocketed. He lived near Raymond James Stadium north of work. And the house was already nice, had been renovated before he moved there. So he found a deal on a house south of work, near MacDill Airforce Base. A year later, when that lease ended, same thing, the renewal price was like 50% higher, maybe doubled. And this was for the exact same house. It had already been renovated before he signed the original lease. This time he rented a house way out in the suburbs, Lutz, with a long commute.

Probably 30 days before the 60 day written notice deadline to tell them we are going to move. All of this is spelled out in the lease. It’s a written contract. 

I’ve lived here forever, so I’m sure that’s why they’ve been fair. Loyalty is a two way street. There’s also a yearly renter’s satisfaction survey, and the last one came right before my renewal period, so I wrote right in the comments that I loved it here, but was worried about the upcoming rent increase. They obviously read the surveys because they actually contacted me and told me not to worry. The renewal offer was only a 15% increase, so to $1115 from $970. Which is amazing because the market price in these units is as high as $1700 sometimes. They post prices online and they change daily with their software, mostly supply and demand. Since the price was so good, I signed an 18 month lease. I still have 8 months to go. 

Even with the offer price, you can try to negotiate them down. I’ve received early renewal offer prices, waited, received lower offer prices later (the software again) and then renewed at the lower rate.

It would really be a good idea to become friends with the landlord or at least the property manager at your apartment complex. At the very least, introduce yourself and make yourself known.

kooddpx,t1_koniutd,2024-02-03 01:26:42,Economics,"Perhaps, but it's still a significant enough change to raise estimated hourly earnings from 4.1% to 4.5%.

You're right though, the revision is 20 minutes a week. 20 minutes! That's 4 minutes less work per day. Not even your employer knows this, let alone BLS.

It is also a more significant revision than it appears, because it is so low. The original estimate of 34.3 hours a week is in line with the historic norm going back years. It tends to be around 34.3 to 34.5, so this month's 34.1 estimate is an outlier. The last time it was this low was March 2020, and only for one month. You have to go all the way back to 2010 to see another estimate this low.

Since they are making these numbers up anyway, why not just leave the estimate in the normal range? Make whatever you'd like of the report. It's just important to be aware that BLS has always played these games.

Our household economies at large are not getting better, and that's what the people see.  The improvements they are reporting are on Wall Street, not Main Street.


If you look back you will notice the media was doing the same thing at pretty much this same timeline within the Trump presidency, although pretty much the exact opposite media outlets.

Have to be: 

* US citizen

* No criminal history

* CS degree (they can milk the government more for you the more credentialed you are)

* General ability to pass secret clearance screening, don't use drugs, and are not a risk of selling secrets to the Russians or Chinese

* Ability to actually successfully complete fizzbuzz appears to help but ultimately be optional, if you can get through the above

From people I know who work at Lockheed & subcontractors, expectations are very low, not much stress, only one of them has had military show up at their house at 2am and take them by helicopter to a navy ship that needed an emergency software update. Sometimes they get to go blow up missiles to test stuff (scheduled). Basically infinite job security and if you do get laid off, your security clearance is attached to you so you can easily take it and get another job requiring a secret clearance and be highly appealing since they won't have to pay to put you through the process themselves. Many of them have 4-10 or 9-9-80 work schedules as standard options as well. 

Is it very boring because you cannot take your cell phone into classified areas though and can't browse the internet at classified workstations.

There’s all kinds of evidence that middle managers already want out and are burned out AF: https://fortune.com/2023/02/08/work-burnout-middle-managers-nearly-half-want-to-quit-within-year/amp/. There’s a million more articles like that as of the last few years if you google it.

I was one and quit to pursue my own business after changing from a couple middle management positions in different organizations, but finding myself beating my head into the same walls over and over. And that I was actually making more than my staff. You take away the ONLY perk and you’re going to lose a lot or be unable to fill those jobs.",Swimming_Tailor_7546,t2_nojp1cfn,5,0,reddit4

kp3hcw8,t1_koz0hj6,2024-02-05 22:59:56,Economics,"> With every recession it’s the same playbook increase the money supply, lower interest rates and create inflation.

Every recession after 1980 has resulted in dis-inflation, because the money supply is just one of many factors that determines prices (the Fed increases the money supply to offset the decrease in the other variables). This (post-COVID) is the only time since then we've had significant inflation. That's why I asked if you were alive after 2008, because 6 or 7 years of 0% interest resulted in no increase in inflation.

[https://i.imgur.com/NJoWfoA.png](https://i.imgur.com/NJoWfoA.png)

Vertical grey bars represent recessions.

The reason for inflation post-COVID is the same as the reason for inflation in the 70s and early 80s: supply (and demand). The oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979 resulted in a big increase in prices, because oil is used in producing and/or transporting just about everything. Lower supply (with the same demand or higher) means higher prices, without any money printing happening. The same idea applies to COVID: factories across the world shut down for a year or more (especially in China), so lower supply and thus higher prices.

The key takeaway is that the Fed is only reacting like a control system to other events that are disrupting markets, they change interest rates and the money supply to try to counter-balance other effects. Key work is ""try"", because they were ineffective in increasing inflation after 2008, and may be ineffective in decreasing inflation right now (global supply chains are inevitably recovering).

The big thing with this sub is that no matter how upvoted a comment is about feelings, it literally doesn't matter. Look at how many people try and swindle a coy comment in about how it's the middle class that is suffering the most.

The goddamn Sun may explode on top of us at your age if we even have the luxury of living that long and not dying in some horrific event such as water wars. Try working until 67 fucking years old with that shit looming over you every single day. Nuclear war is hypothetically preventable, but climate change can have a band-aid slapped on a gushing wound at best and we can't even do that.  Just continue everything as is - kick the can down the road until it explodes. 

Fuck anyone under 65 years old is how this all feels.

Reading the CNBC article on this, many employers are loathe to lose workers after the mass resignations of 2020 due to COVID.   

On the other side, the personal stimulus checks are mostly long gone, and many are realizing they cannot keep drawing on savings.

The goal is to get inflation back down to the 2% target.  The goal is not to break the labor market or destroy wage gains.  It's all related though, so I can see why people think this way.

FRED data shows how much unrealized losses banks are sitting on and it can cause a lot of economic skepticism in people, regardless of how the broad economy is doing.

Personally, I think the broad economy is fine,  but banks clearly are not fine if they are relying on reverse repo and the Bank Term Funding Program when sitting on hundreds of billions in unrealized losses and swap/derivative exposure.

It is hard for them to give up the career they spent so much energy and time preparing for to jump into what they might perceive as a ""lesser"" job even though it might pay more.  

If college was cheaper I don't think people would fall into this sunk cost trap and would be more comfortable with changing career fields.

Unemployment is below the “full employment” number of 4%. Prime age labor participation is higher than before the pandemic and the overall participation rate has nearly to pre-pandemic levels. 

Increasing interest rates makes borrowing money more expensive. This slows down the velocity of money and reduces the overall supply of available money since fewer loans are being created. Less money and lower circulation puts a drag on demand, it’s generally more expensive to “have” money, in the aggregate sense. Lower demand causes businesses to sell fewer goods and services. Fewer goods and services sold means fewer people need to be employed to meet the demand. This is a 1000ft view of how interest rate increases are disinflationary.

2) The employer's market - This is where we are entering now.  A smattering of layoffs, willingness to terminate employees quicker, and higher reliance on contract workers.  Employment numbers may remain steady, but there is a lot more churn in the workforce.

3) A recession market - 2008 and parts of 2021 were the last times we were here.  Hiring freezes are the norm.  Extreme reliance on contract workers.  Job options are very limited and many are forced towards underemployed positions.

I wouldn't agree with that piece.  People psychologically have been found to have two mindsets on money & spending:  

**The Opportunist** \- Money is viewed as an endless resource in their mind.  They can always work more, make more money, and are not concerned with spending on what they want.  These folks tend to take on more risk, spend more willingly, since they are confident there will be many more paychecks coming in the future.  


**The Cautious** \- Money is viewed as a finite resource in their mind.  Proper budgeting, looking for deals, and making short term sacrifices in sake of long term savings is a focus.  These folks tend to look for a good value with their purchases and don't take as much risk since they believe money is difficult to accumulate and should be thoughtfully guarded.  


  
Both are properly valid views.  They are just the two main 'buckets' that people fall in with their internal views of money.

k3r4i91,t1_k3qvf0h,2023-10-06 18:48:03,Economics,"Because its all about what goods that money is chasing.  

Money in the hands of everyday (many) people goes towards finite consumer goods, but there are only so many goods available, so prices goes up.  You notice these price increases because they are items you pay for often.  America has a voracious consumer culture, so they will simultaneously continue to spend and complain about prices.  Not everyone obviously, but there's a reason why a cup of coffee is so expensive, because people are willing to pay that much for it.

Conversely, money in the hands of (few relative to the size everyday people) business and wealthy individuals does not exert competitive pressures on prices of everyday consumer goods that people notice because they are not purchasing those goods in the same proportion.  If all the worlds wealthy people decided to start buying food en masse that fit the needs for thousands of people, you would see prices increase.

You do see inflation in some competitive luxury goods, generally rare things and investments, but these goods are isolated from supply chains, so you do not get the inflationary bullwhip cascade of say, an increase in egg prices increasing the price of omelette at a restaurant.

In reality, massive corporations and the super wealthy act as a liquidity sink so that inflation doesn't happen, but its not without its own problems.  Economic bubbles generally form because of these ""liquidity sinks"" in investments, like stock market bubbles, and then suddenly the bubble pops and they park their money elsewhere.  This creates ethically complicated political problems because retirement accounts are tethered to market investments and gives political/influential leverage to those that have the capacity to derail it.

Consumer goods prices will only stabilize once everyday people are either culturally persuaded into not spending so much, if their wages do not allow for it, if competition increases to decrease the price in order to claim market share, or if a business decides it doesnt want to make as much money as they could.",waj5001,t2_c0wu5,9,0,reddit1

* Controls/Compliance/Audit
* Project Management
* Finance/Investments
* Insurance
* Jobs in local Governments
* Various Trades like Welding

k3sunj5,t1_k3pq1y5,2023-10-07 02:01:55,Economics,"That is correct. 

When you're talking the difference for at best about 1 million people over 50 dying by the US stats. Technically in the first million dead 70k were under 50 930k were over. But then everything opened back up so the number seems a bit less clear at that point. So I just stop at ~1 million to not go data shopping and distract from the real change. So 1 million at best vs a generation in the 10s of millions it makes a small dent at best, millions retiring per year is the generational killer for the work force vs the small increase in labor comparatively of Gen Z.

The peak of baby boomers retirement was during the COVID outbreak. Stock markets were up, low inflation and low interest rates so for most people it was a great time to retire. 

Now with two of the three statistically higher some boomers have returned to work. Not many but statistically significant by the way it was explained. But more importantly the rate of retirement has slowed for people who didn't plan as well for retirement. They are still retiring it just seems slower, but this too could be an illusion of the numbers. One thing factually important but not mentioned as much is that boomers are a very front loaded generation please just go look. There are ton more boomers in the early years than the later years. You see this trend continued into Gen X and is the reason they are smaller is due to the children per woman cratered in that 20 year period. 

So by that fact of course retirements would slow due to the lower number of people in the back half of the generation and retirement age increasing from 65-67 at the time. If SS is your #1 retirement vehicle which it is for many boomers then you will have to defer a few years. On top of which the main limiting factor for many people is the age of medicare which is 65. And since the youngest boomer is now 58 at least 7 years worth of boomers are not receiving it yet so they either have to work or pay a shit ton out of pocket to get it on the public/private market. Again putting pressure on them not to retire since higher inflation and higher interest has pushed those costs of buying or borrowing to buy that insurance so working is just more logical financially for this group. 

All these factors combined would suggest a short term higher work force participation. Mainly driven by a lower retirement rate and financially risky boomers who retired being forced to reenter the workforce for a limited period of time. Your point that long term this is not sustainable is factually correct by a number of demographic and economic realities and any jump should not be considered permanent unless something like the age of SS or age of medicare would increase.

Expecting people to network to have even have a chance at a job is just an alternate form of nepotism. Just like requiring references often is; people with ""great references"" often have wealth and status affording them prestige whether legitimate/earned or not, and people without references (new entrants) or less prestigious references wont be considered, all based solely on a system of honesty. 

In your comment, you place all of the responsibility on individual and cede any form of employer accountability for shitty candidate selection procedures, or internal or personal bias. That's why you deserve downvotes, because it's sounds exactly like something a capitalist bootlicker who got theirs would tell people without sparing an ounce of criticism of negligent employment practices in this country.",,,0,0,reddit1
k3qlk08,t1_k3qk1u2,2023-10-06 16:53:21,Economics,"My advice to young people is learn chat GPT and use the fuck out of it to make tailored versions of your resume. 
  
Start with your master template of skills and experience, and prompt gpt the job description you're applying for and have it spit out a tailored resume.
   
It might take one minute longer per application, but it's a lot better than shotgunning a crappy resume that goes straight to a rejection bin.
   
Another advice is ditch the 1 page resume. It's all digital now and I've seen 12 page resumes in the professional field.
   
Automated HR looks for keywords, the best place to have keywords is including a skill set table. Literally it's a table at the end of your resume that lists every bit of product, technology, equipment, software, that you have hands-on experience with. Be specific too. Keyword bots are looking if you have any experience with an application called Teamcenter or you know how to use a John Deere backhoe.

If anything, CPI overestimates inflation because it doesn't allow for substitution in other areas.

Rent has gone up 19% since prepandemic. Which is the same amount as inflation. But, rent is based on supply and demand, so some markets will be higher and some lower. So, by your metric of housing payment to income, average rent is slightly lower than pre-pandemic relative to income, given that real income is up but rent only rose by the amount of inflation.

Sure, as long as GDP outpaces it. And if it stops, we'll have way bigger issues than the debt anyway. 

>Does it sound sustainable that our biggest government expense is interest in our debt? 

An irrelevant metric. Yes, one category that comprises the interest for all debts is going to be larger than any one single category. It's like saying ""Isn't it crazy that your mortgate interest is more than any of your utility bills?!""

>Does it sound sustainable to raise a generation saddled with debt who cannot effectively keep up with inflation and cost of commodities?

A mortgage on a home and utilities is a TERRIBLE metaphor. A utility bill make up next to nothing compared to the mortgage payment - your ratios are way off. It is ABSOLUTELY a problem that we spend that much on interest on debt. Our interest is an expense that contributes to this entire house of cards. Hardly an irrelevant metric. 

Effectively, yes we have less purchasing power. When the currency inflated in supply while your share of the pie is vastly reduced, yea you have a lack of purchasing power when adjusted. This also doesn’t factor the cost of homes, cars, schooling, healthcare, all of which have increased drastically which compounds the problem of having a smaller slice of the pie.

The only way you can pressure workers to let go of the old projects is to offer more money for the new projects.

> Before we turn to the data, we have to understand what is at stake. In particular, we need to understand why economic theories of corporate governance and corporate finance fail to explain observed reality. Questions of corporate governance are ultimately questions about what decisions corporations make about raising and spending money, who makes those decisions, and what criteria they use to make them. To accurately understand why the relationships between sources and uses of funds in the corporate sector might be different today than in decades past, we need to approach these questions in a concrete historical way, looking at the corporate finance decision as a zone of political conflict and not — as academic economists too often do — as just the solution to some objective maximization problem. First we will look at the general discrepancy between academic theory and corporate behavior, and then we will dig deeper into the history of these corporate governance theories.

> The workhorse macroeconomic models taught in most graduate programs assume that it makes no difference whether households own their wealth directly in the form of buildings, machines, etc., or whether they pay someone else to manage it. They also treat business assets as the wealth of the firm’s “owners."" In these kinds of models, it makes no difference to the “owners” whether businesses finance investment with their own retained earnings or raise it by issuing debt or new stock (Miller and Modigliani 1958). And it is hard to see why any business would incur the costs of higher borrowing simply in order to increase shareholder payouts, since from this perspective that is just moving money from one pocket to another.4

Also, raising salaries today absolutely will show up in next quarter's filings.

If companies A, B, and C don't raise salaries but company D does then (assuming it wasn't underpaying before) it makes its costs higher than necessary. This risks the company's viability and all those workers jobs. The cause of the detrimental long-term effect in this case is raising salaries. Remember, company D doesn't have the option of paying for it by withholding dividends without any consequences if competing companies A, B, and C are paying those. They're just losing money. 

On the other hand if companies A, B, and C raise salaries but company D refuses in the name of short-term profits then the cause is, as you worded it, failure to (re)invest in personnel. In this case what you're describing is true - company D has better financials in the short term, but will inevitably face the disadvantages associated with a ""brain drain"" as it accumulates the workers of last choice its competitors won't hire.

Raising wages (or not) is not inherently constructive or detrimental. It is an appropriate response to worker scarcity, broader inflation if you want to look at nominal wages, etc. But just those two factors jibe pretty well with recent history's wage growth (surpassing inflation, but only just so since there has been a fair bit of slack in available workers). 

None of the above takes what's fair or right into account of course because the free market, on its own, cares only about efficiency. And companies raising salaries without any need to or benefit from doing so do put themselves at a competitive disadvantage. ",JSCMI,t2_8p8v3,6,0,reddit2

As an extreme example: We would be more productive if the state executed everybody that can't work instead of having social support systems for them.  Yet, there is nobody that argues for this.

Now, in terms of difference between a collusion and a union: Collusion will tend to increase the difference in bargaining power between two parties (the colluders and the people that negotiate with them).  Unions will tend to decrease the difference in bargaining power.  This makes them materially different, and I believe it may also increase economic efficiency as you'll end up reaching a point that is closer to the 'correct' division of profits, rather than one based on one party having a stronger bargaining position.  There's counter-arguments, of course, including raised costs across an entire industry (if everybody unionizes) functioning as an externalized cost.

In terms of raw benefits, negotiating with unions tend to have lower amortized transaction costs than negotiating with individual employees.  So if you end up at the same level of wages and benefits paid, a company is usually better off having negotiated this with a union than with individual employees.

Absolutely - it was technology. Whether you're looking at an industrial plant or an office worker with better computers and printers, individual workers can get more done with 2005 tech than 1985. 

Are you saying this is wrong? That the workers deserve a piece of that increase? This would require the workers get the return on the owner's capital investment, lest labor is ""exploited,"" the rich get richer, etc.  

All that's happening is the people who made the investment get the returns. (if they materialize)

If the returns were going to the people who were hired to use the equipment instead, there would be scant incentive for owners to make the investment in the first place.

Trickle down is a term used by people that have little to no understanding of how money flows for businesses especially those that start up (as every business had to do at some point).

Businesses start by paying everyone but the owner first. It's not trickle-down, it's spending heavy (usually invested capital either by the owner or shareholders) which if it works according to plan (half the time it doesn't and it just fails outright) then after the suppliers, employees, and everyone else are paid, if there is a profit, the owner hopefully recoops not only his cost but is paid on the surplus value/utility he/she has created in the market.

The ideal system would value long-term sustainable resource allocation, versus short-term driven unbalanced rent seeking for the banal sake of competition. Keynes himself had the utopian dream of an economic system devoid of rent seeking. But alas, our current oligarchy is well entrenched, and so is the West's winner-take-all attitude. This makes for a very inefficient system when it comes to the allocation of resources. In our system, workers and voters only have to be satiated enough to not threaten current growth and profit goals.

We saw this play out all too clearly in the auto industry where workers had so much compensation and so little accountability that we practically gifted market share to foreign industries.

As I stated earlier, you can make it look however you want depending on what you include/exclude from the calculation. Also, picking a source that argues and presents evidence that will clearly bolster his political leanings is going to be a hard sell. I would be equally suspect if you posted a blog entry from a right-wing economist. Ideally I want statistics from a more neutral source if possible.

Also, I will have to look into why they would only include private sector employees but include the entire economic productivity growth. Why not public sector compensation? They should be included as they are part of the overall economic productivity, and would greatly increase the rise in compensation statistics. 

Does this look at average household compensation? Does it factor in immigrant compensation that is not part of the official numbers but clearly has an affect on raising overall productivity numbers? Can we see how much of the gain goes towards capital so that we get an idea if the monetary gain due to increase productivity is flowing towards the reason for the increase? If it is going towards capital then it shows exactly what was said before. Workers are becoming increasingly interchangeable in many fields and the technology is driving the increase in productivity.

In theory, yes.

In practice, this is rarely the case. 


A significant portion of tax planning goes into determining the best mix of dividends, wages and bonus for the executives of a corporation.

There is also corporate tax planning around moving equity from one related corporation to another, or even stripping equity from a corporation entirely, sometimes in order to render it creditor-proof.

In the real world, corporations often acquire third party financing instead of reinvesting profits. This is because it's faster and easier to obtain the financing for an expansion in a week, instead of waiting years to amass the same level of cash you would need to acquire the assets necessary.

It's not uncommon for financing agreements to include conditions such as postponements of claim from shareholders and closely held related corporations, and financial ratio covenants because dividend stripping is so prevalent.

I think you and I both pointed to that pesky ""human nature"" being the problem in the end, as competition, the attainment of ""pleasure"" (which is power in the eyes of our political and economic leaders), or merely the avoidance of pain (heaven forbid the politicians have to explain a negative GDP growth rate two quarters in a row or that asset owners have a ""deflation"" in their asset values) leads to most if not all of the ailments of our devised economic systems. 

Going back to what I said before, a new ideal system serves humanity in general as its primary purpose, which takes A LOT of (often) short-term pain to gain lots of forecasted pleasure long-term (immature humans like toddlers or politicians would rarely go for this) OR... it would take a system where more pleasure is derived from making sure the whole is satiated, versus individual players putting their needs and wants first and foremost. The latter gives the advantage to players that have a head start (connected to the government or natural resources in most countries) or to players that don't mind trampling on the balance that sustains life if it means one can ""win"" against others. I'm sure this latter human dynamic had a part to play when there was one mammoth left to feed two opposing tribes, but it shouldn't apply to nations murdering civilians to advance the interests of natural gas exporters, as just one example.

Dividends aren't for attracting buyers, they're for providing shareholder value.  Just like reinvesting, just like stock buyback.  They're all tools to increase shareholder value, which is the duty of any publicly traded firm.  If dividends were the be all, end all, every company would have 100% dividend.  If share buyback were so great, companies wouldn't issue stock in the first place.  If reinvestment was the best, there would be no dividends or buybacks.  Each method has it's use, and pros/cons.

I agree with the productivity constraints you've pointed out.  However, I would expand the explanation for that to include not just lagging consumer demand, but also the business community's willful decision to use excess cash for share buybacks/dividends instead of capital investment and hiring where it should have gone to restore the national economy.  By and large, the business community has shown a willful disregard for making responsible economic decisions.

In a public company? An overnight P/E worsening of 5% is kind of a big deal.

In a private company? Let's talk about that:

> Long term employment and employer loyalty

Given this

> But at least I had a job, right?

I'd say no. I have a friend who was in a similar position, just with a _very_ slightly smaller company, and frustrated with the lack of progress, doubly so because he saw areas for growth and the owners were not allowing him to pursue it. He was high enough in the (private) company to know if they were profitable or not, which he said he knew for a fact they were. 

I advised him that if there was money to be made and they didn't want to be a part of it that he ought to split off and go into business for himself. 

All the sudden he didn't have a lot more to say about it. He started talking about what if the clients take too long to develop, what if the market doesn't grow... basically he started giving the exact same excuses that the owners were. 

That's what it comes down to: If you can tolerate the risk and the market is there, then there's nothing stopping you from going after it yourself. Start-up capital is cheap. 

But if you can't tolerate the risk of a similar company (or freelance activity) being profitable at all for yourself privately, then yes I'd say that suggests asking for 5% of profits is too much. 

> Giving up 5% of PROFIT is enough to drive a company under? 

To get to your original question, you tell me: If there's a disproportionately high amount of profit for the risk, go for it. If not, then I guess giving up even a modest % of profit puts the company at risk of being in an adverse financial situation if the next 12 months aren't as profitable as the last.

$1. 60 or $2.40 while it cost you $30 to pay your employees wages.

That's not fully true.  Making marginal returns is the job.   The opportunity to invest elsewhere is the test ... and any investment can cannibalize the ""commons"" in favor of its own returns.  It's happened many times with monopolies and the like.  

>  Its not an exclusive club. 

That's also not true.  The utility possible for buying daily supplies and competing for spaces and paying higher rents is easily able to destroy any chance of using a puny %age return on an investment.   Utility is not %age-on-assets ... so there's only a few who can choose to gain all their utility through %age-on-assets (passive investing versus providing a service).

It's very exclusive.  So for that part ... there's no use otherwise for a wee little return in comparison to buying milk.

All the rest of an industry or nation can collapse and returns can fall to puny little trickles, with no one buying and a very very few holding tons and tons of assets that have no use.  THey can be (just like now) cash-rich and investments-dry, because the economy is under full deflation.  

Just so long as the marginal-return-on-investment is larger than any other.  CEOs/Colonial companies have destroyed economies and hoisted all the profits away, leaving empty demand-free zones of zero consumers.... where they had a place they could sell to beforehand.

So no .... ""making shareholders money"" is a very very tenuous claim.   Money-in-the-next-six-months in a short-selling bonanza is actually a deficit over any long term profit.   If they have an itch to do it ... the market will support very very short term profits.  Especially if there's speculation-gambling going on.  

Let's not believe Bugs Bunny cartoons from the 50s are the permanent state of economics?  Okay?

> When economic theory comes to a consensus that maximizing worker utility is the best thing a company can do, then ill say thats what they should do.

Worker utility is not as big a part of the economy.  You are talking about ""capital utility"" and adding value in a set of production services, a workforce and their services paid for.  A worker is just one part of capital and production ... and (as I said) dissolving any number of workers for a very short term liquidity-demand may seem like ""making money"" ... but can depress an entire economy.

This is very well documented.  You can choose to *decrease* the GDP down to nothing (in a monopoly or monopsony [purchaser's monopoly]) and still have fulfilled a consensus that you made a proper return.

It just so happens you've burned the established economy to the ground.   US Demand is at an long-time low per capita.  The economy is finally past the Industrial Revolution.  Inflation is, basically right now, a matter of banks and currencies and not caused now by supply-line failures.   If the whole system of supply chains starts to fail because demand stays low for a very long time ... costs will rise ... inflation will start ... and the whole economic system will have produced scarcity just so that liquid-profits stay extra high for a moment.

>In [accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy), __gross profit__ or __sales profit__ is the difference between [revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue) and the cost of making a product or providing a service, before deducting [overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business\)), [payroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll), [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation), and [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) payments. Note that this is different from [operating profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes) (earnings before interest and taxes). Note also that [gross margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_margin) is the term normally used in the U.S.,   while __gross profit__ is the more common usage in the UK and Australia.

>The various deductions (and their corresponding metrics) leading from [Net sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_sales) to [Net income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income) are as follows:

>>[Net sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_sales) = [Gross sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_sales) – (Customer Discounts, Returns, Allowances)

>>Gross profit = [Net sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_sales) – [Cost of goods sold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold)

>>Gross profit percentage = {([Net sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_sales) – [Cost of goods sold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold))/[Net sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_sales)} x 100

>>[Operating Profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_Profit) = Gross Profit – Total [operating expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense)

“Monetary-policy lags are still underestimated,” said Thomas Costerg, senior US economist at Pictet Wealth Management.  “The full effect of current tightening may not be felt until mid-2023. By then, it could be too late. The risk of a policy mistake is high.”

It's amusing that tightening is met with such controversy when these are moderate interest rates at best and the Fed is still hoarding $9 trillion in junk debt. There was barely a peep when we were ZIRP and gobbling up $120 billion monthly in junk debt. Did they expect the music to never end? Pulling back on a tiny bit of the intervention is not the mistake; the mistakes have already been made.

WTF was the inflation rate from 2008-2020, when the markets crashed, but average rent prices in every city and small American dump hole went up by about 100% over the decade?

It was around ""1%"" for most of those years, right?

Wall St, real estate and tech industries somehow saw 1000% gains in some cases, but oh, unleaded 87 and apples stayed at a few dollars, so I guess inflation was low. Medical insurance and costs skyrocketed, but I guess inflation doesn't take max-out-of-pocket costs into account, let alone Blue Cross's preposterous rate jumps over the years.

Economics are a smoking crack-pipe joke by overpaid geek professors who should be teaching math to kids, but instead get paid entirely too much money to make predictions and analysis on numbers far out of any human's scope.

For all the rumblings the last year about the economy, things are actually fine if you want to work a job. You now why? Because it's easier to get a job today than it was in 2008-2018.

Maybe regulate the big industries a little more so they stop capping larger profits. This fight on inflation is preposterous; as if the median American household on a 54K salary is causing inflation. These are the people that rely on the interest rates the most for day-to-day living and savings.

[Anchoring bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias).  Taylor rule predicts that the Fed funds rate should be about 12-13% now.  12-13% rates are *inconceivable* \- very few people in the working world now were in the working world last time we had them.  If a publication predicted 12% rates next year their editor would come in and say ""That seems *really really high*, almost unbelievable, if we print that we'll lose credibility and nobody will visit us.""

So they anchor off the most recent experience, which is that the last Fed hike was 0.75%, so the next Fed hike will be 0.75%, and then rates seem high so the one after that will likely be less.  In May the prediction was for a 0.5% hike in June and then further 0.5% hikes until the end of the year, trailing down to 0.25% hikes in the New Years.  In June (after the first 0.75% hike), the prediction was for a 0.75% hike in July, and then 0.5% hikes after September.

While I absolutely believe Uncle Milton was right that inflation is ""always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"" I think the best measure of that phenomenon is nominal GDP. Not M2 or any CPI, PPI, PCI or similar.  


This means that there are times that you let high prices run because supply shocks (esp to energy that's priced into everything) can mimic inflation or heck even cause ""inflation"". Yet if you raise rates on an economy with a shrinking nominal GDP it is precisely the wrong policy medicine.  


In q178, GDP was $2.2T. By Q180, GDP was at $2.8T. That's a nearly 20% rise in NGDP in 2 years.  


The oil price spike didn't begin until Apr of '79 when it started it climb from $15 to $40 in  a year (mar 1980).  


So how do we explain the explosion of nominal GDP from 78 to 79?  Supply shock of oil hadn't happened yet. Fed had FFR at 10% in Mar of 79. The answer is that policy was too loose in Mar '78 even at 10% and having risen from 4% in just two years (76-78).  


Why was it too loose still even with a near doubling of rates in two years? Because NGDP shows its too loose.  
Q175:$1.6T  
Q176: $1.8T  
Q177: $2T  
Q178: $2.2T  
Q179: $2.5T  
Q180: $2.8T  


The Fed allowing the nominal size of the economy to grow by nearly 10% per years for several years before the oil supply shock hits in apr of 79. (likely the impact of Iranian revolution finally kicking in globally late in Q179). We're talking about a near DOUBLING of GDP in only \~7 years.  


It's clear enough that the Fed cut rates way too far when recession hit in 75. 10% to 5% because of recession? If they had cut to 8% or so and monitoried GDP, they would not have left them at 5% for so long while the bubble grew bigger.  


All that to say that the ""wait and see"" is appropriate, they need to ensure they aren't repeating the mistakes of 75-78 in leaving rates too low when GDP is exploding, nor of raising rates into a recession as they did in '80.",microphohn,t2_yx7dn,7,0,reddit3

Right. And it's weird that the market is so stoked about it. I mean, even if the Fed does hike by only 50 in December - that means nothing for future hikes. What if they want to hike by 50 during the first two meetings of 2023 (instead of 50-25 like previously assumed)? I mean what's the difference between 75-75-50-25 and 75-50-50-50?

&#x200B;

It reminds me of the rally back in...March I think...when, at a press conference, Powell said he wasn't ""actively"" considering a 75bp hike for the next meeting and the market skyrocketed on enthusiasm. Do people understand the definition of the word ""actively""? He just meant he wasn't considering 75bp RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT. Then when the Fed ended up hiking by 75bp at the next meeting because of worse than expected CPI reports, everyone started freaking out that Powell was ""a liar"". Even CNBC was pointing to his ""flip-flop"" and/or ""waning credibility"". Must be so annoying for Powell.

That is a key observation. Private debt is especially powerful at causing deflation. 

Unlike governments, when private people dont pay their bills they lose their car, lose their home, cant buy food, etc. They take it seriously, and react by cutting spending, selling assets, and generally panicking.

High private debt paired with high interest rates turns real estate into a time bomb.

Yes, higher rates will cause a massive disaster for debt markets.  You seem to take that as an indication that rate hikes won't happen, while an equally valid explanation is that there will be a massive disaster in the debt markets.

(FWIW, I see the Fed dropping rates back down *after the disaster occurs*.  But the Powell Fed has been pretty steadfast in their policy of enacting painful policies only in response to *actual* problems, not *predicted* problems.  Lots of people predicted inflation as a result of the post-2020 ZIRP, but they explicitly said ""If it occurs, we have the tools to deal with it"" rather than not cause it to occur in the first place.)",nostrademons,t2_1w5b,17,0,reddit3

For the last 40 years we have only been aware of the deflation side.  Deflation becomes highly negative and it’s an all out war with against it with ever more exotic tools to break its back.

We have very little modern experience the other way around.  The last one started in 1966 (along with a bear market in bonds) and ran until the early 1980’s.

The supposed lesson learned as that you have to break its back just as you would self re-enforcing deflation, or it won’t go away long term.

The Keynesian school gave economists the tools (if you agree they should have those tools is another discussion) to address structural deflation, but wasn’t well suited to the inflationary regime that started in the mid to late 60’s. 

That lesson coming out of it, was that monetary policy needs to act just as decisively as you would for the GFC, but the other way around.

Do they have the will to do that?  We will see.  The thought of inflation in our modern age was anathema to new synthesis economists up until the last two years.

The difference between my calculation and the Atlanta Fed largely comes down to PCE vs. CPI.  The Fed uses the PCE as its preferred inflation measure; it's currently at around 6%, which knocks 3% off the implied Fed rate, giving about 9-10% (roughly the pessimistic estimate on the Atlanta Fed calculator).  And I think most of the models use 4-quarter core PCE, which is under 5% right now, implying \~7% rates.

The difference between PCE and CPI is largely that PCE factors in substitutions.  If the good you really want is too expensive for you and so you make do with something cheaper, PCE reflects what you actually bought, rather than what it would've cost to maintain your previous standard of living.

Conceptually it makes sense based on a fundamental understanding of certain economic principles. Even if certain goods, such as fossil fuels, were relatively inelastic to consumers they would still be elastic to producers. Producers could not absorb the price increases as their goods dependent upon the inputs would be elastic to consumers.
This should all cause a slow down in growth and production to be decreased. However, if the money supply is increased improperly then the demand never decreases and instead the price increases just roll right on out across the board.

Did we suddenly got worst at all those things you mentioned overnight? or did we finally see the economic reality of the world once we're cut off from cheap labor?

Ultimately Cochrane’s work is still only a theory and not commonly accepted as a principle. But I also do not see where he makes any claims to supply chains, energy prices, or lockdowns.

People who hang out with rich people are more likely to be or become rich. That correlation doesn't tell you which way the causation flows or even if there is a causative link. 

Hanging out with rich people might make a person who otherwise wouldn't be rich, rich. Or, rich people only hang out with other rich people and upwardly mobile people who are going to become rich with or without them.

An example: when Michael Jordan was playing college ball, he was not rich. However, wealthy college donors would likely have been introduced to him and interacted with him increasingly as his talents became increasingly known.

The same would be true in non-spots areas as well. A guy I knew in high school for a perfect SAT score. He was from an upper middle class family, not rich. He attracted the attention of wealthy and influential people associated with prestigious schools who contacted him to attempt to attract him to go to the university they were connected to.

As disturbing as it might be, both of those behaviors likely predated their late teens. The rich want to be associated with talented people as much as it might benefit talented people to be associated with the rich.

&#x200B;

My uncle had a PhD in chemistry, and so it was ""normal"" for me to get a PhD in physics. It wasn't a big deal, or anything special, ya know? It was just something that some people did.

&#x200B;

It's generally also true that personal economics are generally sticky in an upwards direction. It's very difficult for individuals to move down in socio-economic status, but it's very easy to move up. By difficult here, I don't mean like ""level of effort involved"", I mean ""how much it hurts them"". Once you get used to a certain standard of living, people really really don't like to decrease it.

&#x200B;

If you grow up with wealthy friends, and it's pretty clear that in that environment, what you expect our of yourself is very different . I went to a fairly prestigious private school growing up, even though we didn't have a lot of money (we valued education A LOT in my family, and this school was the best around by far). One of my best friends there was a state senator's son. The state senator owned a law firm in partnership with the man that eventually became my step-father for a while. For years I'd go to Christmas parties with the governor, senators, congressmen, etc...

&#x200B;

Growing up in an environment like that, it was pretty clear that a mediocre life was simply unacceptable. ""No ifs, and, or buts about it"", we had to be well above average. There was SO much social pressure to succeed at whatever you did, that failure was just not really tolerated. I mean, it's not like you had to be a lawyer, or get a business degree. But whatever you did, you had to \*really\* do it well. A few people hated it, bailed out of the system, and decided to be beach bum stoners or starving artists or ski instructors (a very popular choice), but the rest ended up basically all being very wealthy.

&#x200B;

And yeah, some of that was about connections. But you'd be surprised how little of it was really about connections. Most of it was simply that mediocracy wasn't tolerated. By like 4th grade or something, we'd basically run out of the money to keep up tuition at the school, and although I had the option to continue there, I decided I'd rather go to public school.

&#x200B;

Public school was a big, big shock for me. It was the first time I'd met kids with below average or even average intelligence (you had to pass a lot of standardized tests to get into the private school, and couldn't really just buy your way in). It was also the first time I met people who didn't have any real work ethic to speak of. People who just like, didn't pay attention in class, and who didn't work hard (unfortunately, the later rubbed off on me for a few years since public school was so much easier and I really didn't have to try). Also, everyone was wearing different clothes (no uniform), and they were rowdy and rambunctious and had no manners and disrespected the teachers and on and on... Even in like 5th grade, I got in trouble for correcting teachers a lot in science class because they were just dead wrong. In private school, that never had to happen because the teachers actually knew what they were talking about.

&#x200B;

Look, I went from being around a lot of very very wealthy kids to not being around them very quickly, and I can assure you that it's not just about who you know. It's also a lot about using social pressure to keep people in line, and getting kids to start acting in a way which preserves and produces more wealth. Sure, some connections help you get a first job, and sure, that first job can be leveraged into better opportunities. But being trained as a young kid how to recognize opportunities which can be leveraged, and then how to leverage them to maximize your gain from those opportunities... being taught that mediocrity isn't enough... being taught that you have agency in your life, and how to wield that agency to achieve your goals? those kinds of things make a bigger difference than the rest, I think.

&#x200B;

And to be fair... it was really good for me, and I'd do the same for my kids as well. I don't want a mediocre life, and I don't want that for my children one day either. They can do whatever they want, but whatever they choose, give it 100%. This isn't a dress rehearsal, it isn't a practice run. It's your only shot at life. If you choose to work at McDonalds, no problem. But I'll be damned if my children are robbed of that choice by a culture of indifference, a lack of work ethic, or by a world which teaches them that it's okay to settle into a comfortable misery without challenge or growth.

&#x200B;

Edit : And before anyone asks, no. I don't think money really made a difference in my quality of life. As long as you can afford physical and mental health services, have a stable income and are good at managing finances (I've seen people make 800k+ per year go broke because they out spend their income), and are actively searching for and pursuing solutions to your problems instead of ignoring or avoiding them, you'll be fine. Money can alleviate a few stressors, but it doesn't actively add good things. Just slightly more fun distractions, and better tasting food.",,,30,0,reddit4

Depends on how you measure poverty though, which is currently solely measured by income by the BLS/Census Bureau, not including transfer payments. If you look at consumption, the poverty rate has actually fallen quite a bit over the past few decades. The issue is we are still measuring poverty in the same way we did in the 70's (solely based on pre-tax, pre-transfer payment income), which isn't all that accurate. There's some pretty well known research (at least well known to those who work within the academic side of the field of economics, 2 well known profs at Notre Dame):

""The report shows that between 1960 and 2016, consumption poverty fell by 27 percentage points. Changes in tax policy, the researchers said, contributed to the decline in poverty, along with changes in Social Security and other transfer programs.""

Everyone wants to complain about how broken healthcare is and point out how it's often some people's only option to go to the ER for shit that could be handled in a doctor's office or an urgent care...

Don't go after me for showing up where the money is, go after the parasites who created these conditions in the first place.

I'd have to stop the other things I was doing so I could go back in there, get them resituated safely in bed, reassure them, and then go back out to finish taking care of my other five patients. 

And because we look out for each other's patients while our colleagues are in other rooms, I also had to be mindful of the other drunks and demented patients in the area to help keep them from injuring themselves too. 

I'm not saying this to complain about my job. I'm saying this to illustrate what goes into giving competent, safe care when people show up in the ER. 

And if fewer people are willing to show up and do that for what the hospital wants to pay their regular staff, don't get on my ass because I'm taking contracts that pay me much higher rates to do a job that others don't want to.

Travel nurses get paid bank because the hospitals gambled on slim staffing to be augmented by on-demand travel nurses.  Was crappy, but manageable in normal times when demand was at a steady state, the executives got their “win” for their budgets at the expense of the medical staff and patient care.  And it is not like the medical insurance industry and government oversight that harp on about bloated medical costs and force system wide cuts to reserve capacity as waste had nothing to do with it.

But in pandemic times, when demand surges.  Higher demand with low stable supply and low reserve capacity, price increases, sometimes a lot.  Not rocket science.  Kids can figure out the basics of supply and demand at school trading stickers.  The hospitals and executives came up snake eyes in pandemic staffing costs, while still at the expense of medical staff and patient care.  Now just because of predictable, and even perhaps expected blown budgets for a once in a hundred years global medical event, both they and the govt think the system does not work.  It was busted before, everyone in charge just looked the other way as long as their budgets were kept down.  Travel nurse costs are a symptom, not the disease, and not even the worst symptom as though at high costs, travel nurses did help to voluntarily relocate staff from less-stressed areas to areas with higher needs / demands as different hospital systems needed surges of medical staffing at different times, and so did help to keep hospital systems from collapsing.",TheNthMan,t2_f2tj4z6,6,0,reddit1

Firstly, let's talk about value. Understand that nurses have an enormous responsibility for patient outcomes. Nurses go to work and many of them spend their workday saving lives that are lost without their skill and attention. Would we care so much about these wages if it was corporate finance or sales? Fuck no, we would call these wages ""earned"". But nurses go to work to literally save lives instead of win sales. My point is nursing provides a value to society that is impossible to measure but we pay experinced nurses about the same as a first year financial analyst at a fortune 500. Nurses should be paid more anyway, but in any case how the fuck do you think their wage vs value is a ""racket""? 

Second point: hasn't ""nursing faces a labor shortage"" been a headline for about 20 years? Corporate interests have shed nursing labor as a cost containment strategy for years. Patient loads were already increasing before the pandemic which was creating strain on the quality of patient care/outcomes which is a major cause of stress and one of the main reasons nurses leave the bedside. Enter the pandemic which dramatically affects both sides of the labor market: fewer nurses through sickness/quarantine/death/burnout and overwhelming patient loads. Our healthcare system is super broken but it isn't the nurses to blame.

The solution isn't to cap the traveling worker's pay. It's to offer a better salary for the full time group, so there is incentive to stay at that job. And that's where the real problem is. The healthcare system keeps acting like this is a temporary problem, rather than a systemic one. Because of that, they see it as 'cheaper' to pay a temp twice as much for a month than to increase worker pay slightly for the whole year. That math holds for a temporary problem, but when things drag on longer than a month, the math favors the 'should have just raised base pay'. The system refuses to increase base pay as an incentive to stay in a wildly difficult environment, so people leave. They have to fill the gap 'temporarily' until the gap is filled, but without changing the base problem, the gap will never fill, dragging the problem out.

If I could get double/triple my salary with similar benefits for the exact same work somewhere, no one would bat an eyelash if I did that. The comment would be 'well, the place phys worked at should have paid phys more if they wanted phys to stay'.

The Costco example works if workers are treated soley as a commodity, and not like humans. A more accurate example would be an underpayed and overworked software engineer that helped build a website, left all documentation that other people could follow and perform without their specific help, and went to a gig that was exactly the same but paid more. No one would bat an eye at that, except for the initial company that refused to increase the engineer's base pay. If they want the engineer back, thier options are to increase base pay, but the engineer temporarily at a higher rate, or accuse the engineer of gouging.

So increased costs means that there is less money to put back into growing the hospital, which may or may not translate to increased bills depending on how they run things.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization

For example, say a non-profit hospital has $30 billion/year revenue and used to use some of that revenue to acquire other hospital chains. If they make less profit, then they could leave bills to customers at the same level but maybe they might have to defer another acquisition by a quarter or two. Or, they could collect over $1B from the US government in COVID relief funds and use that to cover the shortfall and still do acquisitions.

 >A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a non-business entity, not-for-profit organization, or nonprofit institution, is a legal entity organized and operated for a  collective, public or social benefit, in contrast with an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a profit for its owners. A nonprofit is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties. An array of organizations are nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, business associations, churches, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives.

If you look at the average wages for RNs over the last 35-40 years and correct for inflation what I think is clear is the reason we are considered to have “good pay” is that our wages have just barely kept up with said inflation.    Maybe up a thousand or two yearly over that timeframe.    

That’s what counts as “good paying job” these days… is an occupation that barely keeps up with or surpasses inflation… how f’d is that?   But Teachers are fucked over harder.   And of course Youre right it’s not a competition,  but if we don’t start paying our teachers more travel nurse jobs are gonna get price gouged to oblivion because nobody’s gonna be smart enough to enter this field.    Even now what strikes me is the obvious entropy of critical thinking amongst newer nursing school grads.    Of course I’m fully willing and make a point to try to educate the new ones as much as I can on the job..  but you can’t have big gaps in your ability to reason  and make a good critical thinker… it’s stuff that’s learned or should be learned in grade school on up.

I think that covid magnified the amount most contact staff are underpaid, and people decided to not put up with it. Traveling pay was already going up before cocid. The 'distortion' is people deciding that they can be paid more for the same work, increasing the number of people leaving overall. 

Everyone just started paying attention when federal money got involved. I don't think it would have prevented travelling nurses from asking for more. 

The distortion already existed. Instead of solving the base problem, the healthcare system decided to keep rolling the dice on the 'temporary' solution, since that is what has always worked to make problems in staffing go away in the past. 

Again, at BEST the argument could be made to restrict funds to only covid contact workers.

Companies are profit focused by nature and by law. If a company could pay women less and get the same output then they would fire all of the men and hire women, why would they not?

The pay gap is an aggregated metric that demonstrates the differences in behavioural patterns between groups and the effect of that on pay. The gender pay gap is almost entirely eliminated merely by taking mothers out of the equation. Leaving the work force for some period of time, and being subsequently less likely to come back will reduce the amount that a company is willing to pay you. Women also tend to do less overtime and less overwork, that behaviour is typically rewarded with more money in men and women, just that women tend to do it less than men do.

Promotions are not dictated by discrimination, again in order to remain competitive companies want to pick the best person for the job. If the behaviours that lead to success in those, such as tendency to overwork, are more common in some groups then people in those groups will be more likely to be promoted. The market discourages this being the result of discrimination and encourages it because of economic value.

It is possible that there is discrimination in pay, however market forces highly discourage it and engaging in it is costly. When we look at big companies like Apple and Microsoft, they are bending over backwards to try and address any issues of pay discrimination, and yet pay gaps still exist. This isn’t because those companies want to discriminate, it’s because the pay gap is an artefact of the statistical analysis and the result of societal differences between groups.

You’re making the mistake of seeing aggregate differences in groups and assuming discrimination. The reality is that the differences in groups are dictated by the many factors behind that difference. The US doesn’t have a higher GDP per capita than France because of discrimination. It has a higher GDP because of its approach to the economy, US citizens tend to work more hours, are economically more innovative and so on. The economic value doesn’t mean that US citizens are ‘better people’ than French citizens, it just means that they have different behaviours and situations that lead to higher economic productivity.",Beddingtonsquire,t2_b2vkeizn,6,0,reddit1

If a laborer at their full time job is making  $15/hr, and get offered the opportunity to get paid $25/hr for the exact same gig, more laborers will move to the $25/hr gig. Pretty straight forward. 

Instead of the healthcare industry just paying $25/hr to current staff, they instead lose that person, and pay another company $90/hr for the same thing. The hope is that the temporary overage is just that, temporary, and not long-term. So they're losing an extra $65/hr consistently for months on end, instead of just giving the current worker a pay bump to $25/hr. 

The gamble has been that nurses will come back to the market, and the industry won't have to rely so heavily on temporary workers. The industry can go back to paying what they did before, no long term changes.

However, nurses have decided that $15/hr isn't worth it, and won't come back for less. They go somewhere offering $25/hr.

One of the benefits of the price system is that if you want to discriminate against people it will literally cost you financially to do so.

I disagree with this notion that we ‘know the cost of everything and the value of nothing’, I see no evidence to back that up. we have far lower levels of violence, corruption and discrimination than we ever had. We have more rights and recognition of those rights. Living standards and life expectancy are way up, as are the number of democracies etc. support for interracial relationships is way up from 60 years ago, support for gay marriage too. Working hours are down, standards of education and support of family and children is up. I’m not convinced by moral panics about value.

The idea that economic activity extracts rather than creates value is completely debunked by every single metric we have. Economic transactions are not zero sum, if they were they wouldn’t happen. Why would I bother exchanging my dollar for a coffee, or the coffee seller their coffee for one dollar if we didn’t each consider the trade beneficial?

That some of the gap remains unexplained does not mean that it’s de facto discrimination. That study does not include data over overwork or disposition.

Consider tech companies where about 80% of employees are men. That’s not because the people there prefer men 4 times more than they prefer women, it’s a result of the different choices of behaviour of men and women. Companies like Microsoft and Apple receive a lot of criticism for their pay gaps and yet they still exist. Yet, on further analysis the differences in pay at the same levels.

There was a gender blind study on Uber where the pay is determined by how workers choose to engage with their work. The men worked more efficiently and as pay is tied directly to performance they were paid more because of that https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2018/09/23/gender-paygap-uber-case-study/?sh=237ae8d6b555

Differences do not imply discrimination. For example, is it discrimination that so few white players are in the NBA despite white people being the largest racial group in the US? Is the NBA discriminating based on race?

Prices in stores are in tens digits (with the extra three zeroes to be assumed), banknotes also essentially have the extra three zeros in parentheticals, as in its a 50,000 peso note, but at a cursory glance it looks like 50 peso note. 

So, if someday the median salary is $1,000,000.00, reality won’t look or feel like that. People could be walking around with $100k bank notes treating it like we would a normal $100 bill. People wouldn’t say things cost “one hundred thousand” because it’s a mouth full, they’d say “one hundred” with the thousand implied because with inflation a straight 100 would be a nonsensically small amount. 

So I get what you’re saying with how ridiculous it would be with prices at such high figures, but that’s not an unknown issue, many countries have dealt with out-of-control inflation before and have culturally adapted to prices with an absurd amount of digits attached to them. 

So, while I can’t say what it would be like, in my experience, with Colombia serving as an example, is how I’ve seen that work out.",triscuitsrule,t2_dc2la,34,0,reddit2

The same will be true when $1 million salaries are common, and everyone’s joking about being a broke millionaire. When the average annual salary is $1 million, you won’t be able to buy a starter home for less than $5 million and dinner for two in a nice restaurant will cost $1500.

1. The question that /u/Skyab23 asked isn't ""how could an economy function when people make a salary that is 1 Million [units] per year"" but ""how can an economy function that has such a rapid inflation year-over-year?""  

2. How are none of you talking about the gold standard?

The dates that OP pulled out of a hat are 1950 and today.  They draw a straight line between them and then imagine that the line continues on pretty much that trajectory over the next 73 years, landing them at $1M/year salaries.  

But the salient detail that's being missed here is that in 1950 the United States was on the Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods system was in full swing. American dollars were pegged to gold and they were the foundation of the global economy.  We went off the Gold Standard under Nixon leading to an inflationary period which settled down in the 1980s and stayed pretty flat through to the September 11th attacks.  

This is to say that US inflation has very much NOT been a straight line since 1950 and that there is therefore no particularly good reason to presume that inflation will happen at that rate for the next 73 years.

There should be a reason only countries with severely struggling economies do redenomination (or in major historic events that lead to the introduction of new currencies, such as the euro). I've never seen a country with a healthy economy and not introducing a new currency simply do redenomination because the face values have reached silly orders of magnitude, even though Japan and Korea for example would be in such a spot. I guess there's a social/psychological aspect of trusting the legal tender of the currency that gets eroded in redenominations, even though rationally it should be as you say just ""scratch some zeroes and call it a day"".

hx64pny,t3_st6r6e,2022-02-16 13:28:51,Economics,"I couldn't read the article because of the paywall, but would be curious to know the economic details behind salary transparency.

If you think about salaries as a market transaction, you're signaling that your time is worth $X when you accept a job at a company. That of course doesn't happen in a vacuum. You probably have researched salaries, or have competing offers from other companies. That turns it into something akin to checking prices on Amazon or Walmart before deciding where to buy a product. From that perspective, transparency seems like a good thing in that it helps you more accurately settle on a price of what something should cost.

However, from a business perspective it seems terrible. I'd imagine it would sow discord among employees or demotivate people. It reminds me of the the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard in which each worker had agreed to work in the vineyard for a denarius. At the end of they day when the workers received their denarius, they became angry when they found out some had only worked part of the day while others had worked the entire day.",MrDrego,t2_36t0t,3,0,reddit3

I know people would respond with 'well then break it up into more defined roles with more granular salaries', but that doesn't solve any problem. What would happen is someone applies to the role, we talk to them, and we say 'Ok, sorry, you applied for this same position but level 3, really you need to go back and apply to the level 2 role'. 

Or we can just keep doing it the way we do it now, which is to say 'Hi, we have a massive salary range, and where you fall in that range will be determined by your performance in the interview process. What salary are you expecting?'. 

It's not that we want to hide anything, we just don't know what your value is and if we broke it up into more discreet roles, it wouldn't change anything. People will still apply to the wrong roles and we won't know until the process has already begun anyways.",,,17,0,reddit3

hx2mp13,t3_st6r6e,2022-02-15 19:20:07,Economics,"The highest paid individuals will make far more than the average for their field if they are in a specialized field.  They make more because they contribute more and add more value.  People are willing to pay those people more to use them because they get what they pay for.  These are lawyers, engineers, trades people, etc.  There are very low paid and very high paid individuals that have the exact same job title.

The idea that ""all jobs of the same title are equal"" doesn't apply to high paying fields.  Low paying jobs that are low skill are more likely to have similar compensation for the work done.  It's not easy to differentiate yourself and the value you add as a burger flipper or as a janitor.

The real problem are the fields where high effort work is rewarded with average pay based on job title and not value produced.  When employers or managers pay based on the ""going rate"" of the job title and not the value produced, the incentive to provide value through your efforts disappears.  Teachers get paid roughly the same regardless of whether they are awesome or terrible at their jobs.

So I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $150,000, or I could say I'm a civil engineer and I make $60,000 and both would be valid depending on who the person making the statement is.  Sharing my salary is pointless.

This is why I somewhat support unions for jobs that are tough to do but there's no real need for different compensation for different efforts.  If the outcome of the job is predetermined and the employee cannot change that outcome regardless of their effort to add value, then there is no competitive advantage for that employee to improve their life.  There should be an acceptable industrial compensation that those employees should receive and sharing salaries could help them out significantly.

I don't support unions for work that can be done at very different levels and provide different values to the customers/clients.  In my field I want to differentiate myself from others in my field to be near the top of the compensation that I can get.  I can take a project design from someone else and save hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars over what they did.  People pay me more but they get more in return.  Having everyone that does what I do get paid what I get paid wouldn't be fair for the weekends, evenings, long hours, and efforts I make to add value to my work.  

You don't deserve a specific pay because you have a specific job; you have to add value to be compensated for it.  Make sure you are compensated fairly and salary sharing may help.  I recommend applying for other jobs every three to five years and taking whatever offers you get back to your current employer and letting them know what those offers are.  That is the ""salary sharing"" that will result in increased compensation for what you do if you are worth it.  You'll at least know if you're already being highly compensated for what you do even if you don't switch jobs.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,-14,0,reddit3

The standard prisoners dilemma implies two groups with a shared dilemma and a shared set of preferences towards their shared options/outcomes towards the dilemma where unfortunately both players are promoted to choose the shared worst outcome for themselves. If you haven't noticed, that's an incredibly balanced situation we largely don't have in the real world and especially isn't applicable towards groups with opposite interests - which is the case for most employers and employees unless they are one and the same. There are examples where both players are incentivized towards the same strategy but their preferences are opposite - employers want to maximize profits while minimizing costs (labor) and employees want to maximize earnings from labor while minimizing their perceived negative consequences from labor (lost time, lost freedom, lost energy, etc.).

Beyond the differences in preferences there is also a difference in power to promote your desired outcome, which powerful employers have the leverage in that department. If anything, our economic system is forced to put increasingly more leverage in the hands of owners of valuable capital over mere labor as under capitalism in a post industrial revolution world capital increasingly has more value and power over mere labor.

A change in title should carry a significant change in duties / responsibilities, not just be a vehicle for tacking pay to title. Also, this gets more complicated with multi-nationals when Bob in NY gets paid way more than James in OK but they do exactly the same job. The easiest way to deal with that is to put in bands that are wide enough to deal with you CoL differentiation.

In the labor market, like every single other market, price discovery is based on competition.  In the market of your labor you compete with others of your trade to win work and compensation.  If you take that competition away, there is no way to know if you are adequately compensated for what you do.

The military is a piss poor example of the point you're trying to make.  May as well say you support a centrally planned economy where salaries are all set by the pentagon and nobody can argue for more pay or should ever be paid less if they suck at their jobs.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,2,0,reddit3
hx4vlva,t1_hx4ua59,2022-02-16 04:52:18,Economics,"So in other words, to make more money you change jobs.  Would you prefer a world where that's the only way to make more money?  You don't get additional compensation in the same job, you are hoping to change jobs.  You perform better in hopes of changing jobs, but the job compensation remains constant.

If you apply that to the labor market in general, would that work?  Is there always another position up the ladder that will reward extra effort and value created?  The military has a long long chain of positions.  Does that apply to most labor industries?

In my line of work I'm three steps from the CEO.  How many steps are there to get to a five star general?  Should every labor market be stratified into a huge number of steps and advancement positions?  Can that even work in something that isn't huge like the military or a mega-corp?  If your business only has 15 employees, will locking the wages under a specific job title work?

The military is not the best model for a labor market because it doesn't operate using market forces.  You can't increase your value and be compensated accordingly if that advancement position you'd like isn't available.  Like I originally said, the military sharing what every position pays and operating so doesn't translate to the market economy.  In the military the individual has no bargaining power and no real say in what they are paid.  They are dictated their pay from above and take it or leave.

Socialist countries have organized compensation based on position just like the military does and you have to appeal the bureaucracy to advance just like you do in the military.  The bureaucracy may or may not care what value you add and your ability to leverage yourself is rather limited in such a scenario.

I still stand by what I said, the military model of compensation is not great for labor markets.  Knowing what everyone is paid doesn't help anyone competing to offer value.  Get a few interviews and bids for your labor and you're better off then checking some online compensation list.  Put some effort in marketing yourself and figuring out what you're worth; trusting some stranger to tell you what you should be paid isn't the way to go.

When I worked for government there were some 9 or 10 technical ""positions"" that were compensated and you could work your way up that ladder until you needed an engineer's license.  After you were licensed there were another five steps or so available before that topped out.  Government paid poorly and wasn't really worth it unless you were at the very top.  Having all of that information public didn't do jack to help me or any other government employee because we couldn't argue for a raise regardless of how much value we added.  We could only do the steps to climb to the next position when it became available.  Government employees by and large are very poorly paid because they operate in similar fashion to the military.  How is this the ideal system?  It isn't.  It's far better to be able to be compensated for the value you bring to the table and not compensated by some bureaucratic policy of positions.

That's the problem.  If you know what everyone gets paid, the pay becomes tied to the position and not the value you bring to it.  If the entire labor market operated with set pay for set positions as determined by some central planner, we'd be operating in similar fashion to the USSR.  The military system is not what we want in a free and liberated society.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,0,0,reddit3

hx344n6,t1_hx32oow,2022-02-15 21:10:37,Economics,"Optimal efficiency is when the maximum amount of value is created for the least amount of inputs.

Information can make the market efficient, but misinformation can make it less efficient.  Efficiency is best created through proper price discovery and not through fixing prices.  When an entire group of people decide they should be paid the same as the highest person paid doing what their ""title"" says they do, efficiency goes out the window.

And no, most places that pay engineers do not directly compensate them for the value they add.  The contract with the client isn't such that the client pays some % of money saved.  The contracts are almost never written that way.  What does happen is that the client asks for engineers to specifically work on their stuff and are willing to pay a higher fee as long as those engineers are on their teams.

When people go through the extra effort to add value, they get paid more than those who don't FOR THE EXACT SAME JOB.

Having everyone know what everyone makes doesn't allow people to be differentiators and go the extra mile to add value to their work in hopes of a higher reward.

Like I said, the best market discovery you can do is apply for positions that you qualify for and take the offers you get back to your employer or simply switch to the higher paying offer.

The best thing you can do in knowing what existing salary ranges tend to be is use that information in deciding how to skill yourself and which markets to employ yourself in and then try to get to the upper ranks of that job market.  That information allows talent to position itself within the fields that are in high demand and lacking in skilled personnel.  THAT increases market efficiency.

Having the average idiot demand to be paid what the best people get paid is not a great thing for any job market.  It prevents everyone from differentiating themselves in their fields and reduces the value of adding value to what you do.",Coldfriction,t2_127or4,-1,0,reddit3
hx4kt1r,t1_hx4igbw,2022-02-16 03:22:25,Economics,"There is no set price.  Price discovery is what occurs when nobody knows how much to charge for something.

Flip this around.  If businesses were to all talk to each other about how much they charge for everything all the time, would that be collusion or not?  Why isn't it if labor is doing it?

Businesses compete with each other and DO NOT SHARE information.  Laborers compete with each other and DO NOT SHARE information.  If I say I earn $150k a year and the people beneath me are making $40k a year, they aren't going to be happy about that.  If all compensations were public information, price discovery would go in the toilet and the ability to determine prices for your labor would be ruined.

All price discovery is essentially ALWAYS a bidding system.  You are trying to convince someone to buy your labor at a rate you desire.  You can't do that if everyone is messing around via collusion.

The lowest paid people will share their incomes, but the highest paid will not.  You won't get what you think you will by making salaries transparent.  Essentially all government employee compensation is public information and government employees get paid worse than their private counterparts almost always.

What you get paid is what you are able to negotiate with your employer.  The best way to optimize your income is to put yourself on the market and see what people are willing to bid for you.  Looking at what others make in some public forum is absolutely not the way to improve what you make; it's a way to sink all boats.

Everyone knowing exactly what everyone else makes is good how?  In the military it doesn't matter because you aren't going into your boss and asking for a raise.  You don't work harder in the military to get to a higher pay rate for the same job you're currently doing.

In the private sector, knowing everyone else's salary does nothing but make those who are paid less disgruntled and demand more pay.  It forces employers to compensate the underperforming workers the same as the overperforming workers and provides disincentive to those who push the limits of their job to do so.  In a world where everyone is paid the same there's no incentive to create any more value than anyone else and quickly value production drops drastically and you get economic failure.

The military works because it is socialistic and the people there are professional because they've had it beaten into them and they are following the established order to a T.  The USSR military was similarly professional and structured.  Obedience is not an option.
