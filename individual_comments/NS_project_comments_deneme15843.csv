Also add 2 to my rating of appearance based on objective/subjective data of my appearance being rated on a scale of 1-100 by every woman in the world (theoretically, or at least based on the girls in a certain region or maybe a specific girl I’m targeting). Also add 2 to the number of beautiful women I have that are crazy for me 😂 

Physical stuff in general- adding 2 inches to the length of my hair all over my face both over and below skin, adding 2 to my vision (if I’m below 20/20), adding 2 to my ability to bench/deadlift/squat/lift/etc in terms of pounds, add 2 to the 
my rate of burning calories at rest, the rate of building muscle through exercise, my fat-free mass, the number of petabytes of data my brain is able to handle and process, and add 2 to amount of pressure my skin, bones and muscles and veins can handle based on pounds of pressure.

Other stuff: add 2 to the number of digits my bank account has, add 2 to the number of X item of value I have, add 2 to number of multimillion dollar businesses I own (which is 0), add 2 to my IQ, add 2 to my ACT or SAT score, add 2 to the number of PHDs I have earned legitimately, add 2 to the number of courses I have mastered and done to earn a PHD, add 2 to the rate MPH at which I can fly through magical means (which uses up calories to utilize similar to how a person burns calories to run and swim),  add 2 to the amount of miles I can run in a minute.

Gram is the defining unit of weight measurements. That's why the oz and the troy oz are defined in grams!

I am thankful i got to learn 2 new units of measurement (oz and troy oz), i really hope i get to use them some day. But trying to ""win"" an argument by stating the year when a measurement was stated just is silly. New things in science tend to be better. The Gram is more relevant, recent and its easier to use.

Listen up guys. Mocking our Chairman or making fat post hit the front page is fun while the lulz last, but we need to think of something more long lasting. And effective. How about we go after the Reddit sponsors? If the Reddit admins are willing to fuck over its userbase to get their hands on that sweet, sweet advertising revenue, well here's what we can do. Let's go after the Reddit sponsors. Write to them, call them out on social media. Make them know of the unhappiness and anger here. Make sure it becomes common knowledge that to advertise on this site is to get your name tainted in a newer ending series of memes and abuse. If the admins thought that their draconian censorship would make this site more packageable to the corporate sponsors, let's make them think again. If it worked for FIFA, it sure as fuck will have an impact on our Glorious Leader. So shall we get this party started? Post the names and contacts of some of Reddit's existing advertisers, and let the games begin! P.S: I will soon be shadowbanned, so if anyone agrees its a good idea, I hope you could carry this post, or some variation of it onwards until it really gets traction in our community.

Only a declaration of Free Speech enforced over all the subs would save Reddit.  

That will not be happening as the whole point of the Corporate takeover is to sell the leverage over the news and the conversation.  That leverage takes the form of censorship and banning.

YOU, Dear Redditors, are the product and the censorship is the secret sauce.

So leave this cesspool of censorship.  Go to VOAT which has declared a Free Speech commitment.  VOAT should be able to handle all of you Redditors after it expands its network bandwidth.  Head on over there next week when it's fixed. ",novictim,t2_cxbml,20,0,reddit3

As a mother I would absolutely be appalled if my son, who I am afraid for every day because of things like this, came home and told me a story such as this young mans story. Is what this young man experienced not considered sexual assault just because he is a man? I would have his ass into a lawyers office the next day pressing charges against this girl for sexual assault. Reading into this story deeper than just this article, the young woman in question sent texts to her friends the day after this incident basically implicating herself. This young man was her roommates BF at the time. Once the details came out about what really happened that night her friends no longer wanted anything to do with her. They knew the truth.

We can look at Ellen Pao and compare our values to hers in this situation, exclaiming that we would do everything we could to champion both mens' AND womens' rights. But it's so easy to forget about the allocation of profits to charity and humanity over our or our employees' personal gains; we overlook our ability to bring attention to world hunger, drug wars that are anything but righteous, the problem of obesity that's becoming the world's problem - not just that of the United States - while other parts of the world suffer with poverty and hunger, free speech, discrimination, gay rights, war in general, and ANY OTHER issue that plagues our world today that any person with power or money that has the potential to bring attention or change to some people that need it. 

We forget that the people we scrutinize are human as well, with flaws and biases and major imperfections. We have and deserve the right to criticize - it's how we learn and grow and maintain make right what's been made wrong. But we aren't gods, we aren't perfect, and we forget that we shouldn't idolize anyone because we don't deserve to be idolized ourselves.  

I don't say this to deter criticism, as I disagree with Ellen Pao's recent decisions myself. I say this because it's human nature to try to make the world black-and-white when it isn't. Its the same tendency that leads us to take actions against free speech when that speech is against our own personal morals; it's the same tendency that leads us to believe the person who made a bad decision is worthy of humiliation and degradation when that's what we're all trying to stop in the first place. 

We're all human and we all forget it, but we all need to be reminded from time to time. That includes you and I, Ellen Pao, the people of /r/fatpeoplehate , the president of any country, the doctors in a hospital, the teacher of a 5th grade classroom, and the leader of a poverty-stricken village in a third world country.

You're a leftist, like most here, so you just don't give a shit. You will always be a leftist before you are an MRA. That's the common thread here. That's why this sub has next to no real influence on the broader movement, or men in general (And men are 60% conservative across the board; no space this male would be this liberal if it were remotely representative of men or the MRM as whole).

>__Evelyn Beatrice Hall__ (28 September 1868 – 13 April 1956),     who wrote under the pseudonym __S. G. Tallentyre__, was an English writer best known for her biography of [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire) entitled *The Life of Voltaire*, first published in 1903. She also wrote *[The Friends of Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Friends_of_Voltaire)*, which she completed in 1906.

>In *The Friends of Voltaire* Hall wrote the phrase: ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it""  (which is often misattributed to Voltaire himself) as an illustration of Voltaire's beliefs.    Hall's quotation is often cited to describe the principle of [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech).

I'm a liberal and a leftist. And I do worry about excessive sensitivity, political correctness, and policing thereof. But you can't place the blame on the right this time. Doing so is a disservice, as it fails to address the actual problem.

I'm not sure that I agree with you.

Those early feminists only campaigned for the right to participate in society as far as they were able, no?

If a woman became a mother she was still expected to tend to her family first and foremost obviously, but a spinster should be allowed to share her ideas in the marketplace and let logic fall where it may.

We can't say that an idea is false simply because it is promoted by a female, come on guys lol.

Having the right to vote for females isn't predicated on fighting for the country, or in the context of WWI allowing themselves to become machine gun fodder for the European elite.

I think it's ridiculous to say women shouldn't vote, it's just those tumblr folks who go unbelievably too far and make us push back almost equally too far.

The real reason they're paid less is far more complex but generally boils down to them working far less hours and also being more willing to sacrifice pay in exchange for other perks:

> There are numerous other factors that affect pay.  Most fundamentally, men and women tend to gravitate toward different industries. Feminists may charge that women are socialized into lower-paying sectors of the economy.  But women considering the decisions they’ve made likely have a different view. Women tend to seek jobs with regular hours, more comfortable conditions, little travel, and greater personal fulfillment.  Often times, women are willing to trade higher pay for jobs with other characteristics that they find attractive.

> The AAUW has now joined ranks with serious economists who find that when you control for relevant differences between men and women (occupations, college majors, length of time in workplace) the wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing. The 23-cent gap is simply the average difference between the earnings of men and women employed ""full time."" What is important is the ""adjusted"" wage gap-the figure that controls for all the relevant variables. That is what the new AAUW study explores.

> One of the best studies on the wage gap was released in 2009 by the U.S. Department of Labor. It examined more than 50 peer-reviewed papers and concluded that the 23-cent wage gap ""may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers."" In the past, women's groups have ignored or explained away such findings.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html

> According to all the media headlines about a new White House report, there's still a big pay gap between men and women in America. The report found that women earn 75 cents for every dollar men make. Sounds pretty conclusive, doesn't it? Well, it's not. It's misleading.

> According to highly acclaimed career expert and best-selling author, Marty Nemko, ""The data is clear that for the same work men and women are paid roughly the same. The media need to look beyond the claims of feminist organizations.""

http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-28246928/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/

> The comparison is bogus, for two reasons. First, it lumps together men and women who work different numbers of hours — any hours above 35 hours per week. On average, full-time women work fewer hours than full-time men, often because they prefer it.

> When economists compare men and women in the same job with the same experience, the analysts find that they earn about the same. Studies by former Congressional Budget Office director June O’Neill, University of Chicago economics professor Marianne Bertrand, and the research firm Consad all found that women are paid practically the same as men.

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every year in September, a large number of incoming [freshmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshmen) would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, and would take some time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""[netiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette)"". But, after a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' [social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norms) or simply tire of using the service. However, for the existing userbase, the influx of new users from September 1993 onwards was a new and endless manifestation of the phenomenon.

If you can maintain the speed limit, then i'd say more power to you, but if you're riding in the middle of the road because people pass you when you aren't doing the posted speed limit, then you're a fucking retard asshole that has no business on the roadways. 

Where I live the speed limit is mostly 45 mph, and there are many hills, corners, and only short areas where you can safely pass. It's ridiculous that some selfish cocksucking spandex wearing bicyclist slows traffic to 10 to 15 mph because he's too much of a prick to ride in the breakdown lanes or use common sense.

You now give the example of being grossly outnumbered by those interrupting your conversation (30-6 in your example).

This doesn't really make sense because whenever a FPH person said something nasty on another sub, they get down voted to hell. I was under the impression this is what you were referring too. Since this scenario does not make it difficult for the original conversation to keep going, I did not consider that a violation of free speech.

I'm now guessing that you're referring to what went on yesterday, when /r/all was *filled* with anti Ellen Pao and FPH content.

I would still disagree that is a violation of free speech, as it did not censor anybody, it merely diluted all other content.

Yes it was a mass brigade in retaliation to the ban of FHP, and yes it might have made it difficult for other posts to be seen as easily. 

That being said, the mass brigading did not intend to censor anything. The banning of FPH was intentional censorship.

-----------

Sorry for the long post but I think this is actually an interesting topic, and I'd like to give an analogy in order to prevent any further confusion.

Lets say Reddit is a magazine stand. It has many different magazines, one for each subreddit.

Banning one of those magazines, in this case a publication dedicated to FPH, would be censorship in my opinion because it stops people from seeing something for the sake of stopping them from seeing it.

Now lets say instead, I hate the guy who runs the magazine stand for whatever reason, and in the morning right when the stand opens up, I shoot him dead.

People would flee, and probably not buy any magazines that day. In a way, it's almost worse than banning one magazine because it prevents *all* the magazines from being seen.

Now if I shot that guy dead, you could call me a murderer, and evil bastard, and a horrible person. But would you say I am anti free speech?

----------

Again sorry for the long response. In conclusion, you're right. The mass brigading yesterday in retaliation to the ban of FPH did, in a way, cause censorship of all other subs.

That being said, censorship was not the goal of FPH. The goal was effectively just to protest in a rude and unorthodox way.

For this reason, I do not believe FPH is anti free speech in any way, therefore I do not believe they are hypocritical in regards to this matter.",TheJerinator,t2_hph23,1,0,reddit3

cs3uy4k,t1_cs3u8nu,2015-06-12 03:21:12,MensRights,"This has been disproved many times.  It's been shown that whatever disparity there is between the mean salary of a man and the mean salary of a woman is due to the fact that men simply hold higher paying positions on average.  I can't remember all of the details given, but for example, a lot more women go into stuff like teaching (low average salary) vs. something like engineering (higher average salary) having way more men.  So while your average man might make more than your average woman, it's because men tend to go into higher paying fields than women do.  It is not because men get paid more for the same job.  A female engineer will make just as much as a male engineer.  If there is a problem here at all, it isn't one that can be fixed by increasing women's salaries in the workforce, therefore citing that statistic is useless and almost always fallacious.

This is perfectly in line with logic.  Pretty much all companies in all industries today operate in a hyper-competitive landscape.  If you could hire a woman to do the same job as a man for some percentage less salary, that's ALL you'd see.  Workplaces would be essentially 100% women until the disparity corrected itself.

Institutional authority, control over the mechanisms that define what behavior should be.  

It don't think it happened by design, but once the patterns of employment came into focus, it became a defacto objective.  

For instance?  Human resources.  I work for a big company, I don't think we have any male HR, and it's a big group.  Local and state bureaucrats.  I've talked to one man at the office that handles child support, over a 6 year period.  I have to go to the federal building to find a guy working.  Academic administrators, etc..   

Like I said, it wasn't intentional.  These were office jobs with mediocre pay and prestige.  They didn't require high risk degrees (forget the male female ratios of STEM versus other degrees, look at the drop out rates) or previous experience, so they became natural inlets for the expanding workforce.  And then one day someone noticed they already had control and started exerting it.

A mini documentary about a faction fighting in Syria was posted the other day. It was translated to English, and the video was full of extremist religious rhetoric, but some folks didn't want that part of the video discussed. 

Stupid, unnecessary, and impossible to discuss the subject without bringing up politics. Of course in came a dude who spends his time on reddit discussing Islam, and everyone is supposed to be PC, and let him have his say without saying anything back to him.

My advice, if u want to avoid any awkwardness or misconceptions, just say ur muslim and its against ur faith to touch a person of the opposite sex thats reached maturity and is NOT related to u by blood or marriage. Hugging a child isnt wrong cz its a child, unless ur a pedo then thats a diff issue. 

Even if ur not muslim, u can just lie and say u are for sake of saving urself from any awkwardness because nobody can knock u for following religious obligations right?

I get sexually harassed plenty in my city and zero of those men are in jail. Got sexually harassed at 2 different jobs, zero consequences for those men.

I work retail though and have noticed this change of behavior in many men - they panic if they touch my arm during convo or get too close to me. One guy refused to feel the fabric of the sweatpants his wife was trying on when she told him to feel it cuz #metoo, refused to touch a mannequin for the same reason, and felt the sweats on the actual shelf.

I was bemoaning the fact that kind dudes think they're a problem while assholes continue to be assholes, but here you are claiming women can get guys arrested with ease when zero women I know who have been raped saw their rapists face any consequences. Statistics back me up on this, so where is this concept coming from?

I think she gaped at you in astonishment because claiming a hug is somehow connected to #metoo shows an astonishing lack of understanding of the issue. A consensual hug isn't a problem, and claiming a large chunk of women are waiting for a chance to pretend you assaulted them during a hug is bizarre.

I don't find her sexually attractive. I'm in a long-term relationship. I have absolutely no interest in her boobies, as you put it. I have all the boobie I need, and my own chest is not particularly manly.

I've been in a long-term relationship since the late 2000s, which was before modern identity politics weighed in so heavily. I'm very, very pleased not to have to play the dating game at this point, though honestly, I never did; we met through work.

At this point, I am honestly not sure that there is any way whatsoever for a man to approach a woman romantically without risking being accused of something awful. In this thread, someone mentioned a situation in which a man wrote a woman a note confessing his feelings for her, and *that* was a career-ender. I can't imagine a more passive way of making the approach. In my youth I wrote letters like that, including one which led to a relationship about which I have fond memories to this day. I remain in contact with the person involved and she's a good friend of mine. Am I a bad person?

And even non-romantically, things are getting difficult. In my country, there are at least some areas where police forces record, as an ""incident"" rather than a crime, anything perceived, by anyone, as misogyny, racism, or several other fashionable categories of personal offence. These records, despite not being criminal in nature, will show up on a criminal records check. There is no way to object to them or have them removed. Guidelines for making those records included ""uninitiated contact"" involving a man speaking to a woman.

Put simply, this guideline seeks to *almost but not quite* criminalise... well, all contact between men and women that wasn't initiated by the woman, which includes almost all romantic relationships and quite a lot of professional ones. Any man making any statement\* to any woman, for any reason, at any time, under any circumstances, including walking into a room and saying ""hello,"" risks being listed as a sex pest. All the woman has to is walk into a police station, give them the guy's name and that *she felt it was an incident of misogyny.* The police are required to record it as such and the man will find himself abruptly unemployable.

When that's the case, what the hell are youngsters supposed to do about finding a partner?

In most modern western countries, if you were to make a complaint to the police that I had sexually assaulted you, the police would arrest me as soon as they could find me.

To be fair this is true for a lot of crimes as police officers often have arrest targets to meet, but law enforcement are under a lot of pressure to be seen as tough on this sort of crime in particular.

But the real point is this: if I was arrested for punching someone in the face or robbing them on the street, it wouldn't ruin my life.

>zero women I know who have been raped saw their rapists face any consequences. Statistics back me up on this, so where is this concept coming from?

I suspect you're referring to statistics about successful *prosecutions* for rape. We're all painfully aware how difficult it is to prosecute rape, simply because most people have sex in private.

But it's not really about prosecution. Imagine it was you: ""u/Effective-Walrus1157 arrested for rape!"". Bear in mind it takes a year or more for these things to come to court and in that time the alleged perpetrator is effectively treated as guilty. He may spend that time in prison, especially if he is poor. If not, he's likely to be banned from travelling. His partner may leave him. Women who might have befriended him will avoid him. Long term friends will desert him. He will be thrown out of clubs and societies. If he has or works with kids, he'll lose his family, his home, and his job.

If he's never convicted he may be theoretically allowed to attempt to rebuild his life... but by that point he'll have been replaced at work, he'll have lost his pension and other employment benefits such as healthcare, club positions he held may have been filled, his wife may already have divorced him, his kids may have been taken by their mother or placed into care and alienated from him... it's no surprise that people in this situation sometimes commit suicide, regardless their guilt or innocence.

That is the power you wield.

&#x200B;

>A consensual hug isn't a problem

That's a very common answer from women, I'm afraid. The hug is OK in your eyes, because you are in total control of whether it's OK, including forcing it on me when I don't want it, (everyone will laugh at me because I'm supposed to like it) or changing your mind later. You can do anything you like, and society is fine with it. I'm faced with the choice of rejecting the hug and being laughed at, or accepting it at risk of all the things I mentioned above. It doesn't make me very happy. It wouldn't make you very happy.

&#x200B;

>claiming a large chunk of women are waiting for a chance to pretend you assaulted them during a hug is bizarre.

I have made no such claim. I actually think it's fairly rare, if only because seriously falling out with people in general is fairly rare. The problem is that the consequences are so utterly horrific that it makes me behave with an abundance of caution.

You might say you'd never do any of these things, and that's probably true, because you're probably not a complete sociopath. The problem is, when I've just met you, I don't know that. And the consequences for me are so horrifying that you can probably understand my caution, even if it's very unlikely that any given woman is a potential problem.

If you don't like this situation, and I certainly don't, please speak out when your female friends are laughing about how powerful they are. Your reaction may be ""Wonderful, women should be powerful,"" but at the end of the day it means you're powerful like an unexploded bomb. It's an almost entirely destructive power, and I don't think that's the kind of power anyone should want to have.

You have to find some extremely narrowly-defined statistical data, such as the example you give about ex-partner homicide, to find a very specific situation where women are a higher proportion of murder victims than men. I would suggest that is politically-motivated reasoning.

In a wider sense, one thing that's really worth keeping in mind in situations like this is how significant the data is. The easiest way to get your head round this is to consider a group of 100 people, in which, say, one person likes mint ice cream. Find one other person who likes it, and you've gone from 1% to 2%. The rate has doubled! Sounds dramatic. But it's actually gone from ""very low"" to ""still very low,"" and in reality we're actually talking about *one person*.

In the same way, clearly, lots of romantic breakups happen every year. Probably tens of millions in the USA alone. Only a very, very tiny proportion of them end in someone committing murder. You could look up those numbers and do the mathematics to figure out if it's statistically significant, but I'll hazard a guess that we're talking about some very, very small proportion of the whole. It is not reasonable to encourage half the population to live in fear based on that (and it'd also be victim blaming, if you accept the concept of victim blaming in the sense it's often applied, which I'm cautious about, but that's another issue).

But that's actually irrelevant to what we are (or should be) trying to achieve. If your goal is to minimise the amount of harm that happens to people, then basing your approach on the needs of the most-harmed group would seem to make sense, and in the sense of simple interpersonal violence that is not women, at least unless  you start salami-slicing the statistics down into ever thinner pieces.",Huffers1010,t2_a0xsse2g,2,0,reddit4

Not to be that guy but life is hypocritical. I can tell you wholeheartedly I wouldn't die for any woman on the street. I would give my life for my girlfriend though. The difference? Any woman on the street is just that. Some woman. I have known my girlfriend since we were children. We were best friends for years and now we have been dating for well over 5 years. Plan to be married in a few years as well.

 The difference is background. People seem to think life runs on yes and no and thats that. Logic in life Is more akin to if-then statements. IF a random woman who i don't know is in danger, THEN why would I put my life on the line? Similarly, IF a woman who I have known since I was a few years old, have thousands of memories with, and I have considered my best friend for over a decade, THEN I would be much more willing to take the same risk. 

Hypocrisy is a fluff arguement. You know nothing of the nature of the relationship. Who's to say me and my girlfriend haven't already had a discussion about her being able to hug me whenever she wants? If we have talked about having a free-use relationship, someone looking in would think that its rape. The difference is communication and background.

In the situation OP posted, the OP does not know the woman. He has no background. She very well could have moved from another state after having falsely accused a man there.

So basically you're scared of crazy women the way I'm scared of crazy men, but for entirely different reasons. Fair.

I know a guy who was falsely accused of rape. He lucked out because a female friend was staying in his guest room and heard the whole thing - a woman he'd been seeing drunk called him at 3am, invited herself over, fooled around with him in the kitchen giggling the whole time, stopped him randomly, and the next day the cops showed up to where he worked.

My mom has untreated borderline personality disorder and falsely accused my dad of physical assault. He went to jail for the night. When I point to this story as an example of why men are scared of false accusations, I've had women online go off all caps on me for daring to say some women are liars because this apparently hurts the women who aren't liars, which is ridiculous.

Anyway, I get men are scared sometimes.

I guess the whole thing saddens me. #metoo certainly hasn't stopped rapists and creeps and sexual harassers. It has made decent men terrified to be around women. And that sucks really hard for all of us. I swear I get less interaction from decent guys and more interaction from bad ones now.

You did a great job explaining the social consequences vs. the legal consequences for men. We're seeing that with Chris Noth right now, so I get it.

I guess to me it feels like men are saying ""okay, you don't like being sexually harassed at work? Fine, we won't interact with you at all."" But I guess it's far more nuanced and complicated than that. I've been sexually harassed 4 times at work, aka most men are decent guys, but there's a decent number of shitheads too. And one guy was just dense/socially awkward, he was a boss who kept asking me out, I asked our owner if we could do a sexual harassment seminar saying don't ask out your own employees, that was great because we didn't embarrass the guy or punish him, he just realized he shouldn't be asking out people below him at work.

The others were an old guy everyone let slide, a musician the music venue didn't dare stand up against cuz money who was so awful I had a panic attack at work before quitting, and a cook at that same music venue who got fired immediately. Men with money get protected, men without money don't, and like you said they'll stay in jail waiting to be proven innocent.

It's all shit and I hate it. I'm sorry you have to worry a woman might lie about you and therefore be cautious. I'm sorry I have to worry about creeps and therefore am cautious. Ugh.",,,3,0,reddit4

not to be that guy but speak for yourself.  
your whole monologue about ""the background you have with a girl than a stranger"":  
your emotions are clouding your judgment.  
1. A woman has even more incentive to harm you if there is a relationship that involves emotional attachment, because she has a lot more expectations and if she feels hurt or fed up with you, cruelty is much more likely. it is a simple psychological principle. statistics support this of course, nearly 100% of false accusations and violence (apart from wars) occur in connection with or within emotionally attached relationships of some kind.  
2. you said you'd be willing to sacrifice your life for your girlfriend but not for a stranger, well congratulations! just know that it is almost certain that she would not do the same for you.  
both cultural and purely biological influences push her in the opposite direction, the maximum sacrifice she has prepared will be for her biological children, in this perspective you are only a means to an end.  
3. you talk about the past, that you two have known each other for many years etc ... as if this were a proof that it could not do you anything unfair in the future! you're practically ignoring the fact that even couples who divorce badly have spent years together. in parentheses: how many times have husbands said that their wife has changed after marriage or after children, etc.  
and you would like to predict the future based only on the fact that you have memories together and you have spent years, it makes no sense. people are not static, they change.  
do you think newly wed couples expect it, that it will go wrong? no, because they are wrapped in the blurred idea of ​​the partner, sentimentality dominates.  
""Hypocrisy is a fluff arguement.""  
no. you still have to explain why.  
You know nothing of the nature of the relationship. ""  
the nature of the relationship? lol I'll explain it to you in summary:  
\- the first meeting takes place, assumptions about the other's qualities are unconsciously formulated in the first 7 seconds  
\- basic communicative exchanges take place, plus the first reaction to the smell and the reciprocal magnetic energy  
\- time passes, the memories associated with positivity are higher than those associated with negativity, the thought manipulates the memories by forming images with the imagination that stimulate the desire to see that person again  
\- further relational exchanges take place, the prejudices associated with positivity are confirmed, the mental image that one has built about the other is strengthened  
\- eventually there are discrepancies between your prejudicial expectations and what the other shows you, your mental image of the other changes accordingly but only if the cognitive processing of the perceived is not impeded by emotionality or sentimentality  
\- there is a jump in the relationship with an increase in intimacy, an increase in emotional attachment, expectations, dreaming phantasmagorias etc., physical contact can also form a slight biological dependence on the oxytocin produced  
\- further changes occur but your interpretation of her as a person is too entangled with emotional contents to be able to have a guide free from interference, expectations and emotions are too galvanized  
\- subsequently after another time the positive contents in spite of everything are interpreted by the mind as superior to the negatives, which due to a process of bias are minimized, enhancing the positives, the selective memory supported by what has been invested in the relationship by now pushes in that direction; your own life is perceived as interconnected with his because your own identity is too diluted in this mixture  
\- ....  
I don't need to know the details, you are a person like any other, the psychological structure, how the mind works etc. follows laws that apply to everyone.  
""The difference is communication and background""  
as I said earlier, this does not mean anything, on the contrary the background encourages if something goes wrong to react with cruelty because it is more emotionally invested in it and the wound therefore hurts more, furthermore communication is only words, it could always manipulate or lie, or which is the most frequent thing: to change over time. because people are not static.  
""For personal or familial relationships, there's background which you can use to dictate your logic""  
the past is just an unreliable indicator, each person changes both biologically and psychologically. it is a fact of nature that you seem to ignore, at work if you have to hire a person it is necessary to apply these statistically relevant measures, because it falls within the strict necessity of your task. but with extra-family personal relationships, in which you are ""free"" to choose whether to deal with them or not. therefore the choice, not being necessary, does not follow the same logic and you can be EVEN more prudent and not less because of the background!

""Hypocrisy does not take perspective""  
to be honest it is exactly the opposite! hypocrisy is based on a contradiction between the said and the fact or between the thought and the said etc. This has to do 100% with personal subjective perception.  
hypocrisy is not just a word to use to indicate the ugliness of politicians, as do the newspapers. it is an active psychological condition that distorts the mind, it is a real pathology of thinking.",Professional_Two_845,t2_7t2s4f84,3,0,reddit4

Then broaden your imagination. I wouldn't voluntarily come into physical contact with any woman other than my girlfriend or mother, regardless of age or attractiveness (again, look up what happened to a guy called Mark Pearson; the woman concerned, whose name is effectively public, was in her sixties at the time). A man would concern me less, because he has far less ability to cause serious problems simply by making an accusation, although I don't think I've ever once had a man try to hug me.

It's my experience that people, particularly young women, who (believe they) are attractive are more likely to engage in unwanted touching and it's [known they enjoy some sociological benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/business/worldbusiness/06iht-beauty.html), meaning this woman's attractiveness actually represents an increased risk to me. In short, she's not romantically engaging, she's frightening.

But in all seriousness, the distinction here is between your fears personally, and population-level statistics.

If you've been made to feel unsafe by someone, man or woman, who behaved unreasonably then, obviously, effectively nobody thinks that's good. I don't want you to feel unsafe. I don't want anyone to feel unsafe.

However, what's quite a lot more important than anyone's emotions is the big pile of dead men. I suspect you agree that someone *actually* being dead is a lot worse than someone *fearing* being dead.

I notice a terrible tendency among women to want to control the narrative here, to claim that women have it worse than men no matter the facts, and that does not help anyone. Nobody is approving of violence to anyone, of harassment of anyone by anyone else, but you need to get your head around the fact that this point of view is simply not supported by the facts. No matter how bad your personal experiences may be, and I sympathise, women do not, at a population level, have it worse than men. Men have it worse than women, by a lot. I'm not here to celebrate that fact or treat it as some sort of victory, but please, try to step back and look at this dispassionately.

In this speech you are having with the OP, you are assuming that taking precautionary measures regarding possible false accusations are necessarily dependent on a sense of fear that dominates his life. this is not necessarily the case.  
it would be like saying that if a person wears a seat belt in the car, he is living his life in fear!  
do you see the absurdity of your gross assumption?  
taking security measures, as far as humanly possible is farsighted, and wise  
  
""Furthermore; men, women, it doesn't matter.""  
courts around the world disagree! lol  
  
""Men living in fear of dating women""  
are you generalizing, who are you talking to? not for sure with the OP since he didn't mention dating in his comment. the truth is, believe it or not: you can live very well without it. without being afraid of it.  
  
""I live in the now. Not the what could be or the what has been.""  
this is probably one of the most absurdly false things you have said. it is literally impossible for you to live in the now, your mind continually projects towards the future, speculates on the information it accumulates, and looks to the past continuously. your own previous comments disprove what you said!  
report below some of these sentences of yours:  
""I have known my girlfriend since we were children. We were best friends for years and now we have been dating for well over 5 years. Plan to be married in a few years as well.""  
  
""The difference is background.""  
  
""I have known since I was a few years old, have thousands of memories with, and I have considered my best friend for over a decade""  
  
""Who's to say me and my girlfriend haven't already had a discussion about""  
  
etc  
  
but you said you live in the now! So why do you care about the background or the memories? if you live in the now you are not based on memories, nor on previous information! you contradicted yourself. again.  
  
""I live in the now. Not the what could be or the what has been.""  
second round: this also implies that you never make plans, you don't work waiting for a salary at the end of the month because living in the now implies not having the ability to think about the future and have expectations. it also implies not learning from the past. it also means not knowing how to speak or write in a language because to do so you need to remember how to do it even unconsciously etc.  
""Learn from your life experiences.""  
by your own implicit admission this is something that is impossible for you to do because you live in the now.  
  
""I personally feel that by assuming all women are false accusers""  
this sentence is probably the reason why the OP has thought about not answering you anymore. but since I have free time at the moment I'll do it ;)  
congratulations you just committed a logical fallacy called the straw-man argument! because what you wrote is a distortion of the argument presented by the OP which has nothing to do with what is implied. that's absolutely not what he meant.  
  
""There are no good people and no bad people. There are people that make bad decisions because they have been hurt, or they feel it will benefit them in some way.

If someone you'd never met followed you home and spent all night hammering on the door and yelling, that's quite another, but in most sane parts of the world the latter behaviour will quite rightly get someone arrested. We would need to discuss exactly what you mean by terms like ""stalking,"" and these days the meaning even of words like ""rape"" has been blurred by people making dubious claims, which I regret as much as I suspect you do.

In the context of what you say about men somehow being free to stalk women, I would point out that at least one police organisation in my country has begun recording ""misogynistic hate crime"" using absurdly broad criteria including ""uninitiated contact."" Yes, you read that right; under those rules, literally any statement, any statement whatsoever, made by any man, to any woman, at any time, under any circumstances, for any reason, including ""excuse me"" or ""hello"", is now recordable by the police if he spoke first and if she claims it was misogynistic. These records show up when people apply for jobs. No evidence is required, there is no due process, and the record can never be expunged.

You may claim that the people who wrote these rules didn't really *mean* to create that situation, they're relying on the fact that *obviously* all women are lovely and would never falsely use that against anyone... but claims that the concerns of women around unpleasantness from men are not being taken seriously are *ludicrous*. We're getting to the point where it can be seriously proposed to suspend due process in the case of rape trials simply to improve the statistics, or to set curfews for men, and the people who make these suggestions *keep their jobs*.

Here's the problem. Normally, society has checks and balances to ensure that the views of completely crazy people, or people made temporarily crazy by grief, anger or intoxication, are downplayed, and we don't overreact. That means that if someone pinches someone's backside when he's drunk, he'll likely get a smack across the face, and everyone goes home with the matter concluded. That does mean that if someone makes a habit of it and keeps on pinching backsides, he can likely get away with it for a while before his reputation starts to precede him, which is not great, but that's the price of a sane society.

What we have now is a society where there are no checks and no balances on the behaviour of people from certain groups. That's identity politics, correctness through group identity as opposed to facts, and that's the problem. I suspect we agree on that.",Huffers1010,t2_a0xsse2g,6,0,reddit4

My male boss and I have a great relationship where we can say anything, but you're assuming because I pointed out women get raped and stalked sans repercussion, that means you need to be terrified of women always, which is such a leap I don't have words.

You made your views clear. You clearly focus more on supposed consequences for men than actual consequences for women. If you want to back up your claim men are now being penalized for mere unitiated contact, please do. If it's just some random possible pipeline law in one district, admit that.

Here in reality women are already going through it and you're whipping out a *possibility* of consequences for men as this giant counterpoint. It isn't. Like I said, zero rapists of people I know who have been raped faced any consequences. Zero stalkers I've heard about faced any consequences. If you had at least pretended to give a fuck about those topics, you might have convinced me you cared about both sides, but you clearly only care when men might face anything.

Step back and actually look, with dispassion, at what we've both said here.

It's not my instinct to start repeating myself, but in the interests of clarity, I will.

I think I said it first - crimes such as rape are notoriously difficult to prosecute because most people have sex in private. Nobody likes that fact. Nobody supports that fact. Nobody's happy about that fact.

Equally, men face public violence at a vastly higher rate than women and you need to get used to that reality. It's not a competition, but if you want to make it one, men have it worse. A lot worse. 

If I were to take the same sort of position you're currently taking, I would accuse you of not caring about the violent death of innocent people. Notice I'm not doing that, because I'm not crazy enough to believe that's your actual opinion, and I'd appreciate the same basic courtesy from you.

The article shows a person committing emotional abuse and then calling it emotional labour, along with controlling behaviour.

It doesn't matter if you acknowledge it because you are not going to doing anything about it, or if you do, you would only change your behaviour for a very short period before  slipping back into bad behaviour.

&#x200B;

I'm more concerned about the slippery slope this has led to, especially that 2nd link you provided.

That kind of abuse( and yes it is abuse) leads to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse when they realise that they can't get the kind of fear response they want from you and then psychological abuse. I consider psychological abuse to be far worst because its the one that is hardest to pinpoint and the longest lasting( sometimes leading to indirect death through mental health, depression and suicide).

maybe the worst part of all of this is the double standards that are applied to people based on their gender by letting women off the hook for their behaviour, but somehow men are monsters if they do this( I don't believe it is acceptable for anyone regardless of gender).

This has a very detrimental effect on society, and we only have to look at the legal system to see how my damage it does to men,women and their children.

fathers very often have little choice but to accept all the abuse in its various forms or to risk never seeing their children again( even when they become adults you will lose them)

... all from the small innocuous abuse labelled under the pretext  of  ""emotional labour""",rahsoft,t2_61t4h0c,3,0,reddit1

There are women complaining that their spouses are lazy, and thinking that applies to all men. There are men complaining that their spouses are abusive, and thinking that applies to all women. Can we just acknowledge that a certain percentage of people in general suck, and that this isn't a male or female thing?

The emotional labor argument can be a real thing. Sometimes there are couples where the man expects the woman to do all of the cooking, cleaning, planning, etc. when they're both working full time jobs. Those are reasonable expectations for a stay at home mom, but not for someone who works the same number of hours. Those women are rightfully upset at the men who refuse to do their share.

And sometimes it's the opposite, a man doing his part but a woman who doesn't do her share or endlessly nags her spouse because nothing is ever good enough... and occasionally those women claim to be the ones being wronged because they're doing ""emotional labor"" of being a never satisfied control freak. But that doesn't mean the first scenario never happens.

Anyway, I'm sure the reverse of this will show up on TwoX any day now, how ""nagging"" is the term man use when they want to be lazy but still insult the person doing all of the work, or something like that...",chocoboat,t2_4ure3,12,0,reddit1

h41kvai,t3_odi2ma,2021-07-04 17:35:37,MensRights,"I think there’s a disconnect here between what women are saying regarding emotional labor, and how it’s being interpreted here. Emotional labor in general is a pretty broad term, but it encompasses a variety of different soft skills which are easy to overlook.

While it can seem as though nothing is enough, that’s not really true. Think of it this way, a relationship is a house, and each person involved helps to build the house, working together on the foundation, individual rooms, and so on. The things that go into building this house can be just about anything you do as a couple, whether it’s dates, lunch, chores, meeting with friends, watching Netflix, making decisions together, etc. So when the term emotional labor is used, it usually means some kind of imbalance which either wasn’t agreed upon or hasn’t been addressed is going on while constructing this house. For example, a woman planning a Mother’s Day outing for her mother might find the number of tasks between deciding where to go, what to get, what to make for dinner, etc. overwhelming, especially if there isn’t much time do so. This is where her partner could make her life significantly easier, whether it’s in the physical tasks of preparing the day or the emotional/mental labor of planning parts of the day. While it may not necessarily be “your job”, it clearly demonstrates interest and engagement with both your partner, their family, and the relationships that your partner has with their mother.

We can extend this into everyday living with your partner, whether you’re building your house with a date, a dinner, lunch, meeting with friends, all of it requires some amount of planning, most of which can be fairly open ended(“What should I make”, “What should I wear”, “Where should we go”, “What should we watch”, etc.). If you’re in a relationship where your partner is making most of those decisions, then over time it’s going to come off as though your partner is doing most of the labor to build the house, while you’re just enjoying the scenery.

I don’t want to discount the fact that, inevitably, emotionally abusive women exist, in the same vein that emotionally abusive men exist. But by jumping to categorize all women, or most women, as one thing or the other, we lose their perspective and don’t get to appreciate the nuances between people that make each of us who we are. A little empathy can go a long way in understanding where exactly many women are coming from whether they’re frustrated about emotional labor, or another uncomfortable experience they’ve had. 

Hopefully all that makes sense, feel free to message me with any other questions though.",allyeet,t2_42osunau,-4,0,reddit1

Edit: You should probably use those cRiTiCaL tHiNkInG skills everyone always preaches about in these manosphere subreddits to consider The Federalist is a right-wing rag, and that your post is making several fallacious assumptions to paint women with a broadstrokes mentality that will do you more harm than good. You made some very tenous hypothetical scenarios to portray a ""bitchy"" and abusive woman and sloppily applied terms like ""emotional labour"" to this strawman argument that I do not quite understand, other than it sounds very similar to a very hyperbolic and toxic mentality of ""NiceGuy"" or ""NotLikeTheOtherGirl"" types. Perhaps a controlling woman is controlling, but that doesn't make things like ""emotional labour"" an oppressive tool that *every woman uses* in some conspiratorial end to what, erode your sense of self worth and masculinity? This term can also be referred to as emotional intelligence and it isn't necessarily an exact science or measurable trait so much as a practiced quality of individuals' personalities and an area of psychology. To have a high degree of self-awareness or be a high self-monitor might mean lower neuroticism or higher conscientiousness and other big five O.C.E.A.N traits that might describe emotionally competent people.

One bone I have to pick with your post is your framing of that bazaar post in a very dubious light. The sentiment of the article of ""Women Aren't Nags - We're Just Fed Up"" is that an incredulous partner ought to pick up the slack in what today is a more equitable world anyway. It's a very childish mentality to think women in domestic partnerships today asking for a thoughtful gift like a house cleaning service for a day is somehow an indication of being an abusive woman. How about the schlubby husband who's too cheap to want to do that but instead do it himself (maybe poorly) or buy something else to appease a very simple need? How about the front facing roles women are often relegated to in the workforce still today (bUt wHy dOn'T tHeY jUsT gO iNtO STEM?) have to deal with disproprtionately more emotionally draining people in their services, all while being ""nice"" or a ""bitch"" if she shows any dip in emotional job intelligence of her own? And then when she returns home from work and her husband is too incredulous to have that understanding, it sounds like yeah, maybe he *is* a bit of a dud. All of your post oozes some angry frustration that women don't know their place, and if not, I'm all ears given my unfair generalizations must be the only ones in this thread.

If not, you're undeniably participating in a toxic part of reddit and general online culture of the so called manosphere that bleeds over into the MGTOW movement, TheRedPill, WalkAway, Incels and other nefarious or sketchy parts of the internet that lend themselves to fostering hatred and bigotry in men in particular.

.1. ""Emotional labor"" is just a shit test BS term. Ignore it or agree and amplify it into ridiculous levels. 

.2. Why are you doing chores trying to please her? No seriously, why? I can think of 3 reasons.

a. You want her to be happy because then she'll give sex. **Answer**: Doing chores will never impress her in a fashion that makes her want to have sex, full stop, if that is your only reason just stop now.

b. You feel guilty because she is berating you about things you haven't done. **Answer**: Clean up your shit before she has a chance to talk to you about it, own your mess and be an adult. If you are already doing this but she doesn't give you even 5 minutes to clean up after yourself before then she doesn't respect you and this is just a symptom of other relationship problems.

Why are you ""helping"" around YOUR house? This is your house, whatever you do isn't helping her, it's your God damn house. Even if she is on the deed/lease too, that just means it's half hers as well. Change your mindset immediately. You aren't helping her, you're helping yourself.

c. You've been slacking and you feel the need to announce it when you actually do something. **Answer**: See the above. be an adult. Hold her to the same standards you set yourself.

.3. If any of the above is true, fix yo shit. You don't have to listen to her complain, but her complaining is just a symptom of relationship problems that she doesn't know how to fix, and really only you can fix them. 

Men and women aren't equal when it comes to, well nearly everything besides civil rights (really not there either, women currently have more civil rights).


.4. (SITUATIONAL) If she is a stay at home type while you work, why are you doing anything again? Unless she is working from home or raising multiple children of YOURS, you need to be clear with her on her expectations and delegate that to her. Be a leader and tell her what to do if she isn't doing it.


99% of this is fixed just by you being a proactive leader in the relationship instead waiting around for her to complain. Being a proactive leader will have the side benefit of making her panties moist too, so it's a win win for both of you.

>Then comes the fun part: Nothing you do will satisfy her. You'll be scolded and called ""incompetent"" for getting the tiniest of details wrong. You're not good enough, and you never will be. Not unless you read her mind perfectly, because she can't bother explaining things to you; she shouldn't have to.

>Any confidence you had in yourself is gone, and you stop doing those things you wanted to; you always get them wrong, anyways. This is the real kicker: Now you'll be blamed for not doing enough. You're now a lazy bum, a manchild, a mama's boy. You depend on her for everything, and she can't take it, so she takes it out on you. ""I don't have to ask you to help! You should know already!"". That's the part that gets you. ""You should know already."" You should already know what she needs help doing. You should already be doing the thing. You should already know exactly how to do the thing, to the last detail. You should already know all that, and the only reason you don't is because you're not good enough.

This is probably the best description of emotional labor I've ever read. Being degraded like that fucks you up, it's abusive even though there's no physical harm. Don't dismiss emotional labor, if you do you're just letting them co-opt the term from real workers.",ctsgre,t2_8yzhj7i1,9,0,reddit1

I understand it's a problem to have a nagging controlling partner. I know it can make you feel like some domain of everyday life just isn't your own because they're acting like they own it.

But the man in the story sounds like he doesn't consider household chores his obligation. When he does them, he feels like he's ""helping out."" He feels like he should be told what to do. Should grown adults be told to wash the dishes or do the laundry or are those basic things just expected of everyone? And then he complains he can't read her mind because he wasn't told to do a normal everyday chore that everyone should just do.

Of course, the situation is different if she's not working and he is. Or if they have some agreement on who does what and he does his own fair share, but then she expects more.

But the way it was written makes it sound like the men feel virtuous or helpful for doing basic things they'd be doing anyway if they lived alone.

Again, if they were made to feel that way by a controlling woman who always considers herself a manager of the household, but then gets mad when others start expecting her to be, I get that. But I'm not sure from OP whether that's the case or whether the man didn't do his fair share to begin with.

EDIT: Or even if he did his fair share, did he consider that as a favor to the woman because he thinks of it as her responsibility somehow.

ETA: besides household stuff. Relationship stuff. ""Hey babe, its YOUR FAMILY or YOUR FRIEND'S special day, i picked up the cake and balloons and card, can you write something in it?"" Then when all you do is sign your name your partner is abusive for being upset about it?

There's bro codes for how to act but the stuff you learned as a kid just flies out the window because you're in a relationship?",,,-17,0,reddit1
h44ga6f,t1_h43q3le,2021-07-05 12:40:07,MensRights,"To get started I’ll first disagree with your use of always, only a Sith deals in absolutes 😉. As far as why men are more often told to empathize, while I’m no expert and havent educated myself in women and gender studies, as I understand it boils down to a very large set of historical and cultural trends between 1-3rd wave feminism and the long standing historical status of women who’ve generally had less economic, social, and political power than their male peers. So what’s expressed today is generally a reaction both to those historical developments, and to those individuals in someone’s life who demonstrate a lack of empathy or interest in engaging their partner, with the affirmation of others who’ve experienced similar circumstances of disengagement.

Regarding the “oppression olympics”, that has to do more directly with what I mentioned above with men historically holding the majority of economic, social, and political power, and oppression typically operates from those who have more power against those who have less, but that is not to say anything of someone’s individual circumstances. Individually and interpersonally we’d need to get back into the nuances of someone’s personal life, not necessarily to “out-oppress” someone else, but to understand who they are as a person, because obviously broad generalizations inevitably hit walls when reaching individuals, and that nuance can easily be lost when talking about historical and systemic trends.

<DEEP BREATH>

The house if fine being it whatever condition it finds itself in, it is the people in the house who have the problem.

If there is such a thing as ""emotional labor"" to begin with, in a partnership the degree to which it is shared must be agreed upon...just like every other shared resource or liability in the relationship.

People have different standards and tolerances for the conditions in a household. I have no problem letting the pre-rinsed dishes stack up in the drying rack until there is enough to run a load, but my wife insists the ""correct"" place for them is in the dishwasher.  Am I an immature partner because I don't do it her way?

My wife likes to let (clean) laundry pile up around her part of the bedroom rather than put it in away. I like to put my stuff directly into the closet and dresser. Is my wife immature because she refuses to put her laundry ""away"" like I do?

Problems like this occur when people have different expectations about a shared experience, and do not effectively communicate it with one another.

I will not agree or disagree about the situation being hyper specific, but this is a common enough occurrence to talk about.

What I'm trying to get at here is the focusing on why the term exist, when feminist we talking about the idea of the ""second shift"" and emotional labor, it come from a place where we as a society view the work that men and women do as inherently equal. Feminist were try to vocalize a feeling that alot of women have that there was a level of inequality, one that as you say was not easily quantifiable. And further more one which they were forbidden to talk about In the past.

> I'm not pretending like men are saints here. They have got to get their shit together. Nagging isn't something you do to a partner, it is something for close family or a marriage that has lasted a long time deserves that privilege. 

This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side. I think it is a sign of a healthy relationship where you know what your partner wants, and I think it's natural to want a partner who understands you. It almost seems like your saying ""women are expecting a level of intimacy on to a relationship that is just not present"" which is fair but is def a case by case issue.

> I do not belive that emotional labor is exclusively on the men like women presented in this post say it is NOT women as a whole

100% agree, there are plenty of situations where it might come into play for men, which is why I think it's extra important bit to throw out the term.",xlem1,t2_hxwv6,1,0,reddit1

I agree with this, but I would like to clarify that because the concept gets misused a lot it is something that deserves to be placed under a critical lense and people should be willing to explore this when someone does believe something is unfair to their situation. So calling out the difference is important and people need to look at it more objectively than they seem to.

>This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable

Yes, in a relationship you do not talk AT your partner, you talk to them and with them to problem solve together. Nagging is after decades of being together and still being able to focus in what's important to maintaining the relationship. Women should not be nagging men because in a general sense men are working a lot of hours and so may not be 100% when getting home or even on a day off. And this comes to the next pint of your quote,

>. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side.

This should never be a full on expectation. I expect my partner to do basic tasks and handle responsibilities, the ""mind reading"" aspect is something that only happens after long-term commitment and truly being able to work through issues. Relationships can be fun but they are work and a lot of people (mainly women) seem to not understand this, and if they do they want to have it as easy as possible.

Some of the issues we're seeing here in regards to emotional labor is its invisible and outright dismissal. Take for example OP post, the idea that ""planning stuff"" is framed as not really work. When it most certainly is, we literally have whole occupations for this, secretaries. So when these issues are brought up and discussed it is important to realize, it's not just about the work being unequal, it that the work is unequal, and we don't even realize how unequal it is.

That is not to say men don't ever do anything that women don't recognize, but I think it is important not to dismiss trying to be more open about the rolls people play. Often times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

Like imagine we we at a job together, and I was venting to you about how hard I work, and how I get no help from other staff members, and your response was, well I work hard too, sometimes harder! It just comes off as tone deaf and not really solving the problem. 

I do think we should be more open about the work and effort men put into a relationship, talking about things that are taken for granted. like men being forced into leadership roles in the relationship. If mens rights issues are to be taken seriously>!!< that's what should be done. But, it can't come at the cost of attacking women's issues, issues that historically and even currently in some areas, have been silenced.

I can see what you're saying but I think the framing is incorrect. None of what is being mentioned in the posts about the partner doing enough is talking enough about what a man does. She glosses over the intricacies of mens work on cars, lawns, sports etc. It's easy to feel like you're partner isn't doing enough when you see them sitting after they consider ""their work"" finished. Many fathers come home and don't outsource their duties unless they have to whether because of time, parts etc. And most guys are willing to split the load even if they are tired from work, even if they just finished with cars, sports, lawn work this that and the other It's not accurate and these women don't even mention what their husband's do for work in these posts. I'm not throwing a pity party but understand that men don't just leave the house to fool around and then come home.

> times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

I understand but part of the reason is that a lot of women today hold high standards and expectations of men to do a lot for a job. Then on top of that they need help with house work. Men have to do a lot because of womens standards of men today.

I do believe we need to be more open about these issues but there won't be true equality because we will always have to pull weight more in some areas vs others. Does this mean men should be slobs and careless no. I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age.

Let me put it another way, I don't care to get a laundry list of what each person does and compare the two. I think it's honestly reductive and ultimately unhelpful in the grand scheme of things. What I do care about is talking about the things that one or the other don't know is happening, or how much work it actually is. 

I already know the wife does the cleaning, and the husband mows the lawn. Why should we talk about things we already know? Why not focus on the thinks that are not very apparent, like how stressful it can be constantly have to keep track of everything in the house, how hard it can be to maintain a calendar, or the checkbook. Most people take for granted the idea that these things happen and are easy, but they're not and can be a burden. Where as mowing the lawn, I know hard and time consuming that is.

> I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age. I would like to hear your thoughts on this.

You talk alot about cars and mowing the lawn, but you realize these are things that happen once a week at best. Realistically Most care stuff is once every 3 months at best. And that's assuming that a man is doing that. Depending on your income bracket it's not all that strange to take your car in for an oil chang instead of doing it yourself ect. Where as dishes and cooking are done every day, cleaning is an ongoing process, and keeping track of appointments and what you have is constant.

Like again I really don't want to compare and contrast here, but when we are talking about emotional labor, saying men do thing once every so often vs the constant burden of maintaining a household it will come off as shallow. To use an analogy women are put in to role of manager and work, while men just get to be worker. When talking emotional labor, women want men to take some of that Manger role.

Like we live in a world where men and women almost work jobs almost just as much. Especially if there are no children it's pretty rare for a couple where 1 is full time and one is stay at home. Why should we hold to a standards of a time where that was the case?",xlem1,t2_hxwv6,1,0,reddit1

This right here is worth highlight because it's true. Because of how we evolved both biologically and then as we developed successful civilization, women are inherently valuable for their womb. Their most valuable natural asset, their physical attractiveness, is front-loaded so that they are able to reproduce quickly in their most able years. Men absolutely start well below women and have to prove their worth and utility. Men who do not do so are far less likely to successfully reproduce and far more likely to hold low social status. Where some complain that women are only valued as reproductive vessels by society what is left off is that men are only valued as tools.

This is not an argument for moral truth, because it's not one. This is just a fact of our biology and our evolution as social creatures. Rejection of this facet of reality is also a core sacred belief of all of the applied postmodern social movements; which unsurprisingly undermine and destroy everything they touch.",Emfuser,t2_dxmnr,53,0,reddit2

The example that comes to mind is child support/child tax credits.  It's not controversial to say that women having kids need support (emotional, financial, physical and medical; having a kid is a big deal).  Traditionally that support would come from a husband but sometimes the husband couldn't (or wouldn't) take care of his family amd they suffered.  Maybe a charitable organization would step in to help them but they're in the same situation; maybe they can't or won't (or maybe you disagree with their dogma and are to proud to ask for help or too lazy to build your own parallel organization).  In any case, there's a good argument to build a consistent safety net for these women into government, children being extremely important to the general welfare of the country, as they are.  

The problem is that, once this safety net is built, people can make the argument that they don't need to be safe.  Even people that once could take care of themselves can become careless and fall without severe consequence.  And so the argument follows that, if we can raise kids with ""free"" government money, why do we need husbands?  What's the point of having 2-parent families if ""free"" childcare is readily available?

What we end up with is a sort of state enabled feminism.  If there were no child support laws, no tax credits, no subsidized daycare, it would be insane to argue that a single-parent family is just as functional as a two-parent family; such a family situation would be a comparable nightmare for the woman and children.  But that's exactly what many mainstream feminists call for (there are actually posters in my kids primary school advertising this idea).

And, of course, this completely ignores all the data on outcomes for children of different types of families; regardless of how the families come to be, children of single parent households tend to have lower academic achievment, lower mental health and more trouble forming relationships than equivalent children of two-parent families.",WeedleTheLiar,t2_6jjyx,1,0,reddit2

As I understand Japanese culture, it absolutely is.  What's more interesting to me is that, again as I understand it, Japanese women also aren't participating in a hook up culture to replace their loss of desire for committed attachment.  Like, where did their sex drive go?  We can usually count on human sexuality to drive coupling, if not legal commitments.  But it appears that human sexuality, at least among the women, is failing Japan as well.

Are the drives of both sexuality and relationship commitment so odious to Japanese women that they have disabled that drive in their brains?",sexytimeinseattle,t2_1h5lzotv,1,0,reddit2

>“One of the reasons hikikomori is fascinating is that there's not one explanation,” says Teo. “It's a lot of factors coming together.”

>One factor regularly discussed is the role of technology like the Internet, social media and videogames – already the source of contentious debate in mental health research. Many hikikomori I spoke to were prolific internet and videogame users and multiple studies have noted high levels of technology use, but it’s far from universal and the nature of the relationship is still unclear.

>In South Korea, anyone who remains isolated for at least three months is termed “oiettolie”, the link is more established. A 2013 study of 43 oiettolie found that nearly one in ten were already considered to be addicted to the internet, and more than 50% were thought to be at high-risk of internet addiction.

>Computer games have rewritten the nature of play, he says, with children spending ever more time in controlled virtual environments rather than the unpredictable real world. At the same time the internet, smartphones and social media have made indirect rather than face-to-face contact much more common.

>“Now society has no risk, no direct communication,” says Kato. “It’s easy to hit the reset button and reverse and there's low experience of failure.” He thinks that’s detrimental to children’s development, making them less resilient and less adept at interpersonal relationships. Just like you need to be exposed to dirt to develop immunity to diseases you need to be exposed to risk and failure to develop resilience and independence, he adds.

When it comes to relationships, my own personal life in this area did not take off until I actually DID start getting around people.  In my case, I decided to try country line dancing; it was also an excuse to meet up with an old friend that had moved back into the area after more than a decade away.  While there, she introduced me to one of her friends and we hit it off.

We got married 2.5 years ago.

Interpersonal relationships grew well past just my wife.  My circle eventually grew by the dozens.  I got to know a lot of new people, make new friends.

Why would it bother me, I'm a white man and I want to see my own people on screen. That's first. Second: black people are unattractive and, for the most part, unpleasant. Third: when I was a kid in 80s/90s, I didn't care about skin color of an actor. There was Beverly Hills cop, 48hrs, Rush Hour and Predator-2 and many, many more blacks in lesser roles. The Seargeant in Aliens, who served as an inspiration for Avory Johnson in Halo, best black character ever, in my humble opinion and the only ""cool"" black guy I can name. And I was actually upset with Predator-2 casting, but not because Danny Glover was black. Because he was a poor substitute for Arnold. I love these movies, I watch them quite often. Not even for a second I thought ""fuck, this would've been so much better with a white guy instead of Eddy Murphy"". Now they're being PUSHED to the roles because ""muh representation"", whether they fit or not. Whether they're good actors or not. Black fucking ELVES in Witcher tv series, you don't think it's laughable? If you're ok with it, then we have nothing further to discuss.

Black Ariel, black comissar Gordon, black Catwoman, black Human Torch, black Domino, black Heimdal, black Valkyrie (FUCKING JOKE), et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, the list goes on forever. Not a single case of a white actor being cast in a black character role, but an absolute metric fuckton of blackwashing (or as I personally prefer to call it -- blacksmearing). And then it's THESE people who dare to say something about ""cultural appropriation"". This is what I'm against. This is what I have problem with. It can be ok-ish to cast a good black actor in a little-known role, that won't look absurd (like blacks in Lord of the Rings, which had already happened in a game and inevitably coming to TV show). Like Morgan Freeman's character in Escape from Shawshank is white in the book, from what I know, but it doesn't really matters. But don't touch the set-in-stone characters, like Catwoman or Ariel.

Elves don't exist, so a black elf makes perfect sense. It's a fuckin elf, dude, an imaginary creature.

I think you just have an issue with black people and women in general. It's really sad to read that comment and know you're being entirely serious and completely unaware of how racist you are.

and if you want to bring up being murdered i notice you forgot to mention men are killed 10 times more often.

i dont believe that bullshit that doctors assume women are lying sounds like a load of bs to me. its their literal job to solve the problem.

story time, in late 2012 i was groped by 3 women my brother had over for a party and they were all very intoxicated. When i called the police the police officer asked if i was gay, and laughed at me. never even asked if i wanted to press charges.

or how about the fucking laws in most places excluding male victims of rape by women.

what about tv shows, movies and stuff making a joke out of male rape victims hm? im sure you've heard of the  ""don drop the soap"" jokes right? thats a rape joke dude, can you imagine if it was a women being laughed at?.

also the amber heard and johnny dep case right now is a prime example of what im talking about, she said nobody would believe he was a bused because he is a man. And guess what SHE WAS RIGHT!!! everyone instantly believed her. if thats not proof of women being the most privileged class on earth then idk what is.

or recently i saw a women say men cant be raped because he doesnt feel the same feelings as a women does... i men that says it all right there....

The Marines is exclusively males only and was one of the only employers in Europe to get an EU exemption. A Marine base would typically have about 800 - 1000 guys there and the working culture was so different. People didn’t make excuses all the time, if you were sick they just calculated what you could physically still do. So if your arms were broken rebus just tell you that your legs still work fine. The biggest thing they hate is what they call waffle. If someone gets angry at you for something that’s not your fault they don’t want to hear you make excuses or plead your case they want you to go fix it. There was a tremendous amount of selflessness. My first job was as a manager of team of 20 women and Jesus Christ what a shock. They would just complain about the pettiest shit being not fair. If I told them to just get on with the job they are paid to do they would report me for being insensitive. They wouldn’t come to work if they had the slightest thing wrong with them. They needed constant incentives like chocolate and prizes to do their job. No one would dream about doing more work than someone else as that wouldn’t be fair. After a few weeks I just gave up and started sleeping with several members of my team in secret and they became my best workers. They were in relationships too and at work no one wants to be known for having sex with the boss so it was quite easy to keep it all going on the quiet. Eventually though I just couldn’t take it anymore. The entitled attitude and childlessness was ridiculous. I’ve found women’s entire existence seems focused around trying to have the moral high ground so they will become obsessive about rules and regulations to the point where they don’t care about the end goal of profit or growth or service. The most important thing to them is that Jeremy isn’t wearing a tie or Rebecca was allowed to leave 5 minutes early.  The selfishness with women is easily the thing I find the most difficult to deal with. They’ve convinced themselves that being selfish is empowering and have no qualms about destroying a man’s life if it would benefit their own even a little. They are incapable of thinking long term as well and will destroy a beneficial/profitable working relationship that would see them gain a lot over time just because they felt cheated by some very minor detail that only affected a very small amount of their life or earnings. Fair to them means they are the ones who benefit most at all times.",MARINE-BOY,t2_ja3jjd3c,5,0,reddit3

You’re right. There were no explicit laws that said x # of men need to be hired because no one was hindering their access to the market.

Single women could have bank accounts. 

There was a relatively short period in history (first half of the 20th century) where married women in the US and UK were not allowed to buy property or have a bank account without their husbands permission. Do you know the sexist history there?It is because divorce laws allowed a woman to keep her own property in a divorce while her husband was responsible for the family debts. Women who wanted divorce would take out huge loans to buy her own property or take out loans against the family property and dump rhe proceeds into her own bank account. She got the assets. Her husband was then responsible to pay off the loans after divorce. Malicious women figured this out in the early 20th century. Lots of men were suddenly getting screwed over. So those biased laws were passed to prevent women from taking credit without her husbands permission. In the 1960s the biased laws against men were removed. Women were no longer entitled to 100% of the assets they acquired during marriage and 0% of the debts. Therefore it became possible to remove the biased laws against women without screwing over men shortly afterwards.",duhhhh,t2_35c0i,6,0,reddit3

Let me be honest with you, I never had a problem sharing and I think that indirectly punishing me for supposed benefits my male ancestors had is completely unfair, irrational, and a terrible excuse to justify privileges.

I get where the feminists complaints come from, many men worked themselves to death in awful jobs while their wives were living a long life in a comfortable enough home, but at least those men had the freedom that comes with money. I get it. They couldn't chose to be stay at home husbands but I get it, women want independence and freedom and I guess that's totally fair...just please let's not pretend that's my fault or should somehow make my life more difficult when not even my father enjoyed any privileges for being a man. 

The feminist speech should update itself, but that's not very likely to happen because then the feminists would realize they are basically asking for privileges by punishing innocent men. And honestly, men as a group had no privileges, both genders had social advantages and disadvatanges, but feminists insist on looking at those 0'01% rich, privileged men who basically ruled the world.

It’s because it’s not about gender equality in employment. It’s about giving a women an unjust advantage into top-level, high salary careers that are cushy and require minimal risk. Women don’t even want good-paying jobs that require effort and risk. 

Why aren’t they demanding more men become hair-dressers, masseuses, counselors, nurses, daycare workers? 

They love to complain about the glass ceiling. Do they not realize that most of the male population is also looking at a glass ceiling due to the socioeconomic status they were born into?",hawkeyepitts,t2_3zb3nykh,34,0,reddit4

The target is not 5 most capable candidates. It is gender based. 

I am not shitting on you with my comment. I have the same problem with the HR, when I need to hire new candidates. It irritates me to no end when I hear: ""We could do with more ladies here. You could as your next hire get a lady, you know...just to mix it up a bit..."" 

Maybe the most extreme example is US special forces. They absolutely need top-of-the-notch candidates. What they now must do is lower the standard so that women can be represented there. I imagine the SEALS instructor popping a few blood vessels, hearing about that idea for the first time.

Where I work no joke all of the female devs were moved over time to the “new hire team”. I know some of them earn as much as our most veteran employees but the gap in difficulty and expectations is astonishing. As a guy, this sort of thing is infuriating to see. If I wasn’t cutting the mustard you wouldn’t see management reassign me to an easier position while retaining pay and benefits. I would be terminated because I was actually hired to work and not because of a quota/looking progressive.

And yet we hear all the time about the mythical wage gap even though it’s been debunked for ages now (they didn’t take into account difference in time present at the company or education level or productivity for example, they only looked at the position).

On any other sub I’d be nuked from orbit for stating any of this which is just insane — because what I’m saying is true. On average, people are just less inclined to sympathy towards men and men are seen as workhorses in society. Being a guy has its own advantages, sure, but my observation has been most women are in denial and refuse to acknowledge the plethora of advantages they do have in western countries. I can guarantee you my own application and skill set would go dramatically further in job searches if I could list myself as a minority woman in current year.

I think that if there is any man posting here who's lost his relationship, his career, his home, his life savings, all experience of his children (let's say that again: *lost access to his kids*) and potentially even his freedom, very unfairly and simply because he's a man, and then had some very unpleasant hardline feminists take great pleasure in laughing in his face about it, I would forgive that man for being consumed with anger. Not to take things to an extreme, but it's true that people have been diagnosed with mental health problems as a result of less. Some of the people we have here are probably PTSD sufferers, and I'd hate to think what would happen if they tried to get treatment for it.

The problem we have is that a lot of the rest of the world, including otherwise reasonable people, will *not* forgive that anger, and misinterpret it as misogynistic unpleasantness. It's an absolutely Faustian bit of politics, if you think about it: *we can do what we like to you, and the more you object, the more right we look.*

The bigger problem is that the anger is almost always counterproductive anyway. I don't have the faintest idea how we solve this, because it's going to be very hard to get people who have been treated in this way to react to everything with calm equanimity.",Huffers1010,t2_a0xsse2g,2,0,reddit4

Gentlemen, do not place your jobs on the line just to make a point. If you feel the need to take extra precautions around female coworkers, do just that—but do *not* announce it, at least not in such a brazen manner. That's just going to make it easy for feminists to target these strategies and cry sexism. 

No, this needs to be subtle and covert. It needs to come across as something men have to do in secret, because the deck is stacked so heavily against us. It needs to be something hard to nail down, so that awareness of it ebbs into the societal consciousness slowly. We don't want to appear aggressive here, this needs to be viewed as what it is: a defensive posture we're being forced to take. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to do this, and I don't encourage men to do it if they don't legitimately feel threatened. Maybe that's a mistake on my part, but if so, I'm sure I'll learn the hard way. I just think doing this as a form of protest is likely to backfire on us. It needs to come across as a genuine adaptation to a workplace that has become unsafe for men interacting with women. ",,,440,0,reddit2
dr4hcto,t3_7j7fzt,2017-12-12 05:48:11,MensRights,"You're not supposed to announce your practice of the Billy Graham rule because, let's be real, it is indeed sexist. Just like women fearing all men as a potential rapist. But the reason the rule exists is for practical, safety-based reasons. The word of a woman is far heavier to the ears of people than the word of a man. Especially these days. Weighed against each other, people will sympathize with a woman over a man. A woman claims a man did something wrong to her, then he must have.

I experienced a false accusation and practice the rule to some extent. It is just smart after what I'd been through in a previous workplace. Everyone knew better than to believe her, but the company had to cover itself. She was fired for losing her temper constantly and damaging company property as well as arguing with customers. She was rehired when she claimed I groped her and two other coworkers berated her, causing her constant stress. HR moved my shift and gave hers back. I moved to a different company location instead, she got fired again and bizarrely claimed I was still harassing her at work but HR was fed up, I hadn't been on that particular location's security cameras since I moved employment. She stayed fired and will likely have a hard time working anywhere again. My boss from the other location gave me an apology afterwards, she was distraught that this kind of thing could threaten someone so much and how close I apparently was to being permanently black-balled or worse all for a lie even HR knew about. She was directly told by an HR representative that they knew this was all BS and they just wanted this all to blow over neatly and quickly.

Bottom line; sexual harassment is an easy way to get an entity that values its image to do things for you and against a man, whether you actually hate him or he is just an unfortunate pawn. Even a lame accusation like the one leveled against me is enough to make things happen. I keep to myself less, as it makes me a better target to have no social backing. Just a tip. I like people a little less for my experience, but I appreciate their occasional sense for judgement.

Practice the rule privately. Understand that if you have a false accusation against you, you still probably shouldn't talk about it. People don't care what you have to say, a woman said you did something wrong to her. Just be safe and be quiet, you don't have the privilege of being a victim whether something happened to you or not. Women? Women are victims by default.",GreyTortoise,t2_12kbki,64,0,reddit2

I don't think that's true. I've not heard stories of men putting their ex's shit in a sack and burning it, and female exes seem to take more joy in dragging their former men to court than the other way around.

On the other hand, men in homosexual relationships can be pretty bad to each other sometimes. But lesbians can be really awful to each other too.

Could already be happening for all we know (and indeed is, in the case of eg feminist opposition to shared parenting, fair domestic violence policies etc.)   I mean it's not like any of these alleged acts of ""sexual misconduct"" have been proven in a court of law, and in some cases at least they seem to amount to ""this guy I find unattractive flirted with me at work.""  

A labor politician in the UK has already committed suicide over an unproven allegation.   The Orwellian term ""sexual misconduct"" is so broad it can mean practically anything.   

I'm starting to think the end result of this (ever escalating) feminist hysteria (whistling at a girl is now a ""hate crime"" in the UK) is going to be the return of sex segregation.   Already some men in the workplace are refusing to be alone with women; Japanese men are demanding their own train cars so they won't be falsely accused of groping; and the whole ""MGTOW"" thing seems to be growing like wildfire.   

I'm also starting to wonder whether female complaints about unwanted male attention are the whole reason ""patriarchy"" was established in the first place -- or at least certain elements of it.   What feminists are demanding -- eg that ""unwanted speech"" be classified as a crime in France -- is really an expansion of traditional gender roles, not a repudiation of them.   It's just that feminists want the entire state to act as a gigantic chaperone (and enforcer, and provider) rather than individual men.   Jordan Peterson has even argued that we are entering a new era of female totalitarianism.   

One of the problems with a potential matriarchy (are we already [living](http://www.realsexism.com/) in one?) is that women have in group bias, whereas men do not.   There appears to be a very large empathy gap that may be instinctual in nature.   This is dangerous stuff, because whereas females have all sorts of privileges under patriarchy (women and children first etc.) there is no reason to suspect that males will be granted a counter-balancing set of privileges under matriarchy.   

Indeed Karen Straughan has argued that under patriarchy it is ""women and children first"" off the lifeboats; under a matriarchy it will be ""women, children and the women's luggage first.""  ",audiotraxx,t2_nwu262y,34,0,reddit2

And yes, I do think this man is being an idiot. He's deliberately provoking women on a very serious issue for them in a way that suggests he's not taking it seriously at all. 

That the response to the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment of women by men is a gross overreaction does not negate the fact that many women have suffered this crap for a long time. Our response needs to be commensurate with that overreaction, not an overreaction itself. To the extent that men do feel unsafe around female employees, they absolutely should take precautions, and if that affects women's career prospects...well, that's their problem. But boisterously shunning women like this just makes men look like fragile snowflakes, more concerned with their ego than their actual safety. 

I'm saying let this be what it is: a reasonably defensive response to a misandrist political climate. There is absolutely no need to overdo it, and by overdoing it, men are both putting their jobs on the line and delegitimizing the subtler responses of men who actually are worried about being falsely accused.

The casting couch isn't a new idea, but the willingness to stay quiet about it used to be embedded in and enforced by the community.  Speak up, get black balled.  This is still an issue (ex.

 I have been around some crazy feminists but my close friends and lovers were mainstream if they were feminist.    

Most of my friends are women and I like individuals more than groups so I am always breaking the Pence rule.  

I like drinking but don't mix it with sex much, especially with a new partner.  For the first time I like us to both be sober or close to it.  

All my lovers come from real life. I have never used any kind of dating service.  I am not particularly attractive to most women.  I have no game.  I can do very basic flirting but only started learning in my 30s.
I offer my phone number, not ask for one.  I seldom approach strangers.  

I have never been in a situation where I was aware of a woman expecting me to pay for her.  That type and I just repel each other.
Same goes for women who require the man to initiate or lead, I don't want to know.  I do my share and wait for a response.  

Yeah, I don't  get laid as much as I could. But I have never regretted anything.  There is not a single woman I have been with  that I would not be pleased to run into again.  

I have read a lot about false accusation including case histories.  But it seems like a different world, I don't really mix with that sort of person and situation. If something goes wrong we deal with it.  

My lifestyle won't suit many men but I don't think I would be at all worried about dating strangers or even having sex with people I hadn't known long so long as alcohol is not a factor. ",JebberJabber,t2_o9m32,0,0,reddit2

I do believe that a decision such as this shouldn't be taken lightly but I was circumcised as an infant because my family has a genetic history of psoriasis in men. In the 90's it was believed circumcision protects against inflammatory dermatoses and I believe (with limited research on it in todays world) it's still believed to have some protection.

I'm grateful my parents did because they obviously were thinking long term about my health.

I'm now 27 and deal with Psoriasis in those areas and on some days, it's infuriating.

I could only guess, (cause it's missing lol) but having a foreskin with this issue would be incredibly painful and uncomfortable.

I got a theory.  So one time I heard infant circumcision affects one's pain sensitivity, the extreme pain floods the infant w cortisol n whatever else and permanently alters its nervous response to pain.

I think ppl who are circumcised being more pain-averse would be easier to control (by threats of violence) / less likely to engage in resistance against a ruling order.  So this would explain it being an act carried out upon ur own ppl so they will be easier to militarize against opposing forces.

Also makes sense it will be carried out upon conquered peoples as a form of humiliation and domestication.

The u.s. is hella circumcised and for basically no reason.  At least other countries have religious majorities who are practicing it by rote of custom. However, we do not, by and large, have such a cultural reason for practicing it. So what would explain the u.s. doing it so much?

Pondering that is how I came up w this idea of circumcision being a means of militarization.  Cuz the u.s. is also particularly blood-thirsty.

 * Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.

 * Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.

 * Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.
Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

 * Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.

I think the stats on the items listed by the Mayo clinic sheds great insight.

- Hygiene: We have easy access to water for hygiene. It’s easy to wash body parts.

- Lowers UTI: [""It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision). Take a minute to think about how many 111 to 125 boys are. I would need to have 118 sons (!) and circumcise all of them to prevent a single UTI. And UTI’s [""can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

- STDs and HIV: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) Condoms are an actually effective transmission barriers to STIs and must be used regardless.

- Penile Problems: [""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)

- Penile cancer: [“Decreased penile cancer risk: NNT = 900 – 322,000”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision). That means between 900 and 322,000 circumcisions need to be performed to prevent a single case of penile cancer. It is incredibly rare. 

- Cervical cancer is from HPV which has a vaccine. Which is so effective that (turning to news) [""Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer. Free vaccine program in schools leads to big drop in rates.""](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer)

These stats are terrible, it's disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is more effective and less invasive.


The standard to intervene on someone else's body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:

[“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)

To override someone's body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.



And importantly [the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))

Also check out the detailed anatomy and role of the foreskin in this presentation (for ~15 minutes) [as Dr. Guest discusses the innervation of the penis, the mechanical function of the foreskin and its role in lubrication during sex, and the likelihood of decreased sexual pleasure for both male and partner.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=28m20s)



>National library of medicine - Circumcision prevents hiv and sti's

First more accurately this is authors Aaron A. R. Tobian and Ronald H. Gray. That is not the same as the National Library of medicine, which is acting as a hosting site. 


>circumcision decreases human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition in men by 51% to 60%,

Reduction of 60% is the relative rate which sounds impressive. But the absolute rate sounds very different: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) That originates from the CDC.

A terrible statistic. Especially when circumcision is not effective prevention and condoms must be used regardless.

And to be clear, that’s the exact same data set presented in two different ways; relative rate and absolute rate. The HIV rate was ~2.5% in intact men and ~1.2% in circumcised men, (~2.5%-~1.2%)/~2.5% = 52% relative rate (~ because it depends on which study you look at). For more details on how those numbers work [you can check out Dr. Guest's critique on the HIV studies.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=59m44s)


And we can look at the real world results: [“The African findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with a high percentage of routine circumcisions. The situation in most European countries is precisely the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates. Therefore, other factors seem to play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This finding also suggests that there are alternative, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

I also like their discussion how this is not relevant to newborns or children: [""As with traditional STDs, sexual transmission of HIV occurs only in sexually active individuals. Consequently, from an HIV prevention perspective, if at all effective in a Western context, circumcision can wait until boys are old enough to engage in sexual relationships. Boys can decide for themselves, therefore, whether they want to get circumcised to obtain, at best, partial protection against HIV or rather remain genitally intact and adopt safe-sex practices that are far more effective.  As with the other possible benefits, circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine: there is no strong evidence for effectiveness and other, more effective, and less intrusive means are available. There is also no compelling reason why the procedure should be performed long before sexual debut; sexually transmitted HIV infection is not a relevant threat to children"".](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)


That's critical. STIs and HIV via sex is not relevant to newborns. If individuals would like to take extra security measures by cutting off part of their genitals, they are absolutely free to do so. Others may choose to wear condoms. Or to abstain from sex until a committed relationship. Outside of medical necessity the decision goes to the patient themself later in life.


I think that wraps it all up. Don't forget the medical ethics that require **medical necessity** to intervene on someone else's body.",intactisnormal,t2_k5qcy8,6,0,reddit3

Also:

- UTIs are easily addressed through antibiotics, babies aren't contracting STIs (remember, we're talking about *infant* circumcision), and penile cancer is already exceptionally rare, and we have the HPV vaccine in men to address cervical cancer.  That's why the majority medical opinion is that circumcision's so-called ""benefits"" are irrelevant.

- The National Library of Medicine is literally that: a library.  They didn't write or publish the article, they're just hosting it.  Lots of medical illiteracy from circumcision defenders lately...

- The paper is based on models from over a decade ago which did not pan out.

- [The rest of the developed world](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23509170) called BS on the AAP's policy.  Also, that policy expired five years ago.  Two more of your links just regurgitate the AAP's widely discredited policy.

- That fourth link is about sub-Saharan VMMC, not Western RIC.  Completely different epidimiological cohort, plus there were [many issues](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22320006) with those African RCTs, including that they found (but didn't publicize) that women are 60% *more* likely to contract HIV from circumcised men.

In summary, we can either continue to cut functional, erogenous tissue off of our sons for questionable, negligle, or obsoleted ""benefits,"" or we can simply ask our sons to shower.  Hmm...",LettuceBeGrateful,t2_27729nce,13,0,reddit3

Circumcision isn't medically indicated, so the decision to routinely circumcise is not ethical. There are clear medical indications for removing tonsils and adenoids.  

Children with obstructive sleep apnea are often detected due to snoring. The reason they are snoring is because they aren't getting air into their lungs - the airway is obstructed by the tonsils and often adenoids as well. These kids do sleep studies where their oxygen is measured and frequency of apneic (stop breathing altogether) episodes and then stratified into severity. The more severe (significantly low oxygen levels, apnea occuring every 1-2 minutes) on the spectrum are candidates for surgery. I think it's pretty clear that not breathing while you sleep isn't good for a developing child and a relatively minor procedure is a reasonable treatment option. I have seen kids with virtually completely obstructed throats from huge tonsils. These kids do MUCH better once they are removed and can finally get a decent night's sleep.

The standard to intervene on someone else's body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:

[“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)

To override someone's body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.

It's great you still have sensation but to cut the foreskin off a baby is completely different.  I actually work in the operating room with urologists and pediatric surgeons and I see first hand what happens.

1. The adult technique can spare the foreskin.

They can cut off part of the shaft skin, pull down the foreskin and suture in place so you literally have all the original foreskin nerve endings including the frenulum and ridged band.  This is possibly why you have so much sensation and think circumcision causes no changes in sensation.  You still have your foreskin, just less shaft skin.

Now imagine in a baby they literally cut off all the foreskin and leave just shaft skin which has very little nerve endings.  It's fucked up.

2.  It's extremely difficult to judge how a newborn circumcision will affect the child once they become an adult.  The ridged band is gone.  The frenulum is either entirely gone or damaged severely.

Maybe that type of circumcision you mentioned wasn’t performed in the 70s? Idk. Obviously he has no way of knowing what it felt like to be uncut, but he said he felt like he’s always had great sensitivity. Like me now, he said there has always been different ways he could orgasm. Whereas me before, it was only from the very tip of the foreskin or the ridge of the glans. 

Also, the urologist who performed my circumcision was probably not the best person to do it, in hindsight. He seemed frazzled and possibly drinking when he came to the hospital on the day of surgery and my scar line looks like a kindergartner who was just learning to cut straight lines. I can’t imagine him doing any special techniques for my benefit. Especially after being frustrated with my decision to want it for personal reasons and nothing more. 

My point was, there’s so much negativity around circumcision as a whole that anyone considering it after reading the debates would be pushed away from doing it for reasons that I haven’t experienced. Loss of sensation being the chief fear factor that I see people talk about. 

I’ve asked in this sub before if there was anyone here in my shoes who had had sex before and after being cut to see if their experience reflects my own but haven’t talked to anyone so far. Maybe my doc does his best work when he’s hammered and maybe I got to keep all my goodies intact, idk. 

It still doesn’t explain how I feel like I have heightened pleasure from different areas of my penis now. My frenulum is a source of pleasure now whereas before I felt all the best part was in the glans. Which that was another thing. The glad being exposed now, I can no longer wear boxers as it causes the glans to rub against the fabric. I could barely walk. I feel like the sensation was akin to what I can only guess a girl would feel is she were walking around with a vibrator against her clit all day. But the frenulum now feels really good when someone is masturbating you. The whole thumb up and down on the bottom of the shaft used to do nothing for me, now it’s amazing and I get what that’s a thing. For me, it totally changed my sex life. In a good way. I couldn’t ever see going back. 

I just never see these things being talked about.

A simple medical procedure no one can remember does not cause trauma and most certainly does not cause brain damage.  If something went horribly wrong and nothing was done about it(which is beyond unlikely), sure the cortisol build up may be disruptive for a few weeks. Babies are often stressed in general because external and internal stimuli as simple as an unfamiliar noise can be very upsetting,  but a parent would have to be neglectful or downright incompetent to not attend to a stressed infant. Additionally, babies have smooth plastic brains.  The thing isn't near finished forming and emotional wellness is contingent upon how the parent(s) raises the infant, i.e. attending to a stressed infant.  Fun fact,  a woman can be a cocaine addict while pregnant and give birth to a baby that is heavily addicted and emotionally dysregulated in infancy, but if given a normative upbringing by the age of 5 the kid's physiology will be no different than any other child's because the human body is amazing and nueroplasticity is the smooth, unfolded brain's most valuable tool. If literal coke addiction and genuine trauma and neglect don't cause permanent life-altering brain damage, then why on earth would I allow fear-mongering paranoid men to spread misinformation that junior is traumatized because he got snipped? It seriously doesn't work that way. If a kid is traumatized, then you look at the caregiver because there's obviously something behind closed doors that isn't right, and that isn't to automatically suggest abuse.

The foreskin alone has tens of thousands of pleasure nerve endings. The frenulum has nerve endings. Then the head, which is meant to be kept moist from the foreskin, is sensitive. But this all dries up and scars when you get circumcised.


To make it easier to understand, as a guy with a natural dick, if the head is outside the foreskin, it hurts/feels uncomfortable.

Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.


Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.


Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.


Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

I think the stats on the items listed by the Mayo clinic sheds great insight.

- Hygiene: We have easy access to water for hygiene. It’s easy to wash body parts.

- Lowers UTI: [""It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision). Take a minute to think about how many 111 to 125 boys are. I would need to have 118 sons (!) and circumcise all of them to prevent a single UTI. And UTI’s [""can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

- STDs and HIV: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) Condoms are an actually effective transmission barriers to STIs and must be used regardless.

- Penile Problems: [""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)

- Penile cancer: [“Decreased penile cancer risk: NNT = 900 – 322,000”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision). That means between 900 and 322,000 circumcisions need to be performed to prevent a single case of penile cancer. It is incredibly rare. 

- Cervical cancer is from HPV which has a vaccine. Which is so effective that (turning to news) [""Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer. Free vaccine program in schools leads to big drop in rates.""](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer)

These stats are terrible, it's disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is more effective and less invasive.


The standard to intervene on someone else's body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:

[“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision)

To override someone's body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.



And importantly [the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))

If they have done such a thing it hasn’t happened in months. I went 4 weeks back in their comment history and I saw maybe 1 or 2 comments that might be a little unfairly written but nothing misogynistic or misandristic. 

Your comments are full of shitty behaviour takes and self importance and self righteousness.

Lol you don’t get what self righteous means do you? Self righteous people feel like they are good people it’s why they like to “call out clown and bigot behaviour” that’s a self righteous statement.
You saying you work with autistic people is a cop out to try to abolish some guilt for being unnaturally cruel to someone for being banned. And goes right back to your sense of self righteousness because if you didn’t feel like you’re a good person who’s being misunderstood you wouldn’t mention what you do for a living. Twox DOES make misandristic posts and if it was any other sub I’d actually take you at face value, but considering everything I’ve observed about you, your behaviour, your opinions and attitude, I’m going to go with my gut and say you’re a fucking idiot and need to shut up before making everything worse for you.

j8ramiy,t3_113lgp5,2023-02-16 11:46:25,MensRights,"This isn’t even necessarily a gender issue (although it disproportionately affects men) this is an issue of entitlement.

You are not entitled to someone’s friendship or compassion. Much as the feminists chant this within the online dating sphere (and I agree with them on that point, you’re owed being cordial by rights of being human, but nobody has to humour anything above that if they don’t want to).

So what if the guy wants to focus on work and work alone? You are not entitled to demand a certain level of interaction from him that has nothing to do with the productivity of the job!

This reminds me of a situation many years ago but weirdly it was a bloke flinging this at me. I choose to keep my work interactions to work, always have. I have enough friends that I care to have outside work and when I’m at work, I want to focus on getting shit done rather than making superficial pals.

This guy somehow got it into his head that because I wasn’t down for sharing my life’s story with him and kept things curt, I must have *hated* him, and he tried the whole “hostile work environment” angle as well. The guy in question was gay, and tried to push that as the reasoning on my part. Absolutely no evidence of homophobia on my part and not helped by the fact that I had a very good working relationship with several openly gay individuals in that workplace.

Ended up making a complete prat of himself in the HR summons we had to sit when I fenced the question of why he had decided that me sharing my personal life details with him was so important to him getting his job done properly. I never said a negative word about the guy to his face or otherwise. I was just focused on my job. In truth my hesitation was this guy was known gossip and I had continually heard him talking this or that about people behind their backs and I wanted no part of being fuel to his fire.

Ironically after the whole thing was waved away and he was put back in reality, it is THEN I decided “you my friend, are a twat” but still, never influenced my behaviour towards him.

TL,DR; A colleague (27M) joined our firm last year and since then he has had zero issues socialising with the guys we work with but always finds an excuse or says no to hanging out with the girls after work, even if we go out together as a whole he rarely talks to us and its making some of my friends uncomfortable.  
So early last year our firm hired Dan (27M). In the first few weeks he was really quiet and didn't talk much and that's just how we thought he was. Every conversation with him was short and to the point and never deviated from work, asides from pleasantries (Have a nice weekend etc). About 2 months in he started becoming a bit more friendly with the guys in our office and they would hang out every so often and have normal conversations. However, whenever any of the girls in the office tried to do so he would quickly change the conversation back to work or just not reply. Even now after a year of Dan working with us he straight up refuses to socialise with the girls in the office and it is making them feel uncomfortable. He avoids any discussion of himself outside of work related events and future plans and doesn't ask any of the girls either. Where as he is, what I can only assume, pretty good friends with the guys in the office.  
Even on work meals out to celebrate events he is only doing the bare minimum when it comes to conversation with the girls where again with the guys he talks to them like there is no problem whatsoever. I don't know if I'm overreacting but one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. Dan treats us like he treats clients we work with; cordial and strictly about business and its wearing thin now.

And most have a very difficult time handling disharmony.  If a man (or woman) is being too friendly or not friendly at all, its on an extreme, and becomes disharmonious.....creepy.

But most men are not like that.  And since they were boys they were mostly with boys and boys do not work so hard to manipulate a group into a group of harmonious equals.    Group dynamics are based more on what one can bring to the group, and social harmony is not much considered unless there is a serious problem, like constant fighting.

And between those two cultures, especially in a large work group,  there is no way to have balance.   One or the other has to dominate or there is confusion and trouble.

I am used to working in female dominated work environments....but even I am not always perfect at this.   I am well aware of my tendency to withdraw and seek out space to be alone, and I know that makes women feel they are being avoided (they are) and that its due to there being something wrong with them (there isn't...I just need privacy, space and quiet).    And while this is a source of tension, I know I am doing it and so I have strategies to make up for it.

So I don't really feel that anyone here is ""wrong"".   What I do feel is that those people can't work together because one is kind of too male and the other is kind of too female.

juktmdj,t3_113lgp5,2023-08-03 04:40:47,MensRights,"I almost think that the OP (the woman complaining about the man not talking to her) might be a trolling post.  However, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that this sort of thing would happen.  Hell, it probably happens a lot, but posting about it on Reddit (in relationship advice no less) seems a little suspicious.

I guess there's no way to know for sure.  The anonymous profile makes it a little bit suspect as well.

I will say that if this is real, then it's toxic femininity in the extreme.  I'm a tall handsome dude and I used to be really bad at talking to women so I just wouldn't do it and I think it did make women uncomfortable... not as uncomfortable as it made them when I did try to talk and came across like a bumbling dork who had no game.

I really had to learn to play to my strengths and eventually I did figure out how to be charming and to come across as desirable.  
Now as a man in my mid 30's most women are happy if I just leave them alone and I'm happy to oblige them.

I've been in a bunch of trainwreck relationships and my synopsis is that romantic relationships are highly overrated.  At least within certain groups in our population.  My stepbrother was MGTOW for years and he ended up marrying a girl from the Dominican republic who is ten years younger than him and very traditional.  I hope it works out for him in the long run.  He seems happy.  I haven't met his wife yet but from what he tells me about her, he seems to have made a wise choice for himself.  A woman like that is more in line with what he wanted, and he is the kind of man she wanted as well.

Damned if you do damned if you don't... Yes, in my experience, but maybe it's just our postmodern culture here in the west still getting it's footing.  We are growing and changing as a culture and unfortunately the strict political divides have put men and women on opposite sides sniping at one another in a culture war that is blown way out of proportion by social media and the like.

Men were creeps towards women for many many years in many many ways.  Now women are getting the upper hand in some ways and I think that without any institutional foundations in place to ease the transition to a more balanced social framework, the whole thing is erupting into chaos where no one seems to know how they are supposed to act towards one another.",Creatural_Shade,t2_jkd859gp,1,0,reddit4

The whole premise of 'being friendlier to some people than others equals hostility' is laughable. I don't care what's between your legs, I have the freedom to choose who I open up to. This is entitlement you're displaying.

No one is obligated to be chums with anyone. Do some people just have nothing better to do than gossip about who somebody happens to enjoy talking to? Has the poster stopped to think that maybe she's horribly boring to speak to...? 

Even discounting all of that, has anyone thought of this from HIS position? Women can be quite unapproachable in all settings these days, groups of women even more so. I bet you dollars to donuts this group has done -nothing- to make the guy feel like his friendliness wouldn't be rebuffed. But still the obligation is on him to engage. Have THEY tried reaching out...?

Also this highlights the ridiculous double-bind of being a man - we're pilloried for every conceivable thing. Interact too much? Creep. Too little? Also creep, or just mysognist, incel etc. Cordial?

Work from home has so many synergistic benefits, including reducing workplace sexual tension, but it tends to highlight the inherent friction in relationships through men and women spending more time together. Current society is very good at minimising male-female time spent together through external work, resulting in a home being more a place to sleep and eat than actual cohabitation. It's why Covid was so devastating as relationships had come to rely on that separation. It does call into question though the fundamental compatibility of men and women when close extended relationships start to unravel and nature has to drug men and women to stay together long enough for procreation to be successful, even in the face of sex being a supposedly mutually enjoyable activity beyond its application to procreation.",UnconventionalXY,t2_46a6opwn,2,0,reddit4

I go to an old fashioned barber, not a hairdresser. It's a totally different set of skills. Hairdressers do not learn how to straight shave as far as I know, and my barber always cleans up my neck and beard with a straight razor for me. My barber can do a full straight shave as well, which I have never have done but have considered. They also don't generally use electric razors as much and stick to scissors, and they do more traditional cuts instead of the modern weird stuff you see now.

I'm not given to talking to by barber, but a lot of men are. Especially men who have been going to the same barber for a while. I know my Dad went to the same guy every two weeks for as long as he lived in the same spot. They weren't just tied by business, but they were also friends and they could talk as friends. Much of the time they would talk about their wives, families, and work. You can be very honest when you are talking to people who simply don't have a stake in what you are talking about. If you tell your wife about your struggles at work, then she is going to look at you as a complainer. If you tell a co-worker, then your boss will find out and that will be it for you. If you tell your barber or your bartender, it stays with them because chances are they aren't even listening... unless there are women around who have sharp ears and will immediately text your wife or girlfriend what you said because ""she deserves to know.""

""She had never asked why it was right for her to be a slave to another’s desires, but not evil for them to enslave her. She was not contributing to the betterment of mankind, but was merely a servant to countless puling little tyrants. Evil was not one large entity, but a ceaseless torrent of small wrongs left unchallenged, until they festered into monsters.""

“Evil is not one large entity, but a collection of countless, small depravities brought up from the muck by petty men. Many have traded the enrichment of vision for a gray fog of mediocrity--the fertile inspiration of striving and growth, for mindless stagnation and slow decay--the brave new ground of the attempt, for the timid quagmire of apathy. Many of you have traded freedom not even for a bowl of soup, but worse, for the spoken empty feelings of others who say that you deserve to have a full bowl of soup provided by someone else. Happiness, joy, accomplishment, achievement . . . are not finite commodities, to be divided up. Is a child’s laughter to be divided and allotted? No! Simply make more laughter! Every person’s life is theirs by right. An individual’s life can and must belong only to himself, not to any society or community, or he is then but a slave. No one can deny another person their right to their life, nor seize by force what is produced by someone else, because that is stealing their means to sustain their life. It is treason against mankind to hold a knife to a man’s throat and dictate how he must live his life. No society can be more important than the individuals who compose it, or else you ascribe supreme importance, not to man, but to any notion that strikes the fancy of the society, at a never-ending cost of lives. Reason and reality are the only means to just laws; mindless wishes, if given sovereignty, become deadly masters. Surrendering reason to faith in unreasonable men sanctions their use of force to enslave you--to murder you. You have the power to decide how you will live your life. Those mean, unreasonable little men are but cockroaches, if you say they are. They have no power to control you but that which you grant them!”

Same with the guys at the comics and games shop I hang out at, and all of these places see me in there with my girlfriend. And you know what? They know each other, too! Imagine that! It's a community! And people talk, gossip, and whatever else. 

It's the guys who can keep their damned mouth shut, but it's the women who ensure your girlfriend or wife knows EVERYTHING that comes out of your face. If I say something to the guy who sells me GBA games about my GF complaining about how much I spend on games, then it stays with him. If one of the ladies over at the D&D table hears me saying that, then my GF is getting a text 15 minutes later about me buying a game and badmouthing her, and she will do it with a smirk.

I don't care about the gender of who's in the barbershop either, but that type of situation comes up often enough that it would be nice to have the option to outright avoid it. The thing is I don't have that option where I live. I can try to work around it as much as I want, but I'm going to be stuck with the potential for a hostile visit whenever I go. My workaround has been to just go at opening because it is significantly less likely that those types will be up that early. The point is that I shouldn't have to do that workaround, and there's no issue with having a barbershop be only for men just like there's no issue with having salons be only for women. In a world where one gender has all of the social power, sometimes the other gender just needs a break. It's the same theory behind every other type of safe space.

>I am yet to even see a girl in one so it's obviously very rare so rare that should we even care?

Pixie cuts are really common in my area and all of the barbershops do mixed hairstyles anyway so the clientele is mixed. The only barbershops that don't have a heavy female clientele with them are those that are outright female hostile and not just female exclusionary and I don't want to support them or be involved with them in any way.

The male only Boy Scouts was challenged much longer ago than that. It (puportedly) circled around the differences in teachings. They both used to have very victorian alignments, boys toward outdoors and hands-on skills, while girls towards homemaker based skills. 
  I do not fully agree with that alignment, though I admit, as a man, I can see some base reasonings. I also can see a much increased benefit from  cross teachings of skills. 

My original point was this. 

There used to be Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Now there is Girl Scouts and Scouts. Girls can join what used to be the Boy Scouts, but a boy cannot joing Girl Scouts. 
Double standards. 
But that is the way of society these days. In a collective effort to remove the separate from “separate but equal”, we have gone the opposite swing. 

We have a “what is mine is mine, what is yours is mine” society today. Women can have women only places and things, all they have to do is say they feel threatened or similar. Men cannot have these things because women can use the same logic to eliminate them. They also feel threatened when they are left alone. They somehow have the idea that when men are in groups larger than one, that we are plotting against them or something. They have an innate need to be the center of attention, in a place where there is no need for them to be. 
It is nothing less than control. Women know that men cannot and will not speak uninhibitedly around them, if for no other reason than A) fear of being accused of something made up or B( not wanting to spend the next 7 days having every word analyzed and justifying everything that was said to an insecure woman.",xxdibxx,t2_cmytf,27,0,reddit1

People are getting confused thinking I'm against men having their own space when in reality in simply against one gender telling another they cannot use their public business.

I'm for equality I'm not going to support anything that affects peoples needs e.g. if I'm a woman and I have a barber next door and I have hair shorter than men but I can't go as it's a men only space so I have to go across town and be charged £40 for the same thing. I find that wrong, it goes against my morals and the law of the land.

I object to hairdresser being woman only.

I object to women only gyms. 

If you hire a private space or run a private club then do what you want you can have an African men only space.

If we were to use your analogy and *actually* apply it to my argument instead of this bullshit straw man it would be like this.

The color red is indisputable (Sex is a biological fact) 

Thinking red is a bad color or your favorite color is preference/what you identify with (gender being a construct). 

If you look back in history it is very obviously at play in a lot of ways. The gender role for women was to get married and raise children whilst the gender role for men was to father children and be successful by working/inventing/going to war/etc.  That *gender* role is changing and evolving to something more independent for women which proves that what culture perceives of gender is subject to change.

freedom doesn't mean people will split into small groups who only serve their gender or race. if that's true, that means you think everyone is racist/sexist, and that people only refrain from acting on their racism/sexism because of the law. That's pretty sad. I don't think people are generally racist or sexist.

And yes, I seriously would prefer a system that allows businesses to decide for themselves who they don't want to serve. Because the moment you let government have control over business is the moment you agree to tyranny. End of story.

For example, here in Australia, our ""government"" has passed laws *requiring* our ISP's to block websites they don't want us to access, such as torrenting sites. 

Now, bear in mind, not all torrenting sites have copyrighted material on them, some are used by indie artists to promote their stuff without someone taking a lion share of their profits. 

Yet, we are to be treated like children being told what we can and can't look at online (can you say China?). Now, I do believe criminal websites i.e. human trafficking etc. should be shut down. But regular people won't use these sites anyway and criminals will use them in spite of the law.

People ask ""where do you draw the line?"" I ask the same question about giving government control of businesses. Where do you draw the line? How much of your business should they control in your mind?

Good people don't need laws and criminals will break them anyway.

It's this pesky little thing called freedom of association one of the cases I immediately go back to when talking about this when a norwegian hair salon denied a Muslim woman service because she wouldn't take off her hijab in front of men. Do you know what she did? She claimed discrimination and won because of the sort of laws you want to introduce. The reality of the situation was that the hairdresser was simply asking her to take her hijab off so she could cut her hair and she refused to do it in the presence of men so this meant because of your bullshit that the hairdresser would either have to boot out all of her male customers and likely lose money on top of that just to satisfy the Muslim woman who refused to adapt to the society she lived in.

Source: https://www.thelocal.no/20160908/norway-hairdresser-on-trial-for-refusing-client-in-hijab

> She said that accepting a woman in hijab as a client would have meant she would have had to turn away male customers, since the woman would not have been able to expose her hair with men present.

People like you think you're doing a 'just' thing, but the reality is all you're doing is taking away the ability of businesses to choose who they can and can't associate with and actually forcing them in some cases to provide a service at a loss. I for example make silver jewellery, under the laws you insist are such a good idea if I didn't want to make any kind of religious symbol for somebody they could very easily file a religious discrimination case against me and I would potentially have to defend that in court.

It's one thing to do this over gender, but when you start defending frankly backwards religious beliefs and claim that anyone who is against them is automatically discriminating then you're crossing a line because in order to protect against your perceived discrimination you are helping one group discriminate against another.

So even if a rep was elected by a majority in a district of mostly white men, they should represent all and fight for equality for all. Not just the politics associated with the identity of white men or Latino women etc... The things that fix what black people are disadvantaged by would and should benefit everyone. Preventing police harrasment and abuse of power is a good thing for everyone. Helping students that have been historically at a disadvantage due to the family they were born into would also help Latino students for the same reasons.

From my perspective you're the one that is focused on ones identify to justify yourself. 

Identity politics what happens when your identity is the basis for your reasoning about an issue. By building from or adding identity to your rational you've added an subjective element into the rational which is supposed to be completely objective. All the relevant facts are independent of the identity you've incorporated into your reasoning. 

It's basically allowing our evolutionary bias for protecting the group or group bias seep into our higher functions to rationalize.youvr fallen into this trap in your desire to permit segregation based in sex or gender. 

I don't think you'll even read this, but whoever follows I want them to know I am for equality of opportunity and am against segregation. You for some reason are focussed on your  ""association"" with other groups and find some to be distasteful in some regard. You may not realize it but feminist do the same thing, and it's flawed reasoning for them as it is for you.

> if I didn't want to make any kind of religious symbol for somebody they could very easily file a religious discrimination case against me and I would potentially have to defend that in court.""

Just like feminist that argue that men should have to pay child support for a kid that isn't theirs. You want to be able to make others suffer in some way because of your distaste for them. Of course you make the damn pendant that you personally think is offensive, they money is just as valid as anyone elses cash. You have the right to deny service of course, but not because of someone's race or religion (among others). I don't see why that's a radical idea, equality... Give everyone equal opportunity to pay you for your service, crazy idea getting paid to do a job huh? I used to work IT for a Christian radio station, talk about an atheist in the fox hole, it was a decent job and I had a lot of great opportunities. If I had decided to exclude working there simply because of who they were as Christians, I'd be making the same fallacy you are making here. 

You wanting to be able to exclude and segregate based in a persons identity or group association is what I am against. You cannot make your argument without using identity of a group you want to disenfranchise. I am arguing that any argument you can use to justify discrimination can be used against you based in whatever group you are identified as belonging to. Can you really not see the identity politics you're employing here?

Here's a test can you justify excluding women from a barbershop without referring to their identity as a woman? If not, you're doing identity politics.",,,1,0,reddit1

dddirrm,t3_5s779h,2017-02-05 22:45:26,MensRights,"Boys are currently falling behind in education. As your post stated it is predominantly white British boys who are underachieving. 

Part of this I believe is due to home and family situations... many of these boys are raised by uneducated single mothers. They therefore have no positive male role models and no real parental push for education and achievement. (Please note this is my own opinion based on my personal teaching experience)

The other major factor is that education is outdated. The system still pushes for girls achievement (as exampled by the article you posted) due to the fact that girls were previously undervalued. It is an example of how the world has gone too far to make up for previous injustices. 

A huge focus is girls achieving in maths and making it less competitive (educators have long linked maths achievement with boys doing well and girls under achieving.) What I find frustrating however is that the long time link of boys underachieving in English is not so forcefully addressed... any resources to inspire boys to enjoy reading need to be purchased as a separate expensive set that teachers need to really push for. It previously took me a year of arguing before getting simple books aimed at boys.

There are multiple quotes from both men and women in positions of power who agree that the programs to help girls have been so successful that they have inverted.  So they need to use similar techniques to reach white boys.  The people who need to see this do see this and are taking action.  The article does talk about how business isn't an example of where it inverted so it makes sense that people are following the statistics to try and fill the gaps everywhere.  The program in your article and what is described in this one.
Problems that boys and girls face are being handled simultanously.

To answer your question, here is a quote about some of the programs helping out boys in the UK and US.  Of course more can be done but the point is that the ball is rolling.

"" Seventy-seven British universities, or about 45 percent of the total, report that they have programs to support men and young boys in general, the national Office of Fair Access reports; 51 of them, to help working class and white, black, and ethnic minority low-income boys in particular. There are fewer university efforts like this in the U.S.—but one example is a White House initiative called My Brother’s Keeper, is designed to lower crime and high-school dropout rates and improve college-going and employment prospects for black and Hispanic males.""

If you're against affirmative action, and want hiring to be based on competency above all else, then fostering interest in underrepresented demographics is a good thing. 

Not sure about your area, but all good secondary schools should offer, as part of the final few years, resources and guidance to help students set goals and figure out where and what they want to be later in life. I also want to note that academic performance is measured by grades, and that having goals and aspirations has over the years become rather separate from that.

In effect, what you seem to be saying is that because *some* young white men take up positions in business, construction, politics etc. then the others - the disadvantaged boys - can go hang.

That doesn't seem very fair to me and certainly not very just.

The other point of course is that by saying ""girls ... are not as represented in businesses"" ignores a number of things that I think are actually quite important:

* Firstly, this is women we are talking about, not girls (obviously);

* Secondly - and more importantly - discussions of the wage gap and comparatively low representation in certain sectors (boardrooms, politics, etc.) - always treat women and men as single individuals - not as a partner in a relationship or as a key member of household;

* So, thirdly, that means that, say, when a professional business woman has children she may be able to return to work on reduced hours and/or reduced days because she is supported by the spouse - this is an incredibly sensible and common arrangement and one which - by the way - is also practised by lesbian couples - I know of two married lesbian couples where one works full-time, whereas the other has actually stopped work altogether to be the full-time carer. It seems absurd therefore to criticise heterosexual couples for doing something that works perfectly well for homosexual ones;

* Fourthly, women are very well represented in certain business functions - Human Resources roles are [75.8% female](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/blogs/employment-intelligence/2011/04/the-uk-hr-profession-is-758-fe/) in the UK; PR is [63% female](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/why-are-there-so-many-women-in-pr/375693/) in the US; and [78% of publishers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/27/us-study-finds-publishing-is-overwhelmingly-white-and-female) in the US also women. Of course, the retort to that is ever and always ""Yes, but they're not in the top positions"" - and that is very often the case. But again, it is often the case because women bear children and this significantly shifts their priorities from work to family. 

In short, saying women ""are not as represented in businesses"" is such a gross generalisation as to be meaningless - it certainly cannot be assumed to be a consequence of ""systemic gendered discrimination"" as is usually implied.",William__F0ster,t2_108dx7,24,0,reddit2

My workplace is 61% female, management is about 42℅. There are a plethora of women only events to promote inclusion. Meanwhile there are very few Asian, Hispanic, or black men despite plenty of black and Hispanic women (not a lot of Asians in the area).

The only obstacle women face is the biological compulsion to have children which I understand completely. Most women I know aren't in love with their careers, even though plenty of them convince themselves they are. 

If you want to know why there are more highly successful men just stick around after 5:15. You'll see some incredible women but mostly men trying to get ahead.

Sargon does a number of videos on these types of people and even he sounds surprised by how many of them are all just people like sociology professors and so on.

For one, the vast majority of the benefits go to a tiny elite slice of the population, which lends itself far more to an oligarchy than a patriarchy. This goes double when you factor in that the elites network and educate and support their female children, too. For example, female grads of Harvard Law see only a tiny penalty vs their male peers in initial pay, but both see massive benefits vs. the ordinary law student in opportunities and network effects. They quadruple the average pay for a lawyer in the US in their first year out of school.

Secondly, proponents of patriarchy theory are rather selective in what they deem to be penalties and benefits. They tend to cherry pick, rather heavily, and ignore most of the negative social effects that are aimed at men, like enforced stoicism, the general tendency of our societies to treat men as disposable, to hold men to higher and more stringent standards for responsibility (which shows in the CJS), etc. Modern patriarchy theorists have at least admitted that there's social roles men are expected to fill, and that many of these have negative aspects, but they seem to fail to see why this undermines the entire concept of a patriarchy in the first place.

And just what are these mysterious pressures of which you speak? 

It rather seems to me that you must be grossly overinterpreting patterns in data to a degree that is unjustifiable.

For one thing, as I pointed out above, women are represented in business, but they tend to gravitate towards certain sectors (e.g. publishing, PR) or certain functions (e.g. HR, CSR, marketing).

To talk of ""pressures"" that ""steer them towards raising a family"" you would think they had no agency in this process whatsoever. For that matter, not only no agency, but also no desire and no physical materiality pressing that desire forward.

> This also doesn't excuse the male from having an equal amount of family responsibilities. Short of breastfeeding there is nothing a mother can do for her family that a father can't.

Two points:

First, while it is true ~~that~~ *that ""Short of breastfeeding there is nothing a mother can do for her family that a father can't""*  this ignores the fact that married lesbian couples with children - I know of two personally as I pointed out above - have divided responsibility between one parent that is the main care-giver and one that is the main bread winner - actually, in both cases, the sole breadwinner and the sole full-time care-giver. 

In other words, this is a practical arrangement between loving couples with children that works out best for the whole family meaning there is no need for theories of imagined discrimination at a systemic and societal level.

If there is any discrimination there at all, it is the one that only criticises heterosexual couples for an arrangement common to homosexual ones.

Second, is it the place of government and society to intervene in the private arrangements couples choose to make? What problem is in need of correction?

Yes, the state should intervene where violence or abuse is taking place, but where the woman goes part-time, but the man continues to work full-time? Who is that harmful to? And what on Earth makes you think that the women aren't involved in making those decisions? What makes you think they may not even be the main instigators?

It's patriarchy theory that the overwhelming majority of our social spending goes towards women's health concerns and social concerns and the very same concerns in men are habitually funded more poorly ... if they are funded at all?

You're basically just making my case for me, really. When I said that proponents of patriarchy theory are rather selective in what they deem benefits and penalties, this is what I meant.  Where you see ""more men in leadership"" and stop there, I go further and point that leadership and responsibility go hand in hand. A large proportion of men's greater health issues around lifestyle and stress effects stem directly from that added responsibility. From heart disease to suicide to greater reliance on drugs and alcohol, there's plenty of negatives that go along with higher overall social responsibility. 

It's not just a benefit, and as women gain more and more leadership positions, now their rates of things like heart disease are approaching men's rates for the first time.  Of course, the rise of female incarceration, female heart disease rates, and other signs that they are seeing greater responsibility has only prompted society to double down on ameliorating the effects ... just for women.",,,8,0,reddit2

The question you are asking is wrong because in order for me to answer it to your satisfaction would require me to already share the social constructivist worldview that you appear to be putting forward.

I don't and therefore - in much the same way as the stork in the Aesop's fable was unable to eat from the flat plate offered her by the fox (who then lapped up both his own meal as well as hers) - would not answer that question - or at least, would not answer it in any way that would satisfy you.

> The pressures are all around us and can range from the media's portrayal of women to parenting styles.

As interesting as this is, it is still conjecture. The actual truth is that we really do not know quite what the relationship between the media and our personal behaviour is - if we did, then business would be a vastly less risky pursuit than it is.

Advertisers always remember the massive successes because, after all, they are advertisers and so above all else they have to sell themselves harder than any of the products or services they want to push.

There is no effective method that has yet been devised that could accurately and definitively account for the effect that media portrayals of women have on the behaviour of actual women. For a start, not all women are alike - they belong to different social classes, have different levels of education, have different ages, lifestyles, ethnicities and so on. The latter means that they are not all seeing/reading/hearing the same media at the same time or at the same frequencies and even in cases where they do those media will not have the same meaning to each of those women.

> Countless studies have been done to point out automatic discrimination in group dynamics toward women.

Name one. In fact, better yet, name a meta-analysis of these ""Countless studies"" and then let's see the position from which those studies were produced.

> I'm not saying individuals lack agency, but society definitely limits it.

Well, actually you kind of have been up until now - at least in how you have expressed yourself thus far otherwise I wouldn't have made the comment.

Besides, if you believe ""society definitely limits"" agency then how is that really all that different from my suggestion that you are saying women have in effect no agency in making decisions about their own lives?

> Household responsibilities can't be explained off as simply an arrangement between partners.

Just so. 

But this is not what I am arguing. What I am arguing is that this is not something which society should meddle in - as I said above, if there is violence or abuse then yes, society - via the law - should intervene. But the domestic arrangements of couples and how they organise their lives are absolutely none of your beeswax - nor mine neither.

Naturally, you are free to be as judgmental about the lifestyles and marital arrangements of others as you so please. 

But if you are nearing an argument which suggests we must use e.g. the education system to 'combat' the way most couples with children organise their arrangements, then you would be clearly crossing a particular kind of rubicon - one which argues that the limited resources of the state should be re-diverted to 'solve' a problem that - I would argue very strongly - is no kind of problem at all.

> We know discrimination is present because the vast majority of these ""arrangements"" relegate most household responsibilities to the female. 

""We know""?

We most certainly do not. 

There is emphatically absolutely no evidence of discrimination at all in the pattern of those arrangements - as I've noted **twice** before now - and which you have ignored both times - if the same practical arrangements are practised by lesbian couples without comment then it very strongly suggests that discrimination is not a factor.

Once again, by calling it discrimination you are asserting that the women in these relationships have conceded to arrangements that do not favour them - but on what grounds are they being disfavoured? And again, what makes you think the women are not active participants in the decisions made between herself and her (in this case) male partner?

You assume far, far too much and read, way, way too much into statistics that simply do not bear out your conclusion.

Your arguments remind me of a passage from the anarcho-primitivist Bob Black's classic *Feminism as Fascism*: ""radical feminists actually reduce women to nothing but helpless, cringing near-vegetables, passive victims of male contempt and coercion. This profoundly insults women in a way which the worst patriarchal ideologies — the Jewish notion of woman as a source of pollution, for instance, or the Christian nightmare of woman as temptress and uncontrollable sexual nature-force — fell short of. They defamed woman as evil but could hardly regard her as powerless. The new woman-as-victim stereotype is not only directly traceable to nineteenth century Victorian patriarchal attitudes reducing (bourgeois) women to inert ornaments, but by denying to women the creative power inherent in everyone, it places women’s demands on a par with those advanced for, say, baby seals.""

Ironically, in your fight against imaginary oppression, you reinforce stereotypes about women as weak-willed damsels in distress.  

Also, are you fighting to get women into more dangerous jobs?   Men currently make up about 95% of workplace deaths.

Hm, actually [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism).

And I suppose, for you, that places it beyond criticism?

> We may not know *everything* about the media's effect on individuals, ... just look at Joseph Berger's theory on status characteristics from Stanford University.

Having never heard of Berger, I've just been looking him up and I see very quickly why you would have chosen this gentleman (and scholar) as his research interests include *processes of legitimation*, *distributive justice* and *gender relations*.

I am not saying these aren't legitimate fields of enquiry and I am most certainly not suggesting that Berger lacks the competence to investigate them - but what I am saying is that these areas of his are highly politicised and quite likely partisan. 

Taken together whatever he says is not beyond criticism and I have no intention of simply bowing down before someone on the grounds that they are from Stanford U. alone.

> I'm not saying women who focus on household responsibilities are being oppressed.

That's exactly what you are saying. Your very next sentence proves it:

> I'm just pointing out the discrimination in the assumption that women do better at home.

And again, you are wrong. It is *your* assumption that the heterosexual couple with children believe ""that women do better at home"" and it is *your* bald and unfounded assertion that this is a form of discrimination.

> And I'm ignoring your lesbian anecdote because it doesn't mean anything.

It is an anecdote, true, but it does mean something - I have pointed out explicitly what that is and in this case even if it is an outlier, it still needs explanation because it is the kind of outlier which blows a hole below the waterline of your theory.

According to you, where two women are in a relationship the bread-winning and care-giving roles should be split equally, 50-50. That is your assertion.

So - even if in just two cases - this does not happen, in fact, the polar opposite happens because in both cases the other partner does not work at all and is a full-time care giver - requires your theory to explain it.

> The fact that these arrangements are unsaid points even more to the discrimination. They don't ask; they just assume.

Again, you are the only one here making assumptions.

Your theory doesn't fit reality. 

So either there is something wrong with reality, or there is something wrong with your model.

My money's on your model being wrong.

Well, here's a thought - because of the lobbying of feminist politics and feminist viewpoints that persists in presenting women and girls as victims of social control through a gross over-reading of patterns of behaviour when seen at a macro-level.

The fact that most of these patterns seem to be more readily explained by the fact that adult women become pregnant and bear children and men do not, indeed cannot, than by mysterious systemic forces into ""avoiding"" women careers speaks volumes.

True enough, as a static description.  If you are going to spend your time raising children, then you will have less time available for other tasks, being big in the boardroom, for example.

What you leave unclear is the causality.  What is the ""pressure"" that steers women toward raising children?  You seem to be suggesting it's some set of social attitudes. An alternative explanation is that women are physically suited to the job in a way men aren't, so it's more cost efficient that they do the job.  It's an economic pressure stemming from physical characteristics.  That lets us decide on causality: physical characteristics come first, before any social attitudes.  The social attitudes can be explained by what everyone is accustomed to; that is, they are an effect, not a cause.

These pressures are economic, so they are affected by the general economy which today looks nothing like what it did a couple of  hundred years ago.

Heh.  Market forces are inescapable.  You may think you are exercising free will, choosing for yourself the path that benefits you, right now; but remember that millions of others are in a similar position to you, and many of those will be making the same choice.  This upsets the price of everything, and your initial choice may then not look so good.

For example, more women in the workforce leads to a higher cost for commercial childcare.

And yes, you could Pass A Law for subsidizing childcare; but someone, somewhere, in some way, will be paying for that subsidy.  That itself will change the market.

Environment comes before attitudes. So the driver, the cause, is the environment.  Social attitudes are an effect, stemming from the constraints imposed by the environment.  I think I can agree with that.

If attitudes are an effect and not a cause, then you can't change the attitude and reasonably expect it to affect the environment.  That sort of thinking leads to inanities like expecting that, for example, if we dress young boys in pink, they will be able to have babies when they grow up.

h4yj7lv,t1_h4ycyqq,2021-07-12 20:12:59,MensRights,">The differences between vaccines has been blown out of proportion

Not by a long shot. All we have to do is to compare two countries that a while ago both had vaccinated around 70% of the population: Israel and Seychelles. While the former (which administered only Pfizer) managed to reduce cases to almost zero and go back to normality (not without consequences though as cases are rising again) the latter (which administered Astrazeneca and Sinopharm) had the biggest wave in its history with most patients being vaccinated people. This matches the numbers we got from trials of those vaccines.

It's important to state that any vaccine is better than no vaccine, obviously. However to claim that the differences are ""blown out of proportion"" is flat out lying. They exist and they are relevant.

&#x200B;

>Pfizer has a reduced efficacy of somewhere between 64% and 88% against the delta variant.

Pfizer efficacy against Delta variant has been consitently 87% and 88% in [two](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1.full.pdf) different [studies](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses). The 50%-60% values are for a single dose of the vaccine. Delta variant is in general very resistant to a single dose of any vaccine. J&J being single dose, having generally lower efficacy and the lack of data concerning its efficacy in Delta variant is what's leading experts to suggest booster shots. For all that's worth right now trusting in J&J for Delta variant is basically a gamble. Whether it's safe to mix vaccines or not that's an entirely different subject, I'm also on the fence about that.

&#x200B;

>Both of them cut hospitalizations and deaths by upper-90's percentages with confidence intervals that likely overlap each other.

Not entirely correct, but close enough. J&J cut hospitalizations and deaths in 85% while Pfizer/Moderna in nearly 100%. Smaller difference than mild to moderate cases no doubt, but definitely relevant. And while those numbers are very good, it does not consider the fact that even mild infections can easily leave you with permanent damage. This includes permanent damage to your [lungs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-lungs-scarring-smokers-lungs/), [brain](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/covid-19s-effects-on-the-brain-68369) and [heart](https://magazine.ucsf.edu/what-covid-doing-our-hearts).

I have also included variant-specific data on Delta variant with multiple studies.
2. Difference between hospitalization prevention is smaller but also present. That's not counting Delta variant however. Single doses have been ineffective at preventing hospitalization from Delta variant. Referring to Portugal in particular, in the recent Lisbon wave [one third of ICU patients had a first dose already](https://expresso.pt/coronavirus/2021-06-23-Covid-19.-Um-terco-dos-doentes-em-cuidados-intensivos-na-regiao-de-Lisboa-ja-tinha-sido-vacinado-com-primeira-dose-6a4fac40). J&J being a single-dose and the only approved shot without data on Delta variant efficacy (as well as lower efficacy overall of course) is precisely why [concerns about it and Delta variant](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25/) arose. In Portugal [Delta variant is already 90% of all our infections](https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-07-07/delta-variant-responsible-for-close-to-90-percent-of-infections-in-the-country/60905).
3. I addressed this in the post. Blood clot effects were extremely rare on both men and women. The data used here to justify it showed twice as many cases in women. However ""twice as many"" here is the difference between one in a million or two in  a million. The EMA has recommended it for both men and women. Needless to say there will be a lot of men dying from the delta variant while having J&J than there would be women dying from blood clots if they took it.
4. I don't call ""women get protection, men get whatever is left"" strategy. I call it sexism. It's ""women and children first"" all over again. Except that while feminists claim that ""women and children first"" mentality is perpetuated by men, this has been decided by two women, the minister of health and the general-director of DGS.",TheSpaceDuck,t2_kjyvk,6,0,reddit3

Feminists claim its because of patriarchy I claim its because of capitalism. Men's issues are workers issues and those will never end without capitalism fucking off. It's pointless complaining about men behind discriminated against when it will always happen. Business is business and men will always be heavily exploited if the system is always running.

What's the point in complaining that my coffee is made with slave labour? Petitioning to get it changed? How about don't fucking drink it and don't support the shitty system. Fuck the systems that keep us all oppressed. 

Only Americans are brainwashed into thinking capitalism is the be all and end all. Well their global influence is sad though because a lot of people think like the Americans now. If we all acted like the Americans the world wouldn't exist. There isn't enough resources to exploit.
Capitalism turns necessities like housing and healthcare into exploitable commodities. I would argue that both of these are massive issues that affect men more at least where I live so I would say they are MENS ISSUES.

 I don't want to have to work till I'm dead to make some rich fuck richer. That is a male and a female issue but there again many men are happy to do that but I believe they are the brainwashed minority. People like to live in a false reality because its easier than coping with the fact that capitalism is pure greed and brutality for the sake of brutality and greed.

Also has a VERY low mortality rate for their large outbreak, and said outbreak was likely exacerbated by removing most restrictions all at once.

So did Israel however. And the consequences were going from almost zero Covid cases to a couple hundred (in a population of 9 million instead of 97.000) rather than a record-setting wave. There is no reason why Israel's behaviour wouldn't have caused a wave like the Seychelles had other than the difference in vaccines.

>These vaccinated people were very sick and had high resting heart rates and low SpO2 measurements, but pulled through.

Over here (and most of Europe I'd say) low SpO2 levels are reason for immediate hospitalization. This is what can lead you to a ventilator (or worse) as well as one of the reasons for long-term damage.

&#x200B;

>J&J, Pfizer and Moderna all worked well against Beta, which was less contagious but more likely to evade an immune response than Delta.

Beta is the most vaccine-evasive as a whole that's true, however Delta is the most vaccine-evasive when it comes to single doses which have been highly ineffective against it. J&J vaccine is single-dose. The lack of data on Delta variant (all the previously mentioned Delta variant studies included most vaccines except for J&J) is also a red flag here. Right now for all purposes it is a gamble.

&#x200B;

>If you have vaccine options, you're living in a developed country. Most of the world doesn't have that option.

Well obviously, not arguing with that. However saying we're better off than a third-world country doesn't change the fact that men are treated as second-class citizens compared to women.

>care to point out which points are wrong/false?

I already did. The video points out that trials in different places with different variants shouldn't draw conclusions. I have pointed:

1. Information specific to the variant we have
2. Data from real-world with countries that are already 70% vaccinated, not from trials
3. Data from ICU patients (not just infected) with single-doses here in Portugal

Wealth inequality in America just passed the gilded age. If you don't get the scope of the damage capitalism is doing do some research. Global warming, ocean acidification, corruption wealth inequality. Bezos has more money than Serbia. The fucking country Serbia.

Men are and always have been devalued because throughout history we have had constant class warfare and men tend to be treated the worse. I would rather be a house slave than dying in the mines or in a gladiator fight against wild animals like lions and elephants. 

We have always made other men do our dirty work because we control them with wealth. It has to stop. It is fucking bullshit. The economy isn't some wild beast we struggle to understand. The rich manipulate it all the time. They make our living conditions worse so we have to work. Men bear the brunt of the horrific working conditions we are forced to suffer for their opulence. How many men are lured into killing for the US army simply because they the army recruiters prey on disadvantaged children. They love the poor and abused kids because you can control them with a small opportunity for gain even if they have to do awful things. 

The economy is all fabricated. You think a stable system has a major crash every couple of years. Rent prices in some places are getting so much that the people are protesting. Americans claim freedom but what they mean is freedom to steal. But be very careful from who you steal. If its from someone who can fight back do it. If it's from someone with money do not. Have you not seen the stories of police being violent all around the world for no good fucking reason these people are all protected.

 The state is tyrannical because the wealthy have influence from their wealth and they can use this disproportionate influence to create even more wealth through nefarious means.

Women got priority in these interviews. Often times they did not even meet the advertised GPA cutoff for interviews or internships. Yet they still got them. I would kill to go to those networking events because that is the say-all-end-all to getting a job in my field. 

I once accompanied a shy female companion to a Women in Engineering networking event because I was also desperate for some face time. There were enough open slots and free food so I thought why not. The looks of disgust and anguish from the female recruiters made me almost retreat into a corner the rest of the night. I feel this even worked against me when I had a group interview and one of the female recruiters was in the room. The one who outlandishly called me out for going to such networking events.

I.e. They are encourage to be classically feminine, and males classically masculine. One takes and one gives.

Today, we also encourage women to enter the workforce. The difference is that men are still expected to be classically masculine - workhorses, catering to women, and such. You can see how shit this situation is, right?

To add, males have 2 years compulsory imprisonment in the form of military service, so women get a great head start. In my school, teachers already say that fresh grads will get poached by the companies; meanwhile males are carted off to serve and twiddle their thumbs and do fuck all.

So the end result is that we now have highly empowered women, capable and able, but still not too ""weak"" to go do military service, and still needing men to submit to them.

I live in Estonia, and it isn't that bad in here. We have 4 largely sex-orientes goverment organizations (I'll use direct translations for sake of simplicity):

**Defensive Alliance (DA)** is largely male oriented goverment military organization, though (as far as I know as 15 year old) women can also join. It is kind of military for Estonia, but it is ONLY used when we need to protect our country. It is an organization where everyone 18+ can join, and do not get paid for it. There are annual military excercises, where everyone joined MUST take part of, or they'll be fined. In the meantime, you'll be normal working citizen, not a soldier.

**Female Home Defense (FHD)** is pretty much same like DA, unsure about excercise part. They are ones who make food and that stuff. Only females can join there.

**Young Eagles** is our Boys Only organization. It is a preparation for DA, and covers most important topics like map, navigation and forest survival/camping, also military/forest/group discipline. For 13+ boys there are some controversial topics which I won't specify. I am a member of Eagles.

**Home Daughters** is the Girls Only club. Preparation for FHD. Don't know alot about what they do there.

https://qz.com/671633/hillary-clinton-takes-a-stand-for-women-in-prison/


“Mass incarceration’s impact on women and their families has been particularly acute — and it doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” writes Clinton. The US is home to 5% of the world’s women, but imprisons 30% of the women incarcerated worldwide.

As we can see here : 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm

women make up only 9% of the US prison population.  The men in prison in America are also imprisoned at much higher rates than in any other country.  As Jim Jefferies joked - 'The land of the free has the largest percentage of non-free people in the world'

You can see from the bbc table, that the US is imprisoning men at 6x the rate of the rest of the world too.....  So why is Hillary only focused on the 9% that women make up of the prison population?

Not a reliable figure. In the third world, circumcision is not usually on babies. In the first world (North America), where neo-natal circumcision is common, the ""hundreds"" figure was obtained by assuming all unassigned male-over-female neonatal deaths to be due to circumcision. More careful studies have put the North American rate at about 20 deaths per year out of an incidence of about one million circumcisions annually.   



To preserve credibility, MR should omit the ""hundreds"" nonsense and instead argue that those 20 deaths (and an unquantified number of serious botches) are completely unnecessary given that the benefits of the elective procedure are ambiguous.",Mens-Advocate,t2_o4u60,3,0,reddit4

It's one thing to say men face social rights issues, but it's another thing entirely to say that they are institutionally disadvantaged to women overall.

Baby girls in China are literally abandoned or killed by their parents because boys are preferred. Female genital mutilation is done for the sake of keeping women faithful to their husbands by ""disabling"" them from feeling sexual pleasure. Women in the middle east literally are commanded BY LAW not to do things like drive, or even just dress the way they want. 

I get that there are many issues men face, but please, please don't delude yourself into believing that all feminists are out to get men and install a matriarchal society where men suffer for the sins of their fathers. That is not what the majority of feminists want, and as men we shouldn't try to make ourselves out to be the ""bigger"" victims, because in the reality of this world that just makes us out to be people who long for the old days when women everywhere had fewer civil and social rights.

yes men occupy both extremes.  I never said that just because someone is a man, he is a genius. my only point is that if you're looking at a man and a woman and had to guess which was smarter based on nothing but their gender, you would be right more often than wrong if you picked the man.

""IQ has nothing to do with success""

never said it did. please stop putting words in my mouth.

IQ is merely a measure of how well a mind can solve problems, not a measure of their motivation and discipline to solve problems on a regular basis and therefore derive success


also, 80% was an exaggeration because Reddit. here is my source and an explanation of the actual figured though( not far off)

http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/PAID2011.pdf

In table 3, the one with the consistent participants, at the age of 16 boys had an average IQ of 101.461 with an sd of 15.235 and girls had an average IQ of 99.681 with an sd of 14.085.

Though the difference in standard deviation is small, such differences can have a huge effect on the number of outliers.
For example, in the model where IQ follows a normal distribution for each gender (mean 101.461 for boys with sd 15.235 and mean 99.681 for girls with sd 14.085), one would expect nearly twice as many boys as girls with an IQ above 130. To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model.
These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean. For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.


In closing, even if men disproportionately occupy the retard spectrum of the bell curve, they also disproportionately occupy the genius spectrum. and geniuses are the ones who change the world and innovate and discover and invent. therefore men are the dominant force in the world.  evidence for that is all around you. who invented the device you're talking to me on right now? the internet it uses? the satellites/towers/optics it transmits information to?   name 1 female innovator of antiquity and there are 20-40 men for every 1 female, which backs up the statistics(even though they need no backing up)",RetortsLikeAristotle,t2_2cqouh12,2,0,reddit4

e7od3yq,t1_e7nrxd4,2018-10-13 04:05:26,MensRights,"This study while helpful for determining intelligence at the ages of 7, 11, and 16. It’s not so helpful when the brain doesn’t finish developing until 25. It would be more accurate to see the same test for fully developed adults to start categorizing gender.

A 2-5 IQ point difference is something but basically pointless.

If you were to pick at random, you would have equally likely chances of a man being a dumbass as well as being a genius. You have statistically the same chance. 

So where you are correct, is if you were asked to pick who is more likely to be the genius between a girl & a guy, then yes you would pick a guy. But that’s a different question than asking who is smarter. Because in this case the average is the same, so it doesn’t matter which gender you pick. 

The answer changes due to the fact that your analyzing different parts of the data.

So at 16 years old, 2:1 ratio of guys to girls at 130 - which is 2.28% of the population. Which is 1.5% male and .77% female of the population.

And a 6:1 at 160 - which is the 0.001% of the population. Which is 0.000833% of the population for men & 0.0001666% of the population for women, I don’t think they are statistically relevantly to include in random tests for determining who’s smarter.

We can dive deep into semantics, but that is not really my point here. The whole point of this sub is to make people aware of men’s issues and share together the burden and suffering that men uniquely face and make it important. We are trying to build support and help people take men’s issues serious because men are often an afterthought. We are expected to handle the dangerous sides of life. And we do matter and our issues do matter.

While I understand your frustration and want to point out the delusions of feminist rhetoric, believing men are superior and deserve to be worshipped is what got us in this hot mess. We don’t need to be talking
about who’s the superior sex or who’s more important We need to gain support from both men and women in the issues men face. Because right now, all discourse is completely dominated by women and men need a voice to share their thoughts and feeling and frustrations. Women think that because men perform at the top level across the board mean that all men live lives like that — but we don’t. There are men who operate at the lower levels of intelligence and get looked down upon, there are men who have to risk their lives everyday, there are men who have to deal with mental issues and are more harshly treated because of it. 

When we have discussions with people who aren’t men activists, we have to think in their perspective and give them things that they can empathize with and support us. We won’t get women who will day ah yes, men are smarter and therefore deserve more respect or prestige. But we can get women who can look compassionately at male strife and want to do something about it. Inspire that. I know you can do it.",summonblood,t2_94x2i,1,0,reddit4

Because one man disagrees with your worldview, you assert than men, collectively, do not understand history? That's one big fucking leap. 

>Let me ask you a question, were men in the past privileged or not?

Not particularly. What makes you think they were? Most *people* in history have lived quite shitty lives. Men and women. How can you quantify suffering? Did women in the past need to go and fight in wars? No. Did they need to do all the back-breaking manual labour? No. Did your grandmother die of black-lung from working in the coal pits? No. So what privileges do you imagine the common man had?

>Men are far overrepresented in the STEM field.

Uhh, technically no. If you take the proportion of degree holders women are over-represented in STEM positions. If you take the proportion of college students women are over-represented because there are more scholarships available to them. Men are more common in the STEM field because they choose the subject more often than women do but they're not over-represented. You can't mandate career interest, unfortunately.

Fuck those people. You're on hard mode? Beat it anyways. And when they turn 30 and complain that life is suddenly hard? When they whine and bitch because their souls are empty and their lives are meaningless? Point and laugh. Because you made your life into something despite their bullshit.

That's what it means to be a man. Many fail to learn this, and more fail to achieve it. But it can be done, and you can do it.

TL;DR:  Being a man IS harder. That's what makes it so much more meaningful to succeed as one. Women are depressed, lonely, and unfulfilled in record numbers, highest they've ever been since they started measuring it in the SIXTIES. Men? Not so much. Because we still have purpose and meaning.

jfg2036,t3_12f5xjm,2023-04-08 14:03:15,MensRights,"Honestly, there's a shitton of struggles men face in society that we don't talk about. I feel like as a society (I'm from north America), the only privileges men face are from historical biases.

I study in philosophy, and we see how in most if not all disciplines, men have a lot more recognition than women. Canons very rarely include women (or non white men, for that matter), unless it serves to support the linear tale that we artificially constructed. So for that, I don't think modern men are privileged, maybe just for the representation factor. That being said, ""masculine"" ways are privileged, because we constructed our historical tale based on definitions and views typically masculine, which means that in today's world, someone who tries to produce a research in a different way doesn't benefit from the credibility history gives masculine approaches. Again, I don't think it's specifically a ""man privilege"", but it serves to see how previous privileges men had still affect the way we see and shape reality today.

Another historical bias is found in medicine, where the majority of diagnosis criterias are coming from male doctors observing male (white) patients. That means it's a lot harder to be taken seriously and get a diagnosis when you're not a white man. And that goes for psychology but also diseases and heart problems and a lot more: the symptoms are not necessarily the same for women so theyre automatically discarded from that option in diagnosis. Of course, that privilege is kind of countered by the societal pressure on men to never complain and or seek (medical) help. That being said, we can't just deny that this is a struggle that a lot of people face *because* they're not white or a man. 

Also, the fact that women (and non white people) are misunderstood in the medical world leads to disregarding the level of pain someone is in. When someone who isn't a white man complains about pains, they are more likely to get told that they're exaggerating or that it's normal. Period pains are so misunderstood by most doctors, they will just tell women suffering from a burst appendix that it's normal and they should get used to it. A lot of young girls get out on hormones as soon as they get their period, even when it's not necessary, which affects their bodies greatly. 

Oh and another bias is the assumption that men know more, and are more capable. In many areas, and on many topics, men are still considered more apt to talk about the topic or lead a project. The argument of ""women are too affected by their hormones"" still persists strong, and women are considered less logical, less realistic, less pragmatic, less strong and less intelligent on a practical level. At my job, when one of my male co-workers says some bullshit, the customer always assumes he's right, while when I say a verified fact that I also know from experience, they'll turn to my (male) coworker and ask for confirmation. I feel like that bias is less and less present, and I'm sure a lot of fields have gone near past it, but it's still very much there and it affects greatly the day to day of most people. 

That being said I just think it's super important to keep in mind that privileges often come with hardships. Strong and reliable men are also disposable. Legally protected women are also seen as nothing more than vulnerable victims. I believe that we all have privileges, depending on all our levels of identity and on the field we're in. It's valid and important that we talk about the issues men face, but it's also important to avoid making it a sex war, when it just needs to be a societal critic and a way to shed light on our realities.",OhShitIDontCare,t2_425ntc1a,1,0,reddit1

Here are some of the worst parts of being a woman:

Women are more likely to experience sexual harassment or assault, and are often blamed or not believed when they report it.

Women still earn less money than men for the same work, and are less likely to be promoted to high-level positions.

Women are expected to conform to unrealistic beauty standards and face constant pressure to look a certain way.

Women are often expected to take on the majority of caregiving responsibilities for children and elderly relatives.

Women who choose to have children may face discrimination in the workplace, and are often judged for their parenting choices.

Lastly, for the majority of women, one week out of every month (at minimum) is pure hormonal hell with constant cramping bleeding. They are still expected to work and parent while this is happening. 

While it's true that men face their own set of challenges, it's important to acknowledge that being a woman can be incredibly difficult as well.

Lies or misinformed?

For most western countries there was a roughly ten year gap between men getting the vote and women getting the vote.  AND, the reason men got it was for their contributions to WWI.  Women made no such contribution and got it anyway.

Women have always worked except during times of *extreme* economic downturn.  The reasoning was to increase the value of labour in the work force and because women's wages were their own, not the family's as it was for men.  There's records of women being masters in trade guilds in the 1400s, ffs.

Women had no financial obligations to make money for the family, but they did have an obligation to not leave a family penniless.  Women seeking a divorce needed to show she hadn't robbed her family blind before she left, but otherwise could divorce.  Here's the thing though, it didn't matter who initiated the divorce, the husband had to pay her alimony for the rest of his life.  She could cut ties with him, he could not. 

That's a new one.  But no, women in western countries have never been restricted from getting a driver's licence.  The first drivers licenses to exist was in France and they only started IIRC 8 years before the first women got one.  Considering the roles and responsibilities of men and women of that time, and how exceedingly rare cars were, that's not an indication of women being restricted from having a driver's licence.",_name_of_the_user_,t2_d1105ji2,9,0,reddit1

jfir7yt,t1_jfh4t3r,2023-04-09 01:56:09,MensRights,"> There’s no need to completely shrug off women’s struggle for franchise. Why do you think women were among the last groups to get the right to vote? 

Because until women got the vote there was no such thing as a right without a responsibility and both women and men didn't want women to have to take on even more responsibilities than they already had.  Washing clothes on a wash board woth 7 kids on your hip, while making every meal from scratch...  Women had enough to do. 

Men got the right to vote based on the condition that they can be drafted.  Society didn't want women to have that condition. 

> Because often, they were considered a mere property of men who are unable to form an individuality of their own. 

No they weren't.  Women and men once married became two parts of a whole.  Men represented that whole at the ballot box.  That doesn't mean women were seen as property.  

And if you want to make the argument that marriage was essentially an economic contract, take a complete look at it.  Viewing things as a contract women essentially sold their reproductive rights to men for the time span that women had those abilities.  Men sold their labour to women for the rest of his life.  Neither position was good, but men's position was worse as there was no way out of it.  Women could initiate a divorce and end their obligations.  Even if a man divorced his wife he would never be allowed to stop paying her. 

> How to do you account for the fact they are so few women in positions of power? 

Freedom of choice.  Women today have the freedom to be a stay at home mother much more than men have the freedom to be stay at home dads.  Add in risk aversion and the vast majority of the reason women hold so few positions of power is mostly down to personal choice now. 

> There’s no need to remove nuance from your argument. Arguing that men have got there own set of problems shouldn’t mean you also say that women have it easy

You should heed your own advice.  Women have, and more importantly had, it plenty bad in history without making things up to make it seem like women had it even worse than they actually had it.",_name_of_the_user_,t2_d1105ji2,1,0,reddit1

I just can't be a Democrat. They don't represent me. The party is majority hard-left (feminist sympathizing as well, I'd imagine) at least in my local and state politics, that is.

My family has been in politics for some 30 years and I can tell you that you simply aren't going to get any support from your party. Maybe from your constituents, sure, but not from party officials. In fact, they'll go out of their way to ""disown"" you. I know reddit hates to hear it but if we ever get even one politician who is on our side, he/she will almost *certainly* be a Republican.

Not to say Republicans aren't capable of being anti MRM. I know plenty who are, and believe the whole ""men are stronger and should give women a pass on their behavior/men have it better and feminism is good"" dribble. Both parties are bad at supporting MRMs if i'm being honest.

Even though it was typical for mid-terms, what we saw in November was a *crushing* defeat for Democrats nationally. They might get most minority/women votes but until they stop being so hostile towards males (specifically, white males) they are going to be consistently head-to-head with Republicans, despite internet warriors foreseeing the future as the ""end of the Republican party."" (I suppose it is, if you live in fantasy land.) 

I'm not trying to convince you to be a Republican. I'm just pointing out why MRA have no future in the Democratic party.

For the record, I take no issue with gay marriage, abortion rights, separation of church and state, or any of the other social ilk. (Besides gun rights. Being someone who owns firearms it's kind of difficult for me to vote for a party that suggests it should be difficult for me to do so or purchase any more.)

I'm a Republican because I believe in limited government and a prosperous free-market economy. I've spent most of my life around Democrats and for every 1 ""MRA, moderate"" democrat I've met, there has been 4 more who were hard-left feminist types.",tipper_the_clown,t2_g6bot,2,0,reddit2

You won't. 

The Democratic party is the party of hostility to men and any political issues or goals they may have.

There's that classic ""republicans protect the evil rich"" argument. Do you care to have an adult conversation or are we just going to revert to the same old talking points? 

You know what I meant. Hard-left in *American* politics. They aren't just ""promising"" namby-pamby regulation. They are writing it, passing it, and signing it, because they have a super majority and can do as they please. (Not to say I'm against that.) Many of these ""weak"" (according to you) regulations negatively affect a good portion of this state. You're ""lol he was wrong when he said hard-left"" argument is grasping at straws and you know it. 

>Because Democrats are weak and spineless. The ones with leadership qualities who stuck to progressive values did okay. It was the ones who ran to the middle that got booted. No one needs a Republican-lite when you can elect the real thing.

Believe me when I say I have a grin on my face as I type this, but America has been hearing this argument since the end of Clinton. If Democrats are going to suddenly ""grow a pair"" and become the true progressives you think they *aren't* already, then they'd better do it soon because some of us have been waiting near 20 god damn years to see it happen and evidently, the racist, misogynistic, fascist, evil, top 1 percent, hitler-esque Republicans are still capable of winning elections.

I, for one, welcome the defeat that would follow. America isn't ready for  your idea of progress so long as it is the platform beneath the ""pro-feminism, pro-pseudo social justice"" party's feet.

People don't like being told what to do if they aren't doing anything wrong. Some people might say I'm a nut, a racist-""teabagger"" hell bent on destroying American diversity and killing all black people, but I'm a guy who wants to live his life without government intervention (to a REASONABLE extent, of course) which is why I vote for who I do. I suppose if you are gay or a woman, you might think the other party does a better job of this, and I respect that. 

Your party's weakness prevents the feminist utopia from becoming a reality, which is why it puts a smile on my face. 

Look, the concept of a democratic MRA sect is an interesting one, but you don't help promote an idea by trying to force it down the throats of the people *least* likely to agree with it.

Abstract: In this paper we test the hypothesis that extensions of the voting franchise to include lower income people lead to growth in government, especially growth in redistribution expenditures. The empirical analysis takes advantage of the natural experiment provided by Switzerland''s extension of the franchise to women in 1971. Women''s suffrage represents an institutional change with potentially significant implications for the positioning of the decisive voter. For various reasons, the decisive voter is more likely to favor increases in governmental social welfare spending following the enfranchisement of women. Evidence indicates that this extension of voting rights increased Swiss social welfare spending by 28% and increased the overall size of the Swiss government.

Excerpt: Academics have long pondered why the government started growing precisely when it did. The federal government, aside from periods of wartime, consumed about 2 percent to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) up until World War I. It was the first war that the government spending didn't go all the way back down to its pre-war levels, and then, in the 1920s, non-military federal spending began steadily climbing. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal — often viewed as the genesis of big government — really just continued an earlier trend. What changed before Roosevelt came to power that explains the growth of government? The answer is women's suffrage.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_gender_gap

* Increased role of government
* U.S. military intervention
* Healthcare and welfare
* Firearms restrictions
* Affirmative action to achieve racial equality

Who suffers more under more government role? Men.

Who fights the battles when the US Military intervenes? Men.

Who pays the majority of taxes to fund healthcare and welfare? Men.

I've been posting here for about 6-ish years, although not all that frequently in the past 2 years or so.  I've been involved for well over 20 years at this point.  The movement basically started way back in the 60s and was very, very much a left wing, hippy-ish type movement.  The MRM that we see today started splitting away in the 70s, focusing mostly on family law - and that's precisely how I got involved.  I watched my older brother go through a custody/support battle - he won custody but got shafted royally on support.  I was surprised he won at all with the judge being so dismissive of him.  Then 5 years later I went through the same thing but didn't get custody, so started digging a bit deeper.

I've always been involved at the local level and didn't really start getting in to it nationally until I became involved here.

>Not one of you leftist fucks were anywhere near this movement until just a few short years ago.

They're also raised in an environment where sex is expected at an extremely young age compared to in richer white neighborhoods where girls are considered pure virgins until college. 

However the big issue is the absence of the father in this situation. You can't seriously say that the fathers not being there is because of women. That's an issue that young black males do have, they don't want to be held down by a child, so they leave. Simple as that.

Excerpt: Academics have long pondered why the government started growing precisely when it did. The federal government, aside from periods of wartime, consumed about 2 percent to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) up until World War I. It was the first war that the government spending didn't go all the way back down to its pre-war levels, and then, in the 1920s, non-military federal spending began steadily climbing. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal — often viewed as the genesis of big government — really just continued an earlier trend. **What changed before Roosevelt came to power that explains the growth of government? The answer is women's suffrage.** [emphasis mine]",Demonspawn,t2_4rklc,-2,0,reddit2

The lagoon represents the drug trade I'm guessing, as the drug trade is the #1 reason for the economic degradation of our ghettoes. However the difference is that people went to the lagoon because it was fun, people get into drug dealing for more money. It's a vicious cycle, drug wars destroy businesses in the neighborhood, destroying jobs and Oppurtunities, while at the same time providing groups of people with a large amount of money. People get into drug dealing because they need money because their neighborhood has no jobs, yet that same drug trade is the reason there are no jobs. I sold drugs for a very long time, and while people look down on drug dealers, the reality is that it earns a tremendous amount of money with little time, but horrible consequences. The alternative is unemployment and welfare, which is exactly what you hate so much, however it's the drug trade which creates the conditions for that.

We lack unity.. many NGOs doesn't support the other. Not sure why.

Women are bullies by reputation destruction. This is a highly robust and validated fact. Women arent angels. They're people. And people like to bully. When bullying is rewarded by the desired outcome, or at least not punsihed, it will happen again, and get worse. Its like when people look at a little bit of porn and then go deeper and deeper. And Im not arguing pro/con porn, just how it works for a lot of people.

If we had a system that was ""wise"", we'd probably have a system that seems monstrously unfair, like solomon cutting a baby in half. A system devised wherein any accuser is believed, but has to take 1/10th of the punishment of the acccused at conviction, might entirely eradicate false accusations.

It might even eradicate frivolous true accusations, the kind where the boy tries to kiss the girl on a date, he makes contact, she pulls away, and then calls the campus police for his sexual assault later on. He was supposed to make a move. She's punishing him for not being attractive enough.

if she receives a slight injury for it, she decides whether or not the harm to her was big enough and harmful enough to accept the punishment she'd also take.

That's the only way I see sexual assault/rape law truly working properly, because there's one critical thing everyone misses about this issue: Sex is an intrinsic and necessary function of humanity, and the only thing that distinguishes it from the horrific acts of violence known as rape are the mental state of both individuals.

That's literally all it is. When something is so common in people and when it looks almost identical to a massive criime, false positives are easy.",Burglingthebrownlog,t2_8uyyyup0,54,0,reddit3

From my recent experience the hard-science departments are quite resistant to the worst bits of social justice drivel because they tend to operate from a default position of logic and rationality. The behaviour of specialists in other subjects may vary. I think in general the worst stuff comes from a  minority of people that's very vocal but even now fairly small in number.

When I hear stories like these, my default assumption is that it's some poor guy trying to get his undergrad degree in history so he can go and become an archaeologist and has found himself attending lectures full of fat, purple-haired women who are only there so they can carefully go over every instance of historic prejudice in their textbooks with a yellow highlighter and write about it on Tumblr.

The fact that universities enrol, and graduate these people based on nothing more than doing that is a ringing indictment of the status quo, and I guess the main reason why we're here, but I think if you go and do your bachelors' in, say, chemical engineering you might find it's less bad.

There's nothing wrong with women being engineers and I think you would be hard pressed to find a man that feels they shouldn't be.

There is something wrong with unqualified women being shoehorned into engineering positions due to gender politics.

If, and I said, ""If"", the women were unqualified and shoehorned into their positions (which is possible) then this represents a men's rights issue because they were placed in their position over more qualified men who were discriminated against due to their gender.

The bridge was inspected two days before the collapse and the inspector left a voicemail about cracks in the bridge.  That's what gets me.  The real failure here, the one that cost human lives, was that the traffic was allowed to continue to drive under the bridge WHILE it was being built and stress tested.

She made the construction of this bridge a gender issue? When? I've seen this claim made twice now, without a single source to back it up.

It's the mentality that women have that says they can do no wrong or ever be held accountable for their actions because at some point they were just too emotional and were just needing help(cue crocodile tears). It's also on the cops/DA to arrest as many people as possible so they can have a great record of fighting crime and making a difference but also to cover their own ass when in case they made a mistake on not arresting. Think about the overblown bullshit blowback from the public if they didn't arrest a guy once and he hurt or killed the woman. They would literally be blamed for it because they somehow didn't know how to see into the future or read peoples minds. The public doesn't use their brains in these situations they only think with their emotions because we don't like seeing our moms cry which passes on to other women that we see crying.

I'm not sure I see how, precisely. I mean, it's certainly possible this wouldn't have happened if he'd been a woman, but I haven't seen a pattern in society that strongly suggests this would be the case.

The police hadn't listened to us (5 different people) the first few times and she denied it every time. She said would say she was going to ""drive into a telephone pole or another car"" and get in her car and and speed off. Another time that week she claimed she would let the ""max"" (transit railway) hit her and rode off on her bike. Without video evidence or her admittance though they couldn't do anything. They simply told her to have a good night and went on their way

Finally the 3rd threat of suicide rolled around and she called my phone letting me know she had actually rode off after mixing a bunch of prescription drugs. The police finally found her and she was taken to a hospital to have her stomach pumped. 

That night I sat on the porch and cried after filling my sister in who lived out of town. Our neighbors across the street called in a DV claim. The cops showed up and told me a neighbor heard someone crying and called in a DV. I explained it was me and that it was because of the stress from the day. They had records of the previous calls for my mother and while they believed me they said I either had the choice to leave for the night, or be arrested as once a dv is called in they *must* split the two up.
