e6nfzmq,t3_9ix7in,2018-09-26 03:06:50,science,"So, in our modern post industrial culture it’s incredibly common for couples to basically spend less time together than they do with others because of work.  If you’re spending all day with people of the gender you’re attracted to, then it’s pretty logical that relationships might develop.  — Mind you, then people might get divorced and marry their new attraction just to end up in the same situation, never seeing their spouse but instead spending all their time at work with others again.

Are these results different in countries with better work/life balance?  Or in situations where the spouses continue to say, work together, or at least spend a lot more of a given day together?

Edit/addition:

So I find it funny that everyone is leaping to cheating, but the article is talking about divorce.  And divorce is **not** caused only by people having sex with others.  Other relationships (those co-workers you have, yeah that’s a type of relationship, a business one) still take a time investment.  If the investment there is preventing the time needed to fix problems in a spousal relationship, then things might go south.

I’m not saying “hey look, greener grass!”  I’m saying “these are the people I talk to every day, and I only see my spouse when they’re asleep because we both work so much”,  and if the study considered the difference on couples who are able to have more time together or not",cyrand,t2_efnwb,4388,0,reddit2

This could lead to a greater sense of dissatisfaction with your marriage because you might feel constantly reminded that there are better options out there.  It's not even necessarily that you cheat on your SO, but it could potentially lead to a sense of resentment, which causes damage to marriage and leads to divorce.

This makes me think...we often find that totally unscientific systems, full of superstition and nonsense and harmful practices, end up having some kernels of functionality just because of natural selection. Ancient tribal healers (or witch doctors or whatever) didn't do scientific trials to test their cures, but a healer who settled on a bad cure was more likely to be killed for their failure than one who didn't, so we routinely see traditional natural cures that actually contain a little bit of a chemical now known to actually work. Similarly, in religion, we see many crazy practices, but also we see some sensible ones, such as mourning practices that sometimes fit very well with what modern psychologists think is most healthy, and presumably that has to do with the same sort of selection.

e6npvjw,t3_9ix7in,2018-09-26 06:59:20,science,"I have an alternative and quite unpopular opinion why. I have known three men in these positions who cheated on their wives. It was of course scandalous, the rumours were prevalent on the run-up, people were always talking about what a terrible person he was, etc.

However on the flip side, I had also had the privilege of meeting their wives. Now looks aside (I don't want to go into details), but the way their wives treated them was pretty crappy. One occasion where we went to some fancy gala ball type event with the company, I remember his wife basically treating him like crap; almost like he was her accessory. She insisted that he went off and got her drinks because the waitress was stupid (and also better looking I'd add). She even went as far as calling him her ""little lap dog"" in front of his staff. Now, this was before the cheating was even a thing, but frankly I noticed no different behaviours with the other two guys who cheated re their wives. IMO, the wives married for the money, not the man. 

I have to say, in that position where I had someone kicking my butt like that every chance and a hot 20-something, I'd damn well cheat too. I've been through enough to realise that sometimes running off with the newer model is actually not just appealing, almost advised! I've also seen and experienced enough myself to know, never get married. 

On the other hand, that guy whose wife treats him well never strays. Men aren't complicated in this regard. If they're not stupid and their other halves mistreat them, they'll wander off. If you treat them well, they'll hang around. Another friend I have, his wife treats him as if he were some sort of king. I don't mean she throws rose petals before him as he walks (which in reality would sort of be inconvenient what with modern life), just lets him go do guy things, happy to cook for him and maintains a decent sex life. I honestly doubt that if you threw a whole pile of 20-somethings at him that he'd bat an eye. 

I digress, it has just been obvious to me that I think back about the men in decent paying roles who aren't stupid who's wives do treat them badly. So really, not too surprising as far as I'm concerned. Add in either a bit of social anxiety or even just time available, chances are most of these men will only ever meet women at their office. Therefore... boom!

I'd assume the correlation would swap genders as the attraction is towards he same gender instead, but I have an uneducated hunch that other factors that would still involve the opposite sex could still play out as well.

Or maybe sexual attraction factor outweighs any other factors by so much that they become negligible. What I can tell from personal experience, while keeping in mind anecdotes aren't data, is that I'm a student in a field that's grossly dominated by males in my country (think nearly actual 100%) and being a gay man I can't help but notice attractive men. The classes that I don't share with other majors usually have no females at all and I definitely find myself distracted by all the tension, even if it's probably just in my head.

Assuming cheating is not a part of this because that's just not what the article seems to state, I do believe that massive interactions with your attractive gender and daily comparisons can have effects on how you evaluate your relationship. I mean that's part of the deal, isn't it? Human experience IS recursive comparison.

Have you no problems with stabbing a faithful co-worker in the back to advance your own career?

Can you deceive city officials about our plans to relocate so you can get us that final tax break?

Can you lie to your employees about downsizing to keep them working for you till you shut them out when they are the most vulnerable?

Can you outsource everything to a gullible private sector so you no longer have to pay health insurance or benefits?

Toss in a mix of people who they click with, as friends are other, who they feel they have more communication with, and it simply adds on top.  Vs more time together which provides more time to communicate and work through things while they’re still minor.

I would think that would actually be more likely to entice somebody to pursue divorce.

1) That's not how science works.

2) Human behavior is neither well understood nor as simple as the physical sciences.

That makes no sense at all. Concealed evolution doesn't lead to a ""dualistic mating strategy"". It leads to whatever you want it to lead, for example some evolutionary biologists think that concealed evolution is to disguise paternity and allows women to mate with as many people as possible. Your second point is equally invalid because for most human societies, for most of human history, polygamy was the norm. The second most popular mating strategy is serial monogamy. And a lot of societies have communal child rearing which voids the purpose of a ""dualistic mating strategy.""

It's hard work, no doubt, but unless you are in a super saturated area it is an in demand field currently and pays quite well. It's also a field that allows you to work while going to school and get your tuition paid for by the company. Basically, two years of schooling and you already make decent money and then can continue to get more certification which translates to higher pay.

As far as teachers go, quality of life/pay depends highly on the area. It's one of those jobs that can either be super rewarding with decent pay, or soul crushing with shit pay. Some states are horrid when it comes to teacher pay/benefits, while others are highly competitive and have teachers clamoring to find an open position. Part of the complexities when comparing teacher salary to other jobs is that teachers work 9 months out of the year, and the salary is based on that. 

Anyways, I think the poster was referring to specifically social norms about certain jobs being ""female"" only positions. Teaching has been fairly diverse for awhile now, while nursing is still predominately female. In the 90s male nurses were made fun of more often, but nowadays I really haven't encountered that anymore. Male nurses are in high demand.",horseband,t2_qhfj0,7,0,reddit2

""God damned MRA's trying to take attention away from these women!""

It's true and awful that is the case in China and Bangladesh and the 5 other countries with a female bias toward suicide (it's 7). But they are clearly anomalies and so when talking in generalisations it makes sense to say men commit suicide more often than women unless you are Chinese or Bangladeshi or talking about it within that context.

But considering the people who love to throw out ""MRA"" as an insult are often radical feminists or simply trying to diminish men's problems, I think it's fair to say you were posting in bad faith to push an agenda, not objectively. 

Also worth nothing that none of the countries with a female bias toward suicide reach the global average difference biasing men.

""In the United States, males are four times more likely to die by suicide than females, although more women than men report suicide attempts and self-harm with suicidal intentions. Male suicide rates are higher than females in all age groups (the ratio varies from 3:1 to 10:1). In other western countries, males are also much more likely to die by suicide than females (usually by a factor of 3–4:1). It was the 8th leading cause of death for males, and 19th leading cause of death for females.""

There are 7 countries in the world without a gender disparity in suicide biasing toward males.

They are:

Antigua and Barbuda - Male - 0 - Female - 0.9

Myanmar - Male - 6.3 - Female - 9.8

Morocco - Male - 2.5 - Female - 3.6

Lesotho - Male - 22.7 - Female - 32.6

Bangladesh - Male - 5.5 - Female - 6.7

China - Male - 7.9 - Female -8.3

Pakistan - Male - 3.0 - Female - 3.1

None of these countries have a gender disparity of 1.75 or more which is the global average difference between men and women in suicide (3.74 in Europe and 3.29 in the Americas). So while it is definitely a problem in those countries, to derail a thread on the male suicide epidemic is dishonest, generally.

Fyi the top 7 countries with a bias toward men in suicide are all 6-7x higher in men than women. The disparity in many countries, regions, social and income groups and age can be huge, too. Reaching up to 10:1 in the US when you filter for age and class and so forth.",TheTyke,t2_tzn8z,1,0,reddit3

Essentially, if one has this specific mutation of this gene, the effect is differing opioid and analgesic tolerance levels. The gene also influences one’s genetic disposition for tolerance of physical and emotional/social pain. The body itself produces (endogenous) opioids, which bind to the mu receptor and make humans “feel good” in response to substrates such as pain medications, narcotics, alcohol, *and* social interactions or social bonding. This is what makes one person more likely to benefit from a “good laugh”—it is literally a natural high. Therefore, a person who has mutations of the OPRM1 gene may in fact have a higher tolerance for physical pain, but a lowered threshold for, namely, rejection in social situations. The emotional waves, which humans often colloquially reference, are truly similar to waves. Humans experience regular fluxes in binding of exogenous opioids substrates/agonists via narcotics and analgesics, but also endogenously, in response to social stimuli. The endogenous system is more integral to the human body, as it is easily thrown out of whack by external factors, but must realign naturally over a period of time during which one may experience unpleasant side effects of withdrawal.
A close relationship’s ending via ghosting, moving geographically, or other sudden and unexpected means of separation are powerful enough on the body to induce a “withdrawal” effect. One typically suffers a period of grief which may be prolonged or intensified in some individuals. The grieving may have physical manifestations similar to minor cases of opiate withdrawal in users of synthetic opioids of the narcotic breed. Perhaps this gene is responsible for addiction, depression, and overall self esteem. Bottom line: be kind, because biology can be the biggest \*brat*\ of all time.

Abstract: Despite the fact that suicide deaths are on the rise in the United States and that prior research has implicated workplace factors as contributors to suicide, there is a dearth of management research specific to work and suicide. This study posited and found support for a mediated relationship between workplace mistreatment (i.e., incivility, social undermining, and ostracism) and work engagement via suicidal ideation among at-risk employees: those with depression and/or bipolar disorder. Next, we identify which individuals might be especially vulnerable to the effect of mistreatment on suicidal ideation: individuals not seeking treatment for their mood disorder. Our findings indicate that low-grade workplace mistreatment can have serious implications for employees’ mental health and work-related outcomes. We conclude by discussing additional workplace factors that might contribute to suicidal ideation as well as identifying ways organizations can use the reported findings to aid in suicide prevention.",sciposts,t2_9nv2lp71,9,0,reddit4

I like to use the analogy of 2 dogs which are deeply depressed and stressed. One dog is sitting in a corner, crying and sad. The other dog is barking and seems vicious. People are far more likely to help the dog in the corner which isn't so wild.

I started as the dog in the corner, and I ended it at the barking dog. I kept barking louder and louder as I noticed no one cared to help me... 

My own family neglected me from the beginning, and things became much worse, with my families neglect seeming justified because of how I ended up. I was angry at them for not reaching out, and I even asked - begged - for their help. They still didn't care, and would talk amongst themselves about my issues, but would never address me personally to ask how I'm doing, and what help I need.

You can use a similar analogy but with people. Are you more likely to help a homeless person who is angry and upset about their situation while asking for help, or are you more likely to help a homeless person who is sitting down, crying, and asking for help? They are both just as stressed and depressed, it's just that they deal with their emotions differently...

If I received the help I needed early on, I wouldn't have gotten to the point of anger and rage. People suck, my family sucks, and in the end, I'm still here, but only because I somehow managed it all on my own. I'm still depressed, and I still have a lot to work through, but I'm doing better, and starting to understand that family doesn't matter as much as I thought they did.

The TL;DR of the Harvard study:
> So far we have isolated four factors which contribute to giving women students less access to discourse than men: their demographic status as members of a minority in the classroom; their inability or unwillingness to compete against men; their vulnerability to interruption; and the fact that men and women talk in runs, which tends to keep female participation low.

The study cited another study of classrooms at Yale, Brown, Wellesley, and Smith that showed 

>women at both of the mixed-sex institutions were verbally less assertive than men, in the sense that they were more likely to use hedges, qualifiers and questioning intonations. By contrast, women at Smith and Wellesley were not only more assertive than women at Yale and Brown, but also -- most surprisingly -- more assertive than men at the coeducational institutions.

I'm assuming that Smith and Wellesley are female-only colleges.

Anyway, the Harvard study was pretty good at not blaming men for the imbalance. Instead, it just uses the results to suggest how Harvard can improve given ""the tendency of women to underparticipate when the classroom setting is primarily male"".

Adding a competition element to that situation only messes up my enjoyment of the work. Suddenly we're not cooperating to make something awesome, we're opponents.

I live in Norway, and while our educational institutions aren't as effective as the Finnish model, we also value equality very highly which I do believe is paramount to achieving a high level of median educational value.

However, I would have wished for more competition when I was in school, especially in the earlier grades. This doesn't have to mean actuall competitions (like the spelling b's you see in American television and that I assume exist), but added incentive.

For people in less developed countries going to school is a way of escaping poverty. They really do have incentive, and they are used to having to work. Spoiled Scandinavian kids with extreme amounts of social and financial safety do not.

For some, especially girls, being told to do something is enough to make them do it. For others, like myself, doing something for no reason is pointless. The reasons provided by the teachers (get good grades for good jobs etc.) just doesn't mean anything to young kids who never has lacked for anything.

The US is somewhere in between but there is still huge emphasis on ""being number one"" and resources are spent on trying to create a few academic stars while neglecting the broad mass of kids and then further testing them constantly and teaching to the tests, not to learning.

It's not about paying them well, either. You can throw money at things, but it won't necessarily make them better. Finland is very picky about who goes into the educational sector as teachers. America really isn't. If you have a teaching certificate and a bachelors you can teach high schoolers in a lot of states. Supply is lacking and demand is incredibly high - and raising all teachers' salaries could very well mean the school has less money to hire more teachers. We have many bureaucratic layers in our educational system that make it difficult to see real change. There have been many cases in my home state where there would be upwards of a $2m grant ""to the schools"", but the teacher's wouldn't see a dime because the money would be allocating to hiring more administrative staff and the district office would get an overhaul, but the schools themselves only seeing a few dollars here and there for supplies. America has a substantially larger populace to deal with, and centralizing all the states' educational systems under the DOE is (imo) more a trainwreck than anything. Each state has its own teachers unions and that already weaves a tangled web.

Oh wait. Americans didn't do any of those things. We could go on forever.

The point is, the above comment stated the exact opposite of the truth - that one country in Europe has contributed nothing. Which is easily proven to be absolutely wrong. I don't know what the point is in discussing this further as you are not interested in the subject at all. 

Other countries are founded on the principle of teamwork, collaboration and considerations for the future. One of the biggest problems in the 20th century that have held us back is big industry stopping new inventions - you think the electric car is a new thing? Or renewable energy? The 'competition' that you think will bring us the future is just screwing things up. We could have been hundreds of years ahead if American (and other!) companies weren't stopping new developments.

I also work in IT, I'm the company's Web Services Administrator. We have two teams, of which individuals typically compete with the individuals on their team. Team A handles all the bug and issue requests, and whoever closes the most per month gets a small bonus. As a result, our Bug Team will typically jump on tickets as they come in - which also removes the need for someone to delegate tickets around. On Team B, they handle all the new projects going forward, and their reward structure is based a lot on projected deadlines and how quickly you can reach the projected milestones, and whoever has the best rate of completion on their set of milestones gets the reward.

I've been at places that track stupid stats like lines of code and ""new ideas"", and those strategies typically don't work, but when you employ one that is actually designed by someone who works the job - then you start to see an improvement in behaviour. ",monkeedude1212,t2_67gik,2,0,reddit1

- developers are encouraged to take shortcuts when resolving bugs and issues. This is a huge one because there are very often ways to do something faster now while knowingly introducing other problems that will eventually turn into more bugs. Or take shortcuts on code maintainability that will always eventually cost more time to the company overall. Many criteria of potential solutions are subjective and hard to qualify - time isn't. Those criteria are still important, but they start to get ignored if they impact time.

- developers are encouraged to deny help to each other - why waste your work time to help others close their tickets faster? or worse outright sabotage them by knowingly pointing them in wrong direction. Limits knowledge transfer and turns a team into a number of individuals.

>how was I supposed to know it wouldn't work without spending hours myself first to verify

If one dev is asked to help with another dev, they BOTH can get rewarded with the completion of it. 

So by answering someone's question, you can get another ""completed"" on your own stats. 

>Catching a dev for poorly implemented solutions

This is why the project teams and bug teams are separated, so that essentially any sloppy implementation of a new project isn't handled by the guy who did it in the first place, it acts as its own sort of code review if a bug comes in and another developer has to look at it. Then source control shows you who did what, and you can factor that into your evaluation. A half decent QA team helps too. 

> And now devs need to follow a manual on coding practices that has shit like ""how many words of comments you have to put per line of code""

Coding practices manuals are a good thing. And its never ""how many words per comment"" it literally just covers every other part like establishing a variable naming standard, proper structure/layout. It means that anyone can walk in and join the team without having to worry about their style of programming; all they have to do is follow the manual.

>Intentional selection of easy bugs

This ensures the easy bugs get ironed out as quickly as possible. The managers can be there to whip people into working on the harder more time critical ones. And if they aren't fixing those, it will reflect on their review. It's probably not the BEST implementation for it, since ideally you'd be prioritizing tickets based on criticality, but at least this system encourages devs to work on tickets at all - as opposed to other systems where they would much rather wait around and browse reddit until they specifically get told to do something.",monkeedude1212,t2_67gik,1,0,reddit1

dw9ajek,t3_870rp1,2018-03-25 13:49:35,science,"> Using an experimental experience sampling design, we investigate how witnessing morning rudeness influences workers’ subsequent perceptions and behaviors throughout the workday. We posit that a single exposure to rudeness in the morning can contaminate employees’ perceptions of subsequent social interactions leading them to perceive greater workplace rudeness throughout their workday. We expect that these contaminated perceptions will have important ramifications for employees’ work behaviors. In a 10-day study of 81 professional and managerial employees, we find that witnessed morning rudeness leads to greater perceptions of workplace rudeness throughout the workday and that those perceptions, in turn, predict lower task performance and goal progress and greater interaction avoidance and psychological withdrawal. We also find that the contaminating effect of morning rudeness depends on core self-evaluations (CSE)—employees high (vs. low) in CSE are affected less by exposure to morning rudeness. We discuss implications for practice and theory. ",dioramapanorama,t2_pz8ii,27,0,reddit2

Being mentally strong can take a lot of energy! Ever been around someone who complains non stop? You know how at first you'll try to point out the positives and how they'll argue your points? And then you just get exhausted trying to help them see the positives? I've been around someone like that for three years. It took me this long to figure out why I'm emotionally drained. I noticed myself getting really cynical and negative like him and I don't like that! I can't change him but I can change me.

dwatrbu,t1_dwa6fz8,2018-03-26 09:27:54,science,"This is the key, really. It's about control, and what is under ourcontrol, and what is not. Our reactions and perception are under our control. It is surprising how many people would deny this. 

There is also the counter-argument that eventually, any resistance breaks down, to which I ask ""is that not an opportunity to grow stronger?"" The world cannot affect us if we do not allow it to, and that requires us to have complete control over our perspective and reactions to whatever it throws at us. We must use those negative encounters to hone  control over ourselves, and how we cope with it rather than trying to control the encounter and lash back at it. Note that this is NOT pacifism, but instead, it is choosing where to invest the limited resources we do have in a way that is beneficial to ourselves. As an added side-effect, it may be beneficial to those around us, as well. 

That said, it is not easy. I can understand why most would rather just break down or fight fire with fire when faced with negativity, but having been that person (and still, in many ways, learning to NOT to be that person), the results of efforts to resist are far, far more desirable. Resistance and self-control will lend to a much better quality of life versus allowing other people's shit to rain on our parade. ",piggybankcowboy,t2_4j6dm,1,0,reddit2

I always make it a point to say thank you  to people working customer facing jobs. I can't count the number of times someone took their shit out on me or a coworker because they knew no one would stop them. 

The most frustrating thing is that it was rarely about the actual food or anything we had control over. Trust me, I too am sorry little Johnny got kicked off the bus, because I probably wouldn't be getting bitched at and threatened to have corporate called on me because I ""made Johnny late for school"" when you didn't even order until 10 minutes after school started. The people who do this are completely oblivious to how it is affecting other customers because they never want to leave the front of the line so other people can order, or return to interrupt their orders. It just turns into a long line of people bitching at you.

Having someone say thank you to me when I was on front cash or drive thru always took away some of the irritation/stress from bad customers. I always hated working early am because those were the most miserable customers. It is just that much harder to get through a shift with constant negativity for first 2 hours, especially since our breaks were scheduled closer to lunch.

 Mental resistance is great, but sometimes you just need 5 minutes off the floor to hang on to what's left of it/regenerate it.

Together, these findings suggest that emotional responses drive the effects rather than social learning.""

That's a pretty nice summary, as it addresses the two obvious explanations and indicates which one the evidence best seems to support.

Less briefly, the two explanations are that hearing of an injury to a co-worker makes officers:  

 * (1) Become more fearful for their own safety and more likely use force to ensure it.  
 * (2) Become less empathetic with suspects and more likely to use force in general.

Since (a) there is no reduction in injury risk, and (b) the effect is very short-term, the authors conclude (2) is the more likely explanation, which seems like solid reasoning.

***

How can this finding be made actionable and used to improve outcomes?

It looks like there is increased risk to the public after an officer is injured while on duty; perhaps other officers in the social network of that officer should have support services and/or modified duty for a short time afterward?  That may allow emotion from the injury to fade or be resolved with reduced risk of it impacting the public.

Obviously, officers should not be using excessive force on the public *at all*, and excessive police use of force is a *massive* problem in the USA, but just saying ""don't do the bad thing"" is rarely effective as a strategy; the goal is to protect the public, so a more focused approach is likely to do so more effectively.

But ultimately this is a kind of survival instinct here. If I interact with dogs but at one point one bites me I'm going to be more cautious and biased with future interactions for a period of time. If no other dog bites me then ima slowly become more comfortable again.

I I hear of a neighbor getting bit by a dog living at a certain house, I'm going to become more nervous and even avoid such house. At the very least more defensive.

While cops are held to a higher standard they are at their core human and once again a 7% increase is not as much as I thought it would be.

They blocked off about 6 blocks around where the shooting took place. Every intersection had two cop cars at it and there were search lights from the helicopters everywhere. Cop cars were zooming everywhere in the area. 

It was later discovered the suspect who shot the store clerk was the same guy who ended up shooting the off-duty cop working security.

There was a wildly different response to the two incidents. If they had put as much effort into finding out who shot the store clerk as they did who shot the cop, they might have caught the guy before he shot one of their own.

Rejecting (1) because there is no actual reduction in risk is a pretty big reach.  People are terrible at assessing risk.  The fact that initiating force doesn't reduce risk of injury doesn't mean it's not done to reduce risk of injury. Emotional response could be a fear based one so I don't think your analysis of the abstract is correct. 

The abstract is saying that officers don't ""learn"" to be afraid/callous of the public.  Rather they are afraid/callous because of recent trauma.


>It looks like there is increased risk to the public after an officer is injured while on duty; perhaps other officers in the social network of that officer should have support services and/or modified duty for a short time afterward?  That may allow emotion from the injury to fade or be resolved with reduced risk of it impacting the public.

It would be interesting to look at large police departments (say NYPD) and look at these effects when an officer is injured in another city vs in city vs in Burrough vs in precinct.  This could help in form any such policy.  

If the effect of proximity is small then there is not much that can done in terms of scheduling. Now, I would assume proximity is important but it still seems tricky because you can't have a substantial portion of the PD take on ""desk duties"" everytime an officer is injured.  

>Obviously, officers should not be using excessive force on the public *at all*, and excessive police use of force is a *massive* problem in the USA, but just saying ""don't do the bad thing"" is rarely effective as a strategy; the goal is to protect the public, so a more focused approach is likely to do so more effectively.

Like many of the problems with US policing I believe this could be solved with more education and training, but only if the officers being trained buy in. We could give every LEO a seminar on being aware of their emotions after an officer injury but that won't do a damn thing if the LEOs aren't invested.

The fact that initiating force doesn't reduce risk of injury doesn't mean it's not done to reduce risk of injury.

Both of your points have merit.

I wouldn't say favoring (2) over (1) is a *big* reach, but I do agree with you that an alternative plausible explanation is the increased use of force is *intended* to increase their safety but fails to do so (or mostly fails) and they lose that increased concern for their safety after a week.  I agree with the authors, though, that (2) seems to fit the observations better, in part because I give them the benefit of the doubt that there is more detail in the body of the paper.

When was the last time a seminar changed *anyone's* behavior?  :/

Greater awareness of the impact of co-worker injuries on decision-making *might* help by making some people more aware of the risk of behavior change and/or the need for counseling or support, but I suspect you're right that a training-based solution would need to be part of a more comprehensive overhaul of the focus of training away from ""fear the public"" to ""work with the public"".

I think you're misunderstanding; perhaps I didn't write clearly.

As I said, yes, obviously police should not be overusing force, and should be held to account when they do.  No disagreement there.  However, the findings of this research indicate that there is a short period of increased risk after a co-worker injury, so focused strategies could potentially be more effective at mitigating *that increased risk* in particular.

I brainstormed about some potential focused mitigation strategies in the previous paragraph; however, those strategies *supplement* the need for comprehensive reform of the common attitude of US police towards (a) use-of-force, and (b) their relationship with the public, they in no way *replace* that need.

Building upon recent work on other major fossil fuel companies, we report new archival research and primary source interviews describing how Total responded to evolving climate science and policy in the last 50 years. We show that Total personnel received warnings of the potential for catastrophic global warming from its products by 1971, became more fully informed of the issue in the 1980s, began promoting doubt regarding the scientific basis for global warming by the late 1980s, and ultimately settled on a position in the late 1990s of publicly accepting climate science while promoting policy delay or policies peripheral to fossil fuel control. Additionally, we find that Exxon, through the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), coordinated an international campaign to dispute climate science and weaken international climate policy, beginning in the 1980s. This represents one of the first longitudinal studies of a major fossil fuel company’s responses to global warming to the present, describing historical stages of awareness, preparation, denial, and delay.

hhrtop4,t3_qebgjb,2021-10-23 19:17:30,science,"French oil giant Total knew that its fossil fuel extraction could contribute to global warming as early as 1971 but stayed silent about it until 1988, according to a new study. 

Research published today in the journal Global Environmental Change, based on internal company documents and interviews with former staff, found that personnel “received warnings of the potential for catastrophic global warming from its products by 1971”. 

Total – which this year rebranded as TotalEnergies – “became more fully informed” about climate change in the 1980s and “began promoting doubt regarding the scientific basis for global warming by the late 1980s”. The company publicly accepted climate science in the 1990s but promoted “policy delay or policies peripheral to fossil fuel control”, the authors found.

The research – which has sparked the hashtag #Totalknew on social media – follows similar revelations about ExxonMobil and Shell in recent years which exposed how companies were aware of the impact of their emissions on the climate as early as the 1980s. 

Today’s study also finds that ExxonMobil “coordinated an international campaign to dispute climate science and weaken international climate policy, beginning in the 1980s” through the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA). 

“These revelations provide proof that TotalEnergies and the other oil and gas majors have stolen the precious time of a generation to stem the climate crisis”, climate justice campaign groups 350.org and Notre Affaire à Tous said in a joint statement.

They added: “The dire consequences of climate change we are now experiencing could have been avoided if Total executives fifty years ago had decided that the future of the planet is more important than their profits.”

hhsfbfz,t3_qebgjb,2021-10-23 22:00:47,science,"I find this sort of headline tiresome, for three reasons--

1. Because I have been told something doesn't mean I ""knew"" it.  I have been told many, contradictory things on many topics.  Should I be held accountable for ""knowing"" everything I have been told--all  of which cannot be true as some are contradictory? We see this all the time when a report says a President should have acted because he ""knew"" of a threat that was mentioned in an intelligence briefing. Of course often times these assessments change or are contradicted by other assessments, and often times they are not ""high-confidence"" assessments.  Same goes for academic research: for any position one might take, there is usually some research supporting it. 
2. Were oil companies the only ones privy to research on effects of carbon emissions?  Of course not.  So they have no insights that are unavailable to everyone else. 
3. Which raises the question: whose job it is to take action to reduce a ""known"" (i.e., widely believed) threat of this type?  A corporation's job is to turn resources into products demanded by consumers as efficiently as possible, while observing the limitations set by society via government. To remain competitive a corporation has to maximize profit within the regulatory framework. It is society's job to determine that a thing is harmful and to make a rule to prohibit it, tax it otherwise discourage it.  

I don't think this sort of article belongs in /Science--it not about science. 

Also, for the record, I have no doubt that the Earth's climate is changing, and it seems very likely that the rate of change has increased, in some part due to human activity, from burning fossil fuels to increased consumption of beef.",MannieOKelly,t2_fatd6,-12,0,reddit4

hhujdln,t3_qebgjb,2021-10-24 10:48:30,science,"So, there was, in fact, a massive conspiracy to coverup this information. See, this is why I'm not willing to automatically discount something simply because it is labeled a ""conspiracy theory"". I've seen too many conspiracies proven true in my lifetime. (The coverup of the dangers of smoking is another good example.) History has clearly shown that, if there is money or power to be gained, huge numbers of people will conspire with each other to get that money or power. 

How many employees of this company knew about the climate change findings, thousands? People always ask ""Why didn't any of them speak up?"". Some probably did but they lost their jobs and we disregarded because they were labeled ""conspiracy nuts"".  Other employees saw this happen to their colleague and chose to remain silent. Most of the participants in large conspiracies are guilty of only conspiracies of silence. 

Our willingness to dismiss anything labeled a ""conspiracy theory"" is a big reason conspiracy, like this one, are allowed to happen. I understand this reflex to discount such theories. Many of them are completely insane, but not all of them. If the means, motive and opportunity for a conspiracy do exist, it are worth an open mind and  further investigation, regardless of the socially stigmatized label of ""conspiracy wacko"", The costs of automatically discounting the idea of any conspiracy is too high.

In the United Kingdom, coal extraction peaked in 1913 (repeat : nineteen-thirteen). In France, that was 1960.

Romania once was the world's top producer of petroleum, until the 1890s. The oil and gas fields in the North Sea peaked in the 2000s. See also : Lacq, Groeningen.

Anyway, Europe never had significant deposits of petroleum, and this played an important role in the march toward the First World War (see : *Bagdadbahn*), hence WW2, hence Cold War.

Worldwide, the number of discoveries of new oil fields peaked in 1963, and this certainly is not for lack of searching.  See : *proven reserves.

That being said, yes, as of 2018, two-third of the energy used *within* the Union was fossil, even before starting to account for [grey](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5687) energy. It follow that yes, yes and yes, a number of things that even young people take for granted are going to change dramatically.

Capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide is indeed obligatory, be it end-of-pipe for the few burners that we won't be able to eliminate, or atmospheric for diffuse emissions like the ones from agriculture. The whole thing, though, is a bit more complicated than *""just capture""*, as we can see by counting the number of plants doing that now, which is exactly zero, and the number of plants with  actionable plans to do that, which is also zero.

Of course, laws can be changed. For that, we European citizens ""just"" need to elect MEPs wanting to establish policies in which mitigating climate change isn't a priority. We have, of course, a damnig track record of just this. It would take, however, an astounding amount of cognitive dissonance to renegate on the commitments that we've been taking in the last ten years.

Cooperative work environment gives me access to tools and resources I might not be able to get otherwise. I also get personal access to people working in the same field. Not being to do that has been a massive handicap. It feels the people with families are the ones promoting WFH to be the norm because they want to stay home. I understand their need but, to me, it’s clear that not being able to take advantage of in person collaboration has degraded the quality of work and has the potential to change the direction of not only how we work but also what we work on. Unnecessary escalations, missed opportunities, major screws-up, no accountability that we see, is the sign that direction is not the way we should be moving forward.

Work has a lot of facets. Posts and studies like this are toxic as they promote only one facet of work while debilitating others. It’s same as what breast cancer promotion did to availability of resources for other type of cancers.

- It's given me the space to learn new skills at my own pace.

There was zero understanding about the 1,000 different interruptions that someone in a front desk position faces vs someone in a lockable private office. I was lucky to be able to dedicate 20-30 minutes on a single task before being pulled somewhere else. 

Once we went remote, phone calls and, obviously, in-person interruptions were minimal; it forced the organization as a whole to be more streamlined, organized and ""modern"" (they LOVED everything on paper pre-pandemic), and it seemed like people's time was more valued because everything had to be scheduled out.

I’m not against WFH or remote work but I remember the same claims being made about offshoring IT and CS in the early 2000s.  

But then many of those jobs came back to the US because companies were realizing that you can’t just look at how much you’re paying someone vs some meaningless metric.  

Like, if you’ve outsourced software engineering and your metric is price per line of code, not only is that an easy metric to manipulate, but it tells you nothing about the quality.  

Nor does it take into account that an American programmer might feel more comfortable raising issues and suggesting alternative ways of accomplishing things more efficiently, whereas many companies found out (the hard way) that many overseas firms would just execute whatever they were asked to do.   

It’s that case, those cost per line or code metric would be irrelevant if it resulted in a worse produce, lower sales, and higher maintenance costs.  

But you won’t know that in 12 or 24 months.  

It may take years for these kinds of issues to rise up to the C-level.  

There will be some jobs that are perfect for WFH and there will be other jobs where companies begin bringing them back into the office due to the fact that WFH was producing inferior results.

Been working for one of the largest defense contractors for 20+  years. Remote-work had caused a severe lack of leadership, & morale is at an all-time low. The F lead on my program is almost entirely remote (even for huge milestone events).  She bails on her own meetings when her kids come home from school. Some of the women in the office have concerns that her behavior puts women leaders in a negative light. 

I don't see any reason why a graphic artist or an illustrator should have to go to an office and I'm sure there are other jobs that don't require a commute, but this is not one of those positions. The lack of leadership reduces the urgency with which her team approaches their tasks.

 Essentially there's a small group of us doing everything,  including meeting her responsibilities. She collected the titles & now is literally calling it in.

New hires are neglected. Too many times a new hire is asked to support some event & is left standing there with his pants down around his ankles while the customer asks questions they can't answer. Even during ""core"" hoyrs we can't get any of the leads or the manager on the phone. New hires figure-out quickly to get their Master's Degree for free then leave.  

I wish I had the balls to move on but I don't want to be the new kid  trying to prove myself in some new environment. I forced myself out of the comfort zone a few times, moving internally with success but those were lateral moves the game experience in areas I was interested in. 

I'm rarely challenged by co workers as the unofficial lead, but it's still hard to watch people get promoted that don't do anything. It seems everything that should be important isn't,  & everything that shouldn't be important - is...

Many people also think it’s comfortable and cheaper to work from home, so you don’t want to put unnecessary obstacles in place for that. 

There are two problems with working from home though, that I have seen as a (very) low level manager. 

1. New employees have a hard time learning a difficult job when not being around their colleagues. We had a few people that started working with us a couple of months before WFH became standard, and it took a long time for them to learn their jobs. We recruited people with fairly high qualifications but the job can’t be learned at any other place. The became a productivity problem. 

2. We had some turnover in staff. Because of that we needed to merge two teams into one. That was very difficult and caused a lot of conflicts about how the work should be done and what to expect from your colleagues. It wasn’t until we were able to gather most of the team in the same room and get them drunk (and some time before that explain to one person that it was time to look for another job) that we managed to merge together and work as a team. We have a policy that you need to work more from the office than from home over a period of a year, and have worked hard to have social activities (almost always without alcohol) and that has made a really positive impact on productivity and satisfaction. Seeing each other, talking about other things than work, is very important in team building and just doesn’t work very well when working from home.",Loive,t2_289au8wm,1,0,reddit1

There's a bit more to the story, but these are the essentials.  It's causing a real morale problem for the people who are taking up the slack.   I'm afraid we're going to lose clients because of this -- and I could lose MY job as a result.  We have a union. They don't care.

I do not want to lose clients.  For that reason, for my own clients, I do the job that several other people were hired to do.  It's the best I can do with this.",,,1,0,reddit1

Wasting time working from home = dishes, laundry, vacuum, shower, etc. (not all on one day or in a row) and happening me manage my sanity and work/life workload 

Wasting time at work in the office = chatting work coworkers, building relationships with people I work with, either closely work with or tangentially

Honestly, both have value in my life. I miss the coworker banter and fun and think WFH probably hurts my work relationships BUT being able to toss in a load of laundry or put dinner in the over early has MASSIVELY helped reduce my work/life balance stress.

Not only has his productivity improved, he has a **much** more balanced home/work lifestyle.

But in office, if the lady to my left talks about her kids, you've lost half the rooms focus for the next 40 minutes as the conversation hops between desks.

Work from home... I can't tell you names of a single baby born in the last 2 years... I'll get like 3 calls a month where the question devolves into chatting a bit... 

So you've lost the 2 minutes it takes for me to throw my lunch in the oven, and move the laundry into the dryer, but gained several hours a day of not-distracted or interrupted time.


And that doesn't include the extra time I'm available to get more work done by virtue of not being stuck in traffic 2+ hours a day.

You need me to work a 16 hour shift... In my underpants with my dog at my feet, and my wife home to grab me a snack or something as the night drags on. I won't be happy, but it'll happen.

You need me to work a 16 hour shift, in presentable attire, in an ice cold or balmy office, with interrogation worthy lighting, an uncomfortable chair, a desk that's too low, the cheapest 17"" monitors money could buy, and I've got to drive an hour in and out, and go buy lunch because the fridge is too full to pack my own...

It's harder to be super familiar with the product being remote.

1. lack of binding to the company. Companies become faceless entities you have no bonding with if you get hired during home office. For some this might not even be too obvious if they get bonding with their team (which is still difficult but less so than with ""everyone else"" or the company) but once you set up teams differently nobody knows each other.
2. Absolutely no oversight whatsoever. Most business / economics psychologists agree that trusting people is the better options but it’s hard to let go of the thought that out there might be someone making 150k for doing nothing (and we know those people exist and some like to brag on Reddit or worse whole teams getting detached due to a lack of bonding.

The ability to gauge your work compared to your coworkers/discuss freely (without potential tracking software in-between) are pretty much non-existent, so instead of competing with coworkers of different skill/background and learning expectations somewhat through office-diffusion, you compete with yourself and have a higher accountability. 

It has some major benefits, though: The 1-2 hours I would have been commuting are just accounted for with additional productive hours that I’m not in traffic. I get to sleep in later, have no dress code, can take breaks when I need them, and control the environment completely.

This isn’t my only experience dealing with remote workers.  I often have to communicate with HR, who work flex schedules.  When they are in the office, I get answers.  When they work remote, I get an email dump from them 2 days afterwards where they responds to everything.

I’m not denying that remote may work for some industries.  But in my experience, when answers are needed immediately, remote work is less effective.",SoapSudsAss,t2_2g43qzgh,1,0,reddit1

WFH now, less of the non work stuff above but more on gaming / cooking lunch & dinner / cleaning the house that take hours.

Difference before the WFH is that, everything i do while in office feels justified, that all those non-productive stuff is for me to perform / focus better at work, when the same can also be said when i game / cook while working from home.

i7oooqg,t1_i7omvge,2022-05-07 15:15:11,science,"You're not wrong, but my point is the nature of WFH prevents an effective solution.  

I don't see an effective way to on-board a care person (at least for us) in an isolated environment.  The nature of the work is complex enough that they need a LOT of training, and they need to be comfortable asking questions, because there's a lot of nuance that  affects how they should handle a situation, and there's not an effective way to write all that down.

In talking with the care managers, that's a lot of what's been missing.   New employees don't have the in-person interaction necessary to build the relationships- both with their trainers and especially with their peers - that makes them comfortable regularly admitting they don't know something yet.

I get that.   I remember starting a job, and not really wanting to go back to my boss and say ' I know you showed me this yesterday, but I cant remember hiw. Show me again.' because I didn't want to look dumb.   It was very beneficial that I had a peer I felt comfortable with that I could quietly ask.

And that's where our care people are stuck. They don't want to ask the boss what they think is another dumb question, but they don't have any real relationship with their peers to feel comfortable asking them, so they try to do it on their own.

Work from home often means:

- employee absorbs real estate costs
- employee absorbs some IT costs
- employee absorbs equipment costs (*buy your own overhead lighting*)
- employee absorbs furniture costs (*no more $1000 cubicles and $600 chairs*)
- employee absorbs HVAC costs (*cool your own damn office*)
- employee assumes health and safety risk (*is it even possible to ever have a workplace incident again?)*
- employee absorbs break room / kitchen space and equipment costs
- employee absorbs telephony and Internet costs

- potential employee pool expands at least to the entire state, if not country, if not time zone, if not planet (with requisite potential in reduction of salary costs)
- potential reduction in middle management (hey, it turns out if you manage people by objective you don't need a 1:3 headcount to shoulder surf and make sure they're not taking 16 minutes during their 15 minute break)
- no more employees complaining it's too hot or cold, you can literally have *individualized* temperature zones and spend *less* money!

All for an increase in.... zoom subscriptions? And maybe you need to hold quarterly or annual team and company gatherings.

This is a gross oversimplification obviously. But seriously, SO much saved in capital and operating costs, with potential salary reductions and increased quality of employees.

And all you have to do is learn to hire better managers that can effectively communicate and manage by objective.

What does it matter if they’re cruising on autopilot if their work gets done? Not everyone is trying to grow beyond where they are at. There’s nothing wrong with that and we need those kinds of people just as much as people like you and I who aggressively want to move up

Also, at this point people have worked from home for 2 years and overall productivity across the economy is up, how do you explain that? How about the fact that productivity fell this quarter when people were forced back into the offices?

Because people were already working from home, employers demanding them to return to the offices is a benefits cut. That should come with a hefty pay raise. Employers need to justify why they’re taking benefits away from people, and make up for that benefit rather than expect workers to bite the bullet for absolutely no reason, especially during historic inflation 

Finally, six figures (100k) is not the high water mark it was in the 1990s. This is basically the entry point of the middle class lifestyle now. And no, I’m not looking “up” at 100k. This is the perspective of someone who earns substantially more than that 

Reminder: middle class doesn’t mean middle 50% of incomes, if it did concepts like a growing and shrinking middle class would be mathematically impossible. Middle class means the ability to own your primary residence, a car for each adult driver, the ability to comfortably support a family of at least 4, the ability to take family vacations, the ability to send your children to college, and the ability to comfortably retire without financial insecurity once you reach retirement age (67 for us).",zenon_kar,t2_9fi18rm0,3,0,reddit1

Occasionally these factors are going to mean putting in extra hours to avoid being steamrolled by the pile of work, other times it means I’ll be having a relaxed day that starts a little late and ends early with time spent getting ahead. 

I don’t get overtime pay, either (salaried), but I do receive compensation roughly equivalent to my previous position’s salary (which involved both an office requirement and travel) plus double time when working overtime (using previous positions 40 hour week equivalent hourly rate) and a better bonus structure at my current company. I consider that above-board, considering the balance of positives-negatives discussed above. Accounting for unpaid overtime at the previous position and commute time, I’m spending about the same amount of total hours working, plus the lack of travel means a tank of gas lasts 4x longer and I’m putting 10,000 miles less on my car per year.

Office space uses false walls, floors, and ceilings.  The walls are designed to be movable and the floors are just panels with open space beneath.  Apartments need real walls, real floors, and real ceilings.

Then there are things like fire suppression and evacuation routes which could need to change.

As long as the algorithm took it seriously and backed right off in times of stress and duress, then gradually tapered up to find an optimal point, it could dynamically react to stress levels across a person's life and provide an optimal balance for their profit.

Maybe that might be a good use of metrics. But no, it's keystrokes and 'busy-ness'. Lame.",havenyahon,t2_9x34ntuq,1,0,reddit1

It’s hard to displace low-skill natives, because low-skill occupations depend heavily on references rather than credentials.  Natives don’t hire a stranger with no one to vouch for them, they hire other natives who are part of their network. 

As a consequence, immigrants end up taking on work that natives weren’t doing.  They then spend their money on local goods and services provided largely by natives.  The effect of immigration is almost always a net economic positive—though sometimes only marginally. 

The one group that *does* get displaced really by immigrants are the highly educated.  Natives in professions that depend on credentialed educations are more vulnerable to immigrants undercutting them: nurses, doctors, engineers, lawyers, etc.",Troh-ahuay,t2_12al7q,14,0,reddit2

Here’s a good way to think about it: If you have a town of 1000 people and 700 jobs meet the demand for all (assuming we have 200 kids and 100 retirees) and you add 200 new people, now you need 840 jobs to provide the same amount of “stuff” to the town.

More workers equals more jobs to fill instead of resulting in fighting over the same jobs.

The big scam of conservative ideology is that it assumes that society is a zero-sum game. If one person benefits, that had to be a benefit taken FROM someone else. But that isn't how reality works. If a new worker gets a job (regardless their origin), they need to consume. They need buy food, buy/rent shelter, spend on entertainment, etc. But all that new demand means... there needs to be more activity in food production, in housing development, in the entertainment industry, etc. That new demands means a need for *more* jobs.

This is often called the ""virtuous cycle"" in a number of different contexts, not just immigration but also things like government spending. If the government spends tax money in a way that kick starts growth that leads to an increase in the economy that exceeds what they took in in taxes, then taxes have actually CREATED wealth and prosperity for people.

jlqrsil,t1_jlqr89d,2023-05-26 20:38:29,science,"From the Trillion dollar bills paper:

>	The gains from eliminating migration barriers dwarf—by an order of a magnitude or  two—the  gains  from  eliminating  other  types  of  barriers. **For the elimination of trade  policy  barriers  and  capital  flow  barriers,  the  estimated  gains  amount  to  less  than a  few percent of world GDP. For labor mobility barriers, the estimated gains are often  in  the  range  of  50–150  percent  of  world  GDP.**

>A conservative reading of the evidence in Table 2, which provides an overview of effi ciency  gains  from  partial  elimination  of  barriers  to  labor  mobility,  suggests  that effi ciency gains from partial elimination of barriers to labor mobility, suggests that the  emigration  of  less  than  5  percent  of  the  population  of  poor  regions  would  bring global  gains  exceeding  the  gains  from  total  elimination  of  all  policy  barriers  to global gains exceeding the gains from total elimination of all policy barriers to merchandise  trade  and  all  barriers  to  capital  flows. For comparison, currently about 200  million  people—3 percent of the world—live outside their countries of birth (United  Nations,  2009). 

#On brain drain:

>	African countries experiencing the largest outfl ows of doctors and nurses should  have had systematically  worse  health  conditions  than  other  parts  of  Africa. In fact, those  countries  have  systematically  better  health  conditions  (Clemens,  2007).  More broadly,  if the external effects of schooling were major and straightforward determinants  of economic development, the vast increases in schooling levels across the world since 1960 would have been accompanied by a substantial rise in total factor productivity. As Pritchett (2001) points out, nothing like that happened in poor countries. These facts do not negate the existence of human capital externalities. But they do suggest that externalities from national stocks of human capital per se—all else equal—might  be  small  enough  for  their  effects  to  be  swamped  by  other  forces.

#Effects on the destination country:

>	First, the literature contains no documented case of large declines  in  GDP   or massive declines in public-service provision at the destination caused  by  immigration.  Second, century-old issues of the  American  Economic  Review extensively discuss concerns that any further emigration  might  degrade  the  American  economy  and  society   (for example, Hall, 1913;  Kohler,  1914).  Since then the American population has quadrupled—wit much of the rise coming from increasingly diverse immigration to already settled areas—and the United States remains the world’s leading economy, with much greater  availability  of  publicly-funded  amenities  than  a  century  ago.   Third, there are  also  many  plausible  positive  externalities  from  increased  immigration. These include  spatial  aggregation  economies  in  high-skill  labor (for example, Glaeser and  Maré,  2001)   and the effects of low-skill labor availability on the productivity of high-skill  labor,  particularly  women’s  labor  (for example, Kremer and Watt, 2009; Cortes  and  Tessada,  forthcoming).  Fourth, all serious economic studies of the aggregate  fi scal  effects  of  immigration  have  found  them  to  be  very  small overall— small  and  positive  at  the  federal  level  (Auerbach and Oreopoulos, 1999; Lee and Miller,  2000),  small  and  negative  at  the  state  and  local  level  (Congressional  Budget Office,  2007). 

#Lump of labor fallacy:

>	In historical cases of large reductions in barriers to labor mobility between high-income and low-income populations or regions, those  with  high  wages  have  not  experienced  a  large  decline.  **For example, wages of  whites  in  South  Africa  have not shown important declines since the end of the apartheid  regime  (Leibbrandt  and  Levinsohn,  2011),  despite  the  total  removal  of very  large  barriers  to  the  physical  movement  and  occupational  choice  of  a  poor population  that  outnumbered  the  rich  population  six  to  one.** The recent advent of  unlimited  labor  mobility  between  some  Eastern  European  countries  and  Great Britain,  though  accompanied  by  large  and  sudden  migration  flows,  has  not  caused important  declines  in  British  wages  (Blanchfl ower  and  Shadforth,  2009).

>	Conversely, does the departure of emigrants raise the wages of non-emigrants in  the  origin  country?   Mishra (2007) fi nds that the vast emigration of Mexicans to the  United  States  between  1970  and  2000  may  have  caused  an  8  percent  increase in  Mexicans’  nominal  wages  in  Mexico.  Economic  historians  have  evidence   that comparable  increases  in  home  wages  were  caused  by  mass  emigration  from  Sweden  (Karlström,  1985)  and  Ireland  (Hatton  and  Williamson,  1993;  O’Rourke,  1995).",neolthrowaway,t2_bctxl4cd,2,0,reddit2

This doesn't apply to Germany. The idea of references you can call and vouch for you essentially doesn't exist here. What happens at most is a friend telling his boss to hire you and that gives you a heads up.

Germany is super credential heavy. Even for working as a hairdresser you need a 3 year vocational education before.

jltmeai,t1_jlsaxet,2023-05-27 13:52:18,science,"If what you are saying is true it is more of a confirmation of what I suspect. Any job, theoretically, can be filled by natives. If natives are unwilling to work those jobs because (crudely put) the rewards are unacceptable to them for that work, then cheaper labour must fill them. Therefore, immigrants willing to work those otherwise unfilled jobs for the going rate reduce the number of acceptably waged jobs or a similar low skill nature and reduce the bargaining power of the native workers with other employers. 

The way I have always viewed this is not as an economic problem but as a political economic one. It is true that you need cheap labour (immigrants) to fill certain agricultural roles because they are unable to raise wages to a standard which native should accept the job. I also believe that immigrants shouldn't have to justify where they live as they shouldn't have been disadvantaged by their birthplace. However, I also think that they shouldn't be exploited as cheap labour and should be paid whatever a native would be willing to do the same job for.

This is extreme and is a real fringe case. But it is an example of that can happen when insular communities form with different values.

I'm bloody sick of racists looking for an excuse to complain, but if anything, I'm even more sick of people who strawman legitimate concerns that do need to be addressed. Because the vast majority of people who have opinions on immigration (over here) are not racist.

Whenever these concerns are raised, people are accused being ignorant racists who hate people who are different. The government will only say positive things. So the concerned person is in a weird situation where they're shouted down for asking, and get a non-answer from government.

In those situations, you can see how refreshing a 'normal' conversation on tbe matter is, and you get completely reasonable people joining unreasonable groups like UKIP because everyone else seems to be acting weird by comparison.

I think taking off the rose-tinted glasses would genuinely help. Because immigration is a generally positive, if not vital, thing over here. But the unwillingness to be at all pragmatic on the topic has led to disproportionate backlash by people who feel like they're being lied to and insulted.

Also to remember is that immigrants are about 20-25% of the population, so the fact that 59% of the convictions are against immigrants mean that they are overrepresented in the statistics without a doubt.

There's also an entire study, but this article summarizes it well. 

It's also not a question of racism within the police or the courts, on the contrary both of them often seem to be involved with political activism where they actively hide the ethnicity of suspects and perpetrators to make immigration seem like a better thing for our country than it is. 

Not that long ago one immigrant got awarded $85 000 after he raped a young girl because he was ""unlawfully imprisoned"" because he managed to produce some almost certainly fake papers stating that he was underage after there being evidence in social media of him telling people that he absolutely was 20-25-something while his papers said that he was 16 or something. 
He got time served and awarded $85 000 while the girl who was raped got basically nothing but to see her rapist get a lot of money for raping her and then sitting in Swedish jail in a country that has close to the most humane prison system in the world, a far cry from the US at least. 
Also this was despite there being no doubt that he raped the girl, that was basically proven beyond doubt. 

I'm not right-wing, racist, or conservative in any way, but I feel like many people are just doing wishful thinking and don't want to hear the truth because they just so want to be anti-racism that they forget that many cultures have values that are VERY far from western ideals with blatant sexism, misogyny, anti-LGBTQ+ and religion as their main driving force in life.

So the way the process works (I have relatives that did this) is: the person crosses into the US either through a port of entry or not (going through a port of entry, usually an airport, they need a valid visa). 

Once in the US the person applies for asylum. In this group there is everything from totally made up cases to true refugees fleeing for their life. Shortly after applying for refugee status the person gets a work permit and SS number allowing them to work legally. They also enter into a queue for being interviewed by USCIS with regard to their asylum case. 

The queue for the USCIS interview is very long. However, if the person wants to be interviewed they can request to be interviewed and this happens shortly (months to a year). A lot of the people with made up cases don't want to be interviewed so they don't request the interview. 

After the interview you are either allowed to stay and become a citizen or are deported. 

If your case hasn't been heard then you can't leave the US and come back. People that are basically perpetually in the queue can't leave the country. 

So:

>They’re saying they are refugees when they are just coming here to work.

Sure, but the people with made up asylum cases can't leave so they can't go to the US and go back to their home country and then return to the US. 

>That makes it harder for actual refugees to claim asylum in America.

No. Because you can request to jump the line there isn't really a downside (to the more solid refuge cases) to having a bunch of people waiting in a line that they don't actually want to get to the end of. The less solid asylum cases don't create a problem for the more solid ones.",PuffyPanda200,t2_kjg4n,81,0,reddit2

To the point. Demand they create and supply they create are not in the same place and on the same scale.

**Example**

What is meant can be imagined on an example of a small village of 10 people each doing their single job. One is farmer feeding the whole village, another is cobbler, another is smith etc. So all 10 are busy with their own task, some are more wealthy some are more poor, but overall equilibrium exists.

Now a new guy arrives and he turns out to be smith as well.

What happens? 9 out of 10 in the village will increase their output by 10%. Demand for their services went up, but due to the effect of scale it is not so much difference to feed 10 or 11, or to make shoes for 11 vs 10. However for the smith the world has just collapsed, because competition on a smith marked **instantly doubled**. Prices are crashing. New guy is willing to take on any job since it's better then surviving in the forest, but the life of a smith became much harder, especially if they had kids.

Overall economy is fine, more than fine actually, but the strain on society is now much higher because before that there were no poor people, now there are two and one of them is very unhappy about what happened.

The example is not so theoretical. In 1960-70th a lot of migrants from Mexico flocked into the construction business in US, and absolutely crashed the wages there.",YawnTractor_1756,t2_pkd94kwz,-1,0,reddit2

jltf8yh,t1_jlt5fi4,2023-05-27 12:48:10,science,"One of the biggest ways to solve this problem is making sure that neighbourhoods don't become mono ethnic areas, how do you manage that without it being unethical, forcing people to move to certain places? My money is on truly affordable housing anywhere and everywhere, such that new arrivals are not forced to live alongside immigrants from the same area who had moved ahead of them or just into the unit next door. There are benefits to grouping like this but it also causes an echo chamber of the people who are angry at the way things are in the place they just moved to. Which leads them to thinking well, didn't have this specific problem at home, how do I not have it here.

 I grew up in Canada and I will be the first to admit first generation immigrants very rarely fully fit in. But their kids, on the other hand, I notice little difference between them and the 4th generation canadians. There are exceptions, generally the younger the immigrant the more they adapt to the new place, but I've met countless first gen immigrants who adapt and mix both their original culture and the melting pot that is Canadian culture. 

I would love to see a study that tried to look into things like social ostracism due to ethnic background in places like Germany, Finland, Sweden, and other European nations to see if that plays a role at all in leading people to commit crimes. A ""treat me like an animal and I'll act like one"" mentality if you will. Or more succinctly put does racism lead victims of racism to commit more crimes? I wouldn't be surprised if it did.

The logic is like this: 

1.	We don’t know how much more likely exactly it “makes” someone to vote for xyz *in the real world* 
2.	from our sample we *estimate* to the best of our ability that it may be say 6% more likely (or 80% if the data suggests it)
3.	depending on how much data we based that on, this estimate will be more or less precise. So our estimate is 6% but the true value may well be 4% or 8%. 
4.	if our estimate is based on pretty messy or limited data, it is quite possible that we estimate a positive number like 6% or even 80%, but in the real word, the actual value is zero or even less 
5.	not statistically significant basically means “despite this best estimate, the true value may well be zero or negative. We just don’t know precisely enough to be confident it’s even a positive number.” - This depends on both how far from zero your estimate is, but also how sure you can be that your estimate is kind of close to the real value. 

So yes, if your *estimate* is 80% but it’s based on a survey of like 3 people in total, then the real value in the whole population may well be zero, and therefore your estimate would not be statistically significant.",revolucionario,t2_7qpab,5,0,reddit2

My sources are those cited by Banerjee and Duflo, who are economists.  I’m not an economist, but I trusted their book.

What I recall from *Good Economics for Hard Times* is that the impact of immigration has been of great interest to many economists in many different places over the decades.  It has been studied a lot.  The academic consensus from this is that immigration is, at worst, a (net) economically neutral event for natives.  More studies than not show it has a mildly positive impact.

This seems to be because it is generally difficult for immigrants to displace natives, and because immigrants generally spend their earnings on goods and services sold by natives.

Put another way: to the extent that immigrants *do* cheapen the value of labour by flooding the market, they seem to produce a roughly equal increase in demand for goods and services.

No, you must have health insurance, either socialized or private. However, private health insurance for people with high incomes is much cheaper. I, for example, pay 700EUR per month whereas private health care would cost me around 300EUR tops including dental insurance and many perks, which public healthcare doesn't cover. I stay in the public system as I emigrated here, studied for free and I still believe in doing my part.

> pensions

No, only for freelancers and state employees ( called Beamte ) but there's increasing pressure to make them have to pay into the system. In my case, and most of the German population, we must pay pension and normal taxes with the highest income bracket starting quite early ( around 62,000EUR ). It's worst if you're single ( elder care insurance, they argue it's because you have no kids and thus will burden the system further), basically, we're being taxed to death.

Sweden is an extremely tolerant society, which was to its detriment in this case. The police was and still is scared to police the immigrants properly lest they impede on the latter's rights and freedoms. Which is great in the original society but inevitable got abused by people used to other modes of government.  
Swedish police will shy from using force even when it is completely warranted. They generally avoid enforcing laws and rules in the ghettos because it can escalate quickly and horribly.

But yeah, it's bloody depressing. I'm saving for a house, and started up a successful side business along with working full time. Then you just watch all your hard work washed away in taxes. Then I go to work, knackered, and chat with the biggest slacker in the place, who's salary is being paid by the government on an employment scheme, only to hear him complaining about ""the c**nts at the council"" for not being quick enough fixing a minor DIY job on the door of his free house.

Income tax, national insurance, and people also forget VAT. The government takes about 20% of every single transaction in the country.

At my main job, we make spirits. We pay £8.05 on every single bottle (70cL, 40%) in alcohol duty. We have to pay that before it's sold. So then that gets built into the price, which means you pay VAT on it. So for a £20 bottle of gin, £12.05 goes directly to the government, from your taxed income. And the business has to pay council rates, corporation tax, national insurance, and pension contributions. Alcohol duty goes up this year.

In the UK, we've actually had quite a lot of problems recently with available workforce for low paid jobs. Certainly at the moment, it still seems like there are staff shortages in these roles. Obviously 'pay more' is easy to say, depends on the employer. 

You're right about the effects of migration on the other countries. I've thought about that a bit, and I don't really know what scientists think on the matter. As an example, I can say that the UK has, and still does, employ lots of migrant workers from countries like Poland, who are currently prospering. I guess there's opportunities for money and expertise to be passed back to a worker's home country. But also the issues of brain and brawn drain. Hard to say if countries like Poland have been so successful *despite this*, or whether it could be a slight positive, or completely insignificant!

But in terms of positives, my family have more experience working with migrants than I do, as they mostly work in the trades. And despite the general un-PCness that's common in those environments, they've only had good things to say about those they've worked with.

If it's socialized loss then per laws of competition / shareholder profit it's still a non factor in a businesses' calculations potentially.

Edit:

> leads to financial loss for firms in terms of missed productivity. 

I recognize my point above is poorly put since it specifies this clearly. Productivity tends to mean more goods and services are produced, and presumably the public benefits from this(of course even this is more complicated). I should have said more explicitly that it isn't clear that missed productivity necessarily results in loss of shareholder profits, for a variety of reasons. A more protected and less mistreated workforce can be *more productive* while the structure of the business supporting this can ultimately still give less profits to those who have ultimately less power to control distribution of profits that result from productivity. Productivity and profit are not as neatly related as the study seems to assume. There is nothing impossible about having workplace mistreatment yield more profits despite it lowering productivity, since a business model focused on trickle up, and the internal culture necessary to support it, may effectively rely on a relatively powerless and poorly protected labor force, and its profits may rely less on productivity and more on various forms of social and political control. Giving workers more protection effectively leads to more transparency that reveals its business model and decreases information disparity which is often highly in its/shareholder favor by design.",Havenkeld,t2_xttqr,29,0,reddit3

* bullying
* discrimination
* experienced mistreatment
* incivility
* physical violence
* psychological aggression
* sexual harassment

Edit: In light of similar questions and concerns in responses -

Note that this is just me reading and interpreting the link for other people. I might be wrong, but ... from my understanding of what it says:

* This study evaluates other studies and their data pulled from a variety of sources, so it's not at the level where the criteria for mistreatment was determined.

* They don't claim perfect definitions or measurement by those studies and sources. They are only aiming to evaluate what proportion of employees experience mistreatment *given* the ways it's already been measured based on data available to them from other sources, and with additional considerations for unaccounted for factors. (Yes, someone could reject that we should take this as given.)

* They recognize there can be a disparity between reported and measured prevalence and actual prevalence, hence their consideration of factors that may influence them.

* The study notes variances in measurement. It notes estimation is involved. It's more saying **IF** the data gets roughly at the truth of the matter, the percentage of employees experiencing mistreatment is within this range, and this ""up to 1.97T"" would be the cost of this considering consequences of mistreatment (or even perceived/measured mistreatment, if you like, as yes criteria for mistreatment may be subjective).

* People can object to the big if above, but it's just not something the study itself deals with, more something that would have to be taken up with the studies this evaluates and the sources they used for their data.",Havenkeld,t2_xttqr,84,0,reddit3

Another commenter posted the actual ""criteria"" that count as mistreatment in the data sets used and they are as broad and undefined as you could possibly imagine. To some extent you could say that if an employee feels like they're being mistreated then that's at least valuable on it's own, but this study doesn't frame it in that way.

It would be interesting to see how many employees actually win a case or reach a settlement based on workplace mistreatment. Obviously that has it's issues too, but that could serve as a lower bound for the actual amount of mistreatment that takes place.",,,1,0,reddit3

They don't claim perfect definitions or measurement anywhere. They are only aiming to evaluate what proportion of employees experience mistreatment given the ways it's already been measured and based on data available to them from other sources.

There is a simple fact that people can lie about mistreatment and different organizations may be more or less inclined to believe people or count different things as mistreatment than others. It's not assuming perfect data.

The study notes variances in measurement. It's more saying if the data gets roughly at the truth of the matter, the percentage of employees experiencing mistreatment is within this range, and this ""up to 1.97T"" would be the cost of this considering consequences of mistreatment (or even perceived/measured mistreatment, if you like).",Havenkeld,t2_xttqr,10,0,reddit3

Having a working standard that's not perfect may be better than no standard at all. 

Cases can be made that the standard needs improvement, and so on, but it solves the short term issues with everyone having incompatible personal standards by having a public standard. 

People's interpretation of the public standard can vary, but they have to make a case that their interpretation is reasonable and their judgements compatible with something other than their personal whims at least.

There's no way to neatly remove elements of the arbitrary from social interactions, but there's also no sense in just calling everything arbitrary and giving up on any order and standards altogether, especially if you take the arbitrary to be a problem(I agree it is).

When you know a contract is winding down, you have to start looking for a new one.

Compare that to a salaried employee, where your boss may work with your situation, and you don't have to be concerned about landing the next contract.

Worth noting: I don't have any dependents and I'm pretty frugal with spending. Drive a 2010 Outback wagon, the house I bought is a 2br/2bath. My goal is to have the *option* to retire early. I really enjoy the work so I may keep going indefinitely, but even at part time I can do 125/yr, which for me is more than enough. Most people are going to need more than 1M before they can consider retirement.",darth_faader,t2_3n6lr190,12,0,reddit3

In my opinion, Unless you're an owner it's not your company and forcing yourself to work in these situations is detrimental to your own health.

I've never had a company say ""hey, you didn't work the hours but I'm going to give you some free pay because why not"". Why would I do the same with my labour?

It doesn't feel two way at all to me.

Completely agree with this, I honestly think our only disagreement here is how we define a company ""treating you well"", because I do agree with 75% of your comment, I am just very cynical and don't believe any business has their workers best interests at heart.

Recent decades have witnessed a growing focus on two distinct income patterns: persistent pay inequity, particularly a gender pay gap, and growing pay inequality. Pay transparency is widely advanced as a remedy for both. Yet we know little about the systemic influence of this policy on the evolution of pay practices within organizations. To address this void, we assemble a dataset combining detailed performance, demographic and salary data for approximately 100,000 US academics between 1997 and 2017. We then exploit staggered shocks to wage transparency to explore how this change reshapes pay practices. We find evidence that pay transparency causes significant increases in both the equity and equality of pay, and significant and sizeable reductions in the link between pay and individually measured performance.",thebelsnickle1991,t2_600muuy8,65,0,reddit4

I heard a lady on NPR who was one of the first female executives on Wall St. She was given a pot of money to dole out in bonuses each year. According to her, the men in her office would hound her for bonuses, the women generally didn’t. So even as a woman herself, she paid the men more. She started some sort of group that mentored females in the finance industry and coached them on their monetary worth. And encouraged them to demand what they were worth.

>BUT research finds that all but 6% of the gap between men and women can simply be explained by men being in the workforce longer, having a higher percentage of full time jobs (this goes to your motherhood point), just working more hours in a year within those full time jobs, and men being more likely to negotiate for higher pay when hired ( CONSAD, 2009; Wall, 2000; Kugler, Tamara, Reif, & Brodbeck, 2014). 

>The remaining 6% is more likely due to vocational choice and educational opportunity discrimination.

About the study:

Typical central-planner mentality. Unfortunately, a plague among scientists, who seem to have this natural tendency to believe *they* can control and plan everybody's life.

I have no doubt whatsoever that workers who are bargaining for better salaries benefit from having information about other people's salaries.

This is akin to a business having the price offering lists of the competition. If you are below it, you know you can raise prices. If you are above it, you know you risk losing clients and may need to act.

The part the naive social scientists here miss is that the pool of capital a company is willing to spend on salaries is limited. Also, equal compensation *for equal work* is not an objective thing in most modern jobs.

So yes, you will get an equalization of salaries... to the downside. Even if some rise, many will stop doing it, and future employees will get worse starting offers.",chedebarna,t2_9rh87,1,0,reddit4

hxbsxh5,t1_hx8bv0m,2022-02-17 16:49:31,science,"All, I am just presenting my experience and observation here. Yes, women bargain less. And the tendency is to accept whatever is offered to them the first time around. That’s why I am saying we need to normalize talking about money among women. I am not trying to make this a gender thing. Often times you just have to assert yourself and demand the perks you want. Women do not tend to do that. 

I’m not saying I did not bargain. I bargained the hell out of the two companies that I had offers from - pitted against each other and ultimately got a very sweet deal. 25% more than what I was first offered. Lack of data did not deter me from bargaining and demanding more. 

Having said that I am open to sharing this experience with other junior female colleagues from the lab that I graduated from. Not just sidestep the conversation by saying a one or two liner - “ I was offered x amount of money and took it” or “my compensation is in this ball park amount” or “I am not comfortable talking about it” which is the response I got.

I could have made more money had I seriously prepared, interviews and gotten in the FAANG companies. But I chose to not do that. I was exhausted with a toddler at home and trying to finish my thesis. My husband, who was also in the same boat, however, did it. So yea, there is some truth to the fact that women should not just simply advocate but also lead my example.",,,1,0,reddit4

I've worked with several people who have done research on this subject AND have helped companies large and small manage their human capital disparities. 

Your message caught my attention because of a couple reasons...but I'm gonna drop some information here. 

There IS indeed a pay gap. According to the US dept of labor, pay trends for full time workers (all recorded industries) have women making about 82% of what men do. (Black's make about 80% of whites, Hispanics 75% of whites and Asians make 120% of whites salaries if you're interested)

BUT research finds that all but 6% of the gap between men and women can simply be explained by men being in the workforce longer, having a higher percentage of full time jobs (this goes to your motherhood point), just working more hours in a year within those full time jobs, and men being more likely to negotiate for higher pay when hired ( CONSAD, 2009; Wall, 2000; Kugler, Tamara, Reif, & Brodbeck). 

The remaining 6% is more likely due to vocational choice and educational opportunity discrimination. Women should be more encouraged to enter historically male dominated fields (management, police, engineering) and men encouraged to enter female dominated fields (nurses, clerical, elementary teaching).

But, I want people to understand that in the US Sex (as well as gender identity and sexual orientation as of last year) is a protected group and you CAN NOT be discriminated against for hiring, promotions, and other vital job decisions based on being a woman. If you are, the company should be prepared to lose a lot of money. There needs to be proof that performance criteria could not be met or that other job and task related factors were the reason for the decision.",danethegreat24,t2_zfmuu,11,0,reddit4

Abstract  
Recent decades have witnessed a growing focus on two distinct income patterns: persistent pay inequity, particularly a gender pay gap, and growing pay inequality. Pay transparency is widely advanced as a remedy for both. Yet we know little about the systemic influence of this policy on the evolution of pay practices within organizations. To address this void, we assemble a dataset combining detailed performance, demographic and salary data for approximately 100,000 US academics between 1997 and 2017. We then exploit staggered shocks to wage transparency to explore how this change reshapes pay practices. We find evidence that pay transparency causes significant increases in both the equity and equality of pay, and significant and sizeable reductions in the link between pay and individually measured performance.  
  
Main  
Recent decades have witnessed a growing global focus on two distinct income patterns: persistent pay inequity, particularly a gender pay gap, and growing pay inequality1,2. Though these terms are sometimes used rather interchangeably, pay equity refers to the fairness by which pay is allocated, often measured as the consistency or non-discriminatory manner by which pay is matched to performance or effort. By contrast, pay equality is self-evidently the equivalence of pay, often measured as simply the variance in pay within an organization or society3. While recent studies suggest global reductions in the magnitude of still-persistent pay inequity (specifically the gender pay gap4,5), they also consistently point to a global pattern of increasing pay inequality within organizations6 and societies7.  
  
In partial response to these patterns have come abundant calls from politicians and advocacy groups for greater transparency in pay allocation, particularly the public disclosure of individual income8. The argument is that enhanced pay transparency places social pressure on those allocating pay to reduce both inequity and inequality, including by gender. Accordingly, many nations, states and organizations have taken directional steps to heed this call. But resistance to pay transparency within the private sector remains quite deep-seated. A recent survey of US employers suggests that 41% actively discourage their employees from simply sharing information about pay with their organizational peers, while 25% explicitly prohibit it9. The common explanation is that the heightened focus on equity and equality that pay transparency prompts undermines the capacity to link individual pay and performance, thereby compromising organizational efforts to effectively motivate employees and attract talented ones.  
  
Some prior but mostly contemporaneous research explores pay transparency’s influence on specific dimensions of pay allocation, particularly pay equality. For instance, a published study by Mas10 and unpublished studies by Baker et al.11, Bennedsen et al.12, and Cullen and Pakzad-Hurson13 all point to pay transparency prompting organizations to make pay more equal, including more equal by gender and rank. Cullen and Pakzak-Hurson develop a formal model predicting pay compression following transparency as a result of bargaining concerns. They show corroborating evidence from the private sector of the US economy using a staggered rollout of policies facilitating communication about pay between co-workers. In a working paper that explores Canadian academics’ salaries, Baker et al. leverage the staggered introduction of pay transparency laws across Canadian provinces (and partly within institutions) to show that pay transparency is associated with more equal pay by gender, essentially a narrowing of a gender pay gap that is adjusted for rank but not individual performance. Gartenberg and Wulf14 find that pay transparency is associated with a diminished relationship between division manager pay and division performance within geographically dispersed firms. While these studies explore pay transparency’s influence on specific elements of pay in organizations, decisions about pay equity, pay equality and pay for performance are highly interrelated. Our aim is this paper is to examine pay transparency’s systemic influence on an organization’s pay practices, specifically pay equity (including the performance-conditioned gender pay gap), pay equality and pay for performance.  
  
To explore pay transparency’s broad influence on pay requires access to rather unique data. Ideally, we would observe a large panel of individual employment data that includes both performance and salary histories surrounding exogenous shocks to pay transparency. The US academic context provides an appealing setting to assemble such data. First, many key individual productivity outcomes are observable and measurable, enabling relatively reliable estimates of both discriminatory and non-discriminatory wage differentials, including the performance-conditioned gender pay gap, as well as estimates of pay for performance. Second, through the Freedom of Information Act and state-specific Sunshine laws, salary data for public university employees have become available in most states, albeit archived in widely disparate data repositories and with varying ease and cost of access. Finally, in the past decade, a wave of transparency events in the form of published websites dramatically eased university employees’ access to peer salary data. These websites appeared in a staggered fashion essentially state by state, but each well after the imposition of the Freedom of Information Act and state-specific Sunshine laws. Our data combine detailed information about the individual academic performance of close to 100,000 US academics (that is, their publications, awards, grants, books and patents) with their demographic characteristics (gender (as estimated dichotomously from first names), rank, tenure and discipline) and their salary histories between 1997 and 2017. We then exploit staggered shocks to the accessibility of information on wages in the public university systems in the United States to explore how pay transparency changes pay equity and pay equality, as well as the performance basis of pay—specifically, how the links between pay and observable performance measures change both within the broader population and within individual academic departments and institutions.  
  
Our results suggest that pay transparency has an economically sizeable effect in reducing pay inequity, significantly reducing the performance-conditioned gender pay gap, as well as more broadly improving the precision with which pay is linked to observable performance metrics and promotion. Overall pay allocation becomes more fair, more equitable and less discriminatory, at least on the performance dimensions we can measure. At the same time, our results suggest that pay transparency has a significant and economically sizeable effect in increasing the equality of pay, reducing by nearly 20% the level of pay variance within departments and institutions. Overall, pay also simply becomes more equal.  
  
One way an organization composed of individuals with heterogenous abilities can generate both more equal and more equitable pay is to have pay both more precisely and more weakly linked to individual performance. We find evidence of exactly this: pay transparency leads to significant and economically sizeable reductions in the performance basis of pay. Not only is pay more consistently and equitably linked to performance, but the financial rewards linked to observable performance metrics as well as rank advancement substantially decline after wages become more transparent.  
  
In aggregate, our results confirm that pay transparency has the consequences that many policy advocates claim. It prompts organizations to reduce inequity and inequality in pay allocation. At the same time, pay transparency has consequences less frequently discussed. Pay transparency prompts those allocating pay to weaken the link between observable performance metrics and pay. We view our results as providing an empirical test of the causal effect of pay transparency on three fundamental attributes of pay—pay equity, pay equality and the performance basis of pay in organizations—thereby generating a framework for policymakers and practitioners alike to evaluate and debate the arguably complex consequences of pay transparency.",RoadSufficient7629,t2_fwb7iepv,17,0,reddit4

It's really hard to step back and think about what you would do without all of that input. As a manager, sometimes your boss even hits you with ""well are they complaining about it?"", when you are advocating for a promotion or raise, so you have to fight the bias from within and without.

Anyone who's rational and in a difficult situation with difficult trade-offs will be better off taking all of it in to account and changing their behavior.

I understand the hesitation to discuss pay especially if you make more (it’s always a bit awkward especially if you also have a bit of impostor syndrome). I guess one of the benefits is that it still gives you an idea of what your market rate is, which helps inform any job opportunity decisions. It can also inform end of year discussions and negotiations. If you’re an analyst, and every other analyst you know is making 25% less, then maybe asking for even more money isn’t going to work. Maybe instead you negotiate for non monetary benefits like extra vacation days.

Also, there’s always a bigger fish. Coworkers aren’t just folks at the same level as you or in the same function. Knowing this info let’s you plan your career. If you’re an analyst in marketing, and know that a senior analyst in sales makes 100k while a senior analyst in marketing makes 80k, we’ll now you’re more informed and maybe aiming to be in sales is a good idea.

If the person doing a better job is being more productive then it's not equal work. So it's an invalid argument.


If the person doing a better job is still only outputting the same work at the end of the day, just more efficiently, then they shouldn't be paid more. The person who doesn't work better still has to work harder to achieve the same result.


Companies often abuse hard workers with false hopes and promises. It's a great strategy to get free hard work at little to no expense. And the ones I've dealt with were unlikely to promote hard workers because that means they'd be losing a hard worker in that field. They were more likely to promote slackers (I've heard it termed ""promote away"") so they could be replaced with a potentially hard worker. And companies that do offer negotiated, or increased pay, per individual have a tendency to abuse it with favouritism etc.

Education gets you a better starting salary in some cases, plus if they are a newer hire then market pressure gets higher salaries.  People already working and not asking for raises may not get them.  In fact, this is one of the reasons for pay gaps. Women tend to negotiate worse and are willing to accept lower pay because they don't think they are worth as much.

The thing is when people talk you can realize that the new hire is being paid more for the similar work and similar output so maybe a raise is in order for the person who has been with the company longer.

I agree it's not fair, but that is why many people switch jobs so often early on in careers to get those pay jumps. Companies tend to be pennywise and pound foolish when it comes to compensate until the competition starts poaching and they are left with scraps.

You do not just go to your boss and ask for raise and he then gives it to you because you found out your coworker earns double what you do. That boss has predetermined budget that he can use for pay increase. And he will not drain huge portion of that budget for some huge salary raise. If everyone asked for raises all the time then he would have to split it out. If only some ask for raise because they know their worth then only they will get it and at some point earn twice or even more than their coolleagues.

You just baked the sexism right into your reply. You don't *ask* for equality, you *demand* it. The problem is that if you say ""pretty please can I have a 20% raise"" you will be told no.

If you say that you've shopped around and your market value is now $x, the company either has to respond by offering you closer to or above $x or, the key part, you leave.

Women are conditioned to the former, men the latter. So back to u/Tedstor's point, ""learned behavior can be unlearned.""

The only resolution to sexism is for companies to learn the hard way. Shop around. It's what men do and why they gain so quickly in salaries. Part of the study author's conclusion seems rather unjust to me:

Why? As a consumer I'm not going to automatically pay more for a box of chocolates next year, the company needs to ask for a higher price.

If, as part of a marketplace, companies want to offer more automatically to try to retain talent then that makes sense, but that doesn't automatically mean the company should have to offer the maximum extra they can possibly afford. Each party in the labor market is looking to get the best arrangement they can from the other.

>Second: Even in the situation where a female employee asks for a raise, they are less likely to get it because an assertive woman is seen as ""bitchy.""

You don't fix this with pay transparency because it extends far beyond pay. If it's prevalent in a corporate culture then it permeates that culture and makes every meeting and decision rife with sexism.

Fix the view that women who assert themselves being ""bitchy"" and this issue goes away. Don't do away with performance based pay or pay women more just because aggregate statistics say they're earning less. Dive into the details to understand why.

Those that are good at negotiations (usually low in agreeableness, higher in conflict seeking) tend to thrive under the current conditions. To them, it would be a strict downgrade and it's natural for them to defend the practice. It's basic game theory. If your individual performance is much better than the average, you are thriving in the current system. Enforced leveling of the playing field would only harm you, as it would introduce a push toward the average which for you would be downward.  

It's similar to social safety nets in that regard. The optimal play is for everybody to share their salaries and for employers to be open about offers and raises. This ensures the highest level of competition and the highest total effectiveness. However, that comes at the cost of individuals and this must be accounted for if you want it to become a reality.  

The market will most likely never be truly open and competitive - it's in our nature to look out for us and our own first. Retaining information is an advantage unless you get something in return.

The study author encourages this because it improves pay equality and equity.

>I'm also not saying raises are required (even though it behooves a company to offer good employees a performance based raise, or stock options or something). But if a company is budgeting money for raises, they should automatically go towards the employees that have the best numbers. A thing every company knows about every employee. That's a much better practice then expecting employees to ""demand"" them.

It's a careful balance. Employers should offer raises to help with employee satisfaction and retention yes. But if you're not getting what you want, then you can ask.

The problem seems to be that women refuse to demand what they're owed when an employer doesn't budge. This accounts for a large portion of the gap. When men aren't paid what they should be, they demand more by proving they're owed more and in the worst case, they leave for better offers.

I'm not a favor of fixing the absolute pay gap by simply paying women more. They shouldn't get special treatment.

The adjusted pay gap is only a few percentage points. Once you adjust for education, time in workforce, and negotiating, you get only a very small difference. And in some areas, women make more.

So if we fix the absolute pay gap, women will by far get preferential treatment. I don't think this is a just outcome.

>If I make significantly less money than someone else, I want to know the reason.

I'm all for this too. I'm concerned the immediate conclusion will be that sexism is at work when we already know that once adjusted for confounding factors, the gap is very little. But yet a lot of men and women think there's some huge disparity.

>I don't expect to be paid less because they simply asked for more money.

I believe some companies provide end of year bonuses based on performance level. I don't necessarily see an issue with this as it requires a worker to continue working above and beyond to acquire it. This is compared to granting someone a pay increase where they can then start slacking off and still be paid the higher salary. 


In my country, there is a lot of employee protection so reducing a workers salary for poor performance can be very difficult or even illegal and it's illegal to fire someone without a good reason so the only option for companies is to offer redundancy with a payout and even then they have to be careful how they do it because making someone redundant means the position is no longer available so the company can't hire a replacement.",InSight89,t2_15hqjl,1,0,reddit4

Do you just let a woman struggle to carry a heavy object? 

I would help a man if he was carrying something heavy, but it appears this could be construed as sexism if the offer is to a woman. 

And on average, a woman is much more likely to struggle with a heavy object than a man. 

Also, I think in the real world there is an expectation to offer to help women with heavy items, and you are more likely to be perceived negatively for not helping than for helping (even if the object is not that heavy/the woman is not particularly struggling).",hiraeth555,t2_3e2hyz7k,843,0,reddit1

The study uses physical help as possible benevolent sexism but the methodology regards character traits and professional knowledge more than anything else.

The case in the study is definitely a sexist scenario and the results is at least reasonable at first glance.

The real question is how this holds over different professions. There's already studies shown that sexism is dependent on sex-representation within the workplace. A female mechanic hired for gender quotas isn't going to be treated the same as a male kindergarten teacher, hired for gender quotas. 

Should probably also separate sexism based on physical traits (such as perceived strength) and sexism based on domain knowledge (lower faith in people completing their work tasks, etc).

>Hostile sexism and benevolent sexism represent two different manifestations of sexist attitudes and beliefs. Hostile sexism is the more overt and recognizable form. It is characterized by clear, negative stereotypes and antagonism toward women. Typically, hostile sexism manifests in actions and statements that openly degrade women, question their abilities, or treat them as inferior.

>**Benevolent sexism, on the other hand, is more insidious and can be harder to detect because it is often cloaked in what appears to be positive or protective language. It involves attitudes that seemingly place women on a pedestal but ultimately reinforce traditional gender roles and the idea of female dependency.**

>For example, a male colleague insisting on carrying heavy objects for a female colleague “because it’s too much for her” or suggesting that women are more suited to nurturing roles due to their “innate kindness” are instances of benevolent sexism. While these actions or comments might be intended or perceived as kind or chivalrous, they perpetuate stereotypes and the notion that women are less capable or independent.

>“The main takeaway from our study is that benevolent sexism – this form of seemingly positive sexism that still causes harm and reinforces gender roles and hierarchies – is less likely to trigger bystander responses commonly associated with discrimination and harassment,” Dhanani told PsyPost. “**That is, people who witness benevolent sexism are less likely to view it as a violation of moral norms and are less likely to experience anger in response, both of which are linked to important outcomes such as bystanders taking prosocial actions to intervene after harassment occurs.** This means that when employees experience benevolent sexism, their coworkers are less likely to give them the support they need to lessen the harm of that experience.”",poply,t2_4lt9q,81,0,reddit1

kfz6c9z,t1_kfyuil9,2024-01-02 13:59:57,science,">The case in the study is definitely a sexist scenario and the results is at least reasonable at first glance.

First glance is the thing. After looking through the paper, the beneficial condition was some man saying ""this specific task is too hard for women \[i.e. you\]"", while the hostile condition was saying ""women \[i.e. you\] should not work here"". Imo latter is clearly worse sexism than first, and I am not even sure you'd actually call the first one ""beneficial"". So you are basically comparing ""bad sexism"" to ""worst sexism"", and then find out that people react more strongly to ""worst sexism"" - but instead of just phrasing it that way, you call ""bad sexism"" ""benevolent"", and ""worst sexism"" ""hostile"".

The whole idea of ""benevolent"" and ""hostile"" sexism is also pretty flawed (at least in the way they use it). I mean, think of someone with a very conservative mindset - they might believe that working is harmful to women and doing housework is much better for them. Then they (in terms of intention) might be belevolent when telling a woman that they should stop working, find a husband and take care of housework. But that would be defined as non-benevolent sexism if we go by the study's definition. Then there might be someone else, who is actively trying to make fun of women by ""helping"" them with remarks that women are bad at these thing. The intention is clearly hostile here, but this would be considered ""benevolent"" to the authors.",Chao_Zu_Kang,t2_m4np5,73,0,reddit1

kfz3cij,t1_kfyceut,2024-01-02 13:35:15,science,"Dunno about the way they did that study. Apparently, the hostile condition was straight up saying that the man does ""not believe that women can succeed in a sales role"", while the beneficial condition was the man saying that they should do the work because ""women struggle with being assertive"". So both condition are essentially the same - just the beneficial condition is the weaker sexism (since hostile condition is essentially saying ""you should stop working here"", while the other is ""this specific case is too hard for you""). At least that's imo since I feel like saying ""because you are a woman, you are unfit"" is just higher on the sexism scale than saying ""women tend to be less assertive, so let me do this task that needs assertiveness for you"".

On a scale, you'd basically be comparing a 10 in sexism (hostile) to a 5 (benevolent) and a 0 (neutral), but you use the 5 as a -10 (that is not exactly how they applied their statistics, but it is essentially how they argued - just to show why the conclusion isn't really as simple as clear as stated). Clearly, people should react more to a 10, than to a 5 (if we assume this sort of continuous sexism scale). So stating that the people saw beneficial sexism (5) as less of an issue than hostile (10) sexism seems more like a case of questionable definition of variables to me. At least in this study - there obviously could be other studies that do a better job in keeping beneficial and hostile sexism condition more similiar. If anything, the beneficial condition should have been as bad as the beneficial condition (e.g. ""this industry is too hard on women"" or so).

Always better to not be demanding in that situation. Sometimes people don't want help, sometimes they do, asking shows which is the case. Maybe the other person wants help as in you carry it together or as in you taking over. Assuming that you take it over puts you above them while doing it together puts you on equal footing. Again, just let them decide what kind of help they want.

Also why the need to highlight your perceived lack of the other person's abilities? You don't have to preemptively justify it, if you feel that you want to help someone, just ask if you may and they will tell you. This would also disarm 3's comment.

By using that dichotomy, I agree they seem to be making a statement about intention. I do think it’s possible that apparent intention might affect how people respond (e.g. I live in the Midwest, and people here don’t want to be seen as rude, so reacting to “benevolent sexism” might be viewed as overreacting).

But to me it seems like the best way to fight casual sexism/racism/discrimination is to simply not embrace it, but to still participate in social things.

Example being to simply not laugh at such jokes (if intended to be a joke) and if trying to make some sexist remark (like ""you're a man/woman so you probably..."") is to just ask ""why"" until they say something you can call them out on. Works perfect on flat earther, anti-vaxers and people discriminating based on stereotypes.

But I also believe everyone has their flaws and you should be able to argue/have a conversation with someone without it having to ruin the mood. Avoiding contact isn't the best way, in my opinion, as it just lets people create their echo chamber where everyone who disagrees have moved away.

The thing is, that this goes both ways. You assume that this naturally only applies to women. But men suffer from similiar gender stereotypes such as being able to handle psychological problems more easily, being strong, aso. And if we look at your example

>nah he doesn't need help he's got this

What if you only don't try to help because you assume that the man doesn't need any help because he is a man and can easily take care of his car? So ultimately, you just decide which one of these two stereotypes is the one you want to have as a ""sex-neutral baseline"". And I really don't see why you'd want the ""don't offer help"" part as a baseline here.

And we can make this even more complicated when talking about stuff like looking at potential partners, because then those actions might be due to the sex of the other person, but not sexist since you are doing that due to maybe find a partner, i.e. for a functional reason (and not just due to some stereotype).

The point I am trying to make here isn't that either perspective is wrong or right. The point is, that you can't just treat women the same you'd treat men and then be happy that you aren't sexist.

kg3sa0z,t1_kfyigkg,2024-01-03 09:12:47,science,"Benevolent sexism as a term is poorly named due to the positive association we have with the word benevolence. It conjures up a positive image in most people's heads. The examples I've heard used in studies about benevolent sexism though is a whole lot closer to smug patronising, manipulation or passive aggression than kindness. 

I think one experiment included a man claiming to help a female coworker with the computer while saying out loud something like ' you're a woman so of course you need help with this. Don't worry, I'll sort it out for you' (the one saying this was an actor, while witnesses were the ones researchers were studying)


Another example could be someone so insistent that they carry for you that they simply take the stuff out of your hands by force and then act as if they have done you a huge flavour. 

A lot of people hate having their autonomy dismissed and have things more or less ripped out of their hands, and to add insult to injury then be faced with someone who expects you to thank them for it and be grateful. It's a sort of selfish kindness that has a lot more to do with how the one acting feels and wants to be seen as than about what the target of those acts actually wants or needs. 
That kind of ""kindness"" feels like it comes with strings attached. 


Benevolent sexism is also grafted at the hip with overt and aggressive sexism on a society level. There is last I heard of the studies done no country with high benevolent sexism and low overt sexism or vice versa. If one is high then so is the other.

kfzzgr4,t1_kfz9jty,2024-01-02 17:13:10,science,"At least where I live (not in US, so the cultural norms are a bit different), this depends on the particular situations and knowing the person. Declining may be part of the other person being polite, too. 


Examples: offering my seat to an unknown elderly person in the public transport. The elderly person usually declines at first. Then I stand up and free the seat. It is going to remain unoccupied for half a minute and the elderly person then finally accepts the offer, sits and thanks. This is insistence on my part but it is still part of both of us being courteous.  



With the lifting heavy things it is similar.
Sometimes the female colleague declines at first but accepts if I repeat my offer (which, let’s be honest, is a form of insistence). And the reason is that the she realises that my initial question is out of politeness and for her the polite thing to do is to not trouble me. But if I repeat the offer, which is a form of insistence, she now knows that I really want to help and allows me to do it. This is the explanation that I got from my female coworkers after a couple of situations where my offer to help was declined but another male colleague’s offer was accepted. 



My words when I repeat the offer are along the lines of “are you sure? It seems heavy (or really heavy) let me help with it”. The role of the second sentence is not to imply “you cannot/should not do it” but to show that I truly mean what I’ve suggested. It also provides the person with a way to decline, if so they wish (“don’t worry, it is light. But thanks”). 




Other times the person may refuse a second time and then I am letting it go because further insistence is not courteous anymore, it is straight rude. 



So, why did I say that it also comes up to knowing the person? Because over time I get to know who is waiting for me to offer my help a second time and who will always refuse. It doesn’t mean that I am not going to offer to help in the latter case, it means that I am never going to ask twice, cause it is going to be rude.",darth_vladius,t2_l3lyf,2,0,reddit1

The same way a woman deserves to feel safe and secure when they walk alone at night, but it’s irresponsible of their own safety to assume they are always going to be safe and secure walking alone at night. Women have every reason to be wary of their safety walking alone at night, and should absolutely take whatever measures they can to assure their own safety. That’s not victim blaming, and it’s not their fault if something bad happens when walking alone at night, it’s just reality because there are bad people who target women who are alone at night.

But to try and clarify the matter, I suggest you go back up this chain of comments and make the effort of reading all the words. This is clearly a thread about how some people do enjoy positively engaging with some our time's gender norms, out of their own free will. It's about the importance of personal choice being respected, regarding these matters. You were the first to talk about stereotyping. And why are you conflating gender with genitals? That's an alarmingly transphobic mentality, outdated, and dare I say it, stereotypical view about gender. If you restrict gender to genital, you're excluding heaps of trans people from the discussion.

But to go back to your demand, whether you like it or not, loads of people enjoy *aspects* of the gender norms of our societies. The importance of discussions such as these is precisely to delineate ways in which positive engagement with gender roles may happen without constricting those who wish to not engage with said roles. Having these discussions and conversations is helpful to everyone except to the oppressing parties because it's one way of eroding the restrictive nature of such norms by turning them into choice, rather than compulssion.

Shutting down these discussions with antagonism and lack of understanding, on the other hand, is unhelpful. I understand your outrage, and some situations do require full gas on the antagonism, but this isn't one of them. You completely misread what was said, and by going up in arms about it all you've achieved is the derailing of a constructive conversation and the summoning of a seemingly man's rights dude (which sadly my own comment will undoubtedly achieve as well, now).

Now, it's possible given resources and the size of the packages it's better to allocate one person who's stronger to do the lifting than two people who are weaker and need to combine forces to move packages.

I’ve never had a case where I offered help because the female coworker was insufficient. In our company there are basically no jobs where lifting heavy things is part of the job. Thus when there is a need to lift something heavy it is something extraordinary and is part of something that is not an everyday task.

And if Democrats are in charge of the House, Senate and Presidency at that point (which the polling currently suggests is probable), they will have the option to craft new legislation to attempt to soften the blow and protect as many features of the ACA as possible.

Biden has been vocally against Medicare for All. His platform instead proposes expanding the ACA. If the Court has struck down the ACA, though… then expanding Medicare becomes much more attractive and may actually represent the only option to achieve universal care. I don’t know enough about the law, it may also be possible for Congress to ground the ACA or successor legislation in a different part of the Constitution which would better protect it from a conservative SCOTUS. And the filibuster will be gone by that point, with the possibility of two more DC Senators appointed. So they may have more leeway to make good policy without having to compromise it to the level acceptable to the most conservative Democrat. 

So while the GOP’s plans are heartless and malicious, and WILL cause suffering and disruption, it’s too early to write the eulogy of universal healthcare in the US. And that’s good news for everyone who isn’t employed by a corporation.",age_of_bronze,t2_v1hyd,1,0,reddit2

g6zvf2s,t1_g6yqyuy,2020-09-28 21:18:11,science,"Saudi here. We have a majorly shame based culture - everyone is super super concerned about what others will think. We're particularly concerned about what other Muslim countries think. The fact that we're responsible for the holiest sites in Islam is something people here take very seriously, and so there's a big big cultural pressure to at least maintain the appearance of being strict and conservative.

For example, there's been a bunch of music festivals the past couple years - with huge acts. I know a ton of people who went, said it was the best day, they had so much fun, and then 10 seconds later would say that the festival shouldn't have happened and it was shameful, because of how it would look to other Muslim countries. I know one couple who fly out to go to Coachella every single year, love the music scene, and they were super against it happening here, publicly, because it's 'not correct'. They said it's fine for people to enjoy these things, but they should do it in their own homes. It's changing, but 80% of the criticism I hear within Saudi - about all the changes tbh - is about how it would look to Muslims outside of Saudi.

A big part of it is how we generally view privacy too. People always think we're an authoritarian country, but in my experience we're really much more libertarian. For most of our history, what happened in your house was your business and no one else's - not even the government. Keep in mind, we live in a desert, so we go out a lot less. Our culture is focused around going to other people's houses and hosting, not going out to restaurants and bars. So, 'what happens behind closed doors' was like everything. And no one really spoke about anyone's private business. Like, unless you knew someone really really well, it's rude to even bring up their spouse in casual conversation - male or female. That's their private life, it's none of your business. Again, this is changing fast.

Dunno if that helps explain a bit why we're like this!",crashlanding87,t2_f04c6,1553,0,reddit2

It's not in the US as far as we can tell because everyone in government is supposedly accountable to an elected official.

It's in China. It's in Vietnam. It's in Thailand. It's in UAE. It's in Morocco. It's in Cuba. It's in North Korea. It's in Iran. There are many other places that have literal dictatorships. A dictatorship means that the common people's *only* practical recourse for popular change in the highest levels of government is a violent change.

Some people argue that many European countries still have remnant dictatorships, but the dictator families in Europe generally serve at the behest of the democratically ratified constitutional structures, whereby the people can elect to end such practices. I don't know enough about those European system of government to know if their ""monarchs"" are dictators.

Regardless, you know a dictatorship when it becomes a major legal offense to criticise government officials. In the Philippines people say that you can be taken out by extra-judicial thugs for criticizing Duerte, but the fact that it's *extra*-judicial is the key.

When there was a big push to get women into the workplace, the government had to put major financial incentives and even fines and quotas in place just to get companies to hire women. I don't know if it's still the case, but about 10 years ago there was a program where the government would pay for all of a woman's job training, and in some sectors her first year of employment.

I don't know if it's more or less prevalent here than in other places - because a lot of it doesn't get reported - but for a long time there was basically nothing the police could do. This is changing a lot at the moment - there's a new human rights commission that's doing a lot of work around policy for situations like that, but I'm not up to date on the laws tbh.

And sure, I'd be happy to. One thing that might be interesting to you - I always get into an argument with my older aunts and uncles about talking about Saudi. My view is that explaining to people what we're like and why we're like this helps build understanding, and will help people help us move forward. The older generation predominantly responds that we shouldn't do that, because we don't owe anyone any explanations and it's none of their business our internal workings. I think this is rooted in our bedouin history - where talking about your problems was basically showing competing tribes weaknesses that they could exploit. There's very limited natural resources here, so people are very, very protective about what others know.

My generation is pretty removed from our tribal history, and was brought up on the internet. For my parents, though, the truly tribal, bedouin way of life was still in living history, so even though they weren't living like that, they were still brought up with that culture. 

I should note that this is very specific to the gulf. The Levantine and North Aftican states have been major cities forever, so they have a very different culture.",crashlanding87,t2_f04c6,420,0,reddit2

I do think that a completely behind closed doors culture can lead to abuse being a problem because the government considers it to be none of their business.  

This isn't just a cultural thing, it's an Islamic principle as well. All those harsh punishments you hear about? The bar of evidence for those punishments is *ridiculously* high, firstly because they're mainly supposed to be deterrents, and secondly because *what happens in your house is your business*. Even if you're quite sure someone's doing something illegal in their home, the police can't just break in (unless it's a known place for organised crime). There's also the principle of finding any possible reason to not carry out the harshest punishment (yes this is an actual rule in Islamic law). So finding four witnesses for adultery is super hard.  

For example, under English Common Law, evidence obtained illegally is inadmissible. Similarly, in Islam if someone purposely divulges something private (even if it's illegal), that would arguably make them of bad character and untrustworthy, which would make their testimony inadmissible. For example, fornication is illegal in Islamic law. I heard someone ask an Islamic scholar, ""Would porn actors be punished?"" He responded, ""Since we look for any way out, firstly the video may be forged. Secondly, the crew are not admissible as witnesses because, since they work on a porn set, they cannot be of sound character.""  

Backbiting, libel and false accusations are also extremely major sins. For example, an accusation of adultery without evidence results in 80 lashes. Gossip, spilling secrets and accusations (especially sexual ones) can completely destroy lives.

So yeah, in Islam privacy is taken extremely seriously. I don't know the extent to which Saudi currently follows these principles however.",otah007,t2_c7cxd,73,0,reddit2

A nation like Japan doesn't care if other Muslim nations criticize their values because they don't find shame in the same things.

 Think of him as a benevolent dictator, except instead of being benevolent he's pragmatic and ruthless.
  
When his father decided to transfer much of the authority to rule, Mohammed bin Salman started his power grab by stripping the hard-line Wahhabi clerics of power and arresting any he even thought might oppose him.  He wants a more moderate form of Islam in Saudi Arabia, and that's how he decided to make it happen.  There's no way the old clerics would have accepted reforms such as allowing women to drive, but the clerics in power now do.
  
His next step was to arrest about a dozen fellow princes, several government officials, and several businessmen on corruption charges.  He also seized almost a trillion dollars in assets from those arrested.  There probably was corruption, but this was more consolidation of power and a preemptive attack on rivals.

He has done other reforms such as allowing women to own business and travel internationally without needing the permission of a man.  He has banned the execution of minors (something still allowed in the US).  However, anyone who is too critical of the government will either be arrested or killed by his death squad.

It’s ignorant to think the problem is just in the jobs. It’s about their freedom and being able to make their own decisions. Before marriage your family has a say in what you study and work as (some jobs their parents tell their daughters are “man jobs”)... How you dress ... When and where you can go out ... They can even hit you and no one can say anything. Have you heard of “dar alreaya”? I will tell you. Until very very recently like two years ago, there were these places where woman could be placed for “misbehaving” to fix their behaviours. The lead causes for being out there is trying to leave their homes due to abuse and the family finding out and putting them there or not agreeing to getting married with the person who asked for their hand. They cannot leave this place they are kept at unless their parents come to pick them up. And many don’t because they bring them “shame” and they stay for many many years. Do you realise women in Saudi are like minors who legally can’t make decisions without a male guardian? 
One thing they get the right to do is a step closer to their freedom.

Hypothetically the leader is representitive of the general populace - however, do to systemic changes and rulings set - corporations = people, and money = speech. If you are going to fix the US - these are the first two things that need to change.

The ultimate problem can be resolved through perseverance - the ideal would be to turn changing the rulings on money=speech and corporations = people into significant issues that a sufficient number of single issue voters become a swing capable of winning or losing you the election. Once that occurs - you can bet the trend will be to resolve that: and fast.

Until then: You have to contend with winning primaries and then win the election proper - and you are doing so as a no name, and so help you if someone decides to dig into your past and turn you into a non-viable candidate in any number of ways.

Oh, and this is before we talk about systemic disenfranchisement and gerrymandering and some likely election result tampering.

> Actions always speak louder that words (which is why strikes work. You don't need guns, you just need to stop going to work). 

Union strikes work for the simple reason that the Union has a slush fund that allows it to compensate workers, and ensure that the workers won't go bust over the time they are striking.

The lack of revenue and stop work costs the company a massive amount - and the threat of continued stop work is often enough to force the employer to the negotiating table.

Of course, the walmarts of the world, with the first wif of smoke suggesting Unionization is occurring - will literally shut the location down with practically 0 warning.

Without that union backing you - without the funds sitting in reserve (which most workers - especially low wage workers do not have, nor do they have the liberty to just up and quit).",formesse,t2_7enxi,1,0,reddit2

>Yes, but only if you broaden your definition of shame. You could argue that what makes a culture different from another is what that culture considers shameful. 

I have to wonder if words mean anything anymore. 

Basically, people live their lives as they do because they can do so without shame. If they feel like they have something to be ashamed of, they'll be depressed and repressed. They might avoid doing something if they feel that it might shame them. 

Everyone will avoid shame. 

The difference between cultures is what behavior or status will have shame associated with it. In saudi Arabia, it's one thing. In japan, it's another. In the us, it's another. 

In some cultures, each individual has a wider range of behaviors available to them while still avoiding shame. But avoiding shame is what we do. What we all do. That fact doesn't change.",pm_favorite_boobs,t2_1657jm,1,0,reddit2

There are also many ways in which states limit the accessibility of abortions to circumvent other legislation - by shutting down clinics, requiring clinics to give patients biased materials, and mandatory waiting periods. Sometimes the patients are also required to have an ultrasound done first, and in some states there are only a handful of clinics that can perform abortions.

It is not easy to get an abortion in many states.

g70k5rm,t1_g708oko,2020-09-29 01:15:03,science,"> I just wonder how effective it is at catching people who do commit serious crimes.  

There's one critical aspect that comes so naturally to religious people as to not even be worth mentioning, yet never even occurs to the atheistic/secular mind: divine justice.  

In Islam, for everything good/bad you do, you are either rewarded/punished in this life, or you are rewarded/punished in the next life. So firstly, even if justice is not served on earth, it will be served in the afterlife. Secondly, you would rather have justice here than in the afterlife: this encourages confession, but *only if you are actually guilty!* Unlike most legal systems which can make pleading guilty better than not guilty (due to a reduced sentence), the Islamic system encourages confession if and only if you are guilty, so as to receive the punishment now rather than later. Thirdly, all crimes are forgivable. Confession also makes it more likely for the victim to forgive you, and facilitates restorative justice.  

So even if it's not completely effective at catching criminals, justice will be served eventually, and the system encourages honesty.  

There's also the issue of [Blackstone's Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio) - on that page there's also a quote from Tirmidhi, one of the most notable collections of hadith.  

It's worth noting that there are two standards of punishment - hudud and ta'zir. Hudud are fixed by the Qur'an whereas ta'zir are discretionary and up to the judge/law of the land. It's generally accepted that ta'zir cannot exceed hudud, and in general will be less. So for example if there is significant evidence (i.e. enough for a panel of judges to pronounce a guilty verdict, for example DNA evidence) of adultery, but there are not four upstanding witnesses who witnessed the penetration, or there is no confession, then there will be no hudud (execution in this case) but there will be ta'zir, which may be as little as a fine or as much as lashes, depending on the country etc. So even though the burden of proof for hudud is extremely high, the burden for ta'zir can be lower. It's like how criminal cases are ""beyond reasonable doubt"" whereas civil cases are ""most likely"", so under English Common Law you can be found civilly liable for wrongful death while being not guilty for murder.",otah007,t2_c7cxd,17,0,reddit2

In a family in which oppression is present, the woman may very well have a bank account that she alone controls. This does not indicate the presence or an absence of control of one's wages, purely because the means of oppression that a spouse exerts are not, generally, purely legal in their nature.

Conversely, in a family in which oppression is NOT present, the woman may very well NOT have a bank account that she alone controls. In fact, [a great many families](https://phys.org/news/2019-02-joint-bank-accounts-happier-couples.html) only have joint bank accounts, and on average, such families are actually happier (therefore, presumably, less oppressive to one of the members).

So how come can families have joint bank accounts, and yet not exhibit spousal oppression? Well, it's because **one can control their own wages without having an individual bank account.** Therefore, to suggest that an individual bank account is necessary for one to control one's own ages, is invalid. And that's why I pointed out that you are looking for a wrong indicator: while obviously anyone should have an opportunity to open an individual bank account, simply not having one is **not** indicative of any amount of lack of control or improvement.

Women aren't going to do that for men, so men are going to have to stay working. Women will enter the workforce if they can because work creates opportunities for agency. Ergo, wages will fall because supply increases. 

The economics of the situation aren't complex, and not only do we have ourselves as examples we've actively applied the principle to Africa in 'care' programs with replicable results. There is no reason to believe that Saudi Arabia would have any different an outcome if the same principles were instituted.

The voluntary choices of men and women are there for all to see. What has happened with women entering the labour force and the suppressive effects on wages is there for all to see.

While the fires of religious wars ravaged Europe during the 30 Year War, Poland remained a safe haven where all religions were welcome. There was a reason we used to have the largest Jewish diaspora before WWII, and it was because while not completely free of persecution, they had it much better here than pretty much anywhere else in the world.
Even Black people were treated as people. There are records of several appearing at various courts (most often them being former slaves captured from Ottomans) and being treated like fellow human beings, being allowed to marry (White) women with little controversy.

I have not seen the thing you are referring to. However the value you live by is like a shortened version of why I live my life as if there is no afterlife. If I am right, I have lived a good life on Earth that has not been wasted, And I will have a good afterlife too. If I am wrong, But there is a god worth any worship whatsoever, Then it will understand my choices and I will have a good afterlife. If I am wrong, But am punished for the way I lived my life, Then there is no reason I would want to be around that god. And if I am wrong and there is no afterlife at all, Then I have not wasted my only chance at life. 

There are more situations where I get the raw deal by living a life which does not align with what I believe as moral. And if any god which disagreed with my morals existed, And had any shred of benevolence, I truly believe I would have some feeling somewhere in my gut that the way I am living my life is wrong. So either the only gods that exist agree with me, Do not interact whatsoever, Or there are no gods at all. I like my odds in this situation. 

I would also agree that organized religion is a problem. I believe that people should be able to have a faith determined entirely by their own experiences and conclusions. Some people will end up atheists. Others will believe there’s something out there. As long as neither interpretation is contradictory to evidence, They’re both equally valid in my book. 


If I were to classify myself, I would call myself an agnostic theist. And I truly believe that agnostic theist, And agnostic atheist are the only two intellectually honest positions to have. Unless we become higher dimensional beings to check, Or some god shows up to give us irrefutable proof, The only logical answer is to say that you don’t know, But you believe X. And I perfectly understand the other position. Some people need hard evidence to consider a position even if the position isn’t contradictory. I understand that my faith in this being reality has no validity to these people. All I ask is that people are intellectually honest enough to say they don’t know instead of asserting on position as absolute fact. 

All I can say with absolute certainty is that if you look into the older context of most major religions, You’ll find that they have been modified by men in power over millennia. And that the original forms of these religions closely match neighbouring religions. So *if* any religion were ever the true word of a god or gods, You would need to dig up the ancient roots of it. I can say with a high degree of confidence that the loss of monolatry in Judaism, The constant translation manipulation, Decanonization of books, And all these other factors means that no modern abrahamic religion is the original word of god. I can also say with a fairly high degree of certainty that if any religion has ever been true, We likely will never discover it again.

On a different note diversity of research is important, especially when addressing research inequality. The company 54gene is certainly helping to address this issue, but huge gaps remain in other populations, especially populations that are nomadic or with a justified fear of goverment/science.

One last question. What are your thoughts on nebula genomics business model? I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner. Although it is an 'anonymous' program genotype-phenotype relationships are important, companies may want more interaction with the owner of the DNA.

Especially now that trauma and the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on the brain is more deeply studied, studies on the impact of trauma (individual and intergenerational trauma) on genetic material could lend to ethical issues—especially in regards to ethnic minorities, but also other social minorities (LGBTQIA+ populations, identity-based victims of genocides, folks living in poverty, etc.).

How will we handle genetic information that could be perceived to predetermine the fates (medical, psychological, or otherwise) of these populations? How will we prevent further oppression based on genetic information? How will we empower folks who perceive trauma to negatively affect their genomic offspring (if that is indeed affirmed by science, which is yet to be seen though a growing number of people still believe it regardless)?

There is also the issue of gatekept technology. With accessible food and medicine increasingly being seen as a human right, it's unethical to create crops that require proprietary insecticides to survive.

Instead food is engineered to machine money from farmers and the public at the expense of flavor, nutrition, and frankly the ecosystem as a whole.

That's all tangential to the question you're asking, but it's an important illustration of what we need to prevent in the medical field. Industry wants profit. Health wants wellbeing.

We could end up in a world where gene therapies are engineered to addict us to proprietary medicines for the rest of our lives when they could be made to work the first time.

If a user password is compromised its something that be be disposed of and replaced, but that concept isnt possible with biometric data.  Due to this fact, biometric login data is typically encrypted at the device level so that the platform you authenticate against does not hold and can not get the bio-data.  The fact that companies like those that provide fast airport check-in aggregate biometric data is terrifying to me.

Using this idea that the genetic data is unable to be changed by the owner and has potentially catastrophic consequences if accessed by certain sources, you simply should not hold personally identifiable genetic data in a way you can access it.

Is the much bigger deal not the privately-held data of companies like 23andMe? 

Looking at this, the interesting angle is that you're not just losing control of your data. DNA is intrinsically shared between you, parents, grandparents, siblings, children and any kind of known or unknown half-siblings, cousins, etc. Holding vast amounts of DNA - and increasingly cheap DNA testing - are a recipe for privacy nightmares of all kinds where both good and bad actors can quickly identify anyone. Private and government DNA databases should be extremely limited, highly secure and access difficult - but in practice right now vast amounts of people give up their and all their distant and close relatives' identity, from looks to disease risks and medical issues up for nothing but a mostly-nonsensical 'ancestry' report.

I myself dont know much of genetics etc. But what I'm wondering is that if it's hypothetically possible to extract genetic data from new-borns or the fetusus, much like stem cells, to create a sort of, genetic baseline footprint of a person, and then using this data to possibly cure later-in-life gene mutations such as cancer?

That being said, perhaps leading from that, much further on in the future than we are today, we would be able to build a large enough genetic library to be able to pinpoint ""suspect"" genes and possibly screen the newly scanned genome of each newborn and do some quick quality-of-life edits.

I personally have no issue with other entities ""owning"" my genetic data. The ethical issue would come in as to how they use this data. Say they screen you as a possible psychopath. Do they then put you on a watchlist?; detain you to a more controlled area?; deny you rights to a passport or visa? I suspect that laws will have to be passed, pushed by the WHO, for each country to adopt a kind of ""patient-doctor confidentiality"" clause, where the ""doctor"" would be the genetic library orginisation.

The utopian outcome would be that genetic data be soley used for the screening, detection, and curing of health-related issues.
Dystopia? Governments using genetic data to coralle populations like sheep into groups like ""high-risk"" or ""high medical expenses"", furthering the divide humans are currently facing.

f2aw3ue,t3_dcqmq9,2019-10-03 16:01:39,science,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to have a discussion about this. I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the field of pharmaceutical sciences and am nearing the end of my graduate career. I am very grateful there are skilled minds such as yourselves who are also concerned with the growing industrialization of genetic data.

Over the past several years, I have had a growing concern for where our country is headed with regard to privacy of genetic information. As we move further into the technological age, information is becoming far more valuable than it's weight in gold. Specifically, issues with this first occurred with the monitoring, collection, and sale of private information (such as name, address, gender, age, etc...) as well as information about one's lifestyle and habits (browsing information online, search engine queries, online purchase, what shows you watch, your hobbies, etc..).

My main concern here is that computational and industrial advancements in the processing of genetic data have essentially brought it to the same playing field as these other types of personal data I just described. However as I'm sure you all know, genetic data is MUCH, MUCH more valuable, powerful, and *abusable* than just your name or hobbies. As we continue to gain more and more understanding of the functionality of our own genomes (i.e. can we tie genetic signatures to ethic origins? To sexual orientation? To personality?) While these may seem unlikely **now,** I think it's not at all unreasonable to think that we will be able to discern these traits and more in the upcoming decades. As such, this information may be some of the most valuable that any one entity could obtain. Within our capitalist democracy, private interests have shown that they have a LOT to gain by collecting, using/and or selling our personal data. Facebook was one of the first exposures of this gross misuse and collection of data. There was huge backlash, but ultimately I have not seen anywhere close to enough legislation to prevent this from continuing to happen. There are countless websites, browser extensions, even hardware that STILL will collect and sell your data ""technically"" with your permission by agreeing to their absurdly long privacy protection statements. Sometimes it feels like you need a law degree just to understand what you're agreeing to. The way things are going, will you need a law degree and an understanding of advanced genetics, too? Even now, I have to run a VPN, cookies deleting programs, script blockers, and Adblockers just to be able to SOMEWHAT avoid the information of my habits being processed and sold.

The only solution I have heard proposed to limiting the ability of private industries from collecting and using our data is through legislative processes. Creating laws to protect the consumer. While I know there are some in place, they seem to be flimsy and rather easy to subvert through these kinds of privacy statements that trick you into agreeing to something you probably wouldn't agree to if you knew what it truly was you were agreeing to. Furthermore, and what I see as ***the biggest issue*** is that it is no secret whatsoever that money speaks MUCH louder than the voices of the public. Let's acknowledge lobbying for what it truly is- bribery. Private interests have MUCH more influence over legislation that the populous within our capitalist society. As it has been shown over the past decade, these private interests can and will abuse and misuse your personal information for monetary gain. This becomes further exacerbated by the monopolization of the technological private sector. How many companies now are owned by Google, Amazon, or Facebook? These are MASSIVE and extremely wealthy entities that, as I have mentioned, have a LOT to gain from having your personal info.

Now when we step back and remember that genetic information is *exponentially* more powerful and dangerous when abused, I ask you this- **What is stopping private interests from monetarily influencing legislation that would protect our genetic data?????** I can only imagine how much money there is to gain by knowing the genetic makeup of your consumer. As i had mentioned, what if they knew through your genetic signature that you were predisposed to obesity, and thus sent customized adds to you for diet pills? Or the opposite, for new McDonalds deals? How about if they could tell your sexual preference, or your hereditary/ethnic backgrounds?

As I'm sure you are all aware, there is something very disturbing going on in parts of China where certain Muslims are having their genetic information forcibly collected and heavily monitored. Is this really that different functionally from how our private data is constantly being breached and sold? The digitization and industrialization of a people's faith or ethnicity can be a **very dangerous thing**, with one of the more early and horrific examples being the holocaust. Could you imagine what the Nazi regime would've done if today's genetic technology was available to them? What is there to stop similar bad actors from doing it now?

We are in an age of exponential scientific and technological advancement, and our sociopolitical environment is NOT equipped to act in the best interest of the American people no matter how I seem to look at it. I'm sorry for such a long question, but I feel as though as a scientific community we should have considered these possibilities and asked these questions at least two decades ago. And as such, 20 years form now, what questions regarding the industrialization of genetic information should we be addressing *now?*

Over the last almost 10 years I’ve had the opportunity to convene hundreds of people all over the US in small discussion groups to give feedback to researchers. The ultimate goal has been to help improve research projects and the likelihood of success however most of the discussions, at some point, have focused on privacy concerns. These concerns have been around the sharing of imaging and de-identified medical records, as well as, the collection of bio-specimens and genetic information.

Consistently, regardless of age, ethnicity or class, people have serious concerns about the potential negative impacts the collection and storage of this data presents. Top concerns have been 1) how insurance companies may be able to gain access and use information against patients i.e. pre-disposed for a health condition or 2) for more vulnerable and historically oppressed groups how this information could be used to hurt them or their family members. Could it be used to increase stigma or even used in criminal proceedings without due process? 

One of the most dynamic groups I facilitated was with teens who identified as transgender to give feedback to an international genetics research project. They were very vocal about how a study could be used to create policies or to support harmful stereotypes that would be damaging to their community.

f2biyw9,t3_dcqmq9,2019-10-03 18:24:16,science,"I was reading a book called Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari, and he talked about the potential of our genetic code to be used by doctors to tailor treatment. This raises a few questions for me: Does this mean that doctors/ hospitals are going to keep a profile of our genetics? If treatment tailored to your genetics does turn out to be substantially better, will insurance companies increase prices for those unwilling to share their genetic code? Could those insurance companies then sell our genetic code to advertising agencies, or keep a profile of us after we’ve stopped using their service? This is a serious issue I truly don’t think many people have considered. Facebook sells all our data to advertising companies and makes billions, and that’s just data from whatever we happen to click on when we use Facebook; imagine the monetary temptation to misuse the genetic profiles of two billion people (Facebooks active number of users). I see that a select minority of people stand to benefit from the buying and selling of genetic data, while the rest of us get put between a hammer and an anvil. Either we sell/give out our genetic code, which, in all probability will be used against us by one company or a another; Or we refuse, in which case life gets more and more difficult for us, as services begin to rely more and more on our genetics. As an example of this, imagine trying to buy car insurance in this new world of genetics. Already we have to give up a host of information about ourselves, anyone who has ever had to buy car insurance knows what I’m taking about. Imagine if in addition to that, it asked for your genetic code? All the predictions they will be able to make will be invaluable, so invaluable that they may simply deny your service altogether if you refuse to comply. Banks may do the same with loans and home mortgages, and while there may be a law against genetic discrimination in hiring, there is no such law (that I am aware of) for selecting students at university. I suppose if there’s a summary of my argument here it’s that our genetic code should never be something that is sold. It is not enough that my genetic code should belong to me by right, it should be a GUARANTEE that it cannot be used against me by anyone or anything.",Aramuis,t2_3pttxgpf,1,0,reddit3

Also because I have T-cell mediated hypersensitivity I underwent genetic testing before being prescribed psychological medications because so much of that is trial and error. 

We found out I was compatible with almost nothing and I had already ready had a reaction to 2/3 of what I was compatible with which is what prompted the doctor to test in the first place......but what struck me was how much information on dosage and compatibility was able to be gleaned on 5 families of medications with just a cheek swab and it made me wonder why we are doing trial and error at all?

The two united can greatly help inform and expand both. Genealogists need to see genetics as the first source of proof, and then records to further fill in names, dates, marriage, death, etc. Which obviously would save data analysis time if this information could be imputed in a complementary system. Like record archives, there needs to be the DNA version of that, and with it certain library type clearances, such as for personal family research. scientific research, or law enforcement.

f2accep,t1_f2a73ms,2019-10-03 14:06:04,science,"Hi, this is Bob Kain. This is a tough question to answer in a few paragraphs. MicroArrays, or arrays, typically assay, or interrogate, 700,000 predefined DNA bases in our genome. Each of us has over 6,000,000,000 bases in our genome, so the 700,000 bases does not represent a high percentage of our total genome. The 700,000  bases on a company's array are chosen based in part on the following 3 factors: a)Medically relevant, b) informative for ancestry purposes, or c) evenly distributed across the genome.

Some health conditions are caused by single base changes in a single position in our genome.  Changes in these locations have a *first order* impact on our health. These locations are very valuable for medical research. Some conditions are caused by specific combinations of two or three changes in single bases in our genome. On the other hand some conditions could be informed by tens or even hundreds of different base changes in our genome. The latter conditions would in most cases require full DNA sequencing.

This discussion is complicated even more by the fact that some changes in our genome impact only our predisposition to diseases or conditions. These impacts can be thought of as *second order* impacts.

You are also raising a great point about the value of arrays for minority populations. Array content can be chosen to provide value to all populations. The content can also be chosen to optimize value only for a sub population. Additionally if the genomic diversity of a minority populations is less well known...  the array design would be hindered by that lack of knowledge.

We still have much to learn about the contribution of our genome to our health. By some estimates our genome, on average, contributes about 30% to our health. Surprisingly, according to one study, health institutions contribute only 10%. *The remaining 60% is contributed by Social Determinants*, including the decisions we make, our habits, and our environment. Only through collecting of this Social Determinant data can we hope to understand the complex interactions of these different factors and accelerate our understanding of what causes disease and reduces our quality of life. Only then will we truly enable Personalized Medicine.",Bob_Kain,t2_4pt8wow2,42,0,reddit3

>What are your thoughts on nebula genomics business model? I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner.

I am also skeptical about what the demand *will* be, however as co-founder George Church mentions, medical data is worth 10x that of your credit cards on the black market. As such, it is less about the *identities* of the individuals, but rather simply the need to source real information to perform big data analytics on populations.

Of all the potential real-life (non-digitized) assets I see being cataloged on a blockchain, from real estate to supply management, I think genetic data is one of the best use cases after monetary and governance protocols.

Nonetheless, what do you mean regarding the data being used in a ""predatory manner"". That is the *point* of providing you with the private key to the encrypted genetic info. The data belongs to you, and you are free to approve your own sequence for research, and receive compensation directly rather than letting corporations cash in on your sequence.

Furthermore, what assurances are currently afforded by companies like Ancestry and 23&Me to not use your data? The plain and simple fact that they didn't secure your permission? That hasn't stopped Facebook for doing exactly that deliberately, or many other corporations that neglected to adequately secure confidential information and it was stolen.

This seems like something of a no-brainer IMHO. Give individuals the rights and ability to privately sequence their genome, and utilize their own discretion how that data is used. It isn't some paltry ""oath"" from a neglectful company.

Without defined policies and regulations in this area, there is also great potential to abuse the power of DNA to identify individuals and violate our right to privacy. 

On most consumer platforms you have the ability to either request that your data be deleted from the platform or to *""Opt-out""* of various uses of your data, such as law enforcement searches. The best method of preventing misuse is for everyone to take control of their DNA information by following these steps.

**You should expect and demand privacy,** though as you point out our privacy can be partially compromised by relatives making their DNA data public**.** **Everyone's right to control their DNA data should be respected and protected by law.**

Companies that steward and safeguard personal data should use the ""opt-out"" as the default, and then a person could ""opt-in"" to the ability to use data for criminal searches, for instance. Additionally on platforms like LunaDNA, *the link between a members personally identifiable information and their DNA information is encrypted and not accessible by third parties, such as law enforcement.*",Bob_Kain,t2_4pt8wow2,6,0,reddit3

People screen embryos for various legitimate and illegitimate reasons. For instance, the advent of affordable ultra-sounds enables massive abortion of female foetuses in South Asia. I don't think it was on anyone's mind that a medical technology aimed to benefit pregnancies can be grossly misused like that. 

Some screening programs do not operate by abortion at all. For example, Dor Yeshorim is one of the largest genetic screening programs that aims to assist ultra-orthodox Jews. People in this community will not abort pregnancies because it is against their faith. And the Rabbi that started the program has lost four kids to Tay-Sachs one after the other. So instead of offering pre-natal genetic test, the program focuses on pre-marriage tests. They screen young adults who are 18-20 years old. Now when these kids marry (usually via arranged marriages), they first call to the program to make sure that they can marry each other without the risk of a fatal condition in their future generation. The program has been a massive success and virtually eradicated Tay-Sachs from this population. Now since there are no abortions, genetic variations are not eliminated from the gene pool.But it only works with recessive conditions.",Yaniv-Erlich,t2_zh4729n,3,0,reddit3

I guess that this is a matter of a personal opinion. I think that this was an important and thoughtful study. In genetics, we study many traits, populations, and conditions, that historically have been subject to immense discrimination, hate, and threats. For example, many studies looked at the genetic origin of Ashkenazi Jews, a group that has been prosecuted for hundreds of years and was subject to one of the largest genocides in the history of humanity. So just because a phenotype is sensitive does not mean that it cannot be studied. In fact, maybe this is the best reason to study such phenotype, because as scientists, we can bring facts and reason into discussions that are normally shaped by misinformation, propaganda, and politics.

So while securing our data is critically important, sharing our data securely to improve our understanding is also critically important to us, our community, and future generations. 

Additionally while individual control of information is also important, trying to obtain consent every time a credible research desires to query our data, would result in consent fatigue, limiting studies, and slowing discovery. The right balance is to 1) allow broad consent for our data to be used in aggregated or populations level queries, while maintaining privacy, transparency and even value sharing, and 2) require specific informed consent when a study requires participation at the individual level.

Great question. 

In some ways ,the genetic capabilities already passed the horizon drawn by GATTACA. If you recall, the police cannot identify the DNA of Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) because he is not in their database. Today, with investigative genetic genealogy, the police would have no problem to identify him in a few days of work.

On the other hand, recent studies in genetics have shown how useless is genetic data to predict many types of traits compared to other types of data. For example, GATTACA has this amazing scene of predicting Vincent's birth where the doctor predicts that he will live to age of ~30 yrs based on his genetics. We know today that it is impossible to predict your life span from genetic data. Genetics explains only 5yrs on average of the differences in life span between individuals. And we know that genetic predictions can be modulated via environmental factors.

We all should care about keeping our date private both to protect ourselves and in the case of DNA data, to protect our relatives, our children, and our grandchildren.

Models that protect their privacy while also enabling research exist today, to make this all possible. 

Also, even though some people are not as concerned about privacy, another friction point relates to how fairly a person is being treated. Most studies show that 80% of people polled are willing to share data for health research. Many people however get upset or angry when they find that while they are being altruistic, the data aggregator is profiting disproportionately from their acts of kindness.

LunaDNA for instance offers individuals shares in the company that owns the data, in return for data contributions. The SEC qualified offering guarantees the protection of individual privacy and the sharing of commercial proceeds. Researchers bring questions to a informatics ""sandbox"", can form case and control cohorts, and can push out blinded request to cohort members to learn more about the research in the hopes that persons would consent to share personal data.

As we've seen from recent reports of crimes solved by analyzing crime scene DNA and comparing the results to public databases, it is possible to re-identify a person.

The solution to enabling contributed data to be used to further research is to: 1) allow approved research studies to access the aggregate data in a controlled environment. Researchers can ask questions of the data and receive answers. They do not have access to a person's data file. This level of research enables important correlations between disease conditions and genomic information to be identified, for instance, without compromising privacy. 2) provide a mechanism for researcher to request more information from an individual, without divulging the identify of the individual.

Unfortunately we have to take control to make this happen. I believe the laws to protect us are coming, but they do not exist today.

One needs to actively opt-out of data sharing when one provides a sample for consumer DNA analysis. Once the DNA information is made available a next step could be to download the results and delete the file on the consumer genomics site. At this point one could upload you information to third-party sites that provide ancestry information, while opting out of sharing. Once the desired information is returned its the DNA file could then be deleted.

There are also companies and websites that would store your DNA file while protecting your privacy.

This is a very good question. In the US, the Genetic Information discrimination Act  (GINA) prohibits insurance companies to use genetic data or family history for medical insurance underwriting. Also nearly all US employers cannot use genetic information for HR-related purposes. One GINA case was brought to court about four years ago and the employer had to pay a hefty fine ($2.1M) for misusing genetic information. 

Saying that, GINA does not protect using genetic information for life insurance or even auto insurance. 

However, there is a question of fairness.  If people with early onset deadly conditions (e.g. Huntington disease) will pay the same life insurance premiums like everyone, there is a concern that the insurance system will collapse and not be able to re-pay the claims.

I think each person is the expert with regard to themselves, about everything, and particularly sharing one's genetic information. So what should or should not be done, within reason and law, for the most part, should be the individual's decision.

As we know, most families with any sort of disease and the suffering that ensues, want genetic research to benefit them and their loved ones, and likely have little concerns about anything else.

We have about 45 advocacy and community groups who have used the platform to organize their community, give everyone a ""voice"" in the form of data, and my dear hope - allow the data to speak.

Sharing your data in a way that does not protect your privacy, will compromise the privacy of family members. Good point. If a person shared their data while protecting their own privacy, the protection would extend to family members. For instance at LunaDNA, a person's genomic or other personal data is never shared with others. Members control their own data.

While our genetic makeup is impacted in combination by those who came before us, and while it will impact our offspring, it is still ours to control. We should be the ones making conscious and informed decisions about how our personal data is used. 

Its important to point out that DNA data has already saved countless lives through an improved understanding of cancer as a disease of our genome, through the identification of variants that predispose us to disease, and through the development of targeted drug therapies. In San Diego the Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine treats sick babies, infants, and children with early onset diseases. By utilizing DNA sequencing Rady's  is able to diagnose the cause of the disease and recommend treatments. These children in many cases would not live past the age of 5 years old without Rady's efforts to sequence the children, interpret their genome, and take appropriate action.

The more we understand how our genome, microbiome, environment, and our daily decisions impact our health and quality of life the better for all. This understanding requires a lot of people to share detailed personal data.

Encryption can also be used by oppressive governments, not just the scary terrorists, and generally serves to protect the individual from the centralization of power, lump blockchain into there.
Again, benefits outweigh risks.

The wellness programs I have worked with are all done by 3rd party companies, and the patient is the only one who gets the results. The idea behind it is to get people involved in their healthcare early. 

For example; every insurance company would rather pay for you to be on cholesterol meds for YEARS, compared to paying for time in the ICU and/or open heart surgery when you have a massive heart attack due to uncontrolled high cholesterol. You are also statistically WAY more likely to make healthy lifestyle changes if you find out early that your cholesterol is slightly elevated, compared to finding out at 55 that you have blocked arteries.

gashrpv,t1_gasejuj,2020-11-01 13:37:06,science,"Construction is a complex beast. The smallest contractors are usually directly run by the owners, who operate on a slim profit margin that doesn't allow for extensive monitoring of employee health. Small nonunion contractors often don't even offer health insurance, and are completely dependant on retaining reliable, skilled employees. Skilled tradesmen are typically able to jump companies on a whim if they don't like the conditions, so if a guy refuses to wear a mask, he can drag if the boss tries to push the issue. Larger contractors that can actually afford complex monitoring systems involve a lot of overhead staff that don't directly deal with workers, and the decisions to implement policies to protect jobsites from infection are usually made by a nebulous ""management group,"" while the actual enforcement is left up to frontline management. Frontline management is 100% concerned with keeping costs down and productivity up, and a big part of that is crew morale. Creating friction with a crew over something that doesn't have anything to do with the actual work is a good way to kill the job.

The fab shop where I'm currently working is run by a fantastic, well-respected foreman who enforces company policy regarding facemasks and social distancing, and we have had zero issues.

Conversely, the project I was on previous to this was run by a GF who didn't care about masks, but was good at every other aspect of the job. The superintendent who was his boss wasn't willing to sacrifice an essential member of the project over the mask issue. The foreman that I reported to was supplementary to the job, meaning he wasn't a regular employee, and thusly didn't have a close relationship with the guys on my crew. This position is often tenuous already, and to be the sole voice in favor of an already unpopular corporate policy just isn't going to happen.

And yes I wear glasses and know how bad it sucks but I've got a few tricks to keep from fogging up. My state is on the edge of nixing indoor dining and possibly going back to essential only. 

Because a bunch of grown ass adults can't follow a few simple rules because protecting others and to a degree yourself is apparently beyond their capacity to reach conclusions.

I was just reading how it's hard for them to test exactly how large a viral load you need to have before you get it because its unethical to do tests on humans. Giving them more and more Covid until they get sick.

How about everyone who had a mild case and everyone who refuses to wear a mask get to be the test for all sorts of covid stuff.

In demolition, it's in every building built before the 1970's. 

Fun fact: India still uses asbestos in almost everything with no safety precautions. They import a lot of it from Cananda. The US no longer exports it due to the difficulty to safely mine it. (Asbestos is a mineral).

Edit: as you work constriction you will really only encounter it in older buildings. It can be found in insulation, paneling, floor tiles, ceilings, it was a ""miracle mineral"" and put into just about everything back in the day.

Your dues increased because your working dues are a (very small) percentage of your hourly rate. You knew that this was the case. All trade union locals have work agreements that are negotiated with the union contractors and signed by every member of the local. Also what contractor pays you for getting laid off? I could go work anywhere in the us or Canada for a union electrical contractor and it works the same no matter where I go. The day you get laid off they pay you for the remaining amount owed to you for the hours you've worked, shake your hand and say ""thanks for your help."" This has been the case for every other trade I've witnessed for the past 15 years.

Again with the working agreement, this drunk operator you're talking about would get thrown off the job because these documents all have an anti drug policy. So do the job sites. So does every company safety policy. What are you talking about????

gat38da,t1_garsyhv,2020-11-01 17:08:17,science,"I wear my glasses during all waking hours of my day, am accustomed to wearing safety glasses (albeit not with masks, but normal glasses conflict with the nosepiece of the mask in similar fashions), and I just use a normal kn/95 mask. Only adjustment to speak of is the metal nosepiece in between the layers of “fabric”.

What I’ve discovered is that the digging of my glasses is less an issue with the a particular mask, and more with how I’m WEARING the mask. Any air that is coming up past my nose into my glasses isn’t being filtered by the mask’s filtering medium, but rather, is escaping between my cheeks and the mask on either side of my nose, and fogging up my glasses in that way. Learning how to better fiddle with the metal nosepiece has helped me cut down entirely on the fogging in my glasses.

I don’t have any good resources on how to learn to do it properly, because I just kinda fiddled with it and it worked one day, because I realized that any escaping air wasn’t being filtered, and that these masks wouldn’t be so popular if they didn’t properly filter air on exhales as well, so I realized that the fogging must be a fit issue, rather than just an unfortunate consequence of wearing a mask.

Hopefully somebody else in the comments somewhere can provide a good link to somewhere to learn how to fiddle with the nosepiece and such well to help prevent these issues.

But when my nosepiece is correctly adjusted, literally no air escapes out the top of my mask. I’m in a warm climate right now (unfortunately), so I don’t have to worry about getting fogging from the exhales if they go through the mask, but the solution to that in a cold climate would be to never breathe looking straight down, or at anything that reflects the exhale back at your face. Which honestly, isn’t so much caused by masks as it is just a reality of wearing glasses in cold temperatures.

Now, why I say that better masks may help is because in an extremely active field like say, construction, it may be very tedious to keep adjusting that very thin strip of metal to keep a good seal every time you accidentally bump it, but a more expensive mask would eliminate that issue entirely by say, having a hard material holding the shape for the seal, and a replaceable medium to filter the air like a reusable grinding mask or something.

IMO, the employer should be responsible for either A.) accepting that their employees will have to work more slowly to keep adjusting their lower quality masks to allow them to continue to work safely, or, if that’s unacceptable, to B.) Provide higher quality masks so they can work at their previous speeds without having to compromise their safety on the tool handling, situational awareness, or breathing protection fronts. If your mask or your safety glasses do not allow for adequate safety measures to be taken in any way, the employer should be responsible for providing a safe way to account for that.",crimsonblod,t2_54s2p,1,0,reddit4

Think of the next scenarios, when you look at a resume, yo are comparing it to, in your mind, the ""ideal"" candidate. The biases that come here are mostly because we attach aspects to this character that are not related to what makes them ideal. So maybe we're more interested in a character that has an internship related to the subject, than a character that has a bunch of practical part-time and full-time experience since they're 16. Even though it turns out, when you think about it, that most of what these professional experiences matter is in bridging the gap between ""knowing how to do something"" and ""knowing how to do something in a professional environment"". The person with more experience in work in general may have a better understanding and ""work ethic"" (whatever that means) to be a more productive person. The guy who had the 1 internship was a limited experience, with the idea of working only for 3 months and people around them making time to help and hand-hold them. The guy with less specialized experience may have more useful experience though. But the thing is we don't realize that our ideal the person has good theoretical and professional experience. We don't choose who is a better ideal, but simply who look more as what we expect.

But when you realize someone breaks your assumptions in a way that you know can be problematic, you stop and think and reconsider. You challenge your ideal expectation and test it to make more sense. You may realize that someone who is Black, or comes from a foreign school, will not have the connections, or path to get to this position that you'd expect, and are more open to consider them and try to objectively see what is their skill. Doesn't solve the problem, but who knows if censoring does as well, most companies will not admit to that, and the few that have shown results, it hasn't been that promising.

What I find interesting, and would want to know more about, is if there's any correlation between policies and work population to a company's having a preference for a certain gender in their applicants.

You're reading it wrong also your statement could use some more clarification because ""insignificant"" could be taken in the insignificant ""effect size"" type of way or the hypothesis is insignificant. 

 
A) If you are meaning ""insignificant effect size"". You are basically making assumption that its a point estimate not a distribution. The reality is there is going to be firms with much higher effects and some which don't discriminate. 

B) 2.1 % can be huge if the baseline rate is small. If the baseline rate is 10% that is still a bit bigger than a 20% difference

In Quebec they would heavily favor French dialects, names, backgrounds for instance.

One of the small studies sent out resumes and found that people with ""ethnic' names were actually MORE likely to be hired/called in for interview in the US. I forget offhand which places in the US this covered.

&#x200B;

Another small study concluded that people of certain ethnicities were more likely to be hired in certain sectors. Such as Indian backgrounds for IT. Ironically, in Pakistan this is the opposite.

There is no revelation here. People like to be around others of similar backgrounds and like to hire people they feel comfortable can do the job. Going the other way is seen as tokenism.

&#x200B;

People have bias and that bias can go both ways. I am currently working for a company that VERY strongly likes to hire women and people of color. There are 2 men on my entire team of about 30. well over half of management are women and people of color which is a stark contrast to the demographic of the country.

The way to interpret it is, if black sounding name sends 100 applications, they get 20 responses. If a white sounding name sends 100 applications, they get 22 responses.

This is assuming the black and white applicant are identical in all other respects. This is really just a thought experiment because no two applicants are ever identical in all respects, and the differences between them (other than name) will almost certainly far outweigh the black / white sounding of their name.

This is not a bad state of things. Black sounding name applicants are not receiving responses at a such a lower rate that it would prevent someone from actually getting a job. It's not ideal, but it is by no means indicating that having a black sounding name is a meaningful liability in America (I'm black btw).

ic0grcj,t1_ic0dqhd,2022-06-11 20:32:31,science,"If Jon Stewart era Daily Show is an example of ""forced diversity"" then it certainly makes a good case for it. That show was incredibly successful and well written.

Regardless, you're engaging in a false dichotomy. Seeking out diversity and hiring on the basis of ability and work history are not mutually exclusive. Often times jobs (especially jobs in the entertainment business, which is very competitive) will have a number of highly qualified candidates who represent a variety of backgrounds. The science shows that in cases when choosing between candidates with equal ability and work history, bias will often lead to White candidates being hired over Black ones. Trying to create a diverse workforce in many cases simply means giving a tiebreaker to diverse candidates. 

Furthermore, one can convincingly argue that diversity in itself has inherent value, especially in jobs that are trying to shape a product for the widest possible appeal. If your team already has several members that are all from largely similar backgrounds and experiences, a team member who has perhaps worse ""ability"" or less extensive ""work history"" but has a very different background/perspective to the rest of the team may add more value to that team than simply adding another member with the same background that you already have. As long as all members of the team meet a certain threshold of ability, a team with a variety of backgrounds will be likely to generate a wider range of ideas and solutions than a team with homogeneous backgrounds. 

I'd argue that this same argument could mean giving favor to a White candidate in certain situations. If you are trying to write a show that appeals to a broad audience and your writing team has no White members on it, then there's probably added value in hiring a White person to the team. This situation is pretty rare though as generally Whites are well represented already so it would be very unusual to see a team that doesn't have any White representation. Meanwhile it's very common to see teams that don't have minority voices on them, hence why there is much more often added value to be had in hiring those voices.",swarmofseals,t2_h7a3g,38,0,reddit1

One explanation for adverse treatment is that one individual discriminates against another based on a racial cue(s) under the false notion that racial differences signal personal differences (in qualification, temperament, interest, personality etc).  

However, the explanation offered here is that individuals of different races actually ARE different in some way that manifests on a resume and that screeners have unconsciously (or consciously) both guessed the race of the applicant AND unconsciously (or perhaps consciously) discriminated against them.  That's quite a modification of the idea of ""unconscious bias"".

Again, it's personal bias. Bias doesn't have be negative. If I read something and I connect with it and not with something else I read, that's my personal bias. If I consistently do that and, without consciously trying, I select authors that look similar, have similar backgrounds, and are my generational cohort, that's not implicitly bad. That's my personal bias working it's way through my decision making process. It becomes implicitly bad when that's the selection process for hiring.

I don't agree with that equivocation.  Not all discrimination that results in a gender imbalance is gender discrimination.  

I think this is sort of an epistemological problem.  If a hiring manager associates a certain font with women, and women with poor performance and then discriminates against a certain kind of font on resumes...that would be ""gender"" discrimination of the type we are trying to describe.  However if a hiring manager just detests a certain kind of font and it can be demonstrated statistically that women are 1.9X more likely to use it.....it will appear that gender discrimination is occurring at that firm instead of merely incompetent talent evaluation.

The argument was made that firemen needed to be strong enough to carry heavy equipment (and sometimes people) up and/or down ladders and the height requirement was needed to ensure the strength. While height and strength are correlated, it is far from 1.0 and so, the rule needed to be changed to : able to carry X lbs (I think 50, up and down a ladder.)

I don't think we disagree.  The question is (i) whether the discrimination occurs on the basis of race and (ii) if that basis is practically irrelevant AND there is a statistically significant disparate impact AND the magnitude is sufficient for the court and CAUSED BY the the irrelevant policy then that policy MAY BE illegality.

The bar is simply not that low for proving illegal disparate impact.  

No impact would be illegal until/if it actually occurred.  I'm pretty certain that the advertisement itself for some putatively gendered quality would not be illegal.  If some other check in the system (like an oppositely gendered requirement) that prevents the impact from manifesting then theres no case.  Also, single hirings seem not to qualify.  There needs to be statistically demonstrable impact across multiple groups and multiple events.

If you can cite a case, go for it.  I'm quite sure I could post an add for a ""an assertive, aggressive negotiator"" and that would NOT be illegal disparate impact even 3/4 of the agents I hired were men.

Its hard to imagine any job description that didn't include ANY qualities which could be differentially correlated to gender (punctuality, politeness, ambitiousness, conscientiousness, creativity etc).

Edit:  From what I understand, the magnitude of the impact would have to be very great (and causation unquestionable) such that the government has an interest in stepping in...or there would have to be some evidence that the requirement was actually an intentional ""proxy"" for discrimination against a protected class.

This is all a triple-edged sword because to show causation of disparate impact one has to admit real-word differences between groups (gender, race or whatever).  And implicit in that admission is the idea that those real world differences might have their own impact on performance however that is measured (profit, owner satisfaction, customer satisfaction, some combination....)

None of that contradicts the point I was making, which has to do with the ability of hiring manager to intuit the race of individuals from resumes with personal information (or at least name and race) REDACTED.

In what way were the the CVs racialized?  Since these were invented CVs...how was that racialization validated?  In other words how did she ensure those CVs were representative of actual people with racial identities?

I have access to most academic journals...so if any dataset resembling what I'm looking for is available I will be happy to look at it.  

The assertion I am challenging is that racial information is secretly encoded in resumes despite the efforts of hiring managers (at the Daily Show specifically) to anonymize them by removing names and some demographic data.  Its sloppy reasoning however you look at it to attempt to remove racial information from resumes...fail to achieve equity...and then conclude that the reason is that hidden information MUST remain that you failed to redact.  I mean - If the Daily Show is so good at diagnosing information which leads their managers to exercise racial bias....then why didn't they (and what was that information?)?

I am aware of the link between negative life outcomes and race...that's something that can be studied quite easily public records etc without experimenting on a human subject.

It's worth noting here that the traffic death rate for non-Hispanic black Americans increased by 59% between 2012 and 2020 (11.6 per 100k and 18.4, respectively), while traffic death rates for non-Hispanic white Americans stayed virtually flat over the same period of time (12.6 to 12.8).

jllfzoo,t1_jlkv8uc,2023-05-25 18:11:43,science,"Which leads to three other questions:

Were sheriff deputies included in the count of police officers? (Unlike police officers, deputies can be fired or demoted for political affiliation.)

How many officers are included who are command staff? (Command staff serve at the discretion of the chief elect official in most cities and can be demoted for any reason. While political activity is technically protected, it is difficult to prove.) It should be a low percentage, but is a factor.

How does this change if you specifically look at police officers who are cross-registered in a different party from their chief elected official or department head?

While political activity and affiliation are protected, public employees frequently register the same party as their chief elected officials, especially in a closed primary state like Florida. It both provides extra protection for that employee from difficult to prove illegal discrimination and also gives a stronger say in who they report to in areas that are heavily one party or another where the primary becomes the de factor general election. This is even more true when the employee is not a merit employee (though most police officers are merit while command staff are not).

Edit:

I see that this was specifically highway patrol troopers and not officers nor deputies. So that means there are no cross-registered republican troopers, as Florida only had Republican governors during this time. It is not clear to me at what level in state highway patrol that employees serve at discretion versus being purely merit based promotion.

But this also goes heavily back to the closed primary issue, where you would expect over-registration as Republicans.

I also noticed that the abstract states they only looked at the measure of propensity to search (without differentiating between search subsequent to arrest, consent search, or search on probable cause). There are several measures of racial disparity in traffic stop, and normally rates of stops, rather than search rates, are the primary measure used because search rates can be heavily influenced by FTA warrants whereas stop rate is more subject to the discretion (and presumably racist tendencies) of individual troopers.",marigolds6,t2_dm4gr,22,0,reddit2

No, they didn't.  Southerners started voting for Republican \*presidents\* in the 1980s and 1990s.  But they didn't start voting for Republicans in other offices -- Congress, governors, and state legislatures -- until later, usually much later.

Alabama's state Senate and House were majority Democrat until 2011.

Arkansas until 2013.  And its federal Senate and House were Democrat until 2010.

Georgia until 2003 for the governor and state Senate, and 2005 for the state House.

Louisiana until 2011.

Mississippi until 2011.

North Carolina until 2011.

West Virginia's state governor was Democrat until 2017, its state Senate and House were majority Democrat until 2015, and its federal Senate was completely Democrat until 2015 (and its now split between a Democrat and Republican).

I could go on, but it's mostly the same throughout the South with only minor variations.

For pete's sake, Republicans first won a majority in the federal House and Senate in 1995.  And at that point, the South was pretty far from a monolith.  In 1995, 9 out of 22 Senators and 58 out of 125 House members from old Confederate states were Democrats.",mattymillhouse,t2_8619d,5,0,reddit2

No; they don’t.

PoC and progressive enclave communities (EG:  inner cities, black small towns, colleges and universities) stated voting reliably Democrat long before that full Dixiecrat switch.  

Additionally, many of the Dixiecrat systems which were legacy of the Jim Crow era, gave the party a lasting structural advantage that didn’t fully dissolve until the late 90s or mid 2000s in most of the south.   

Those combined issues + the fact that actually a ton of incumbents **did** serve for 50+ years, explain Democrats holding onto some level of control much longer in many red states than they would have.  

On top of that, you have a ton of incumbent dynasties.  That issue is still going on (EG: the current Kentucky Governor).  The big driver “ending” those regional dynasties wasn’t even that they lost power, rather that most of the children / grandchildren / great grandchildren of Dixiecrats eventually switched parties to better maximize their federal ambitions.",BEETLEJUICEME,t2_1ymfrxh,3,0,reddit2

Ugh.  I was trying to avoid this.  But if you're not going to look at the elections and arrive at your own conclusion, then ok.

You brought up Kentucky.  So let's look at that state.

In 1971, Kentucky had 2 *Republican* Senators.  In 1972, one of those Republicans retired, and Kentucky elected a *Democratic* Senator (Walter Dee Huddleston).  So at a time when they were supposedly just waiting for incumbent Democrats to retire so they could vote for Republicans in free elections, they rejected the Republican and elected a Democrat.  

The other *Republican* Senator was up for re-election in 1974.  And he lost re-election to the Democrat (Wendell Ford).  So, again, not only did they reject the Republican, they rejected the Republican incumbent.  

Well, surely those two Democrats were just re-elected until they retired, right?  Nope.  In 1984, Huddleston lost an election to some guy named Mitch McConnell.  

And what about governor?  Literally zero Kentucky governors served for 50 years.  In fact, a new governor was elected every 4 years.  Because Kentucky had term limits on governors.  So literally zero Democratic incumbents were winning those elections.  And yet, like clockwork, [a new Democratic governor was elected every 4 years from 1974 to 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Kentucky).  At that point, a Republican won.  And then a *Democrat* won and served for the next 8 years.  And then a Republican won.  And then another *Democrat* won. 

Again, I'm not going to go back through every Congressional and state house election for all the Southern states.  But your theory -- while intellectually appealing if you want to ascribe to the idea of a party switch (that took 50 years, and involved Southern voters being so mad at their representatives voting for Civil Rights that they kept re-electing those same representatives for 50 years, which doesn't make any logical sense) -- doesn't match the data.

Speaking of incumbents serving for 50 years:

>Those combined issues + the fact that actually a ton of incumbents did serve for 50+ years, explain Democrats holding onto some level of control much longer in many red states than they would have.

In the entire nation's history, do you know how many members of Congress have served for at least 50 years?  

[4](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Seniority/40-Years/).  Only one of them was from the South.  And that guy started serving in 1914 and stopped in 1964.  

Which is exactly the time when, according to your theory, Southerners should have voted in a Republican in a free election.  But they didn't.  

Instead, Georgia elected John Flynt, a Democrat, to fill Vinson's seat.  And Flynt served in that seat until 1974.  At which point he retired, right?

Nope.  In a very close race, he lost to some guy named Newt Gingrich.  

This is the problem with coming up with theories to explain politics without looking at the data.  It might make good sense to you logically, but if it doesn't match the data, it's worthless.

Hmmm.  What else happened during those years?  Oh, right, black people across the state got the right to vote.  And what was his winning vote total?  Under 51%.  Who was his opponent?   An unpopular moderate Republican Governor who had raised taxes and who was endorsed by the previous two-time *Democratic Party* governor Happy Chandler **explicitly because of racial segregation issues**.  

In 1974, during the height of watergate, Kentucky again elected a Democrat.  But that also had to do with

-	depressed Republican turnout because of the national events
-	a rejection of the **moderate** Republican incumbent who had been appointed but not elected to that seat (not a traditional incumbency)
-	a Democratic “challenger” with all the trappings of incumbency, having been a statewide leader for a decade and the sitting Governor.  Ford would go on to serve in that seat until 1999, which was exactly my original point about how the power of incumbency allowed Democrats to maintain a hold in the south even long after the party switch began

I literally studied this in college academically, and then moved to North Carolina where I worked in electoral poltiics for nearly a decade.

I wasn’t writing off the cuff or making stuff up to fit a pet theory.  I was writing from an area of specialized knowledge.

There are dozens of excellent academic books on this topic, and plenty of decent ones written for a lay audience.  I’d be happy to recommend some to you!  

You clearly know a lot about southern politics, and much of it is even factual!  But you have wildly missed the thread on how and why political voting trends changed. 

Studying the partisan politics of the panhandle, the original topic of this thread, is very instructional.  Broadly speaking, people only very rarely change their partisan identification or voting behavior after their early 20s.  

The shift of white voters away from the Democratic Party in the south and to the GOP was like turning an ocean liner.  It didn’t happen overnight, and it lead to many many individual election results that can be cherry picked to look anomalous.  

It involved not just the switch of conservative Democrats to being conservative Republicans, but also the slow excommunication of moderate Republicans for their party.  Many times the Republican on the ballot in the 70s or 80s was, in many ways, still to the left of the Democrat running.   

Moreover looking at *who won XYZ election* is a truly terrible way to do political demography.  To understand the shifts, you have to look at the changes of vote totals over time, changes of party registration over time, and break both of those categories further down by demographic data including urban/rural, gender, race, educational level, emigration, and age.  

You also have to keep a close eye on local / state / federal, and on broader turnout numbers which fluctuated wildly between elections in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  Incumbency, regional power structures, and even changes to voting laws also played big roles in how the changes evolved at different speeds in different states.   

Democrats managed to control the Supreme Court of North Carolina unto *just this year*, but that’s not because conservative NC white voters didn’t switch from D to R over the previous 5 decades.  It’s because, among other factors:

-	black voters consolidated their Democratic coalition
-	Hispanic voters increased dramatically
-	huge numbers of highly educated white progressive voters moved in from other states
-	Democrats had gerrymandered the state when they were in control, and set up myriad systems to protect that advantage
-	powerful financial interests in the state were slow to fully switch which party they supported

But North Carolina is still the state which sent Jessie fracking Helms to the Senate for five terms.  

Helms, notably, was the son of a powerful local Dixiecrat politician. He started his political career in 1950 as an operative in Democratic Party, working for a Dixiecrat against a progressive, creating an ad campaign that literally said “Wake Up, White People.”  

Helms was a prominent Democrat for over twenty years, including as a powerful elected official elected with a “D” next to his name and the support of the Democratic state party.

But, in the early 1970s, the party was no longer willing to support such a racist.  In the previous presidential election, MLK (before his assassination) actively explored the possibility of running *as a Democrat*.  That’s right, briefly, MLK and one of the men who filibustered against the creation of MLK Day, shared the same political party.  

By 1972, Helms had left the party and was running for Senate as a Republican.  Many racist white North Carolina Democrats followed him in that switch.  It wasn’t subtle. Helms *explicitly* ran ads encouraging white Democrats to leave the party and reject the civil rights movement.  

But North Carolina is *also* the state which voted for Obama in 2008, only five years after Helms retired.  And it’s the state that nearly elected a black progressive Democrat (Harvey Gantt) to the Senate in races that Helms won by only ~5%.

This dichotomy was in many ways related to the fact that black voters had been systemically disenfranchised prior to Helm’s career (a practice he supported!).

I wonder if this is a good kind of safety inspection or if it is a money kind of inspection. companies tend to have health insurance and paid medical leave, and or law suits in mind, so improving safety will save the company money. Most inspections tend to be done by annalists attempting to save money, so I will hold a pessimistic position.

I love the actual work unions do. My feeling is that should extend to all workers; this extra layer is wasteful - the government should be doing their job in the first place, and protecting workers.

Safety inspections are good things. They let you keep good workers longer, because they're safe and happy. This leads to long-term, steady, stable profits for the company. Again, this is why I do not understand this push from companies to strip power from their people; it damns you long-term and makes you horrible at the thing you're trying to make money at.

Is a short term gain of, hell let's go crazy and say $1,000,000 worth letting go of profits over a decade that climb year after year, along with good will from your employees and customers? Surely saying ""we made $50,000 this quarter, and have for every quarter for the past decade"" ($2,000,000 gains) looks better?

g45kbz4,t3_in17a3,2020-09-05 19:06:21,science,"As much as people are vociferously supporting unions in general these days, it’s interesting that police unions  are so unpopular even though it is groups of workers in a dangerous profession that collectively bargain for  better treatment, better pay, and safer working conditions and legal protection.

I absolutely agree there is a moral hazard to allowing police forces to unionize, so here is my question to the many people asking for both the abolition of police unions AND the expansion of other unions:

Which industries should not have unions?  Which workers do not deserve equal opportunity to collectively bargain for better treatment?  What are the criteria for deciding whether people are allowed to strike in the name of worker safety and compensation?

If we want to bring back unions for many industries, we need to nail down this criteria well ahead of time and get it in the law.

I personally pray for a world where people are paid living wages for any job and the hours of their lives are treated as the precious resource they are, and that industry and technology are used to facilitate a life of love and peace and plenty for every human, but unfortunately that’s not the world we live in.

The love of money is the root of all evil.

mmm now I don't personally use the hertiage foundation as the best ""indicator of economic freedom"" frankly I find the ""libertarian"" version of economic freedom to be unsustainable, unrealistic and pretty problematic. But I do also think your analysis is just wrong here too... China and Vietnam follow Marxist-Leninist ideals and forms of government.. They are objectively closer to socialism than Brazil could ever be.. Countries like Vietnam and China have massive state run trade unions which are the only ones legally allowed to exist with unionization rates as high as 90% in these countries.. Brazil has really only recently been run by moderates and social democrats, except for their current fascist president though... but thats another conversation.  I'd just make the case that countries like Vietnam and China look to protect their workers a lot more than Brazil has and currently does.

Conversely you have the opposite problem in fields that people set their personal identity to. When you set your personal view of yourself based on doing a specific job you become incentivized to find more of whatever makes you the “hero.”  This is (one of the main reasons) why you will see firemen become arsonists and similar situations.

In my experience doing something very similar, most of it is logistical convenience. The goal is to inspect as many places as you can as safely as you can with the resources and manpower you have.

Federal orgs have a very different system compared to state and local regulators. 

Unless something is requested (usually due to an injury or violation report) inspectors generally have a set area to do with that changing on a day to day basis. 

A place in the city is certainly going to see more inspections than a place in the middle of nowhere. I had a few encounters with city health inspectors, but never federal. 

Sure those routes are calculated so that a place doesn't go inspected for years, but it's far more likely a place in a city will see an extra inspection or two compared to a place three hours away from anywhere else simply because it's inaccessible.

Not to mention backlog regarding new regulations, complaints and accidents that tends to push scheduling further down the road.

Really there aren't anything close to enough people actually doing inspections to ensure regulations are tightly followed, and the fines for breaking regulations are so insignificant it's cheaper to just shrug instead of redoing production, especially since it's going to take months to get someone back out there.",DigDux,t2_dm2k5,0,0,reddit3

Yes. It's one less thing to worry about. A union rep bargaining on behalf of you and 99 other workers has 100 time the bargaining power of you trying to bargain with your boss on your own.

The FBI stated it found no evidence of ""enemy hunting"" of the kind that had been suspected, but that the investigation did reveal the IRS to be a mismanaged bureaucracy enforcing rules that IRS personnel did not fully understand. The officials indicated, however, that the investigation is continuing.[162][163][164][165]
DOJ investigation

>In October 2015, the Justice Department notified Congress that there would be no charges against the former IRS official Lois Lerner or against anyone else in the IRS. The investigation found no evidence of illegal activity or the partisan targeting of political groups and found that no IRS official attempted to obstruct justice. The DOJ investigation did find evidence of mismanagement and Lerner's poor judgement in using her IRS account for personal messages but said ""...poor management is not a crime.""[164][166][167] In September 2017, the DOJ declined a request from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means to reopen the investigation into Lerner's IRS activities.[168][169]

Perhaps that's the disconnect with your other comment. Indeed, some other countries have free medical care, support for the elderly, safe working conditions, 40-hour workweeks, the right to lunch breaks, and protections against unjust firings written into the law. Perhaps in some countries, these rights were won without unions needing to fight -- literally fight to the death under gunfire -- for them, and perhaps those rights never come under attack now. In America, that's not the case.

In America, health insurance is still predominantly provided by employers. Retirement savings are mostly the responsibility of individuals. Demanding safe working conditions can get you fired for ""unrelated reasons"" if the company suspects you're the snitch, because it's totally legal to be fired for wearing a blue shirt even if there's no rule against wearing blue. 40-hour workweeks and lunch breaks are courtesies employers provide, not anything protected by law in many states.

For discussions of American unions, the fact that other countries have universal healthcare paid out of taxes is irrelevant. If other countries have guaranteed lunch breaks, that's irrelevant. If other countries have protections against being fired because you turned 29 and your employer hates prime numbers, that's irrelevant when the conversation is about American unions.

And having worked in both union and non-union jobs, the non-union companies were way more lax with worker's rights, and nobody was willing to report them because they would be fired if they did. 

Unions also do a lot of education and support for members that the government doesn't provide.

A union can't guarantee you anything else without negotiation, and that comes with strikes. In my experience as a worker, nothing matters but your seniority when push comes to shove, so all the brotherhood talk doesn't mean anything when it's my job vs another lazy jerk who just happens to be there a day longer than me. It's about blame blame blame, here's my dues. I was stuck covering for guys who couldn't be bothered to come in 5 days out of the week, then getting mandated for OT to boot. ""Don't work so hard, you make the other guys look bad"" I was told on my first day. Like how can I be stunting on you having zero experience and you're a ten year vet? So I get promoted, then educated (which the company paid half for, even through I'm not covered by a collective agreement anymore) and I am now trying to make the workplace safe for these guys and it's insane the pushback and hostility. So now I'm working for a non union places. Wages are still comparable, and benefits are the same. Total shift in workplace feeling. There's still cynical workers, but it's not made worse I find by an attitude collectively putting a line between ""us and them"". 

There's definitely workplaces that need to have issues addressed, and a workers committee can be formed without big union. I still feel stock and share ownership gives workers a stronger bargaining posture, and the right to refuse gives them power to halt anything truely unsafe.

They usually don't need to strike to get a fairer deal. As to your complaints about your co-workers, that is more of a workplace culture issue than a union problem. My experience has been exactly the opposite. 

As far as workplace education and enforcement,  leaving it up to the provincial government has two major flaws. 

First, unions make that information more accessible, especially for new Canadians and workers with less education. Many workers either do not know where to go to learn about their rights, or they do not understand what they're reading. A good member rep and/or shop steward should be able to explain that information. They can also assist in the process of reporting a violation, which can be a difficult process for a lot of workers. Many stewards I know actively search for violations that the worker wasn't going to report (usually out of fear of repercussions). 

Secondly, many of our provincial governments are slowly and deliberately eroding worker's rights. Alberta, for example, recently made it legal to hire 12 year olds to work in restaurants (at a lower minimum wage), and just passed legislation essentially making it legal to not pay tradesmen overtime. Saskatchewan no longer requires companies to send in OHS reports. Unions are necessary to protect these rights, and most are working to expand them. 

Are unions a perfect solution? No, but they are still necessary for a lot of workers. A worker's committee would maybe be able to address some safety issues (although in my experience working on one, all we accomplished was pointing out issues for management to ignore). And right to refuse only lasts as far as the guy who is willing to do whatever management says, because he either can't lose the job or doesn't know any better.",taronosaru,t2_tky7q,1,0,reddit3

In this case, running a regression of overdose/suicide mortality on union density might not tell you what would happen if you actually increased union density. There could be other factors that affect overdose/suicide mortality which are correlated with union density. Labor unions could decrease deaths of despair, but it might not -- I'm not sure this article is conclusive.

For another example, if you run a regression of crime rates on police per capita, you might find a positive relationship between the two. That's probably not because more police causes more crime, but rather that areas with more crime want larger police forces.

If these other factors are observable, you can just control for them. The trouble comes when they are not observable, or when there are issues of reverse causality (probably less of an issue in this case because they use prior years' union density on the following year's mortality, but this could still be a problem if these trends move slowly). From what I can tell (I can't access the full paper but I can get the appendix), the paper does control for unemployment, GDP, and mean wages, but these factors still might not capture other things which may affect both unionization density and deaths from despair.

There are many ways to try to isolate the treatment effect. We can find something that affects union density but otherwise doesn't affect overdose/suicide mortality (an instrumental variable). An example for police and crime may be mayoral elections (IIRC from Freakonomics): mayoral elections should have no effect on crime, but ""tough on crime"" mayors have separate reasons to boost police forces during elections. You can then estimate the effect of mayoral elections on crime to back out the treatment effect of increasing police on crime.

Alternatively, you can match areas that are very similar except their unionization rates diverge. You can then use one as a control and one as the experiment. You'd still have to do some work to show only the treatment effect was different between these areas, but this can help with finding the treatment effect.

&#x200B;

One last thing. I really hope they didn't make this mistake, but you have to be very careful when you work with data across time. If the variables in your regression have trends across time (and they do in this case), then a regression of one on the other will find a strong relationship between the two just because of their time trends and not because of any reasons of causality. It doesn't matter if they're number of pirates vs. global warming, cumulative rainfall since 1900 in Botswana vs. GDP in the US, or overdose/suicide mortality vs. union density. The regression will find that one's generally going up while the other's generally going down (number of pirates vs. global warming) or up (cumulative rainfall since 1900 in Botswana vs. GDP in the US). You can avoid this problem by using the rates of change instead of the absolute level to remove the time trend.",abetadist,t2_3lq2j,249,0,reddit4

1. Unions have only 1 priority: make sure the union survives.
2. When has it ever been a good thing to **make** someone belong to a group, then garnish his/her wages for the privilege?
3. Anything the union does to benefit its members only happens as long as #1 is observed. 
4. Unions have driven up wages artificially and unsustainably.  Example: auto manufacturing jobs to Mexico.  Or, iron smelting lost to China.
5. Higher wages drives automation which eliminates jobs.  See fast food.

Which means that labor costs increase for the company.  Higher costs mean less profit, less expansion, and less return for investors.  Lack of new investment capital and lack of support from current investors means lower profits or even the death of companies.  

In the 50s there was a very high demand for labor so labor had the power.  They were able to make demands and companies had to fall in line if they wanted a work force.  That's no longer the case.  Automation has reduced the need for skilled tradesmen.  You can train a machine operator in week to do what used to take a tradesman years to learn.  Most of a companies work force is easily replaceable.  Companies are able to rely on temp workers instead of trained professionals.  And globalization means that companies can easily just abandon a unionized workforce in exchange for a cheaper workforce elsewhere.  Labor no longer has the bargaining power they once did.  

Also, individualism, rather than collectivism, is a lot more prevalent mindset.  The left, who traditionally supported unions, have become much much more individualistic and less unified and the right, which is more group focused, typically opposes unions as they see them as restrictive to growth opportunities for both companies and individuals.  In general, Americans are not as good at unity and working together as we used to be, which is what makes good and strong unions.

And a lot of labor demands are now law (work place safety, overtime, child labor, working conditions, minimum wage, etc...).  Unions did that.  They fought hard for those rights and we all benefit from them.  However, unions need to continue to fight for things to justify their existence.  Just like an army needs a war, a union needs an injustice to battle.  Many people do not see the workforce as unjust and exploitive enough to justify the fight.  There is a lot of fatigue with things like the Chicago teachers striking almost every year despite being the highest paid teacher in the nation.  Or police unions constantly protecting very unfit cops.  Or manufacturing unions striking just to see their factory close and the jobs move overseas.  Many people just want a job, not to join a fight.

And finally, our current economic/political situation suppresses unions.  The back and forth between corporate jobs and high ranking political office is extremely problematic.  Executives become politicians and make laws to support big business.  Politicians that make laws to protect big business are given executive positions.  And big business doesn't like unions.  At the top level, corporate and national leadership is focused on a few specific stats.  Unemployment, for instance, tends to be lowest when you have a lot of gig jobs, part time jobs, and temp jobs.  Solid union career jobs mean less people working but for higher wages.  GDP, is highest when corporate profits are highest.  Stock market prices as well.  Unions cost companies money and lower corporate profits.  Top leadership at a national and often state level is going to tend to be anti-union and attitudes, policy, and financial support will follow.",LacksMass,t2_49ala,12,0,reddit4

This isn't a great study.  It's sociology modeling where they just picked two moving stats and correlated them and then assumed one could effect the other.  It's just as likely suicide is causing union membership to decline and if people would stop killing themselves they'd all join unions.

Realistically all workers at the bottom of the barrel should be paid more, but Walmart is already leading the pack in most areas. People working at walmart get above average pay, that discount, and they have walmart experience on their resume.

The union organized community volunteering events people participated in. People rallied together and were unified when it came time to renegotiate the contract.

I don’t think attending membership meetings is where the sense of community comes from.

That said, if I were to make a gut reaction to the cause of the claim in the headline,  it would be access to health insurance and other services. For example of other services, one employer (for a union job) I had made available 4 confidential mental/chemical health counseling appointments available per year at no cost, independent of insurance.

The classic is ""rainfall causes women"" 

Because if you graph all states by their average rainfall and gender ratio you get  a strong trend.

>This is the average yearly rainfall in the lower 48 US states vs. their gender balance (measured in number of men per 100 women). The correlation is about r = 0.84 (p ≤ 0.0001), much higher than anyone’s ever found between guns and crime, or income and happiness, or most other things people make regional scatterplots about. So what’s going on? Do women cause rainfall? Does rain drive men away? Or is there some confounder that causes both rain and womanhood?

fc6873k,t1_fc5z5wb,2019-12-27 19:21:51,science,"This is a very general analysis and should not be used to infer anything about individuals.  The US, historically, is very opportunity and growth based where Europe is more stability based.  In Europe everything is very established, if you want to expand it's pretty much always at someone's expense and retaliation is likely.  Hundreds or thousands of years of various nations flexing their might and starting political or economic fights creates a situation where what reasonable people want most is peace and stability.  Americans have a history or rapid growth, of constant change, of new opportunity.  More natural resources, more land, more possibility.  It creates a culture where everyone expects, or at least tries, to have constant upward mobility.  In the 50s, unions offered that jump from bad factory jobs, to stable safe careers.  It was a step up.  Unions now offer stability and gradual growth, but it's doesn't really represent a big step up from anything.  Non-unions jobs for the same work aren't significantly worse than union jobs.  And non-union companies are usually faster growing and have more opportunity to quickly rise through the ranks.  Americans are generally bigger risk takers and fortune chasers and unions don't support that mindset.

The mob connections are really limited to a couple major US cities, notably New York and Chicago.  Unions needed organization, leverage, and funding to make things happen.  The unions loyalty, willingness to break rules, willingness to use violence and desire to shift the status quo aligned pretty well with the goals of the mob.  Even today, connected people tend to do better than talented people.  There are often clear limits on how much connections and money are allowed to go into influencing decisions, so having people that have less morals when it comes to influencing people, can be very helpful.  Big businesses have lawyers and lobbyists to pave the way to secure big government contracts.  Unions will sometimes have mob connections to remove obstacle to secure big government contracts.

Without unions, there are no pay raises without minimum wage hikes.

Without unions, you have zero ability to earn the rewards you imagine people receiving after they work hard. 

There is no such thing as a corporate responsibility to make people happy. In case you haven't noticed, when people work hard they get nothing but the expectation of that being the new bar of expected effort.

but they do have an obligation to make as much money as quickly as possible. Broken backs and stress causalities be damned.

Working private industry I was taking 15-20% raises year over year due to merit. Some of my peers didn't, they didn't have as much drive or ability. Seems to be working to me. 

Be better than your peers and you'll get rewarded. The world is cut throat, if you can't keep up then you're going to drown.

I gain nothing with being lumped into the same group as the lazy and/or incompetent fucks that fill the bottom levels of unions. They are nothing but dead weight - collective bargaining means that my contributions get averaged down by them. My ability to excel is entirely diluted.

> Must be nice to be angry about chump change

As for chump change - I contribute 5% of my net pay for dues, and another 5% for union-mandated benefits. At my pay grade that's ~$6,500 of my NET pay each year.

Would it be worth the time and money to become a Mechanical Engineer? 

- I have textbook ADHD and my grades have always suffered as a result. Going back to post secondary will prove to be a massive ordeal and most likely take longer than anticipated. 

- I don't have any debt but I also have no savings to contribute to my return to school. In my position now I could realistically save 10,000 with a year of steady work as I have minimal overhead costs. 

- I would be approaching 30 upon graduation from an engineering program.

September 2016 is when I would be able to return to school if I choose to pursue this route immediately. 

I am currently considering all schools in Canada, but Ontario would be the most ideal. 

I'm in the position now to become a junior fire alarm technician and work my way up the corporate ladder but that doesn't excite me and I have a strong desire to do far greater things in regard to my scope of work. I want to have the  ability to create and design large scale projects in the future; whether it be building a custom home for a client, or helping design and custom build a race car..

My mind seems to change about my goals on a daily basis but I have always maintained the strong desire to design and create things with my mind and imagination.

Sorry for the rambling, but I hope that someone could offer me some input.

However it’s nearly impossible to accurately answer this question because of the complex workforce economics involved; policy makers and labor economics experts have tried. Our take on this issue is that it’s distracting for the biggest stakeholders (those at the PhD trainee level) to think about it too much. Pursuit of a PhD and higher education in general offers huge value in itself, both to the student and to society. It is even likely there are sectors of the workforce that haven’t fully realized the benefit they would derive from hiring more PhD-trained professionals.  

If you are considering graduate school, first ask yourself whether a PhD degree is something you want to do for the love of the research (whatever that research might be). Second, be sure to consider what your career options might be at the end of your studies, and how well grad school will prepare you for those careers. It’s up to institutions to decide what qualities they are looking for in a graduate student, and to ensure they have the capacity to appropriately mentor the students they accept to their programs.  -LS

cum08rz,t1_culq9qi,2015-08-31 17:12:07,science,"The question I hear you asking is whether it is possible to move back to academia, for a faculty position, after having spent time in a full-time scientist position in industry. This is possible to do, though not always easy and might require more training time. 
There are two ‘times’ when this is traditionally easiest to do.

Time 1, Early career: Very soon after you move into industry. If you realize that industry really isn’t the right environment for you, work to get back into academia as soon as you can. Depending on your particular background and publication/grant record, you might be able to apply for faculty positions right away. If you aren’t competitive for a faculty position, you may likely have to do another academic postdoc to get you the publication history you need. While you are still in industry,get on projects that will allow you to publish, so your time in industry doesn’t cause a major break in your publication record.

Time 2, Advanced career: When you are a senior scientist with a well-known track record, your expertise and research program may be sought after to head back into academia, or to head to industry from academia (see Jim Wells and Don Ganem as examples of each). These types of transitions happen when throughout your time in industry, you continue to have strong collaborations with academia. You continue to publish the same quality as a top level academic scientist (and publish regularly). You continue to attend conferences and contribute to the academic community. You become known for innovative and impactful science, “even though” you are in industry.

At the end of the day, no matter when you might decide to head back to academia, you will need to spend your time “out-of-academia” thinking, acting and publishing similar to an academic scientist. --AS",UCSF_Career_Dev,t2_pznw1,17,0,reddit1

Moreover, I fear that the longer you pursue one way, you loose the ability to switch to the other. Is that true?

cum186g,t1_culr3ar,2015-08-31 17:36:57,science,"The advice I would give students and postdocs early on in their training is to start exploring career options and planning their training accordingly. Career exploration can be a lengthy process and, in a way, graduate school is a way to explore academic research as a career option. For those with  set career goals, they should strategically plan their training. Several key questions to ask themselves are: What are the important milestones that I should attain throughout my training to obtain a faculty position? What sources of support are available to help me attain these milestones? What advice can I get from successful trainees? What types of mentors will I need to optimize my training (OCPD Director Naledi Saul wrote an effective article about the types of mentors to find). And, most importantly, who are the PIs to help me get where I’d like to go? 

Create a 5-year plan and revise it every year. And, if a faculty career is plan A, once you have identified plan B, you will need to ask yourself the same questions for this other career option. If you are a life scientist, one great tool to plan your training is the online myIDP tool from Science Careers.-LC

So for a company to want you, they have to start interviews in Jan/Feb, sort out contract details in March, start applying for visa's, then wait 6 months before you start (assuming you are given one). It is a HUGE risk and cost for the company, especially when there are so many good candidates already in the USA. 

The better way to do it, is to go to academia (no quota, try get a H1B visa instead of a J1), work for a few years, then apply for Green Card so you can work anywhere. If you change to industry from academia, you run into the same problems with quotas again.

1. PhD/MD value?: At the end of the day I feel that the value of and PhD or MD is only what you yourself find in it or derive from it. Is the advanced degree going to get you the type of career you want? Does the degree allow you to get a job that has the environment, job tasks, financial support, recognition, location, work/life sustainability (or other values) that are important to you? There are many careers that are only open to you with an advanced degree, but there are many great careers that don’t need one. It’s what you value that is what is important.

2. Networking v. Training: BOTH! I posit that there is no conflict between the two. If you are going to spend the long, hard (but hopefully rewarding) slog that is grad school, dedicate yourself to it. Get everything you can out it. Networking is critical for both your research and your future career. It is pretty hard to do good work in a vacuum. Your colleagues are where you go to with problems, and reality checks, and just some well-deserved venting. Building a network both within and outside of academia gives you a broad base of support.

1) Half of UCSF’s postdocs are internationals, and our office has worked with many of these postdocs as they move into faculty positions. There may be indirect advantages to having international experience  --  for example with a wider network, and greater experience of the way science works in different parts of the world, an international may be better prepared to navigate collaborations. However, in our experience, there is no direct or specific advantage or disadvantage in the application process to having had international experience prior to your postdoc. Importantly, though, it is more difficult to move into a US-based faculty position directly from an international postdoc. Outside of the US you would not be eligible for certain funding mechanisms like the Pathway to Independence Awards (K99), and you may find it difficult to be isolated from the grant review and application processes that are unique to the US. 

2) There are significant efforts in the US, and in other countries, to move away from assessment by impact factor. There is increasing recognition of the flaws of the impact factor as an inadequate and inappropriate measure of a scientist’s worth. Citations, and other article level metrics, are of increasing value as a more direct assessment of the impact of a scientist’s research output. Outside of publishing, there are many ways to make yourself marketable as a candidate for a faculty position, and there are many skills and experiences that can help you to succeed once get the job.

cum34ck,t1_culry3m,2015-08-31 18:24:00,science,"I am so thrilled that you are asking this question! Now is a great time to start exploring your career options.There are several things I would recommend to get you on your way or you can read this [article to get you started](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/08/13/career-a-or-b-making-the-decision). 

1. Self-Assessment: One of the most powerful things you can do is know yourself and what you want and need out of your work environment (and your work/life situation). Fortunately, there are several ways to start working on this. A structured (and free) way to do this is to use [the myIDP](http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) tool at [Science Careers](http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/) (full disclosure, our BL is one of the co-authors). If you have access to a career center, self-assessment tests such as the STRONG, MBTI, and others can be helpful in learning more about what’s important to you. 

2. Initial Exploration: Self-assessment never really stops, but it’s hard to move forward without new information. This is where exploration comes in. Start reading all you can about industry. A place you could start is this content collection on [Pharma](http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2011_12_09/caredit.a1100138) from Science Careers. And there are many great articles online. I also recommend books like Toby Freedman’s [Career Opportunities in Biotechnology and Drug Development](http://www.careersbiotech.com/). One of your main goals is to start compiling up questions about Industry that you want answered. Also attend any seminars that are industry-related at your institution or attend webinars if none are happening where you are (many professional societies put on things like this), and see if there are any career seminars at the next conference you are going to.
3. Advanced Exploration: Get yourself out there talking to people. My suggestion is to do this as early as possible, because it may take time to get comfortable with the dreaded “networking.” As awkward as it can feel, talking to professionals  is the best way to get your various questions answered. What you are going to be aiming for is [informational interviews](https://career.ucsf.edu/phds/non-academic-careers/career-exploration/build-your-professional-network). But you can start the process at conferences, networking events, even in you lab with lab alumni. You might be amazed at the people you actually have in your network! This is where LinkedIn is really powerful. Slowly but surely, build out your profile and connect with your friends and colleagues, people you network with (some good [tips and tricks](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2012/12/20/linkedin-tips-for-scientists)). Super -advanced exploration would be finding and working on projects or industry collaborations to get a ‘hands on’ feel for the environment. 

At the end of the day, use the time you have now to make self-assessment and career development a consistent part of your life, so that when you get closer to when you move onto the market (for whatever career you decide on), you aren’t rushed and feel very informed. Also, my answer focused on exploring industry, but you can use these same techniques to explore parts of academia that you want to learn more about -- AS

Nearly 100% of them would trace their eventual job offer back to either a contact who helped them get their foot in the door (networking, that is) or else an online application to a posted position.  So, if you’re reluctant to get out there and talk to people, or to carefully tailor resumes and apply for posted jobs, then you might be in for a long and uncertain job search.  
However, a few clients have landed jobs by more passive approaches including:

1. Reaching out to third party recruiters (known as “executive search firms” or “headhunters” or even “contract staffing firms”).  Consider submitting a generic version of your resume to some search firms that specialize in your field.  There’s a search firm that specializes in everything so just google “search firm and x”  where x = an application, product area, disease focus, tool or device that you would be qualified to work with based on your current background.

2. Attending job fairs.  Job fairs are great for learning about companies, local employment markets and networking.  For PhD-level applicants where your background is specialized, the chances of landing a job by passing out your resume at a job fair are very slim.  But give it a try and see what you can learn!

3. Creating a really solid LinkedIn profile and posting your resume on science focused job search sites like Biospace, ScienceCareers.org, NatureJobs, etc, or even general job search sites like Indeed, Monster, etc.  Recruiters from companies or third party recruiters might find you.

4. Join several scientific societies related to your field that feature job boards for members and post your resume on those sites, also with the hope that recruiters or more senior society members who are hiring will find you.--BL

However such questions are of interest to those we work with and so we do think quite a bit about it.

There is definite value in getting experience before embarking on a research graduate degree. Importantly, getting research experience under your belt will enable you to determine whether academic research is for you. When selecting students, the graduate program committee will see that you have done research already and know that you have a high enough interest and aptitude for research to commit for several years, and so will be more inclined to accept you. However it’s not necessary to do both a research Master’s degree and gain separate technical experience. Doing so is likely to just delay your final entry to the job market. -LS

cum77qa,t1_culs17x,2015-08-31 20:06:31,science,"There are two parts to your question, the first is exploring careers to find meaningful work ,and the second is analyzing your return on investment given labor market dynamics. 

For the first part of your question:
There are several ways that you can explore various career paths as an undergraduate, however many students find that the most illuminating way to determine whether or not a career path would suit them is to experience it first hand through obtaining an internship or externship.  Due to financial constraints, some students can’t always afford to take an unpaid internship however, so a multifaceted approach to career exploration is key.  Here are some steps you can take to further explore your interests and careers:

1. Assess yourself: Take note of what activities/skills you enjoy most and ask yourself what you like about what you’re doing and why.  Often many students claim they’re interested in a field, say English, but when they look at their activities, there’s not many activities that reflect their interest, (i.e. they haven’t written many things outside of what they need to do for classes and instead spend more of their time designing websites for student clubs because they enjoy that more). By taking note of what kinds of skills you enjoy using every day you can better identify which careers might be a better fit for you based on what skills you like using.
2. Research online: Once you’ve verified your skills and interests, you can start to explore career options based on majors online through your university career center, or resources such as: What Can I Do With My Major?,  Explore Health Careers or My Next Move. These sites will give you information about various career paths and the education/training necessary to obtain a certain position. This way you can begin to start outlining which types of careers appeal to you most and cross check them against your preferred skills list.  
3. Validate: your research through doing informational interviews and engaging in experiential experiences like internships, externships and related entry level jobs.- AC

The qualifications required to acquire a faculty position vary widely between fields, types of institutions, and within departments themselves, as you probably know. The type of institution where you want to be faculty dictates the type of postdoc activities you should pursue. Specifically, in order to help answer your question, we developed an Academic Career Readiness Assessment tool (and were just awarded a grant from Burroughs Wellcome Fund to refine the framework).  To get a preview of the tool, visit: https://career.ucsf.edu/pac-up-stage-3.  And yes, I believe that the postdoctoral position you will choose can greatly impact your success in getting that eventual faculty position. Once you have identified the type of institution/faculty position you’d like, it is important to do your homework about the lab to which you are applying and find out if it is the right environment for your work style and career goals. Also, find out where alumni of that lab are working now.  --LC",UCSF_Career_Dev,t2_pznw1,3,0,reddit1
cum3cqz,t1_culwv56,2015-08-31 18:29:46,science,"Nurse Practitioner (NP) and Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) career paths can be very rewarding for many people.  In order to determine if this path is right for you, it would be wise to do informational interviews with various types of NPs, (including FNPs) so that you can get an accurate sense of what it’s like to be an NP in different settings, (i.e. hospitals, clinics, university health centers etc).  What you’re looking for is consistency in their answers so that you can verify that all the information you’re getting is generally applicable.  Also keep in mind that settings will differ based on the resources they have, the patient populations they serve, and the clinical skills that are used. 

In the process of analyzing all the information that you’re gathering, it’s also important to ask yourself:

1. What appeals to me most about being an FNP based on what I’ve heard?
2. How do I feel about the challenges that other NPs face and would I be able to similarly use my strengths to be happy and thrive in this profession?
3. What type of patients would I want to work with? 
4. How much field experience did other NPs have before going into their NP programs, and how did it help them when they graduated?
5. What clinical settings appeal to me most and why?
6. What combination of work and school would be feasible given my current financial situation? 
7. How have other NPs and current NP students managed going to school and/or working?

After speaking to a good sample of NPs, your next step should be to get relevant clinical experience and exposure by working with or volunteering with NPs (if you don’t already have these experiences).  One of the most common pitfalls that people pursuing an NP make is that they apply to programs without having enough clinical exposure and experience in the field.  This could translate to needing to step out of your academic studies while pursuing an NP (not uncommon unfortunately), in order to obtain more relevant experience to help make you more competitive for jobs after you graduate.  

For people who already have an RN or BSN, and are thinking of applying to NP programs, the strengths they bring are their previous clinical experiences, exposure to working in different departments and an established network within the clinical community.  Note however that there are some places where the labor market for NPs or FNPs are more saturated than others, so new graduates with more experience, language skills and an established network might be more competitive than others.  Generally less competitive candidates in more saturated markets tend to find jobs in less saturated markets across the country.  The rule of thumb when applying to most graduate programs is to choose a program in an area where you wouldn’t mind living for a while as you build experience because the network that you’ll build in school may be tied to a geographical area (i.e. all the local hospitals that your rotations would take place in). --AC",UCSF_Career_Dev,t2_pznw1,2,0,reddit1
cum6k5q,t1_culxcrw,2015-08-31 19:50:10,science,"Hi Neurozoe! Within science writing you have several options - 

(1) Technical writing (writing manuals and grants; pamphlets for companies); (2) Medical writing; (3) Science journalism (where you cover new research and talk to the researchers or cover health stories of interest); (4) Communication and Publishing (editor or director at a pharma company). Read about other [career titles on the UMMS webpage](http://www.umassmed.edu/gsbs/career/pathways/communication/)

Science writers are also employed in full-time staff positions, or as freelance writers. When considering between these opportunities, be sure to think about stability, salary and health benefits. 

A PhD may not always be required depending on the level of technical knowledge you need for the job. For example, for medical writing or editing at a STEM journal, a PhD (or even a postdoc) is often required because the training exposes you to a breadth of research areas you potentially will have to cover in the job, and gives you specific knowledge for certain research or therapeutic areas. Also, having a PhD and some postdoc experience may qualify you for more advanced titles such as Scientific Communications Director in a company.

Whether you decide to pursue science writing (with a PhD or not) - get writing experience or consider doing a fellowship. Agencies and institutions offer fellowhips for students with graduate or [undergraduate degrees] (http://www.aaas.org/page/apply)

You are correct that it might make you look uncommitted depending on how the conversation goes and who the professor is. Instead, ask about where the most recent post-docs have gone.

Also look at what types of activities the graduate and post-doc societies put on. Most of these organizations are starting to do more alternative career talks.

Other than that, once you are in a PhD program it is up to you to figure out how to divide your time between lab and build alternative skills.

cum25ao,t1_culq5k5,2015-08-31 17:59:39,science,"There are several things that you’d need to take into account in planning to keep your options open for medical school after going into a different path after you graduate.

1. Medical schools vary in how long they’ll accept pre-med courses.  Generally if it’s been between 5-7 years since you last took your pre-med courses, you would probably need to re-take those courses at a 4-year institution (most likely a post-bac program which could be expensive).  If you want to keep your options open and save money, you would want to prepare to go back to school 3- 4 years after you graduate.  It would also be a good idea to take at least 1 hard science course per semester to keep up your study habits, continue to demonstrate an interest in science, and to show medical schools that your knowledge hasn’t gone stale.

2. For the MCAT, your scores will be good for 3 years. However, if you want to be safe, apply to medical school within 1.5 - 2 years of having taken the MCAT.  For example, if you decided to take the MCAT in July 2019, then you should apply to med school no later than June 2021 (after that cycle your score will expire in the midst of your application in 2022 and would no longer be accepted.

3. For letters of recommendation (LOR), they’re generally considered stale after 2 years. So if you take time off, you’d definitely want to take some science courses in between so that you could get some fresh LOR (you need 2 science, 1 non-science academic letters generally, and can have additional letters, like from a coach, up to a total of about 5-6 generally).  Otherwise you’d need to keep in contact with your current letter writers, and have them update their letters. Again this approach would be better if it is within 2 years of graduation.

4. It is also important to demonstrate your interest in working with people through non-clinical volunteering and through clinical work  (free clinics, hospitals, EMT, medical assisting, etc.).  There is no one way to do it, just know that in order to be competitive you’d need to demonstrate continued commitment and interest in working with and helping people and through gaining exposure to clinical settings and doctors. --AC",UCSF_Career_Dev,t2_pznw1,4,0,reddit1

The value of a PhD and MD in the marketplace are NOT equivalent, and they are NOT just what you yourself derive from it! Professional degrees are barriers to entry to specific fields! As a MD or PE, you are qualified for a wide variety of work that you cannot do without those degrees! As a PhD, you are qualified for high-level research or university level teaching *in your specific field* THAT'S IT. The job prospects and career opportunities are TOTALLY DIFFERENT for engineers, doctors, and scientists, and your dissertation in butterfly taxonomy or early renaissance art may not qualify you for sh@t outside of that field! Not to say you can't go and say, ""look, I'm smart and I can work hard"", but 5-7 years is a lot to put in just to completely change course. I'm not saying don't do it, but do realize what you are and are not qualifying yourself for, professional degrees are real things, and a PhD is a very limited professional degree.

cum78j8,t1_cum77qa,2015-08-31 20:07:04,science,"For the second part of your question: 

To determine return on investment and which fields are more stable or lucrative than others, you can check the Occupational Outlook Handbook (put out by the US Dept of Labor) to determine future labor market trends.  Another resource that posts survey results for top paying majors yearly is NACE Top Paying Majors 2014.  Note however that while certain majors are currently more lucrative than others, there’s a reason that not everyone majors in engineering.  People generally tend to do better in professions that match their interests and skills.  So for instance, if a person is passionate about photography, is diligent about gaining broad experience (they do an internship for a magazine, a movie studio, and/or a photojournalist), then put together a strong online portfolio which gets them noticed, that person could become quite successful since they’ve built their skills and have networked while also finishing their studies.  By the time this person graduates they’d be well positioned to start a job in several industries all centered around photography.  Then say that this person continued to work hard and was entrepreneurial.  They could then become a well respected freelancer and be very satisfied with their compensation and the variety of their work, or they could choose to work for an employer at a magazine or in a marketing department and eventually become part of senior management.  

Overall it’s important to know that there is no one way that is guaranteed to provide satisfaction in life.  Also being satisfied with your career means different things to different people at different stages in your life.  The average student is now expected to have 7-10 careers in their lifetimes as opposed to older generations.  You could decide to be an engineer then find that over the years you’re not happy with your choice for various reasons.  If you make your decisions based on taking an honest look at your current values and needs, then you’ll be better served than pursuing something because it is more lucrative.  Being concerned with financial stability is important, but the real question you have to ask yourself is: is financial stability more important than the quality of your work?  Or is working in a collaborative environment more important? By asking yourself what you’re willing to prioritize you’ll get a better sense of what things you’d value more in a career. --AC

Is the research you would be doing as a postdoc disease-focused or other application-focused?  4. Do postdocs move on from the lab relatively quickly (that is, if the lab’s history says you’re likely to undergo a long 7 year postdoc, consider what industry will think of those last several years).
