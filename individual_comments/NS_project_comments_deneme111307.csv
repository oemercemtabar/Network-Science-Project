hqwwuod,t3_ru0zvy,2022-01-02 08:23:41,MensRights,"I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, feminists are some of the most misogynistic people I‚Äôve ever come across. 
It‚Äôs insane how quickly they‚Äôll resort to the same misogynistic behaviour they claim to be fighting (behaviour they claim only men exhibit) when it suddenly benefits them.

They claim men see women as objects only good for sex and yet they‚Äôll call a woman a ‚Äúdick worshipper‚Äù just because she doesn‚Äôt hate men.

They claim men and the patriarchy are to blame for rape culture and then tell a woman she deserves to get raped just because she pointed out the fact that men can get raped and women can be rapists.

They say ‚Äúall women are beautiful‚Äù and then attack a womans appearance when she disagrees with them, and they‚Äôll accuse her of grovelling for mens attentions by having ‚Äúinternalised misogyny‚Äù because it‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôll ever fuck her because she‚Äôs too ugly. Wow, how very feminist.

‚ÄúAll women are just as smart as men‚Äù‚Ä¶. Unless a women calls them out for their hypocrisy and bigotry, then she‚Äôs stupid.

They don‚Äôt care about doing good, they care about looking good, and they only care about looking good to the other idiots in their own echo chamber. They‚Äôll resort to bigotry if and when it suits them even if they were calling someone else out for their own bigotry five minuets earlier. They‚Äôll resort to misogyny and justify it so long as the women ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù it. They pick and chose when they support women and equality. 

A misandrist women calling little boys ‚Äúpredators in the making‚Äù? ‚ÄúYes! You beautiful goddess! You go girl! Women are the most intelligent beings on earth!!1!‚Äù 

A woman supporting both women AND men and taking everyone‚Äôs issues seriously? 
‚ÄúUgly ass pick me girl lmao go suck a dick you dumb bitch XD‚Äù

I saw a post on tumblr a few years ago where a feminist was telling women who had been hurt by other women ‚Äúat the end of their day they‚Äôre still your sisters and we‚Äôre in this together because no matter how much a woman hurts you you, men can and will hurt you worse‚Äù  I wish I was joking. As a victim of abuse by a woman, this infuriated me when I saw the post and it had SO many likes too. So many idiots agreed with that shit. These people claim to care about female victims of abuse and then they tell these same female victims that our abusers are our SISTERS. Fuck that.

These are all things I‚Äôve seen feminists say and do throughout the last 10 years that ive been on social media but it‚Äôs not everything I‚Äôve seen, its just a small example of how feminists don‚Äôt actually care about women, and that‚Äôs nothing to say about how badly men and boys are effected by their shit either, five minuets on this sub and you can see just how fucked over men and boys are by feminists and their bigotry as well.

hqxs8hy,t3_ru0zvy,2022-01-02 14:44:32,MensRights,"it's a standard buzzword response.

it's meant to elicit a response from you.

if they resort to this mindless nattering as a gotcha, then acknowledge your logic is sound and the only response they have is to attempt to reduce your argument to an enemy stance.

because if you are the enemy, you must be a man, and men are wrong, see how frail their logic is.

it does not even matter if you are a man or a woman.

acknowledging the *all men* argument is not only wrong, but harmful, should be held by someone who is sound of mind, man, woman, other.  if you hold the view, *all men are evil, and out to get me and opress all women* then you are simply devoid of any rational thought.

I can barely scrape by, I've never been privelidged, in fact being a man has harmed me more than it has ever helped me.

one tiny, tiny example. in the sea of hate towards men, is, I'm a man, in a woman dominated industry.

me and my partner, discussed earlier in 2021 the decision of having a child, after being together for 8 years, and making shocking progress in both of our careers, lives and mental health.

we decided we would, and were blessed to conceive a child, together, planned and we are ready.

I chose not to reveal this to any coworker, boss, supervisor etc.

my partner needed to come in to discuss something with me, while I was at work.

everyone found out on that day, 32 weeks in.

I was bombarded with, ""are you married"" ""was it planned"" ""typical male, forgot to tell anyone"" ""is she leaving her job"" ""what have you done to prepare for the child"".

just insane questions, like an interrogation. instead of the celebration of life we wanted, I was ridiculed.

this ""pick me"" response, is the lowest form of reducing a logically sound stance that men, are treated as monsters, incompetent, or lacking of care and humanhood.

do yourself a favour and leave any conversation relegated to such low levels of ridicule.

hqy6jg5,t3_ru0zvy,2022-01-02 16:31:23,MensRights,"Men prefer women who support their rights.

Feminist concludes the only reason a woman would do so, is because men prefer it, suggesting her own ideas and agency don't exist and she is merely reacting to mens agency.

As the woman begins to articulate a reasoned understanding of why mens rights are self-evident, the feminist reacts by calling the woman a man because she dares to have an understanding of mens humanity and inner lives and begins to articulate it.

The reason is the feminist wants you to have no understanding of it and just hang on to mens arms and go ""Whatever you say baby, gosh you're so clever, tee-hee."". This is why they call you a pick me girl. They assume you're not actually interested in any of this shit and simply trying to please men.

When you show you have an understanding of it and support it for moral reasons, something a pick-me girl wouldn't do, the only option they have left is to call you a fake-woman or a woman posing as a man. The alternative would be to *actually engage with the arguments*, which they can't do. This isn't helped when you demonstrate an understanding of mens inner lives and situations both as a result of having empathy and through listening to men recount their experiences.

You ""Sound like a man"" to them because they have no experience of empathizing with men and trying to see things from their perspective. Thus, when you begin saying it, they say ""You're just a dude"" as a reason to stop listening to you. Which is, really, the point isn't it. The reason they don't recognize you as a woman is they never try to empathize with men and see things from their point of view, and when a woman who has done that begins to articulate it, feminists recognize it as ""Mens perspective"" and shut down, refusing to listen, thus their experience of womanhood is one divorced from attempting to empathize with men to such an extreme extent, that they confuse women with empathy for men.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,6,0,reddit2

hqxdd41,t3_ru0zvy,2022-01-02 12:09:24,MensRights,"People without arguments tend to resort to insults. Take note of how they attack you, though. 

You're a ""pick me girl"", which is a term they've created for girls who don't have enough ""value"" for men to choose them as mates without you having to do something (do a backflip!) to get attention. Note the currency they're judging your implied value on, your ability to get male attention.

While there is truth to the whole social value concept, it is described quite incorrectly there.

Not to stray too far on a tangent, but there's just a few simple steps for women to have a high social value, aka be the type of mate the vast majority of men seek. Pay attention to how many of these ""practicing"" feminists get wrong:

1. Maintain a healthy weight. Not that healthy at any size BS, nobody actually believes in that ""body positivity"" bullshit they just use it in commercials to sell soap.  Inability to manage a basic healthy lifestyle is a huge red flag, fat diabetic kids always have fat diabetic parents. Yes, some guys are into big girls, but that's a fetish.

2. Don't alter your body unnecessarily. Yes, some guys like tattoos, piercing, and fake boobs but again, that's a fetish not a norm. 

3. Don't look/act/dress like a clown, aka don't go out of your way to be repulsive. For example, many feminists think having purple hair attracts attention. In reality, humans are biologically programmed to avoid things that are clearly wrong, the same way we are disgusted by rotted food... (I'm relatively sure that the blue haired feminist type does it thinking it will keep you from noticing how fat they are, which obviously isn't true.) Wearing a bunch of makeup is another good example of this, there's a vanishingly small amount of makeup that doesn't just look immediately unnatural. There are some guys who are into clowns, but that's a fetish.

4. Don't start a family without a mate. Single moms are about as low as you can go on social value while still having all your limbs. They're a terrible deal for the vast majority of men who want their own families, and who want a relationship where the partners come first at least for a little while before having children. Dating a single mom means you're always second place, not to mention the whole concept of raising another man's children. Yes, some guys are into that, but it's a fetish.

5. Have some depth, be more than just a pretty face. Time keeps on ticking, if your only value is a your looks you're on a downhill slope before you hit 30. Learn some things worth learning, do some things worth doing. Those beautiful actresses and models who end up divorced, they were *boring*.

The rules are pretty simple, and short of an actual disfigurement will put you far ahead of the pack.

So back to the initial topic, note how many of those basic rules are consistently gotten wrong by ""practicing"" feminists. The stereotype of a fat, blue haired tattooed nose ring shrieking single mom feminist is relatively accurate, these women have effectively removed themselves from the pool of viable mates and will lash out at women who haven't.

Anyway it's a sad fact that men and women fight for rights not just separately but sometimes against the others. The adage of ""if you're not with us, you're against us"" is absurd from a movement claiming to support a demographic. We should all expect equality in the eyes of the law and to be judged on our own merits rather than by our genitals.",singularitous,t2_i3uus6e3,3,0,reddit2

Trying to educate yourself, making yourself cultured, learning how to socialize with a wide variety of men and women, making yourself physically attractive and intelligent, and putting yourself in a position where people of the opposite sex can interact with you, and generally wanting to find a successful relationship are good things.

Same thing goes for men. Learning how to make yourself attractive both physically and socially in the hopes of attracting a mate and then doing it is part of the maturing process for absolutely everyone.

Some people get this idea like they have to dominate their relationship and that they need to be 100% in control, and the other person should do exactly what they think as they think it. That's... not how relationships work.",elebrin,t2_4etv6,2,0,reddit2

They can be but not always. There's lots of sexy and attractive men and women who have some of the traits you mentioned. A nasty arrogant attitude is usually what makes someone unnatractive imo. I'd way rather date someone with blue hair and piercings who's overweight than someone with a terrible attitude, and I think most people would. 

The main issue with feminists isn't their hair, their tattoos, or their weight. It's their messed up beliefs and attitudes surrounding those things and other things. Like having purple hair to attract attention. That's the wrong intention imo. Rock purple hair cause you think it's fun and it makes you feel confident, whetter you're a man or woman. Like anything else, you should be doing things not to impress others but to feel good in your own skin.",mcove97,t2_2zae96xw,3,0,reddit2

A lot of MRA issues like gender-neutral draft, gender-neutral rape/DV laws, punishment for false allegations, family court and custody reforms, exempting non-biological fathers from paying chikd support, etc cut into the 'female privilege'.   

Others like banning MGM, male suicides, censoring of online misandry, equal paternity leave, often get some support from feminists. Mainly because it doesn't threaten female privilege...

hr3f8bx,t1_hqxgqwm,2022-01-03 17:19:38,MensRights,"Every single social media site is cancer though some are obviously worse than others. 

I‚Äôve been on tumblr since 2011 and believe it or not, these days it‚Äôs actually very tame compared to other social media websites like Twitter for eg. I‚Äôve seen people say this many times in the last couple of years, that Twitter today is like what tumblr was in 2014 and I completely agree. All of the radical feminism and radical leftism was only just starting to really take hold online at the time i first started using tumblr and I watched it get worse and worse until around 2017 when allot of the assholes started jumping ship to Twitter because Twitter is a better safe haven for people like them. 

If you critise radical feminists or radical leftists on Twitter there‚Äôs a high chance your account will get suspended for ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô but that doesn‚Äôt happen on tumblr. That‚Äôs why even though it‚Äôs still, as people on tumblr call it, a ‚Äòhell site‚Äô, when it comes to trying to spread awareness for how harmful feminism etc is, tumblr is actually now one of the better sites. 

Hell, literal NAZIS unfortunately don‚Äôt get their accounts suspended half the time (there‚Äôs nowhere near as many of them on tumblr as you might think though, they‚Äôre very hard to come by in my experience), so anti-feminists certainly don‚Äôt. 

There‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôve stayed on tumblr as long as I have, if it weren‚Äôt for that site I wouldnt be nearly as educated on the problems feminists and the radical left cause, in fact I might even still be a feminist myself.

Actually while I‚Äôm in the topic. A few times now recently I‚Äôve seen people on this sub ask where are we all suppose to go if this sub gets taken down and well, in all honesty I really think at least some of you should consider tumblr. It can be a bit harder to curate your timeline so you see things you want to see because you have to actually go looking for it as opposed to it being recommended to you but once you do find some blogs to follow you can find more by simply looking on the comments and finding more like minded people and if you share the posts on your own blog people who don‚Äôt even pay attention to that subject will still see it because someone they follow for another reason may have reblogged it from you and if they agree with it they can share it to their own blogs which will spread it further.
 
And the best things is that, like I‚Äôve already mentioned, there‚Äôs little to no chance a blog dedicated to mens right is going to get taken down.

Twitter is regressive-left friendly and your account can and will get suspended simply for tweeting ‚Äúradfems are mean‚Äù.

Reddit is also regressive-left friendly and is constantly taking down subs that aren‚Äôt doing any harm, but on top of that it‚Äôs also overrun with power hungry mods who ban people who so much as comment on a post from a sub they have black listed. I got permanently banned from ‚Äòthat‚Äô female dating sub just for commenting here.

Meanwhile on tumblr, the only time I‚Äôve seen someone with a blog dedicated to topics like this get deleted, that person eventually got their account back anyway because there had apparently been a mistake. 

Overall, there a reason I use tumblr more than any other social media and the fact that mens rights and other ‚Äòtaboo‚Äô topics like it don‚Äôt get you suspended is high up on the list.",averagedisasterbi,t2_9qhqjvom,1,0,reddit2

Regarding the second paragraph, I didn't feel it was necessary to put ""don't be a purposefully terrible person"", but i acknowledge that is an extremely important thing, just below ""be alive"".

The trope about being able to spot a girl raised without a father from a distance is relatively accurate. People cope with things in different ways, but a few of them end up being common. Childless women in their 30s tend to get cats and drink wine. In their 40s and 50s they push little dogs in a stroller through Costco.

These feminists aren't any less real just because you don't want them to be. It's a really privileged position to be in really, to decree them fake and unworthy of attention. It's easy to block someone on twitter but it's rather difficult to block sexist legislation without any significant political power. It's easy to ignore a subreddit but it's hard not to look at censorship that feminists partake in against men's advocates in spaces designed for voices to be heard. 

You're basically telling me to ignore all of the bad that hurts people like me, and to only focus on the bit of good that has nothing to do with me.

Feminism is pretty much a hate movement. No matter how you look at it, from the beginning is has harbored some of the most sexist, racist people, took part in bombings, guilt tripped young men into fighting in wars. 

If you really want to get deep into it, click the pinned post on my profile. It's far more thorough than the copypasta and it really calls into question the integrity of first and second wave feminists.

Hating on people for being a certain race, gender, or sexuality isn't okay. But hating on people for literally joining a hate movement? If you're going to cry about that then it seems you can dish it but can't take it.

Men can be feminists, and I hate their ideology just the same, I don't hate it less because they're a man. Your line of thinking you just said implies all women are a monolith, and that all women agree with feminism... seems sexist to me. 

I don't look at people through a group identity lens, all people are individuals. I don't hate anyone based on their immutable characteristics. 

I hate ideology, especially one's used for pernicious motives and in hurtful ways. 

You will never agree I'm sure, but the ideology (or at least what it has become) I find absolutely abhorrent and evil; and that is not because ""a few horrible people"", but what the very foundation the ideology is based upon. (To be clear, I am hatdly talking about first or even second wave feminism).

Not to mention, a huge proportion of feminism is what you've described as a ""few"".

I think it is a hateful sexist movement; and that has absolutely zero bearing on how I feel about women or men. I'm not sexist, despite you implying I am. I'm an egalitarian. 

You see, you just so casually said a blanket statement about all men, and you painted me and many others with a horrible brush, implying I'm sexist because I hate a specific ideology. 

I would never do that to you, nor even any random feminist. Like I said, I hate the ideology, not the proponents of it. 

Perhaps you should ask WHY some men are quick to hate feminism, and perhaps you should actually LISTEN to their reasons. I mean listen to understand, not listen to respond. 

You will not get anywhere in your understanding of men's rights, or even feminism, if you simply look at it through a lens. 

Just my two cents.

Frankly, I don't even believe you're listening to what I'm saying in this very instance... You haven't come into the discussion with one ounce of interest in understanding, nor have you extended a single olive branch. 

Three sentences in and you've declined to steelman my argument, and also haven't acknowledged half of what I said. Then, condescendingly imply I'm basing my argument on ""my interpretation of it"", though I'm basing it on my study of the ideology, as well as the literal tenets of it. I can cite that if you like?

But perhaps I'm expecting too high of a level of debate here. 

The dictionary definition is practically irrelevant to me, as it is with many other ideologies. Do I go off of how something is ""defined"" or what it results in? 

Communism sounds great on paper, based on the dictionary definition; but it's resulted in a hundred million deaths. 

Christianity sounds great on paper, but its resulted in this massive amount of deaths as well. It doesn't mean it's good inherently nor bad inherently, I'm simply going off of what it results in. 

Feminism is based upon the theory that western culture is an oppressive tyrannical Patriarchy. This is not something I can condone whatsoever. The very center tenet of the ideology is based on a pernicious lie. 

A lot of MRA's don't hate feminism because of how they're treated by women, they hate feminism for the movement and ideas behind it. 

Okay. You claim you're hated on by ""a lot"" of MRA's ""just for being a woman with a voice""... Well, I know plenty of women that come into Men's Rights spaces that aren't hated on... Have you considered that it's because of your lack of acknowledgment or willingness to understand, instead of just assuming those MRA's are sexist? 

""Women who aren't feminists don't want to be treated fairly."" 

Yeah, there is the condescension. That's about enough for me. You're not even implying it anymore; you are outright saying so many women, many of whom I love and hold in high regard, are simply incompetent and weak because they don't agree with you or an ideology. 

I had high hopes for this discussion, but I'm afraid it's devoid of an actual point now.

The company that hired me was 95% women. I didn‚Äôt really care, I was just happy to have a paying job. During training, I learned an interesting fact. In health care, under company policy, female healthcare providers are allowed to service male clients and female clients, and they can also serve elderly male/female couples. However, male healthcare providers are not allowed to be alone with female clients, much less serve them. The only time a male is possibly allowed to help a female client is if it‚Äôs a male/female couple and it‚Äôs an emergency. I asked why, and they basically said they don‚Äôt want to risk having providers rape or take advantage of their clients. As if somehow men would want to rape an elderly woman just because they were men. And even the male clients preferred to have female providers. 95% of my clients over my 9 month stint there switched from me to a female provider. I was told ‚Äòit‚Äôs nothing personal‚Äô but it sure felt personal. I was one of only four men in the company that I was ever made aware of, with something like 50 women.

>I wonder how many of those perpetrators are men vs women?

Does it really matter what the sex of the perpetrator is? The fact is that it affects men the most and if the offender having the same sex of the victim means that the crime is somehow lessened, well that's just a whole other kind of effed up.

>Is that completed suicides or attempts? It's well known that men more likely to use a more lethal method of suicide attempt and thus complete suicide at a higher rate

You'd think that if it's well know that men use more lethal methods for suicide (and also plan their attempts more) that people wouldn't tell us to ""man up"" or to just ""deal with it"". You'd also think that there would be more resources targeted at male mental health but the opposite is what happens, men have to rely on unisex solutions while women have those resources AS WELL AS women-only clinics, professionals, call centers, etc (and the women-only side of mental health usually receives more funding and employs the best professionals, be them man or woman).

>For the incarceration rate, I'd be interested to see the stats on who commits more crime

That's literally the same argument used against black people, and it's a really deadly one, because it shifts the spotlight from the systematic problems and court bias to place it on the affected group instead, undermining the efforts to get rid of such biases. Men DO commit more crimes, statistically, but is it because it's in our DNA to do so, or because courts will bump down offenses committed by women to misdemeanors or sometimes even shift the consequences entirely to their husband or boyfriend, deeming them as the masterminds behind it all while the women involved are deemed to have been coerced into the crime?",-who_are_u-,t2_9alten42,7,0,reddit3

Your point? Women typically commit violence through proxy so even if most of the perpetrators of violent crime are men, women still bear a lot of responsibility.

Completed.

Because women really aren't trying. Suicide attempts by women are typically cries for attention.

I also do not appreciate your implication that I was providing sub-optimal care to my clients, I had my company evaluate each and every client I had after they switched, because my first thought was that I gave inadequate care and needed to improve or seek additional training. Every single time without fail, the company said that my care of the client was above and beyond their standards, and they re-assured me again and again that it was not because of the quality of my care that they were switching, but rather that it was either due to the fact that the client either directly and specifically requested a female caregiver from the company, or due to the fact that the client simply asked that I no longer be on their care team (almost always made up entirely of females besides myself), and then I would find out later through the grapevine that my replacement on that care team just so happened to be female.

- ""Are you aware of the situation your professor is facing?"", to which I answered ""Yes"", because, you know, I was aware of the accusations.
And right after, she asked:
- ""Have you been present, or have you heard your classmate do these accusations in class?"", to that I answered ""Yes, but..."" She interrupted me, ""So, you are acknowledging that your teacher intended these actions?"" (Here my teacher, who was present in hearing was getting pale) to which I answered ""No, but I have heard my classmate talk about...."" She interrupted again ""So you are aware that your teacher did these acts?"" ""No, he didn't..."" Again, interrupted, by the fucking judge ""So he hid these actions and you only know of them because of the classmate?""...

We continued for about 15 more minutes in this back and forth. In the end, I managed to get across that the accusations were nothing but rumours, and that the student had a personal vendetta against the teacher (she was a slacker and was about to fail the class).

Even tho I gave my side of the story, and there was no evidence of the harassment, he was fired, and his teaching license revoked, he loved giving classes, and we are good friends to this day almost 10 years after, he holds no grudge against me, but he does tell me that he loved to teach, and see young minds grow.

It's a sad reality how a man's whole career or life can end because 1 student sees fit to make false accusations, and after, regardless of the resolution, there is no consecuences to that student, she might accuse her bf of rape, or go around her workspace accusing people of harassment, and without doubt, her victims are fucked, and nothing will come back to bite her ass.",RichiZ2,t2_eljp1id,38,0,reddit3

No, we think that not due to them being inferior, but being feminine. Women should do feminine things, men should not, that is the logic. Teaching is not feminine, btw. Actually most teachers used to be men, and teaching used to be male only in some cultures.

&#x200B;

\>The reason most men loose custody over their own children is because child care is seen as an inferior pursuit 

&#x200B;

No, it's because child care is seen as a feminine thing to do, which makes sense, because nurturing is a feminine thing. And, gender roles should play no role in court anyways, so none of that matters. You don't make laws and legal judgements based on feelings, or opinions, but facts. Factually, both parents should have parental rights, regardless of how anyone feels about that.

I have tried for years to be reasonable and understanding towards feminism and feminists alike. I have read feminist literature and interacted with them. You are actually right to a degree‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt all vile, man hating devils, not on the surface anyway. Some are more obvious than others but those are almost charicatures to the point I don‚Äôt let them color my opinion. 

What I DO let color my opinion of feminists is the news articles on which women who will never know what it‚Äôs like to be men tell us our innermost thoughts and vile they are. When boys are told their natural behaviors and ways of acting are wrong and ‚Äúnot suitable for the kinder gentler world‚Äù feminist-aligned teachers and parents want to bring about. 

It‚Äôs when mothers talk about resentment towards their unborn or small child because he‚Äôs male. Or when she neglects his needs because ‚Äúthe world will take care of him‚Äù. Or when a wealthy father proudly brags about unequally dividing his children‚Äôs inheritance so his daughter gets more than her brother, to ‚Äúmake up for the hardships she‚Äôs going to face as a woman‚Äù. And yes these are real articles written by real people!

Feminists believe in the Patriarchy; it‚Äôs a cornerstone of their ideology. The idea that through the ages men have oppressed women and kept them under their foot. Feminists have different reactions to this idea, ranging from hateful to pitying as though we men need to be saved from ourselves. 

But the examples I gave? That is the worst result of their precious patriarchy theory. Hatred and animosity towards men and boys, even their own kin at worst. It twists men too, turning us against our own kind when we need to be united more than ever. 

So Patriarchy theory=anti male. Having anti male beliefs= enemy of men and boys. Feminists have anti male beliefs as a large part of their movement.",Enzi42,t2_h7uw2,7,0,reddit3

gr0vyda,t1_gr0prpi,2021-03-15 15:59:13,MensRights,"Serious question, what goes through your mind when you read ""If the patriarchy truly existed, none of the things listed above would have happened"", how did you make the leap from issues that men face almost uniquely would not really be issues if men had all the control, and relate that to women voting and owning property?

I am genuinely asking.  What makes you read something about what men face today and immediately jump to non related women's issues from 100 years ago?

I am 100% genuinely asking as I and many others would love to know the mind set so we can better work with people like yourself.  Because one of the biggest problem this entire movement faces is when we say men have a problem *today*, old laws or anecdotal stories that pretty much effect everyone are always brought into the fold to take the conversation away from the topics in which we started discussion. 

I mean, should men go around saying our grandfathers and great grandfathers were drafted, forced to kill and even die against their will, strictly and only because they were male and hold that against women and demand more and more for men of today? This is a direct result of women's suffrage because they *fought to be treated as superior* and NOT be draft eligible for voting as men are.  And men STILL have to sign up for conscription or lose the right to vote.  This is why 100% of conscripted deaths are men. I mean that was only 50ish years ago last time it happened, it's much more recent that suffrage.

Oh yeah. And the only people reporting on this attribute it to misogyny. 

[This article](https://www.wokefather.com/sexism/4-laws-that-openly-discriminate-against-men/) references some of the main issues where men are significantly discriminated against. Namely, selective service, the definition of rape not covering forced penetration (where the man is forced by a woman to penetrate her vagina), paternity, and a few other topics. 

[Here‚Äôs a UN report](https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/afghanistan_protection_of_civilians_annual_report_2018_final_24_feb_2019_0.pdf#page19) on the impact of wars on civilians. You will find it interesting that only women and children are mentioned. Men as civilians are not considered or even giving passing thought. The UN has a pattern of this. 

An example from this pandemic, [Canada‚Äôs new 2021 stimulus package](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2020/12/17/canadas-stimulus-package-1200-stimulus-checks-plus-a-dose-of-sexism/?sh=3bfa7a7e33f1) assumes that if a child is with a male and a female parent in a household, the *female* parent is the default, and should receive the check. Yet if the male is the primary parent, he must send in a form with a *signed letter from the woman* declaring him the default parent. Why is that? Governments shouldn‚Äôt be dealing with this in a gendered manner at all. This hurts both men and women. 

[This article](https://quillette.com/2020/07/27/the-myth-of-pervasive-misogyny/) discusses the myth that feminists perpetuate. They call it ‚Äúpervasive misogyny‚Äù and this article addresses that. 

Here, [an example from the white feather campaign](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/world-history/history-of-the-first-world-war-in-100-moments/a-history-of-the-first-world-war-in-100-moments-white-feather-for-winner-of-victoria-cross-9352952.html) where women shamed men who were not in uniform. They took *so enthusiastically* to this campaign that they artificially inflated the price of white feathers. Most of these men couldn‚Äôt vote yet, and they still shamed them into volunteering, and also continued to campaign for the right to vote *for women only*. 

An example from today, [a study on how men are now extremely underrepresented in higher education](https://cfey.org/2016/07/white-working-class-boys-higher-education-widening-participation/) and how this gap has been increasing for some time now.

I believe in using strong (not usually profane) language to name things in these sorts of discussions. Perhaps you are a feminist or identify with them? 

If that‚Äôs the case then I‚Äôm sorry you are offended but I don‚Äôt think what I said is wrong. 

Feminism casts ALL men as an oppressor class by virtue of being born into this world as a male. This belief infects their interactions and is disseminated to others. 

What else would you call them in this situation? That is an enemy. This isn‚Äôt one of those situations in which disagreement can exist harmlessly. The belief that another person belongs to a group that inflicts suffering on your kind will always have negative effects.

I also not say patriarchy was the same as hatred for men. I said that patriarchy theory and belief in it will ALWAYS lead to hatred and negativity towards men, demonstrated by the examples I‚Äôve given...some of which included turning on their own family.

Entertaining the idea that I and other men are part of an oppressor group is not nuanced‚Äîit‚Äôs self loathing and I will have no part of it for myself or any other man I can prevent from going down that road. 

Also what some of nuance can be had? A discussion with feminists always is framed through the idea that even though patriarchy harms men and women, men created it. Whether subtly or overtly the ‚Äúmen did this to yourselves‚Äù attitude seeps into the dialogue.

And finally from an emotional standpoint‚Äîwho the hell wants to have any kind of negotiations with those who think you are inferior/tainted/bad by nature of your birth? It‚Äôs like one side approaching on their knees while the other stands tall.

I‚Äôll have to decline the Menslib offer. I lurked there for a long time but have lost faith in it.

All they‚Äôll do is taint what is a very vulnerable and important undertaking.

The compsci professor was a genuinely nice old man that actually tried to get to know his students while giving us coding lessons, he wasn't abrasive or hostile about anything, if we had questions he would slow down and make sure we all understood before moving on, he made himself available if people needed to talk about issues at home and whatnot. But the history teacher, he made it very clear from the start he was an ardent feminist, atheist, anything you'd expect to hear from a proud democrat supporter on Twitter (I'm not trying to get political, that's just the kind of guy he was). History prof was practically the spitting image of what you'd expect a man who tries too hard to be a man is like: he was cocky, aggressive, if he found someone that wasn't in one of his group, and practically everyone here would count in that, he'd immediately try to fight with them and assert himself over them, it was honestly frustrating to have to take that guy's class because I felt like even talking to him was going to make him bite my head off, and he's supposed to be the one we look up to in class.

You're looking at the word ""cuck"" and you're imagining soft-natured guys that are getting crapped on for not being manly enough, but I'm seeing those male teachers promoting a feminist agenda like Mr. history prof ready to just threaten and silence and indoctrinate kids instead of teaching them responsibly.

I agree with this TBH. My gf gets bad periods and always has to take leave for it. That said, not all women have it so bad they need the day off, and they'll now get an additional 12 days leave compared to their male co-workers, which is quite a lot (most places dont even have that much sick leave or annual leave). 

Also my problem with the thinking ""accept the biological differences"" is that it is not applied consistently. For example - feminists demand equal pay and other outcomes like 50% of executives or the board be women, after they cut their career short to be mothers (or now take period leave). So ignoring the fact men are biologically wired to work more and pursue higher job titles.

  Or demanding 50% of engineers/tech workers be women, completely ignoring the fact men are more likely to enter these jobs from a biological standpoint (men are more likely to be builders, creators, tinkerers). 

Basically it seems feminists only ""accept the biological differences"" when and only when it benefits women.

Ie, unless he complied with all the medical demand, he would have to pay the employee a full salary to do nothing.

You know what my uncle did ? He paid for the equipment, he paid for mandatory training for all employees so that they'd know what to do if the employee in question had a seizure or any other medical emergency at work.

Exactly. I had maybe one day last year where I experienced deliberating pain at work to the point I had to ask my employer to go to the pharmacy across the street and get some some painkillers. I took the painkillers, sat down in the office for 20 minutes and I was good to work again. 

If the day off a month was paid I'd probably take leave regardless of having my period or not, cause who doesn't want to get paid for not doing work? However, if the day off a month is an unpaid day, I probably wouldn't take it more than needed. 

I think unpaid leave is fine, but to pay women for not working one day a month every month is just incentivising them to not work whetter they have a period or not.

Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; however this would also mean if she did end up having a painful period she would've used her time (depending on how this policy works ).


By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

One thing I do agree with is that this policy unfoundedly assumes that all women have painful periods; that's not true, and it may become stigmatised to take leave on that basis.

With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive.

No they aren't. The day off is explicitly only for women and transgender persons, regardless if they experience period. There are no special day offs for other conditions as far as I'm aware. 

>And 'transgender' probably refers to female to male transgenders 

The policy expressively stated all women and transgender employees. 

>Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; 

As far as I know, female employees are not required to prove that they're on their period in order to apply for this leave. This is in line with some organisations that provide similar schemes. 

>By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

It's one day per month. I do not think a doctor's note is required as it is not categorised as a variant of sick leave. 

>With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? 

Because it's objectively unfair and recognising its unfairness and advocating for more conditions to be included aren't mutually exclusive. There has been some progress for Flipkart where they increase paid paternity leave from 10 to 15 days. That's a good sign but it's trivial when compared to their paid maternity leave scheme, which stands at 6 months with full pay. Mothers also have the option to choose 4 months of flexible work arrangement with full pay (3 months for fathers with no guarantee of full pay) and 1 year (only 3 months for fathers) of unpaid leave. The most blatant discrimination (other than the one in OP's topic) is that adoptive mothers (who do not experience postpartum recovery) get 6 months of paid leave whilst adoptive fathers only get 6 weeks, regardless of extent of caregiving. 

>And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive. I just find this all this outrage ridiculous and out of place, when there's more to be concerned with. 

All employees of Flipkart get 20 days of annual leave, 12 days of sick leave, 2 days of optional holidays and 1 day of special leave. They also get 5 days of marriage leave and unlimited bereavement (compassionate) leave. The introduction of this scheme effectively means female and transgender employees get 13 days of special leave, compared to the 1 day male employees get. 

Flipkart employs around 42145 employees. According to my knowledge, most technicians and delivery personnel are men, so no, I do not believe they have a substantially larger female employee base, not that it should matter anyway.",Solid-Perspective98,t2_8i5ikeia,1,0,reddit4

All humans start with having a monthly hormone cycle function (I believe it‚Äôs hypothalamus that does it). in the uterus for those that get the androgen production signal (from SRY gene, commonly on Y chromosome), that cycle function turns off since testosterone production in males follows a daily cycle rather than monthly. 

The hypothesis around why taking estrogen as hrt for transgender women brings back a sort of monthly cyclical pattern is because that hypothalamus function like reactivates. 

cramps, sore breasts, mood swings (what we typically attribute as PMS). Some can like tell when they period week is supposed to be. It‚Äôs not for everyone but it has been documented by some.

Actually, No. Equity is best defined as this- 

[https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509](https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509)

And I never saw this as a part of the ""feminist propaganda"".

There are things that I agree with on both sides and there are things on which I disagree with both sides. That does not say that I am tilted/with one side completely. 

In fact, my take on the whole gender issue is this-

If you look at the picture that I have linked above, you will see that one person has advantage and still is being given the same opportunity as the other, when they don't even need it.

I think that is the case on both sides. There are things and laws that women don't need but still they are being given more and also, there are things that men desperately require to achieve equal status in the society but they are STILL being denied those things. But, please understand when I say this, that this does NOT mean that there aren't things that women are disadvantaged at too, just like MEN are Disadvantaged in certain aspects of life!!! Both sides have certain disadvantages where they require some support to maintain equity!!! And while the feminists (the more public ones in my opinion) are only interested in gaining the required support for women, the MRAs (some of them, NOT the majority of them) are interested in gaining the required support for men. Notice that the ratio of people on both sides working ""only"" for the specific gender is different (for feminists, there is a majority like that: and for MRAs, there is minority for that- the rest of the members in both groups are striving for true equity, but sadly the disparity and disagreement between the two groups has not been able to help them achieve the said purpose).

As we know that a lot of ""feminazis"" have always fought for even more and more rights for women even though it may require them to Step on Men's rights to achieve it. They think- ""Hey!! How come Men get to do that!!!! We also want to do that!!!"" - even though the task at hand is something that they don't have a need to do. And that is exactly where we criticize them and distance ourselves from them. But doing the same thing that they are doing just makes us as petty as them!!

I never faced any criticism for my views on this subreddit before and I have always provided with gender-neutral views on anything. This is the first time that my gender neutral view has been soo criticized even though I am not completely disagreeing with you. I have my own opinion which I have formed after having seen both sides' point of view and I think I am happy with my opinion, even if other people may find it to be ""feminist propaganda""- which it isn't. 

I don't think that we should criticize giving them a day off, because periods can be a lot painful for some women. I always thought that a thing like this would always be appreciated in this subreddit because I have seen people in this subreddit being supportive to both genders, not just one, and that is what made me like this subreddit more, But alas, there will always be some people who will always see things from only one side of things and not both sides.

In procreation contexts it means what gametes one produces. female/male is a designation for plants too for example. if we are talking about procreation contexts for humans if can be done but we need to remember that is a very narrow section of human sexuality so isn‚Äôt absolute truth. it looks at a human from the perspective of just intercourse for procreation, assuming heterosexual and only having sex for procreation. 

In more society based contexts ‚Äúfemale‚Äù is a phenotypic sex designation usually, so genitalia shape. That is how the F or M gender marker is assigned. When there is an intersex infant that has a penis that is considered too small for the doctor‚Äôs liking, they can perform surgery to turn the infant ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. Even if it could have XY chromosomes and gonads were supposed to be producing sperm. (yes this is very common for intersex infants who have a penis too small for our society‚Äôs definition of male so they mutilate it for the sole reason of fitting into the sex dyad) 

woman is a gender identity and is not synonymous with female.

There can be women and non-binary and intersex and female and whatever designation of human you want to be put there since it‚Äôs not all men or male humans. The premise is to consider humans that are in the larger and stronger end of the spectrum, which isn‚Äôt gendered. 

When you gender things it creates a lot of problems. Such as gendering sexual assault. Right now it‚Äôs marketed as a woman problem so men have to fight to get it acknowledged for them too. or we could have just not gendered it and it would have eliminated a lot of issues and people would have actually started to understand how sexual assault works. 

not all human female menstruate. women is a gender identity. if you don‚Äôt want to be transphobic and want to understand the full complexity around how people work you need to separate female and woman. because really those are different things. woman as human female is a very simplistic definition for those that don‚Äôt study human sexuality as a science.

Man and woman is not genetics. Notice how neither are the stereotypes you used are genetics. 

Man and woman are now words to describe gender identities that are on a spectrum. Just like non-binary. Eventually those labels will drop since they keep growing. You have bigender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer too. Usually when terms keep growing it‚Äôs because we are working on a spectrum but people don‚Äôt see it this way yet. Sexuality is a spectrum so labels will keep growing until people realize you can‚Äôt label every variation and there is no point. So people will just be allowed to date/have sex with whoever they feel like without labeling it. it is difficult to label human experiences into neat boxes. 

Like right now the terms ‚Äútrans masculine‚Äù or ‚Äúpresenting femme‚Äù are getting used. Instead of gender identity like man or woman. 

A more higher approach to think of it is forget everything you know about gender. Stop gendering everything like bathrooms, pronouns, clothes, sleeping areas. Stop assuming things about people based off their body parts. You now are left with just humans with various genitals shape, various hormones, expressing themselves as they wish, dressing how they wish, no laws restricting anything by gender or genitals or bodily function. If someone wishes to adjust their gender expression with hormones or surgery then that is easily given to them. 

A world where the concept of gender becomes irrelevant is called gender inclusive which is what we are moving to. It is in essence the point of real feminism. Gender equity.

If you have some sexual orientation it has nothing to do with whether you are man or woman.

It's biology not psychology or social studies.

Definition of women is human female and definition of men is human male.

If you want to change definitions to fit your views then you are destroying the language. It's like this is the only true God.

Plus gender at first was to categorize things in genders.

There is a reason why in different languages they don't use translation for gender but go with the English word.

A lot of languages they have three genders masculine, feminine and neutral. For example Germany has Der die das.

English was gendered once too and you have up on that.

Now if you want to go by gender stereotypes. Like okay this woman doesn't fit the stereotype of a woman so it is a man is really weird.

And then once again how would you make sure the person is menstruating.

And even in sexual assault it is good to specify the gender. For example woman is more likely to be SA by a man and vice versa.

And even if it wouldn't be gendered it will be men perpetrator women victim.

Like in all the articles about women being raped in military. Yes tragedy but why it never stated who raped them. In cases of men it states that it is done by other men. In women cases where they are victims nothing. Nothing about the perpetrator. So people will go to default it is men.

That is the point you need the gendered language because there are differences.

Women are more likely to develop breast cancer than men.

The other way to approach this - and this is what society currently wants - is to go full equality. The catch is that this only applies to women.

Transgender men can ask to not have periods because they cause gender dysphoria. Anyone else regardless of gender identity can ask to not have periods, they aren‚Äôt necessary. Because there are currently methods to stop them by taking birth control non-stop. The placebo week is not mandatory. It was there to give periods so people verify they are not pregnant.

Taking Depo Provera, a shot every 3 months, and having IUD which is in the uterus for 5 years before changed also has the effect of stopping periods. There is no placebo week with Depo Provera or IUD.

It is literally the definition for woman and man.

The same for animals. 

And once again you need to gender sexual assault. So you have best statistics that you can get. I would even push them more. From hetero, homo, trans... To get as precise data as possible.

If you put it out and only go with perpetrator and victim.

1. Everyone would still assume men perpetrator women victim.

2. You are destroying the data.

If one years there would be extremely high peak in female victims okay something bad happened. If there would be significant drop in male victims. Okay we did something really good.

Like the one with 40 000 men survey that they were doing annually in one city. Always it was like 5% victims.

Then one year they had 33% so they started to freak out and looking for any clue. And lo and behold in that year there was huge coming out of male football players that got sexually assaulted by their coach. Which means more of the men reported it and got to know what is the definition of it.

There has been studies done that those that were on birth control more of their life or were pregnant for more parts of their life so had less cycles and less of those hormone fluctuations (since birth control keeps same hormone level and being pregnant stops period) has lower risk of cancer in those reproductive organs.

A small amount of the endometrial lining must stay to keep the capillaries closed (it bleeds because it‚Äôs like a wound, endometrial layer flakes off due to hormone drop so until a new layer builds on top the exposed capillaries have blood come out). If there is no cycling of hormones due to the constant birth control then the endometrial lining stays thin and intact. that‚Äôs all. 

Lot‚Äôs of people go on birth control to stop periods. 

lmao did you just claim that stopping periods will have a woman die???
Tell me again why that is, I missed this explanation. 

Trans men need hormone blockers only if they start transitioning pre-puberty. That stops the development of puberty we associate with women. They then need to take testosterone hrt to develop the puberty we associate with men. If the trans man went through the woman-associated puberty they just need to take testosterone to get the masculinizing effects. There isn‚Äôt like ‚Äúcancelling out‚Äù for trans men that ovaries still produce estrogen. Trans women on the other hand do need hormone blockers at any stage (pre-puberty or post-puberty). Since testosterone effects can overpower feminizing hrt. [notice how since testosterone overpowers feminizing effects in transgender women taking estrogen, it is unnecessary to block estrogen in trans men. They just need the testosterone added on top]

Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal. 

That‚Äôs the original way birth control was invented but today we use it for other things. Originally Viagara was for regulating blood pressure. Today it‚Äôs used for something else because we found more use for this invention. 

There are no consequences to skipping placebo well. There have been many studies done to show this is okay. where are you getting your information from? 

No lol. Tell me how an IUD has a ‚Äúplacebo week‚Äù. Tell me how Naxplenon has ‚Äúplacebo week‚Äù

Then your mom should go to a doctor that will give proper methods for her goal. If she was getting pain then that‚Äôs not the right method. 

How is stopping periods unsafe?

What‚Äôs the problem with the number of hysterectomy going down? Our birth control is free up to age 25 so maybe people are choosing that method to stop periods. Anyone can access transgender health care. Don‚Äôt want breasts? Say they are annoying and lowering your quality of life, and free mastectomy. Say periods are annoying and lower quality of life, and free hysterectomy. 

People can have control over their bodies. We don‚Äôt gatekeep abortion just like don‚Äôt gatekeep not having a period.

The great thing is with today‚Äôs technology people can choose to not menstruate if they don‚Äôt want to. Periods are no longer necessary.

Before puberty the body is getting ready to menstruate. After menopause we stop because the body got rid of the ""eggs"". And during pregnancy the ""period blood"" is what helps the baby grow. There is a reason women have periods naturally. 

>Gynaecologists know it is unnecessary if someone doesn‚Äôt want it. 

Gynecologist know how important it is for most women to have their period, only a few get recommended stopping it and only for medical reasons.

By flowing the body with too many hormones without knowing the consequences.

>Tell me how an IUD has a ‚Äúplacebo week‚Äù. Tell me how Naxplenon has ‚Äúplacebo week‚Äù

The way the hormones get to the body is different and those also don't stop periods. Many women that use them can tell you that.

>hen your mom should go to a doctor that will give proper methods for her goal. If she was getting pain then that‚Äôs not the right method.

You are using a law for transgender people as if is valid for cisgender women. That is not how it works. Also long-term effects of hysterectomies: it can increase the risk of stroke, bone loss, heart attacks and urinary issues. Most hysterectomies are done to women above 35. 

>Pople can have control over their bodies. We don‚Äôt gatekeep abortion just like don‚Äôt gatekeep not having a period.

I was on depoprovera, the side effects were extreme for me. Depression, extreme anxiety to the point where I couldn't eat, painful acne that I couldn't get rid of no matter what and am still battling after being off of birth control, mood swings, irritability, constant headaches, constant bleeding, weight gain, extreme pain during sex, tearing and bleeding in my vagina, and complete lack sex drive which kind of defeats the point of being on birth control in the first place. I would bleed every two weeks for two weeks straight. I never had an irregularities in my period before. I switched for my physical and mental health.

I tried a different brand of bc pills, less side effects than Depo, but I still didn't feel like myself and it still made my life more difficult than necessary. 

I have been off birth control for a whole year now and I am finally in a good place, I can feel emotions again, I have a sex drive, my periods are regular and manageable, I'm not crying all the time, I'm back to my normal size, I feel good and life is really good for me. I'm not gonna go back on birth control just because some guy on the internet said I should to stop my periods (which bc doesn't even do for me in the first place actually just makes them worse). 

The point is, every person is different. SOME people are able to stop their period with bc and like it that way, but that IS NOT the case for every woman and it may be a good decision for some, but for others it's not what's in their best medical interest. And you cannot just ignore the adverse effects the medication does have in the body, it is a major hormone alteration and it's not as simple as you think it is.

The recent statistic from a gynaecologist I know for IUD success rate at stopping periods is 2/3. With Depo Provera it‚Äôs less than 5% have periods.

It‚Äôs not too many hormones. It‚Äôs a certain amount that is needed to get the desired effect. It would be the same amount as what your body produces itself during the luteal phase. Anything more would not be useful so doctors can regulate that to be the amount.

Any human can access transgender labeled care. But also in my country I already explained that just going through a gynaecologist can allow someone to get a hysterectomy. They just keep the ovaries in. While the transgender route can remove ovaries too. All those bad side effects you listed for hysterectomy is if ovaries are removed without hrt. So you would be missing a sex hormone. In itself not having a uterus doesn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs just removing an organ that someone doesn‚Äôt need, like removing an appendix.

People have periods because it‚Äôs what a human body can have. But with current technology we can eliminate the inconvenience since it‚Äôs no longer a mandatory inconvenience.

I am an active Men's Right supporter and look down on discrimination like this but I have to realize that its the exact same thing as someone yelling out **""Nigger!""** or **""Faggot!""**

I have only experienced the best treatment from women in my nursing experience and only find myself thinking bad things in the general direction of angry feminists when I read lots of unfortunate stories often posted on this sub-reddit.

I try to convince myself that the real world is not that bad, and that we only get people posting negative situations, you rarely get a post saying ""Hey I'm a guy and I was treated well by my wife during my divorce proceeding"".

**Making the complaint was a great move, it can protect yourself from any bullshit that that particular person may make up to further her political agenda**

I recommend taking this in your stride and always having your chin up when you are nursing, some days you get bad situations, other days are great!

I have often been in a situation which is not too different from your's!

I am a young male and looking after 18 -30 y.o patients is always uncomfortable but they are always happy to have me as their nurse and am never denied the opportunity to watch procedures (some quite invasive).

Were I a mother in labor I would much prefer assistance someone who has been through this procedure before as opposed to not. You are a health care provider, people's lives depend on you. By denying you some form of education or experience that person would have negatively impacted, to some degree, your ability to not only perform your job but to provide adequate care. Your inexperience could have both led to you providing inadequate care or being less equipped for your job. It is just highly unethical to do so. Now, I imagine that you would have seen or worked through some similar scenarios in the future but it is still no acceptable to deny someone an education. 

I do not care what that person's reasons were because all I know is that you were singled out and that alone is wrong. The rationale behind that does not matter much to me. The issue, as I see it, is not so much a men's rights issue as it is an issue of impairing your ability to perform your job. The motive was sexist, the crime would have been worse. 

I would advise against bringing up sex and gender when discussing this with either supervisors or administrators. That bias is obviously there and present in the dialogue alone. Your issue is not the bias but the result of it. 

Now, to play devil's advocate I do have to say that there could have been a pseudo-legitimate reason to do what that person did. In our society a nurse is traditionally female, that is changing to be sure, and some people are actually uncomfortable with male nurses. The intention may have been less to keep you out of something as it may have been to keep the patient comfortable. I know that you mentioned that your brought up the idea of asking the patient but I would think that asking a woman in labor might not be a good idea. I don't know the state of the mother at that time. 

Gender bias certainly existed in your scenario. But what was the intent? It is understandable that some people will be uncomfortable with male nurses, as some are with female doctors. If the intent was to keep the patient comfortable then I am not too concerned, there are worse things happening.

c1zerjb,t3_hyddl,2011-06-13 12:38:35,MensRights,"Well, I hate to be the lone voice of dissent here, but here goes:

I'm no nurse, doctor, med student, or anything like that, so I can't relate directly. However, as a male patient, there are some times when I'd prefer to have a *male* nurse/doctor looking after me (basically, any time my gentlemen's sausage was involved or could be seen easily). For example, if I were getting a hernia check during a physical and I had a female nurse/doctor, I would be fine with it - but if I somehow had a choice, I'd choose a male doctor 9 times out of 10. Similarly, having been taken care of by both female and male nurses in the past, I have no preference between the two, but I'm more comfortable with the male nurses in general but willing to be more emotional with the female.

I don't think you should take it so personally. It's the same socially - in certain situations, we're more comfortable with certain genders. Whether you agree with that or not isn't really the point; you'll be dealing with people who are in pain, sometimes agony, and that's not the best time to get all hot and bothered about gender issues.

Just my humble $.02 :)

You were right to file a complaint, although I hope you realize that sometimes the female patients will legitimately be nervous having a man in the room.  I know I wouldn't want a male nurse in the same room with me for some procedures, just because I'd be embarrassed.  

One interesting thing about nursing that my mom shared with me was about the pay.  When she worked at a hospital in Pennsylvania, the entire nursing staff was warned that it was against the rules to tell anyone else how much their paychecks were.  Of course, the staff shared this information anyway and all the male nurses were making about $200 more a pay period than the female nurses, despite the fact that they all had the same job title.  

My mom never complained about it to anyone but her family and they're probably still doing this today, but, yeah, the reason I tell you this story is because nurses are often treated unfairly in a bunch of really unexpected ways.

Forum reply from ""Unknown Nurse""  
  
I am very surprised that so many people do not believe this happens. It does not happen that often. I am a nurse and worked with one Doctor who was a female and her and I would talk about and laugh about all the guys that would come in for their yearly physicals and get an erection during the exam. I personally have seen many of them during my initial run through after I have asked them to disrobe down to their underwear. amoungst all those men who got an erection during their exam there were a few who ejaculated. Both myself and the Doctor I worked for joked about how we helped them along a little. 
The most obvious incident occured when the Doctor was seeing her one of her regular patients who was in his mid 20's. She informed me that on previous exams he had gotten an erection and that his penis was very large probably around 9"". She asked if I wanted to assist her during the exam. I jumped at the chance to see this. 

Both her and I talk regularly about sex with our husbands and we are very sexual oriented people outside of work. So to have her ask me to assist during the exam so I could see this guy's large package was not out of the ordinary. 

So sure enough as soon as the Doctor starts checking him over while he is wearing nothing but the gown he was given it became obivous he had an erection. And by the looks of how far he was sticking out it had to be as big as she told me. At one point she looked at me and winked. She then asked him to take off the robe and left him standing naked with the biggest erection I had ever seen! Both the doctor and I smiled at each other hoping he did not notice. He apologized and we both told him it was normal and he had nothing to be embarressed about. So the doctor began the usual exam but what I noticed first is that she was not wearing gloves like we usually do. I knew then that she had something up her sleeve. She began to exam his testicles and at one point said she felt a possible lump and asked him if it would be ok if the nurse could check it also. She looked toward me and smiled as he was behind her at that point. I got down with no gloves either and checked his scrotumn. I have never done this before medically but pretended I knew what I was doing. His penis started to jerk back and forth as I felt up his balls. I wanted to grab that big penis in my hands but felt that would go to far. I told the doctor that I too possibly felt a bump. She jumped back in and felt him up again and I could tell by the look on the patients face he was liking all the attention. The Doctor then said that it might be due to a back up in sperm in the scrotumn. She told the patient that she would need to use some lubricant on his penis and scrotumn to get a better feel as to how far to goes up the shaft of his penis. He seemed to be ok with this as he stated he understood. I thought for sure he had to know that we were only doing this for our satisfaction but I think he did not care as he enjoyed it also. So to my amazement the doctor grabbed a hold of the lubricant and applied it to his penis and began to massage the length of it. She asked me if I would like to give it a try and I again jumped in there and grabbed his huge penis. I began to massage his penis up and down pretending to feel for any lumps. I could her him begin to breathe heavy and his penis was so large and hard in my hands that I knew he was close. Sure enough a moment later and he shot sperm all over the floor, my arm and hand. He aplogized up and down about what happened but the doctor explained that that was probably the problem and everything seem to be better now. She finished up the exam as she usually does as though nothing had happened and scheduled him for another apointment. 

when she was done we both left him to get dressed and talked about what had happened and agreed never to tell anyone. What she also told me is that she had done that to other male patients before. So it does happen!  ",RonaldFuckingPaul,t2_336ff,-5,0,reddit1

>In our society a nurse is traditionally female, that is changing to be sure, and some people are actually uncomfortable with male nurses. The intention may have been less to keep you out of something as it may have been to keep the patient comfortable.

Picture it this way to help you see your bias:

""In our society a nurse is traditionally white, that is changing to be sure, and some people are actually uncomfortable with black nurses. The intention may have been less to keep you out of something as it may have been to keep the patient comfortable.

Would you leap to the defense of a nurse who refused to even ask a patient permission, because it might make them 'uncomfortable'?

>Gender bias certainly existed in your scenario. But what was the intent? It is understandable that some people will be uncomfortable with male nurses, as some are with female doctors. If the intent was to keep the patient comfortable then I am not too concerned, there are worse things happening. If it was that person's personal belief that males are ill-suited for that situation then there is a problem.

So you have no problems at all with an administration perfectly willing to deliver gender-biased educational opportunity?  Maybe only so long as it's done with 'proper motivations'?  

The INTENT is paramount?

As an RN you can work anywhere from public/private hospitals, doctor's clinics, large community medical centers to working in the mining sector up in Western Australia!

The pay is generally much better here than in the US, an student who has just graduated from the 3 year course will earn 50-65,000$AUD which is about $75-80,000USD with the way the exchange rate is going.

After doing your first year here you earn more, easily in the mid 70's to the low 100's after counting up all the night shifts and weekends + holidays.

You get really good holiday and sick leave here as well, and you can easily get 3+ weeks of holidays each 6-12 months!

The great thing about working here is that you do not have to wait years to get into a nursing program like in the US, you do not need excellent GPA's to get in and once you graduate you simply apply for a grad position if you wish, otherwise you can go right to work - it is just more difficult to find interesting work (Mainly nursing homes and such).

There are A LOT of nurses here from countries such as the UK and the US - Because there was a shortage a few years back and there were big incentives for foreign grad students to come here.

Currently we have more of a bias to pick domestic students for graduate positions but the usually do this to avoid students who speak ZERO English from India/Sudan/etc and if you have good English they will take you in regardless of where you are from!

**It is pretty easy to move to Australia from the US as we have had good foreign relations since passing the trade agreement with the United States.**

There are definitely less overseas students trying to get into nursing here due to the quite high fees that foreign students pay at University **(15-20,000$ a year for a 3 year course + accommodation easily into the 40$k a year mark their parents have to pay)**

*Nursing has consistently been rated as the most respected and loved profession by the Australian public so you get nothing but respect over here from everyone in the public.*

**Nurses don't have to do much to maintain their registration over here - Just complete 12 hours of professional development every 12 months (such as seminars/workshops/etc) - and you are set for life!**

There is also a very high demand for nurses (particularly male) to teach students in University and Tertiary colleges, and you can easily land a part time teaching gig to go together with your regular work as a nurse.

*The Australian branch of MSF (Medicines sans Frontiers) - Doctor's without borders is also very respected around the world and you can easily do some work in a part of the world that needs it after working here (Or in the States I suppose) for 2 years.*

Because it may come off as uncouth, it is much simpler to simply present the issue then introduce something that may be seen as bias into it. The bias is there, it does not mean you go around screaming about it. Use tact.

>Picture it this way to help you see your bias:
""In our society a nurse is traditionally white, that is changing to be sure, and some people are actually uncomfortable with black nurses. The intention may have been less to keep you out of something as it may have been to keep the patient comfortable.
Would you leap to the defense of a nurse who refused to even ask a patient permission, because it might make them 'uncomfortable'?

Yes. Is it that alien? I would expect a health care professional to care about the comfort of their patients. And especially in a situation like child birth because it affects not only the mother but the child, to a degree. I fully understand that it negativity impacts a person like the OP but I am siding with patient care as they are not in a position to really choose. 

""Your bias""? What bias? I presented a scenario that may have occurred. I made no statement of how likely it was or how likely I think it was that it occurred. I only presented it as an option. I hope you are not insinuating that even considering other options in a scenario similar to the OPs is ""bias"", that is quite silly. 

>So you have no problems at all with an administration perfectly willing to deliver gender-biased educational opportunity? Maybe only so long as it's done with 'proper motivations'?

Did I say that anywhere? I only stated that if the scenario I presented was the case then it is understandable that it occurred. I did not say that it was right to do or that it even should have even occurred. I was only stating that it is possible that the rationale for it was not malicious in nature. Nothing more. Anything other than what I said was added by you.

>The INTENT is paramount?

What is the difference between murder and manslaughter? Our society focuses on intent because it is what matters. I would love to get behind moral absolutism but I have trouble seeing that an accidental action carries the same weight as one with intentional planning.

>Holy feminist apologist Batman!

Love it. Really, I do. Emotion, pure emotion. I love how it works. Nothing else, I have done the same.

>What you are saying is if she 'meant well', then her rank sexism is excusable, and moreover, that he should 'understand'.

I never said he should ""understand"" I only said it is understandable, as in it is possible to see a rationale behind the sexism. Sexism occurs all the time and some times it is warranted. Do I think it was warranted here? No, not really. 

>I suppose Blacks should 'understand' being denied entry - even the asking of permission - because it might make someone 'uncomfortable'?

If this situation were a restaurant then yes, I would agree that the whole issue of being comfortable is stupid and silly. However, we are talking about the well being of a mother in labor and, much more importantly, the unborn child. I would much rather put someone through some inconvenience than pass any risk on, due to the distress of the mother, to the child. Maybe my reservations are baseless and it would not matter but until I find out otherwise I would rather place my values as I had.

>Fuck you, you hateful cunt.

Now, hateful? I presented a valid, I certainly consider it valid given the scenario, situation where sexism might be rationally expected. I never said it should be tolerated or accepted. Only that it's existence should not be immediately taken as a gross injustice.

>Hey look! Blue bike! Purple cow!
(pay no attention to the fact that my vehement argument ignores the basic objection).

Some action are bad, but bad is subjective. A murder here does not equate to a murder there. Me killing my mother is not equal to me killing a worm. It only is equal in the semantical sense that a killing is a killing. You can justify anything. That does not make it right. One must consider the circumstances leading up to an action and from there decide if some one was in the wrong. 


>Feminist IS a dirty word. Like NAZI. You hateful evil tyrants DESERVE the reputation you have...one the 'ineffective' mens movement had no hand in forming, by the way.
That's right, your rep as hairy legged man hating lesbians is OTHER people's opinions, not ours.
We know you're far worse than that.

The traditional feminist strives for gender equality. The ""modern"" feminist strives for the empowerment of women, to the level, and above that, of men. 

Seriously, I subscribed to this sub-reddit because I generally believe in it's premise. I know the injustices that men face, I know the gender inequality that exists on both sides. I don't really need to defend my position. 

""your rep as hairy legged man hating lesbians""

I am going to make assumptions on what this means so that I can respond to it. 

I am male, always have been. I support gender equality. I do not think women need special privileges, nor do I think men do.  

>I am. And pointing out all the ways in which you are a hateful, sexist bitch.

Are you daft? Hateful? I presented another viewpoint to take and nothing more. I insulted you, not your gender or anything more than that. 

>Oh, believe me, my contempt for you was telegraphed intentionally.

I want to meet you in person. I think the both of us would enjoy a nice fist fight. Really. Live in the States by chance? Maybe we'll be lucky and can face each other. I'm tired of the internet for now. I want a fist battle. Violence is not the only answer, but it is an answer.

Read the entire witness statement. 

Look, there are plenty of cases where I've seen violent women be hypocritically defended, but if the witness checks out (which makes the police statement exceedingly problematic, or conversely the witness unreliable), this is clearly not one of them. She's 5 feet 2 for fucks sake^%. He allegedly threw her down a flight of stairs. And punched her, straight out. Are you seriously defending this shit? And god, some of the comments: *animal*, seriously? 

This sub has given me some great info and really helped me articulate some issues I've had with feminism for a while, but if the top comments to this story are about blindly defending this guy - *exactly what we accuse feminism of doing* - then what exactly is the difference between the two movements?  

%The stature is important because it is quite possible for somebody of his size to manage a violent person of that women's size without hurting them. That he chooses not to do so, is problematic. And yes, to preempt an obvious critique: I would use the same argument if it were a man of that stature. ",finebalance,t2_3stqp,-6,0,reddit2

So I guess mutilating people is over the line, yes?  Or no?  My point is that there is such a thing as measured response, and there is such a thing as going too far on one's response, and that to put all violent responses into a single bucket and consider them all equally justified is an idiotic over-simplification.

Those who get caught with fraud always ALWAYS try to manipulate perception in order to excuse the severity of punishment. They always come at it from an emotional reaction. Someone depressed and suicidal? People have compassion. Someone elderly who just wants to spend time with grandkids? People have compassion. Religious persecution? People have compassion. Claiming you were sexually assaulted? People will have compassion. So many are down voting whay I'm saying because they just want to shit on women because they are angry at women. This whole thing with her, isn't because she is a woman, it's because she is a sleezey piece of shit that will do whatever she can to get sympathy and pity and compassion to get out of trouble. No different than any of those who came before her and no different than those that will come after her will try to do. Emotional manipulation in financial fraud isn't strictly a female move, as it happens with anyone on this scale.

For example:
Jeff Skilling tried to claim sympathy because after he bankrupted Enron, he was too depressed and suicidal to be in federal prison.

Bernie Madoff tried to get only a 7 year sentence because he was old and tried to use the sympathy of elderly age and quality of life to justify why he should get a severe punishment. They tried to explain that it would be unfair to the grandchildren to deprive them of being able to spend time with their grandfather. Then in 2010 he tried to have his conviction over turned because his son committed suicide.

And you know these ""officers"" will only be looking at the men, who look at women, because that is the only type of looking that considered offensive or predatory.  And, clearly, it's deemed offensive and predatory because society clearly has a very negative attitude towards male heterosexuality and because it's become the norm to just presume that if a man looks at a woman, it is with ill or nefarious intent. They won't be policing this for women looking at other women, women looking at men or men looking at other men(ironically, if a man was to be upset by another men looking at him, he would be shamed as being homophobic).

 Imagine being so intolerant of male heterosexuality, that it's considered acceptable and commercially viable to police men for even looking at women. In what world would men be forced to require a woman's consent to even find her attractive or to desire her attention, yet still also call women oppressed? You will have parades and months to celebrate homosexuality, while openly shaming, vilifying and attacking men for their heterosexuality.

The nation that's gaining a reputation for being misandrists (woke countries)

This is the same nation that had some schools make school boys wear dresses for school

Singled out the boys to stand up in an assembly to apologise for crimes made by men towards women

And ran an advert campaign in cramberra called 'boys will be boys' which was later considered sexist

And once had sheilas wheels, an insurance company that discriminated men and became international until the uk and europe abolished seperate car insurance rates for women

2. Staring is rude
Thats what i was taught growing up, so nobody should be staring at anyone, least of all where alcohol is involved, because two guys staring at one another in a bar or club is likely to result in a fight.

Staring ar someone lustfully is just creepy (be it a man at a woman or a woman at a man), it kinda reminds me of the smiler logo (alton towers ride, google it if you dont know of it)

So for me its unnatural, so i do see their point on harrassment as it is antisocial behaviour

But... How does that get policed
Ie how do you tell the difference between a malicious stair vs an innocent one

Examples:

25 yr old in a club, sees a girl across the club, he thinks he went to school with, but cant be sure as shes older and hair style, colour changed and might of put on a bit of weight, might of lost a bit so face has a 80% recemblance

What if he has a lot on his mind and just staring into space but happens to be a girl other side, he isnt intending to stare at her his just dazed

Now this one is illegal, he could be on drugs and monged, again his no threat to the girl, he isnt thinking of the girl, he just isnt concious of his actions because his drugged up (i suppose the club will welcome kicking him out for licence purposes)


What does amaze me is
In the late 90s early 2000s it was considered more risky to meet people online and unsafe vs a pub or a club, now this article is saying, dont come to the club to pick up a partner

Scenario 2:

that's why it's always going to be enabled by rich capitalist men at the very top pretending to be white knights who are for things like this bc it reinforces their dominance hierarchy and gives them permission to publicly shame to make examples of their competition when an opportunity comes up to spin a situation to make something innocent appear malevolent, bc it makes them more powerful as well. so it's a win win for women and rich men. 


bc obviously this bar owner who's implementing this system is immune from being kicked out of his own club no matter how many women he approaches or what actual sexual harassment he does. 


rules for thee but not for me is the history of our species, its important to remember that freedom and democracy are the exception not the rule. in every system except democracy, dumb rules exactly like this were used to keep the average guy down with stupid rules like royalty, caste systems and bullshit religious customs. and now the feminist agenda is trying to bring those same dumb types of customs to a free democratic state. 


it's no exaggeration to say bringing violence and the police state into nightclubs is an attack on men's freedom. creepy men who get handsy or aggressive and sexually harass women are already kicked out of clubs or pulled away by men like you and me bc 99% of men AREN'T criminals. only 1% is. so an unnecessary extra - ""don't even look or talk to them"" without asking rule on 100% of men that they're trying to enforce , is only made so they can abuse it on people they dislike.

""The fresh policy states that ""Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to 'pick up'"".


when people want to go to a place to not be picked up and hangout with only their friends and family - they go to a fucking restaurant where you get your own table and it's considered taboo for strangers to approach YOUR table and try to pick you up. 


restaurants are perfectly happy to serve your exclusive group of friends just drinks instead of food as long as you're paying their upcharges and everyone expects to be kicked out if they're disturbing guests with horniness bc it's not the place for it. that's what this ""club"" should switch to- a fucking restaurant.


but when people want to meet new strangers to pickup - they go to bars and clubs.


of course people are usually more subtle about it instead of being that obvious about it going up to each other saying - ""hey , we're at a bar/club instead of a restaurant , so we obviously both want to fuck, let's go fuck."" 


sure, some people do the direct approach with the ol ""do you wanna get out of here?"" - and sometimes it works tbh 


other times it doesn't work, so they're simply told no thank you. 


and 99% of the time that's fine and everyone goes on with their lives bc we all accept that we're adults and we risk the slight discomfort of being propositioned if you go to a place designed for propositions... what do they think alcohol - the sole beverage of nightclubs - is for ?



 it's for getting enough liquid courage to talk to strangers and ask each other out. how that's done is usually polices itself by what works individually- very good looking guys get success by doing pretty much anything. less good looking guys have to be a little more personable a little more creative and of course buying women alcohol helps them get success too.


but to single handedly attempt to police drunk people even TALKING to each other ? ya i don't see that ending well. why not just go to a Christian dance at that point? either their atmosphere is going to be so incredibly dry and boring that they'll make the already difficult low margin nightclub business even harder than it already is and go broke.


or it'll somehow work and people will come and try to play their stupid little feminist game to impress each other - for a whole 6 months while the fad is cool- and then move on to everywhere that's not so uptight. 


so it'll hopefully fail sooner than later. bc if this shit catches on it's the end of nightclub culture . creepy guys already get kicked out of nightclubs, they don't need to kick out regular guys just for shooting their shots where they should be shooting their shots.",mindset_grindset,t2_h9cqpgm0,14,0,reddit4

if that happens - all that happens - AND the police get called :


‚ÄúIf you are, for example, staring at someone from afar ‚Äì if the attention you are giving someone is unwanted, that is considered harassment,"" the club said.


‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre being harassed by another person or receiving unwanted attention, please seek them out or tell our staff immediately.


""We adopt a policy of ‚Äòalways believe the report‚Äô in cases of harassment and feeling unsafe.


""If we receive reports of any behaviour that has made someone feel uncomfortable, the reported individual will be removed from the venue and the police will be called.""


so basically - you're minding your own business walking up to get a drink, some girl happens to be in your eyeline, for any reason whatsoever she decides she's uncomfortable - maybe you didn't offer to buy her a drink and she's mad, maybe she doesn't like your race, maybe she just hates men- so she immediately waves the feminist white knight police over and no questions asked they jump you and kick you out AND call the police to send you to jail. 


my guess is if this happens a lot then the police will just hangout nearby or outside like they do at hotspots in my town, so it'll be very litteraly straight to jail if you get kicked out. my guess is they'll hire off duty cops for security anyway to basically skip the middle man so these pink vest white knight feminists are essentially police , so if you try to argue or drunkenly throw an elbow as a natural reaction before you know what's going on then you'll have the police throw the book at you for disorderly/resisting arrest. 


so essentially now at this club and others if it catches on- any woman regardless of income, mental health or believability- will have the direct and encouraged armed police state to enforce any ""uncomfortable"" feelings or false accusations they have out of spite or any reason whatsoever.

ilqhdkl,t1_ilq7tta,2022-08-25 14:08:57,MensRights,">Any man that goes to this club is an idiot.

I did a stint as a bouncer in a club during college, and let me tell you that any man that goes to a club is an idiot. They are pretty much money extraction pumps for thirsty guys. We had quotas of who got let in, and pretty much hot girls could walk right past the line. The logic here was that lots of guys would come to where the hot girls are at, and spend a fortune on drinks to try to get in their pants. The girls were aware of this and a lot would just plan on free drinks. Furthermore, some establishments would have paid girls there in the crowd with the express purpose of getting guys to buy them drinks.

So repeatedly Id see a PUA type 'work' a girl all night. She'd literally just walk away from the dude when the local football star showed up, and he'd seal the deal with a nod and grunt then leave with her. All in under half an hour... without buying single drink. Which was absolutely the worst scenario for the club, TBH.

As an aside a girl I was with in college had two roommates who were identical twins. They would openly brag about going out to the club and getting free drinks from guys. If he tried to get their number, they'd give him the number to the local pizza joint. They thought this was hilarious. 

Bottle service was a massive scam. Most of the time the venues just kept refilling the expensive import vodka bottles with cheap stuff from the local supermarket. The 'VIP' room is pretty much the same concept, but for suckers who are known to have loads of  money. Especially the ones that get boozed and cause damage, which they will charge the customer for at an up-charge. 

Even the parking was a scam. One of the venues I worked had VIP parking for $25 bucks. Pay your fee and the guy across the street would undo the little chain across the drive and you got a convenient parking space in a nice grass lot. Thing is they didn't own the lot, and the church that did sent them a cease and desist once they figured it out. 

Working the front doors, you'd better believe we had quota's. 10% minorities, 50% women, 40% white guys. Because for a thirsty dude you want it to appear that there's lots of hot available girls for him to buy drinks for, and if one doesn't pan out there's more you try your luck with. It's akin to slot machines, and I'd say the psychology is pretty much the same.",RunawayGrain,t2_i6tf1,45,0,reddit4

That's most of the West to some extent nowadays, but particularly English-speaking countries, which have it by far the worst imo with the exception of some outliers like Sweden which are equally messed up. Sure, other countries also have problems with feminism, and it has filtered into their discourse and some cases legal systems, but the Anglosphere nevertheless stands out for how pervasive its influence is, and how much it has come to influence nevermind political discussion, but simple daily interactions.

As an example of this phenomenon, France is often seen as a very liberal country, but surprisingly to some, not very feminist. I live in Canada, and it's quite common to see French people immigrate to Quebec (I've been to Quebec and speak passable French, but don't currently live there), and a sentiment that you hear again and again from French expats is that Quebec is far more liberal than France, and feminism ""is taken seriously"" and ""not a joke"". Of course, Quebec is not exactly an English-speaking region, but most people speak English to some extent and most of Montreal is fluent in English, although French is still the native language for most people, so the influence is not as great, and this is reflected in the attitudes. While Quebec is certainly feminist, I certainly find its women more feminine, open, and less angry and judgmental than English Canada's where a significant portion of women seem downright crazy.

Also, I immigrated myself as a kid from an Eastern European country and have always found English cultures to be rather cold, reserved, and restrained in comparison, with few people expressing their true feelings, creating an ideal environment for something like feminism to take hold and thrive. About the only English-speaking regions that are not fully crazy yet in terms of male-female interactions are the Deep South  and states like Florida, where there is a more conservative culture and there are more Hispanics, who are warmer, and tend to be less feminist. In most of the rest of the English-speaking world, normal interactions between the sexes are pretty much a thing of the past.",shydude92,t2_vi41h,1,0,reddit4

Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night.

If want to you feel sexy you can just as easily dress up that way when you're having a wine party, sleepover, whatever with just the girls. However guess what from all the girls I know, they don't dress up in the sake sexy clubbing clothes then. Nor does the majority of girls/women ...  
If it's just to feel sexy you can put on music at home and dance alone or with 1 or 2 friends, then there's no reason to go to that club.

The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind. 

However this is the crux of the problem.
You can either get angry at everyone when they keep on flirting/staring/whatever after you say you aren't interested or at no one. However enough girls will first get pissed at a guy they don't find attractive and then do the exact same with a guy they do find attractive but play hard to get. That's just dumb and inconsistent and even hypocrite behaviour. 
You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. Most guys in clubs just do what they had the most succes with ... Or often what they see others do that are successful. 
Either that behaviour is okay or it's not, shouldn't matter if it's done by person A or person B, assuming they are both strangers to you. However that's not what happens in practice and that's part of the problem ...

You want consent and no staring, then you need to be extremely consistent with that to everyone. However that's not going to happen in practice because most women and many many men, aren't consistent in that regard.

Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...",NwbieGD,t2_3kfvddv,20,0,reddit4

that's why it's always going to be enabled by rich capitalist men at the very top pretending to be white knights who are for things like this bc it reinforces their dominance hierarchy and gives them permission to publicly shame and quell their competition making them more powerful as well. 


bc obviously this bar owner who's implementing this system is immune from being kicked out of his own club no matter how many women he approaches or what actual sexual harassment he does.

> Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night

Because men and women can like to look good for themselves, it can help you feel more confident, show off to friends, you‚Äôre dressing for the occasion. That‚Äôs ontop of the people who would also do it for attention

Dressing up at home isn‚Äôt an occasion, it‚Äôs not exciting, you aren‚Äôt really doing anything. If you‚Äôre going out clubbing, you want to look good, you want to dress up in clubbing attire, you want to dress to match the energy of the people and the music at the event you‚Äôre at. You can‚Äôt get that same energy or atmosphere in you‚Äôre basement with ¬£5 wine and a handful of friends, it‚Äôs a different vibe 

Not to mention how it doesn‚Äôt really matter, dressing up still isn‚Äôt an invitation for unwanted interactions. Dressing slutty isn‚Äôt ‚Äòasking for it‚Äô, because people are individuals and have their own reasons. Making grimy assumptions is the incorrect way to approach strangers. You probe, you get a response, and whatever response you receive you respect, simple. 


> The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind.

Why not? Personal preference or their individual choices absolutely should be respected. An invitation for one person isn‚Äôt an invitation for everyone, that‚Äôs common sense. If you ask someone not to stare or make it‚Äôs obvious you aren‚Äôt interested and they carry on, it‚Äôs unwanted, it‚Äôs making them uncomfortable, it not unreasonable for them to be told to stop

> You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. 

Doesn‚Äôt make it at all appropriate, and it‚Äôs not restricted to men, woman can be pushy too

> Either that behaviour is okay or it's not

Not really, it‚Äôs not black and white. You can want to interact with person A and not interact with person B, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that

> Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...

And that just boils down to respect

If you‚Äôre staring at someone for a prolonged period of time with no response, maybe you should take the hint? 

If you‚Äôre staring at someone and that attention is being reciprocated, equally you should take the hint and take it further. It‚Äôs just being respectful and having basic communication skills, understanding the ‚Äòyes‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äôs‚Äô",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-13,0,reddit4

VIP service is a scam. At best you have someone of the opinion that they are a big shot and don't want to be bothered by the public. We had an local MLB player guy that frequented one of the establishments I worked. He had a bit of an overblown opinion of himself, hence the VIP room. Frankly, he was a jerk too. He'd get wasted and have a bunch of barfly girls on him like leeches on an old mule. Then he'd do some minor damage. He usually had a huge tab due to the hangers on and the club exaggerating how much the repair bills were, which was the point.

Unless you managed to find a place absent of security and often fueled by drugs, you were always subject to get thrown out, for anything, really. But if women complained, you did not have the option to stay inside or even argue, that has always been the case. It still is, unless a man is really rich or is with somebody really rich, he's really not in any position to act out of line. In fact there's plenty of places you probably also get a beating from security after being escorted out, even if you really did nothing just because they can, nobody will see anything and the police will do nothing because it's much easier for them to look away when a few testosterone junkies beat somebody up who didn't yet get the memo than having to respond to some bickering every ten minutes.

The only difference is that usually women didn't care what anybody was doing as long as they didn't intentionally interacted with them over and over. And why would they? However a policy this explicitly laying down that women can get men thrown out even if there is no evidence against them and there is no possibility that they won't be believed, and even the police gets involved, will only have one effect: it's going to encourage even women who never cared and still don't care to be ""empowered"" and ruin at least the night of somebody they think shouldn't be there for whatever reason. And if the insanity continues and we actually see laws pop up making ""staring"" and other thought crimes illegal, men will get their lives ruined even by just not looking good enough and standing ""too close"" to an ""empowered"" woman in a crowd of hundreds where dropping a needle would be impossible, like subways.",,,1,0,reddit4

You're right about this part. But the yes and nos aren't in English. These communication skills aren't at all 'basic' for some, especially men. It's a skill that needs to be developed and can only be developed through interaction, not being told do this, don't do that etc 
intellectually.


I think it would be good for all men to learn and develop these skills but there is no manual for what these yes and nos are. What is lacking is strong male role models and father's demonstrating how to be a man and how to understand and treat women, a lot of which is obviously thanks to feminism. But because of this, a lot of men don't know how to be men and aren't even allowed to be men except only when given permission from a woman.  'Explicit' permission that comes in indirect so called communication, just basically hints.

Dating and engaging women for men is becoming more and more like being a tomb raider. You have to decipher heiroglyphics you haven't been taught or shown how to read and any wrong turn is booby trapped. 

This is how it feels, basically. Yet women in traditional mens roles get to complain and have the world bend to them. That men aren't allowed exclusive spaces, that any women no matter how unwelcome they are have every right to not only exist in any space men can be, but demand that it must cater to them and overlook their deficiencies. E.g. women 'not being heard' or promoted in certain areas needs quotas to address any perceived imbalance against women. Why is it never asked that women just work on their competativeness and assertiveness.

In the dating and social world where men are typically disadvantaged, it's not hey, we have to be inclusive of everyone and their relative skill socially, like it is now with skills in the man's world. It's no, you're not reading the hints correctly and you have 'upset' a woman, get the fuck out you creep.

I think you are wrong about the feeling sexy part. It's not the vibe that makes you feel sexy, it's being desired. What you are wearing inspires desire in men and that in turn makes you feel sexy. If the same scenario of you and your friends hanging out happened, except a guy you were attracted to was coming, I imagine you would also want to look sexy, but sleepover sexy or whatever. The difference is the man to be masculine to make your time worth while being feminine, getting dressed up and looking good. Not the vibe.

So you having done your part in being feminine and dressing up to go out to the club a guy then has to be masculine and make the move. If you don't like the guy and his 'masculine' in the way he approached you, you can have him removed.


Imagine if there was a club where men could be 'offended' by a woman's appearance and have her removed, it would be extremely dehumanising and disgusting.

 But thats happening now apparently to men and it reflects I think a deeper truth. That a lot of women don't see men as human. I think the constant dehumanisation by women drives up the 'creepiness' of the guy. If a lot of women talked to men like humans and not rapists and murderers in waiting, a lot of men would be able to get over whatever it is that makes them appear 'creepy'

I think the position you are arguing from has some truth to it. But it's also shit from the other side is what I'm trying to portray.",,,2,0,reddit4

>""It was like being hit with a sledgehammer,"" says the Dancing with the Stars performer, who will tell his story at New Zealand's first sexual abuse survivors' ""summit"" in Auckland tomorrow.

>Mr Gilmore, now 31, was sexually abused from the age of 12 by a woman 23 years older than him.

>The offender, Hendrika Margaret Shaskey, was jailed for five years in 2003 for the abuse. But she would have faced a longer sentence had she been a man having sex with a girl because the law then had not conceived of the possibility of a woman abusing a boy.

>""When she was first charged she was only going to be charged with cruelty to a child,"" Mr Gilmore says.

>Charges of sexual violation were added later and the law was changed in 2005 to raise the maximum jail term to 10 years for any ""sexual connection"" with a person under 16 of either sex.

>A survey of 9000 New Zealand high-school students in 2007 found that 5 per cent of the boys said they had been ""touched in a sexual way or made to do sexual things they didn't want to do"". Mr Gilmore believes many boys still don't admit to having been abused, and that the true abuse rate of males is closer to a US estimate of one in six.

>""My personal opinion is that it's much more common than we realise,"" he says.

>Mr Gilmore's abuser, Mrs Shaskey, was the mother of two other children at the Christchurch dancing school Mr Gilmore attended. She spotted him as a vulnerable 11-year-old. ""She was genuinely nice to me,"" he says. ""I didn't have that kind of relationship with my own mother - she didn't know how to connect with me.""

>Mrs Shaskey started taking him on activities with her own children, and at the same time cultivated a friendship with Mr Gilmore's mother. ""I looked at her like a second mother.""

>After about nine months, when he was 12, Mrs Shaskey drove him to a carpark alone one night and started ""full-on kissing"". He was ""in a state of shock"", but also liked the physical closeness.

>""My mother wasn't demonstrative at all. She didn't cuddle. So as a kid you want those things,"" he says.

>Over the next few months he started staying the night at the Shaskeys', and Mrs Shaskey took him on a holiday to the West Coast.

>In a hotel in Greymouth, she got into bed with him. Even though he had not yet finished puberty, his body responded. ""That's one of the challenges of being abused as a guy ... It's a reaction to physical stimulus.""

>Mrs Shaskey's marriage broke up a few months later. She kept the children, and soon after Mr Gilmore's parents let her take him in as a boarder because she lived closer to his new high school and dancing school.

>He rebelled once early on, but she ""burst into tears ... and went storming down the hallway saying, 'That's it, I'm going to tell your parents'."" He gave in, accepting that everything must be his fault.

>""After that she really changed,"" he says. ""She became quite mean and cruel and really, really controlling.""

>It took him more than five years to escape. Finally, when he was 18, he took up an offer to dance in Australia. Later he came back to Christchurch and, when he was 22, was referred by a workmate to free counselling funded by ACC.

>The counselling gave him the courage to tell his parents, and then the police.

>Now, he believes the only way to stop sexual abuse is to talk about it. He has his own children now, aged 7 and 5, and wants to make sure they never feel unloved.

I honestly don't know what to tell you.  When I bring it up in feminist-aligned fora I get taken at my word, treated with respect and sympathy, and generally not challenged on *my* take on *my* life.  When I bring it up in MRA-aligned fora I tend to be initially applauded for fitting the MRA narrative, but the moment I do anything other than use my abuse and rape to demonize women I get challenged on details, criticized for viewing my struggle through a feminist lens (IE, using the word 'patriarchy'), and even accused of being some kind of feminist troll/spy/whatever.

>Feminists frequently deny that males can be abused

Not in my experience, not in the (seemingly mainstream) feminist fora and communities I've known.  Maybe *some* feminists do, but trust me: I am very sensitive to the issue and would pick up on any shit like that if I saw it.  It simply hasn't happened on my watch.

>What would you like this sub to do differently?

Stop doing those things I said I didn't like at the top of this post.

EDIT: Apologies if I'm not especially coherent or thorough in my response.  Needless to say this isn't a subject that I'm particularly fond of discussing (particularly when past experience has told me I'm about to have the worst moments of my life dissected by armchair rape counselors/skeptics), so I'm less than sober at the moment.  I apologize for not engaging to the extent people would doubtless like -- answering more comments than this one, for example -- but that's the way it goes sometimes when the subject at hand is (and likely will ever be) a raw psychological wound.",,,2,0,reddit1

The other thing is NEVER go in to any meeting that is close doored with a single person. If you are forced to do this then record the entire thing and explain to them it is to protect everyone involved. If they have nothing to hide then it won't be an issue. You may want to record any closed door meeting anyway so it doesn't become a he said she said, she said situation. You should never go in to a closed door meeting alone with the opposite sex, that is just asking for trouble down the line for all kinds of claims that things happened that didn't. Most companies have policies against this for that exact reason.

If your work place has gotten so bad that you feel you are always being attacked or whatever, then check the laws for your location and start audio recording your entire day on your phone or whatever. This will further allow you to document things if you ever need to go to a lawyer.

I am not a lawyer but if a work environment is hell I would consider recording my day regardless of the law and then allow the lawyer to figure out what to do with it when you are forced to sue.

I would put the recording devices infront of them.

In this case the two people did not want the meeting even though they had ""issues"" that were never revealed to me, and had weeks to get thier case together. A soon as any hint of actual accountability came, they then said they did not want the meeting.

Later to a SNR they said ""I did not want thte meeting"" I had them on record saying \*they\* did not want the meeting.

America is not socialist. America cant even manage to socialize the 3 most perfect institutions for socialism: healthcare, education, and incarceration.

No. You're wrong. You clearly dont understand socialism. Also, acting like the US court system is inherently anti-right-wing is a joke. Kyle Rittenhouse committed premeditated murder, but the judge unilaterally decided all the obvious evidence of premeditation was too damning to be used in court. After all, an honest and fair trial would have landed the right-wing darling in jail!

I want to be on your side of the argument about HR departments because I have been a victim of women deciding that they were justified in discrimination against men because feminism told them it was necessary. But your language strikes me as someone with the tradcon victimhood complex. I can't help thinking there is a chunk of the story that's missing. Specifically, a chunk that indicates why firing you was not unlawful termination is conspicuously absent. Because if the story is this simple, you should be suing them for sexual discrimination, unlawful termination, creating a hostile work environment, and retaliatory actions toward an employee who reported harassment. So, what gives?

hup7os1,t1_huowdst,2022-01-29 08:59:10,MensRights,"No kidding, these bitches have had the most cushy spoiled lives in the history of mankind. They outnumber men in cushy government and bureaucratic jobs, which they then use to further antagonize or punish men with policies created to benefit themselves.

Think about carpool lanes & who the beneficiaries are and who is harmed most by them.

They have wormed their way and spread their legs into all these government positions while men were busy building the civilization around them, then immediately began to oppress men. The majority of women have cushy indoor office jobs & usually work at companies where carpooling for example is feasible and frequently done - and they created these rules knowing that the vast majority of men do NOT work in cushy office jobs with other people from their geographical area - they do NOT usually have coworkers they can ride with and most men usually DO need to use some tools to perform their work (you know, useful work. real work)

So the entire carpooling system is a sham being propped up by these feminist whore bureaucrats and its yet ANOTHER way they have created a broken system that forces men to waste more of their lives waiting in traffic while they get to ride to their cushy office jobs with their friends where all they do is gossip and come up with stupid policies to make it look like they're actually doing something useful- and by doing so, freeing up more of THEIR days to enjoy doing stupid shit, while men are punished by being forced to waste THEIR time sitting in traffic. So it's not just taxation being set up to effectively transfer resources from the most productive members to the least productive members in society - consider the amount of time that has been lost by men who had to wait in traffic due to those stupid carpool lane policies. Ever since they entered the workforce in droves, they have done everything they could think of to make their lives easier, make mens lives harder, and give themselves an advantage at the expense of men - as if taking their money through taxes wasnt enough, theyre effectively now robbing them of their time, their youth, and their life for their own benefit- all this while also supporting mass migration into our country & essentially promoting and enabling a future attempt at genocide of the white male citizenry as a whole.

No matter how much they complain about this and say that its not true, they know that theyre lying and that i'm not, and i know that theyre lying and im not- and they know that i know that theyre lying, but theyre still going to choose to keep lying because they're all worthless whores and snakes.

- and this is all coming from one of the chaddest Chads there is-its not an incel view point, as much as they would love for it to be

Note also that the women stopped being too bitchy when men (who could be impressed!) were around. Men behave differently in groups when women are part of those groups, too.

cqxzzvc,t1_cqx771f,2015-05-04 15:04:13,MensRights,"Respectfully, I disagree. I don't expect to change your mind, but I will explain mine:

A) This example does not prove that all-women companies fail because of their gender exclusivity. Maybe (maybe!) this one failed because of the infighting described, but to say that the infighting was a result of hiring all-women is sexist. I could create a company of exclusively women that would be monumentally successful, and I could create a company of exclusively men that would be monumentally successful. This is because the success of the company is based on the individuals, not their gender. To claim otherwise is sexist, and inaccurate.

B) By holding this up as an example of ""see-told-you-so"" to feminists we weaken our message of equality. why? Because inevitably there will be a successful all-women company, and then we will have to acknowledge that with the same fervor that we have 
clung to this one. And the truth is that it doesn't matter (see point A) and has nothing to do with mens rights. Yet in some peoples minds it will be a point against us. By sticking to the main point of our narrative - equal rights for men - instead of trying to whack-a-mole everything that feminists could say we are more immune to this.

B) No ones rights are harmed by this. Some overzealous and confused men's rights adherent will say ""But men didn't have an opportunity to be hired!"" Yes, you are right technically. But we have a much more important and bigger fight on our hands then a small ~5 person company and what they choose to do. If it was an enterprise then yes, it would be an issue, but there are already laws to prevent that. I suggest you refocus your priorities. Men and boys are being killed right now over seas in wars. They are being raped with no community support. Right now there are way more homeless men on the streets in a city near you. Right now more males are being incarcerated for crimes that females are walking from. Talking about a small businesses hiring methodology in light of what is really important makes us look trivial, and the problem of equal rights for men is not trivial.

This is called patriarchy, and ""good old boys club"", and is harassed by feminists out of existance. 

But only women working together is fine.

No, the business failed because she failed to manage.

She seemed to think that her job was to referee all of these conflicts‚Ä¶ or do nothing. She appeared to believe that it was necessary for her employees to 'like' her out of what I suspect was an emotional neediness to have one big, happy, all-female 'family'.

She failed to demand that her employees adhere to business standards and conduct themselves in a professional manner.

It is subdivided into 100 *pence* (singular: *penny*). A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the *[pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(currency\))*. At various times, the pound sterling was [commodity money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money) or bank notes backed by silver or gold, but it is currently [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), backed only by the economy in the areas where it is accepted. The pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use and which has been in continuous usage since its inception.

As a society we really need to step up more and help each other recognize when we are engaging in distorted thinking patterns, because these are unhealthy and unproductive.

https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/

Men in this sub and women in feminist subs - for the most part - have been traumatized by either the opposite sex or because someone they care about has been traumatized by a toxic member of the opposite sex. This leads to distorted thinking patterns, and part of that pattern is an over-attribution of the negative to a group, when the reality is that it only takes 20% of a population to victimize 80% of a different population.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,8,0,reddit4

That is is just logical. You would not have enough worker to enforce the law. On top of that, you would have no valuable money nor supplies to pay and motivate them. 

Yes, right now you cannot imagine being with a woman since you are not naturally attracted to them, but there is a difference between sexuality and sexual behaviour. A good example is how suddenly there is an increase of homosexual couple in prisons. No other gender, only one option. Another example is how sexual assault in prisons are just common especially cause it is barely to never punished, like if there was no law enforcement like in my example in my first comment. Except my example covers a whole country/world and not just a secluded place. Sex is not a primary need or desire? Then you would deny every major industry which profits out of the natural desire and all the prison relationships and or rapes (including women prison). What is a natural desire and without discussion is the desire for dominance. Which rape is primarly all-about. And in a country where there is no more laws and enforcement of those, people's brutality to satisfy their aforementioned desires will express itself. If it is so hard to believe that women will assault other women, look up the abuse rates of lesbian couples. This should prove my point. And this is what happens in peaceful countries with stability.

I really won't get much into the ""pointing fingers at the other gender"" arguments. But to just give you some counter-arguments: I am afraid I will be accuse of assault because a woman is with me in the elevator. I am afraid I will accused a pervert because I accidentally looked into the direction of a female colleague. I am afraid people will think I am a pedo because I go out with my niece or because I carry her home.  I am afraid people will accuse me of being a ""toxic man"" just because I give them a stern look for once. All of those fears and more are there because people judge me and my entire gender due a minority which is not even close to the majority of ""us"" doing those said crimes. All of that because ""we"" were forced to carry the sins of those that did shit 200 years ago. 0 of all men I and my wife know did any of these things you are afraid of. And I do not say it by any hyberbolic sense, I mean the coldhard fact that literally zero men we know ever did any assault on women especially. Your sexist stereotypes prove that I should be still afraid of being accused of nothing.

You wanna do any of the many many essential jobs. Then go for it. Every Western country is happy to do so. You are legally allowed to do any job and by all accords, any man would be glad if more workers, regardless of gender, would relief them of the daily back pain of their cracking bones. The truth is, most women do not want to even think to dirty their hands and not do an office job. Which is fine, as long as you don't hide it. Besides, you think that any of your current rights and I mean any, would not have been achieved when fathers, husbands, brothers, cousins etc. did never ever wanted their female acquintances that they care and love to have a good and fair life? Do you think ""we"" liked it that a bunch of fat and rich elites denied that? Keep believing that equal rights have not been achieved by equal amount of help. And keep believing that women are innocent of an crime. Even in a sytsem lf anarchy. You accuse us of ""blind rage"" yet here you are exploding on me in a theorotical scenario and give me a whole sexist paragraph when I was talking calm and rationally.

The idea that this tiny 3% of engineers (who are female) could take up the entire workload & ensure society has electricity is one of the most idiotic things I have ever heard in my life.

No, women would absolutely not ""easily fill up"" those jobs. And look at how quickly you resorted to tiny exceptions (like female engineers) to make some deluded point about how women could very easily thrive without men in male dominated fields, but when it comes to crime, suddenly it doesn't matter that only a ""small"" % of criminals are female, because without men, crime wouldn't exist, somehow.

isyjiuv,t1_isy6sdm,2022-10-19 17:12:50,MensRights,"Can you become an electrician within 3 weeks with no training and just the internet? More than 90% of electricians are men. Same with sanitation workers, garbage men, and truck drivers. Even with actual teachers, it takes years to become a capable electrician. Without teachers, it would take much longer. Given that electricity and will go down  within the month, it will take much longer to become an electrician. That means Society would go without electricity for years even if they could learn to become an electrician somehow without accidentally shorting the entire power grid. Another thing is transportation. Without most of the people working on oil/gasoline refinement, and without truckers, after a month, just filling a car much less ships and planes would be basically impossible. Each continent would be completely isolated from each other. Even if the trucking part gets filled, it would also take years for anybody to learn how to work on oil rigs and refine gasoline. That skips the whole part of getting to the oil rigs. Even if they don't accidentally break the oil rig, it would take years to learn what to do and how to do it. Also, food. Around 70% of the farmers are men. so, most of the food you are dependent on is now gone. It takes years to learn to farm. Most mechanized farming equipment will not work anymore too, so the female farmers would be able to farm much lower areas and as such, food production would go down more than 70% again. More than 90% of construction workers are men too, so nobody will be able to fix the facilities that get destroyed. No sanitation workers means no clean water too. That job again, takes years to learn.

Summary: without men, even if women do learn to take up the jobs men have, the world will be without electricity, clean water, food, and gas for years. It would be a miracle if humanity could relearn everything without accidentally breaking stuff(shorting the power grid & breaking oil rigs). Before you argue ""those jobs would be easily filled"", You're right, they would easily be filled but that would be after 5 or more years of constant study and practice but would society still be standing at that point? 

Super short summary: Do you think that society would survive without electricity, clean water, food, and gas for 5 years(or more, likely more)?",drakeinalake,t2_lwktvy8o,14,0,reddit4

It is so long ago now, sorry, so I don't remember the exact details. He told the 'married' guy to stop hitting on him but the guy didn't stop..So he went to HR and was basically told 'nothing we can do'. This acquaintance felt flattened and gave up but what happened later was the big deciding factor in the end. He found that there was a court case against the Married man for doing the same thing to another gay guy in the office/company. It all came out that HR knew this but kept it hush hush. My friend then went to lawyers who had a name for supporting gay clients and they sent a letter to the HR department about what would happen if they didn't get a response within so many days. It could be that HR ignored once/twice but they finally got the message and within a month or so the guy was sacked. Gone. Big companies in particular are afraid of bad press, even if in the end it hardly touches them.

I've told so many people 'don't go to HR go to a lawyer first'. The company will be all hurt that you didn't trust them first but (I kind of dislike saying this because it is speculation) the same company would have no problems setting their lawyers on to you if the need arose.

I've had people who the boss is stirring up so that the person resigns and the company saves money on redundancies. I remember one woman was so upset and crying on the telephone and I told her the above story. I have no idea what the outcome was but by the end of the call she said 'I'm going to a lawyer'... I only hope she did.

Some HR people are good with the arguments that make you feel like you are in the wrong but they do hate lawyers... the ones I knew anyway... because it makes them and the company look bad if the dirty laundry is brought into court...

It takes a huge effort though.

But documenting each time it happens is a good thing. Ask your work colleagues if they would be willing to step forward if it went to court but don't count on them to build your case if you go down that path. At least you know then if you are all alone.

It could be that you go to a lawyer with the file when it is thick enough!!!",,,59,0,reddit2

Suddenly they have nobody to ""manage"" and they have no ""culture"" but the teams are still functioning.

Often included in companys because of regulations and accounting and not much else.

Something thats been intresting in my job is automating large sections of their job. Which is also why so many of them are in HR these days. This is also why HR ""culture"" has formed because they have to justify their job this is where all the corportate culture bullshit comes from.

If you have ever noticed they often have their own ""HR"" language and terms just like almost all professional jobs. Then use these complex language terms to mask the bullshit.

Whereas others will reply, ""I don't know how to do it. Can you explain to me how to do it or tell me where I can find out how to do it?""

Two entirely different responses will tell you a lot about what sort of employee you are dealing with.

I think the educational system is also getting worse in this respect.

I recall during my early educational experiences, that there used to be exams, where a certain number of questions would require students to go a little above and beyond what they had been taught in class to demonstrate some level of understanding that goes beyond having memorized something. Something that required having to figure out something on your own that you weren't explicitly taught how to do.

As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught. I start hearing complaints about teachers being ""sub-standard"" when exams contain questions that require reasoning not explicitly taught, but that arises from understanding basic principles.  The premise being that a question was asked of the student, but that the instructor was ""sub-standard"" because he or she did not give the student explicit instruction on how to solve a problem that appeared on the exam.  Never mind that being able to reason about things not explicitly taught, was the entire point of the exam question in the first place. Nope. ""Not fair"" ""bad teacher"" they will exclaim.

My coworker is actually a third type. She goes this route, but then still puzzles me anyway. Either she wants me to explain it to her (which, in her mind, means telling her exactly how to do it) but *will not follow up on it*, or asks me where to look for the answer, and then calls me again asking me to explain to her what *she* read :)

> As education has become more ""consumer friendly"", it seems like students have become enraged with the entire prospect of being expected to accomplish something they haven't been spoon-fed or explicitly taught.

Exactly. This is perfectly on point. Insecurity is one thing, but unwillingness to learn is something entirely different. My coworker won't make a decision unless someone else justifies *her* choice. She write an email, she passes it on to a coworker to read and correct. She does a task, she pass it on to a coworker to check if ""she did a good job"". She wants to do something, she asks a coworker what they think before saying anything to others...

And when the only person (me) capable of doing a task she can't handle and won't learn how to, refuses to help her, then it's either bashing or drowning. Just an observation: she was willing to bring the issue to the ""nice-boss"" table, not to the other boss who expects her to perform.

True, it is largely the parents and the culture.

But there is some culpability from within the educational community too, because today's parents and culture are yesterday's students.

 It's hard to be certain, but I believe that a large part of the problem arises from uncritical peddling of [""blank slate hypothesis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science) which leads many to argue, falsely, that there can be no innate differences, and that all differences in capability can be traced back to social circumstances or to education.

Consequently, many of the largest voices within the educational system, over decades, have pushed to create expectations that biggest failures in outcomes can only be due to failures in instruction. That is, when a student fails, it must be because at some step along the way, the student wasn't taught in a fashion that was tailored to the student's learning needs. Which may or may not be true. Consequently, if a child cannot solve a problem, and they were not explicitly taught how to solve the problem, that is by necessity a failure of teaching. So the instruction becomes more and more spoon-fed, continually trying to deflect concerns that instruction is insufficient. Extrapolative thinking and analogy are removed from exercises, and education is reduced to a boring, mundane, and less-than-generalizable exercise in rote memorization and rudimentary aping.

Of course, teachers are intimately familiar with the ground truth on these matters, so the majority probably have some concept of what is really going on, and many do not view it as a positive development.

So bottom line, you are correct, it is students and parents who are largely responsible in the immediate sense. But today's parents are yesterday's students, and it is the educational community and academia that is largely responsible for creating the class of parents who are so aligned with uncritical and PC peddling of [""blank slate thinking""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa#Science).

So while teachers may be more aware of the ground truth, the general social climate that creates these expectations in parents and students, is largely traceable to education.

Note, that I'm not saying that all learning is based on innate capability. I do think it is possible to improve people's capability to think on their own through teaching. But, importantly, teaching people how to think one their own must incorporate some aspect of the trial-by-fire approach, where students learn over years and years through their attempts -- and critically failures -- in thinking on their own. Teaching to think cannot be accomplished in the idealized centrally organized one or two day program where every child is spoon fed every aspect of what they will be expected to do, because doing that removes the entire process of a student's thinking on their own from the education entirely.",MagicTampon,t2_10wa5e,9,0,reddit3

I have dealt with 3 such people.  A narcissist-borderline mix, a sociopath and a malignant narcissist. The sociopath got shipped back to where he came from, ie jail.

On one side, you have the divorce settled. Good! End of story. The husband got more money and the ex is upset. Big whoop, she can deal.
 
However, on the other side, IF this was the US, I'm almost positive that his company would have to be listed in the tangible and non-tangible assets that each person owns at the time of divorce.

What cut of the $15M came from any evaluation of the company?  I cannot fathom a lawyer of any class or practice just completely overlooking or ignoring what the ex-husband had in terms of value in the business, and if that value was anything that could be measured in dollars, I see it impossible that a cut of that didn't go to the settlement.  If a single red cent was part of the split, case closed and the chance to rake in more died when the ink dried on the papers.  It'd be like a rare collectible and a Porsche being valued at $30K each.  One party takes the Porsche and the other gets the collectible.  Can't go after the owner of the collectible and expect to win if the collectible sells for $60K, and can't expect more a year down the road when the Porsche is totaled or loses $5K value from an extra 40k miles on the odometer.  The value is its value at that time, appraised and tagged, and you can't go after more if the value goes up after you got your cut of the value at the time.

Then again, what if the ex-wife got the ball rolling on the company?  Maybe got mentioned in an article 30 years ago where the ex-husband said ""And I wouldn't be where I am without her"" or was always at the company events or something similar.  Was she ever mentioned as the source of inspiration or a level of success, even in passing or at a holiday company picnic or anything?  If it can be traced, the ex-husband better not have known *anything* about the IPO, because a case could be made that the company would not be as valuable if it weren't for the ex-wife's participation.  This differs from the value statement above.  The work of both parties did not make the collectible or the Porsche more or less valuable.  The factors that contributed to the ex-husband devoting a level of the success the company saw to his wife though?  The argument is there that the company would not have been as successful during its IPO without her, and that could be worth a larger cut.  

All that said and none of it really being worth more than a way to kill some time on lunch, she probably got an offer for value at that time and took it, and there's probably more in the paperwork that says if the company went public, none of the earnings could be sought.  Any divorce lawyer's bound to see a private company may go public or may go tits up, then draw a line in the value sand and say take it or leave it.  ",ICOFUS,t2_chl5h,-1,0,reddit4

That's true in Australia too.

My reading of the story is that his company *was* listed in the assets during the divorce. The reason why his wife is going after him is because he didn't mention that he was thinking about listing his company on the stockmarket.

I presume a valuation was done on the company as part of the divorce, but when he listed it he achieved a higher price than its valuation when it was privately held. That's not unusual, public companies often trade at higher multiples than private companies.

His defense is: ""There was no need to mention those discussions, they were only early stage inquiries into the feasibility of listing the company. It was only after the divorce was finalised that the stakeholders met and together made the decision to pursue a stockmarket listing"".

I think the case will turn on the question of whether these sort of informal discussions about possibly doing something can be deemed a significant fact that must be disclosed during a divorce. IANAL, but I think they won't - I certainly hope they won't, anyway. People speculate about lots of things all the time, and vague wonderings aren't usually classed as material facts in a legal case.

It's very hard to live on 13,000$ already, I've pulled up his paycheck stubs for him a few times. His take home pay is something in the realm of 100$ a week after their take.

That's not true. They would have done a proper company valuation as part of him disclosing his assets.

The only way her case has any merit is if she can prove that prior to settlement that the stakeholders in the company had agreed to go public. Even then, it's hard to pin anything on the husband because as far as I know, there is no way to really evaluate what a company will trade for, so what those shares will be in the future.

That being said, she might have decided to hold onto them instead of selling them for cash back to the husband if she had known the company was going to go public.

Anyway, yes, it all comes down to disclosure. Technically you can't disclose an event that hasn't happened, so I don't think she will win this suit. 

A more concrete example of this would be if you had a rare coin collection worth 10,000 dollars. You're getting divorced and you want to keep the coin collection, so you pay 5,000 dollars. Then you decide to sell the collection and another collector offers you 40,000 dollars for it. The only way you might get nailed on this is if you **knew** that someone would buy the asset for 40,000 dollars later and you didn't disclose it, which means you knew it was worth more than what he paid in the settlement.

Yes but it didn't sound like she took a stake in the company, meaning that yes the value of all their assets combined would've been 30m, but the value of the company (assuming that was *all* of his half) could have been at most 15m. 90m is 6 times 15m.

The answer becomes clear when you consider the other possible outcome: the company's entry into the widget market is a huge failure and very costly. The losses force the company into bankruptcy and the husband loses everything.

Exactly.  The court took a guess based on the information he provided, then the market gave a hard valuation shortly after.

Valuing a company is extremely difficult.   This is why there are standard techniques to do this and why there are specialist companies that do it.   But go look around in the world and you'll see plenty of example of companies that go from being worth nothing, to literally billions of dollars in a couple of years.  Oculus is an example but there are others.

>I feel like even major corporations miss the mark on this by a lot when they do their IPO, let alone some rinky dink micro cap.

This is why a 3rd party gets involved, it's the only way to come up with a current today valuation that people can agree on.  Ultimately this is a negotiation.  In most cases there is nothing to stop a party who is getting divorced from simply taking stock in the company.  However, in most cases this is an extremely bad idea because the only way a lot of private stocks will get any liquidity before an acquisition is through the spouse buying them out.  

So imagine you are a woman married to a man who started a company and owns $20M worth of stock today.  This stock is ""worth"" that because of investment rounds (remember a lot of times investors are rich and extremely tolerant of risk and the company is being valued basically based on the potential upside, not based on current profitability).

So you get divorced and you have a choice.  Your husband will buy your $10M in stock and give you cash OR you can keep the company stock.  However, since it's private there is no market for it and you have zero liquidity and it's likely even difficult to borrow money against.  It just sits there not generating income, but it might go up in value.   You have just become an investor in this company to the tune of probably your entire net worth.  If it goes up maybe you get richer, but it can go down or go out of business as well.

Do you take the stock and then risk the company folding or simply doddering along with you not liquid for years?  That's incredibly common in private companies.  Or do you take the cash and eliminate the risk  by basically moving it on to the spouse who is buying you out.  BTW when investors take large positions in private companies they generally get board seats and other levels of control.  It's unlikely a spouse is going to have much control and potentially not even that much information about the company other than basic financials.  

Now this is an oversimplification because it's reddit post but you can see the conundrum here.  

So in this case she took the cash and then the company went up in value.  Well if you wanted to participate then you also need to take the same risks and hold onto the stock instead of taking the cash, just like any other investors.  This is basically just sour grapes.

j6njm67,t3_10p8zza,2023-01-31 16:25:52,MensRights,"I was having a conversation about this in a private chat once.  Here is what tends to happens with this issue:  
Man walks through a women's change room:  Women are easily threatened and have a stronger sense of boundaries than what men do and that is why it often quickly escalates into a women reporting the incident.  Women have more to fear from a man because men are naturally physically stronger than woman.  Women are generally more afraid and easily feel threatened.

Woman walks through a men's change room:  Men are more easily manipulated by a woman and also women pose less of threat physically to a man.  However that does not make it right.  Men are more likely to stare at a woman especially if she is naked because men are more visually aroused and attracted by a woman's appearance.  Also women know men are generally more lonely than they are so they are also taking advantage of man's tendency to be more single these days and think to themselves that they will probably get away with it.

A man's boundaries should be respected just as much as a woman's however women will sadly exploit this by sexually arousing a man just to get favorable outcomes for some themselves.

Once again it does not make it right for a woman do this.  However women are more aware of this dynamic and sadly will take advantage of it.  And yes I would report it because I bet if you did the same and walked in on them, they would report it to management.  The same rules should apply regardless.",taiga003,t2_2us9exox,4,0,reddit1

j6kwq8p,t1_j6jydu8,2023-01-31 01:24:29,MensRights,"Exactly. If the place is gendered, then it's gendered.

I've heard of some places in Europe that only have a mixed change room, IMO that's okay because there's no expectation that you're in a male-only or female-only space.

I've also heard of this happening with cleaning staff. (IMO if cleaning is necessary during operating hours, and it is performed by a person of the opposite sex, then MULTIPLE signs should be provided at the entrances and within the change room to clarify this, and the change room is either closed OR the staff member announces himself or herself - although IMO if this is necessary, closed is better due to the potential for clients to be accused of exhibitionism or inappropriate behaviour or whatever).

But that this ever happened. So what if she's the the District Manager. She should never walk into a male change room whilst it's being used. She can go in before opening, or after closing. Or have a male inspector from her office perform any inspections if it must happen during business hours.

j6lnfwm,t1_j6kqles,2023-01-31 04:57:04,MensRights,"Men and women are equal but not symmetric.  I don't see this gym incident as a particularly gross violation of men's rights.  Men have much less biological need for privacy from strange females (but not zero need).  We must always prioritize our values.  How does this value compare with, say, the right to share custody of one's kids, for example?

That being said, modern political orthodoxy insists that men and women are equal *and* symmetric, and this manager's actions *do* violate the principle of gender symmetry which undergirds feminism.  

Ideally, I think we should abandon symmetry as an goal, but in practice that seems to result only in abandoning the symmetries that benefit men, while preserving those asymmetries which serve women (like differences in the importance of gender-exclusive private spaces).

Until the public discourse has matured and allowed for a lot more honesty, I think we MRAs should take the high road and admit that violations of male bodily privacy are less dangerous, but still insist they be respected with the same degree of sensitivity, according to the currently prevailing symmetry principle.",brutay,t2_3p631,-4,0,reddit1

Anything that takes sexual asymmetry seriously will wind up *technically* ""sexist"", because biological asymmetries have consequences.

If you value male changing room privacy *very highly*, then, whether you realize it or not, you will pay a *very high* price in the sacrifice of other values.  

And note I am not saying male changing room privacy has *no* value, only that its value is *less* than for women **because of very basic, widely accepted and easily understood principles of mammalian biology**.  

Ideologues like yourself who refuse to onboard those uncomfortable but undeniable scientific facts are really not different than the trans activists that similarly refuse to accept reality.

Well clearly you don't because court cases, especially civil cases, are not based on facts. OP would have to prove that his life was affected in a meaningful way by her walking in and that she was negligent enough to cause significant harm.

It's especially hilarious because I've been in a small claims' courtroom with a similar case. A maintenance worker walked into a woman's apartment after she got out of the shower and he saw her naked. She tried to sue him for $5,000, which is the maximum amount in small claims' court. The judge ordered him to pay $70 to her in the end.

No, but I can infer that you *do* follow an ideology, based on your rejection of basic scientific facts.  But there are many possible ideologies that could compel you to reject that part of reality, so, no, I'd need more information to label you, if I was so inclined (and I'm not).

>Narcissist personality disorder does cuse some people to believe their opinions are ""facts"". 

Violence, especially sexual violence, is not observed symmetrically between the sexes, either as perpetrator nor as victim.  That has almost certainly been true for millions of years. As a result, human anxieties are very likely to be shaped by that asymmetry and result in very different psychological responses by males and females to strangers being present while they are nude.  This should be obvious.

>The right to privacy has been widely appreciated for BOTH sexes...

Something I explicitly noted in my original post.  But that does not mean that it has been *equally* appreciated by both sexes.

>Your presumption that men's entitlement to privacy is not important 

Again, I explicitly said that it *is* important--just not *symmetrically* important.  I'm not sure if we actually disagree, or if you just have a problem with reading comprehension.

After drinking a lot I had the urge to pee and went to the washroom there was a huge queue, when my turn came in two of my female juniors came wanting to go in one was completely sloshed on the verge of puking and the other one was holding her, they demanded that they wanted to go in, when I asked about the women's washroom they said that it was completely dirty with puke all over the floor and these two wanted to go here.

Consider the following hypothetical: bathrooms are segregated into co-ed and women's only.  The co-ed bathroom is generously furnished to serve all comers so that lines are never an issue and the urinals have physical dividers to preserve privacy.

How is this a problem?  Do men *need*, or even *emotionally crave*, a segregated bathroom space?  I know I don't.  My understanding is that segregated bathrooms are a service *to (some) women* who have evolved a heightened instinct for privacy in the presence of men.  

However, I see no problem with recognizing that modern women may be evolving new attitudes; why not let them lead the way to new social norms?  Because it would violate a largely symbolic symmetry between the sexes?  How does the vigorous enforcement of ""bathroom parity"" contribute meaningfully to the *actual* problems that men face?  Couldn't generosity on this issue translate into a reciprocal compromise on some other issue?

Similar situation, except the women would say, this is the ladies room get out.  The man would say fuck off I gotta piss, do business in stall, wash hands and exit.

This post would be on twoXchromosomes. That's the difference.

There is a unique thing about bathrooms, and George Micheals getting busted for lewd acts with another man in the stall helped establish precedents for people's privacy rights in bathrooms.  A huge win for privacy, what you do in stall is your fucking business.  Which bathroom you pick somehow became a huge topic out of nowhere in recent years, and a non issue suddenly became an issue.

In addition to a privacy issue, accessibility issues, for both able and the disabled, also come into play.  You are making a fuss about someone utilizing a bathroom, which is where a person is supposed to relieve themselves.  I ask you to please cite an incident where a person was retaliated against for using a restroom in a normal manner.  Although loud and obnoxious, she used a stall.

The absolute absurdity of this restroom right to relieve really rouses ridiculousness.  Trans advocates became very vocal about legislation needed to allow trans people the right to use the restroom they felt comfortable in.  They were tired of facing discrimination and harassment for choosing the room whether it be for a he or a she, let the Trans pee. 

Addressing the PooPlah plumbers can't fix, lawmakers looked Loo legislation, combing it over for labias and dicks.  When came great surprise, nothing addressing that between the thighs. Not all businesses have bathrooms for girls and guys.  Some have just one, due their size.  A business conducting business requires a room for people to do their business.  Regardless of gender, one X chromosome or two, the room with the loo is for anyone who needs to poo.

So people fought and fought for legislation, spouting out nonsense about discrimination.  What needed to done was already there. The struggle, the pushing and strain for nothing to happen, looking back you see the waste, all that time flushed away in swirl.  Poo where you want...boy or girl.",Dr_Golduck,t2_10ishr,0,0,reddit2

Let me say this again. A human being used the bathroom. I hate to break it you soyboys but even women gotta shit. The only shit I could give about the other people in the bathroom with me got flushed.

Its also a global pandemic. Why in what flying fuck are you at fucking Disney World? Seriously, dumb cunts like you are why we are still in this mess.

A big fuss was made by trans advocacy groups spouting this nonsense, discrimination, hate, and retaliation against people but I haven't seen any cited incidents.

In my home state, lawmakers finally decided to look at the laws about bathrooms and their accessibility.  When they did, they realized the laws were written without any mention of gender or sex, and done so specifically bc small businesses may only have one restroom.  Restroom compliance had nothing to do with the signage on the door, and written in a way that ensured access to restrooms were available to all individuals.  

People made a big fuss about how they needed legislation that allowed people to use the bathroom of their choosing.  When if they had read the laws regarding bathrooms, it was already written in  way that allowed individuals access to the restroom, and that signage on the door does not mean anything and is an arbitrary, non enforceable, but rather just a social norm that people follow.",Dr_Golduck,t2_10ishr,12,0,reddit2

My understanding is that section 5 is used for verbal abuse. But yes I do not see why it could not also be a section 5.

I think if a woman went into the mens toilet she would have intended to cause offence so probably is section 4.

Here‚Äôs my counter argument. The idea of 2 separate rooms is dumb to begin with. There are plenty of co-ed bathrooms across the world and quite a few at colleges. Make 1 big bathroom and everything a stall (urinals are pointless) with the walls completely to the ground much like if you‚Äôve been to a nice gas station (buckees) and where everyone can wash their hands. 

Furthermore, I realize if the rolls were reversed it‚Äôd be unacceptable and it‚Äôs a double standard. But honestly, who cares? If she was dressed as a man and hadn‚Äôt said anything, no one would‚Äôve noticed or cared. The same for if a man was in drag going to the ladies room.

These types of issues are idiotic and honestly OP sounds like a Karen/Kevin here. If I was in the bathroom I would‚Äôve just said ok and gone about my business. This actually happened to me a few months ago at a mall and I couldn‚Äôt have cared less, except for the fact that they cut the line for the men‚Äôs.

Ok here, you can have your opinion of being ok with women walking into the men‚Äôs restroom but guess what, your not the only male in existence, there are more men than just you and a lot of them would rather not have a woman barge in on them, reason? Privacy, also I like gendered bathrooms as non gendered would be kind of awkward and would make both genders uncomfortable at times. Also urinals are quite the good invention as they don‚Äôt let any piss slip out as sometimes your dick let‚Äôs pee out where you‚Äôre not aiming! Why? Because the human body ain‚Äôt perfect. 

I care that it‚Äôs ok for women to walk into the men‚Äôs bathroom but not ok for men to walk into the women‚Äôs, why? Because it shouldn‚Äôt be acceptable for either gender! It‚Äôs wrong both ways. And for the argument that you were on with it and gendered bathrooms are useless, guess what! Those were gendered bathrooms whether you like it or not so walking into the other genders bathroom is flat out stupid, if it‚Äôs a non gendered bathroom who gives a fuck! But if it‚Äôs a gendered I give a fuck, and that‚Äôs because those are gendered! So respect that. 

No dip no one would care if someone entered a bathroom dressed as that gender, they wouldn‚Äôt know the person wasn‚Äôt that specific bathrooms gender.

This is men‚Äôs rights we are talking about here, the right of privacy as that women fucking looked somewhere she shouldn‚Äôt and you find that ok? It‚Äôs not ok for me to look at a women‚Äôs vagina and that‚Äôs a good thing, and it also isn‚Äôt right for a women to look at a mans penis. Also equality, if a man isn‚Äôt allowed to do something like walk into a women‚Äôs bathroom then a women should be allowed to walk into a men‚Äôs bathroom, it‚Äôs common sense.",EstablishmentFunTime,t2_9dbm5r9d,1,0,reddit2

All the things you have stated are very true for a man. Nobody has ever jumped in and tried to help or do anything for me. To go along with this, as a man, I no longer help women do anything with the exception of my woman. If she was a feminist in any way, not only would I not help her do anything but I also would not have her in my life. I truly believe in equality as far as pay and all  that goes but I also believe that being equal is about both rights and responsibilities.  If a woman wants equal pay for equal work, she isn't allowed to ask the nearest man to do any heavy lifting or strenuous manual labor because she is a woman. As a man, I never get compliments, most men don't and unfortunately this will be something that you will have to get used to. There is quite a bit of body shaming and much of this does come from women. They rarely will do it publicly though and often will do it when they think nobody is looking. Typically, very few men are believed about anything and almost everything we do is considered weird, creepy or abusive. Even if we stay completely silent we are seen as emotionally abusive and yet if a woman does the same thing, they are entitled because they were mad and needed to gather their thoughts. The double standard of how men and women are viewed for doing the same thing is also something you will have to get used to. You also must be prepared for the fact that if you ever need any government assistance, as a man you will usually not qualify. This has changed a bit in the last few years but I don't know how much. When i was young and had custody of my daughter, I tried to get assistance and was told no and flat out told it was because I was a man.

One of the things I've always liked previously in the mensrights subreddit is that if you're discussing men's rights then it hasn't really bothered about the gender of the poster or the commenters. 

There are a good few supportive comments in here but way to many are self righteous, self absorbed or down right hateful/transphobic.

I've been noticing this is becoming a common trend these days, similar to the atheist subreddit. I'm pretty sure these were never supposed to be echo chambers of hate towards the ""opposite side"". This is not the hate on women subreddit. It's also not bash the newly trans men subreddit. 

OP, I'm sorry you've had some negative experiences post transition but give it some time. As others have said you'll need time to adjust.

Men need sex more than compliments and quite possibly the wish for more compliments is actually a wish for more sexual interest and engagement. Until men get the sex they need, I think compliments will continue to be interpreted as sexual interest.

Women don't seem to appreciate how much men need sex as demonstrated by the responses by women to this issue which focus on compliments and reject sexual engagement as creepy.

There's a huge disconnect in the understanding of male biology versus what women want: until we acknowledge that and work towards an arrangement that meets the needs of both parties, then the sexes will continue to clash.

What I would find interesting is whether a trans-man feels differently to a cis-man: that is, whether certain aspects of the brain are fixed by DNA and relatively unaffected by subsequent testosterone treatment, like regretting the loss of compliments when for most cis-men, I think compliments serve a different function than for women.",UnconventionalXY,t2_46a6opwn,1,0,reddit3

Men can be very lonely.  This compounds with the way some trans people are rejected by former family or even friends.   Add to that the problems with many LGBT/feminist support organizations... you'd think there'd be a big FTM suicide issue but as I understand it MTF is a lot worse, the same pattern as the assigned at birth sex, which suggests to me that the ruling issue is how people were socialized growing up as kids, either to see suicide as a selfish act (girls) because everyone would miss you or an unselfish act (boys) because if you're not producing you're just taking up resources and therefore everyone else would be better off if you were gone.

You know how some women say they're not shallow and they don't care about looks or money, they're just looking for a decent stable guy?  And then those same women end up chasing guys that look a certain way, or make a certain income?

Women often have the same experience regarding their looks.  Guys will say, ""it's really about personality for me,"" but a lot of us filter out physically unattractive women without even realizing it.  By the time we're focused on personality or intellect, the so-called unattractive women aren't even on our radar.

I'm not saying this applies to you specifically, but I know many women that would take your words with a bit of skepticism.  In the same way that a man's worth is often defined by his success, and a woman's worth is often defined by her looks.",LettuceBeGrateful,t2_27729nce,1,0,reddit3

h61vehf,t1_h61spne,2021-07-21 21:18:46,MensRights,"I don‚Äôt think all men are creeps- I just think a lot of men take compliments that way because that is how they flirt with people.

For example when I get compliments from men it‚Äôs usually on how I look (because they don‚Äôt know me personally so what they see on the outside is all they know at the time) and it‚Äôs usually meant to be flirty. 

Rarely do I get a compliment from a man who isn‚Äôt trying to get my number or date me. There aren‚Äôt many men that would walk up to a girl in the store or at a bar that would just be like ‚Äúhey, you look great tonight‚Äù and then carry on with their night without me. Most men use compliments as a way to start a flirty conversation. And that also might be why you guys don‚Äôt get compliments from other men. Men in our society associate compliments with flirting.

Women on the other hand give each other compliments all the time. When I‚Äôm out and about it‚Äôs not weird for a woman to walk up to me and say they love my outfit, and then they go their way and I go mine. It‚Äôs not stigmatized amongst women, we know compliments aren‚Äôt inherently flirty. That‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs so hard to tell when another women is being flirty with me (I‚Äôm bi) , because women throw around compliments amongst each other all the time.

My advice on how to change this is for men to start complimenting one another as friends, and women will catch on and see that ‚Äúoh wait! Men can compliment eachother as friends, they understand‚Äù. Women can‚Äôt be the ones to fix this and we also aren‚Äôt the cause of this stigma.

Edit: ALSO, I do feel comfortable complimenting my guy friends but that‚Äôs because I have an established relationship with them and we know that we are just friends. I know they won‚Äôt take it flirty, but I only feel comfortable complimenting men I know well.

TLDR: women aren‚Äôt the root cause of this stigma. Men need to start complimenting each other more so that women will catch on and feel comfortable complimenting you all.",prettyjupiter,t2_aayf2wzc,-5,0,reddit3

h623mnb,t1_h61hoz5,2021-07-21 22:21:22,MensRights,"Well, I have read many books about feminism and I have many female friends whom I would never flirt with. I perfectly know how to behave and I never flirted with a woman before making it super sure that she was into me as I was into her. Yet, the behaviour of society vis-√†-vis men is different than the one society uses when dealing with women and it is a fact that women can be misandrist and get away with it while men are kept to way more strict rules of conduct.

This is socially wrong as is causes inequality and is also ethically wrong because every person is equal, has the same rights and should be treated accordingly.

When we agree about equal rights, then it must be equal rights and equal treatment for everybody.  I am totally in favour of removing inequality and I agree that 200 years ago there was such thing as male privilege. Yet, now things have changed and everybody is equal no matter gender or any other trait (race, religion, sex, appearance, culture, height, weight etc.).  Equal.

If there is inequality about women, well fine, let‚Äôs remove it. This said, my take is that feminism today isn‚Äôt about achieving equality, but about reversing that 200 yo male privilege into a newly crafted female privilege and this is not right.

The argument that I, as a male, should pay for the sins of our common ancestors is plainly wrong under any respect: it‚Äôs not ethical, because you don‚Äôt punish the children for the sins of their parents. It is not right, because the Constitution of any democratic nation prohibits discrimination already and legislation is in place everywhere to enforce this prohibition and is also culturally wrong, because it is against the very foundation of our society, which places the individual on top, regardless of any characteristic that this individual may have, giving the individual a full set of rights and, correspondingly, making the individual fully responsible for the actions taken by said individual.

So, we have a convergence of culture, society and law on the concept that all humans are equal and must be treated the same, regardless, among other things, gender.

Any claim to the contrary, aimed at supporting a better treatment of a group of people (be them be blue eyed people, women or any other identifiable group) against the others (be them be brown eyed people, men or any different identifiable group) is plainly wrong, unethical, unlawful and should be rejected because it is the exact contrary of what we want to build together as a society.

Last comment: if there are women around misunderstanding feminism and behaving like misandrists, I guess it‚Äôs the responsibility of true feminists to better explain their ideas and to take care of their own extremists.

h61e44t,t1_h617yvc,2021-07-21 19:17:03,MensRights,"For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""

You see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206

Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey

and

The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey

and

Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females. These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs ""only"" 1 in 71 men and dismiss raped men because men are one group ""nearly all the men were raped by other men"" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.

2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf

2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf

2015 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf

Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

And non CDC study...

A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.

The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/

Another non CDC study...

a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.

And another non CDC study...

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‚Äòever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,‚Äô 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.‚Äù

Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers

when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù‚Äîeither by physical force or due to intoxication‚Äîat virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).

Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one. But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at ""rapists"", rather than ""men"".

And it isn't just the US.

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

Women‚Äôs rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn‚Äôt empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims‚Äô fight for justice.

https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities

Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys. Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this. Around 10 of them cited here.

http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528

I said that male privilege was there almost intact 200 years ago (with some notable exceptions, e.g. Queen Elizabeth I, XVI century, the founder of English dominance for centuries, undoubtedly a woman). Since then, male privilege has been eroded and now there is hardly any left.

Now society and legal systems in democratic Countries do not have that anymore and are actively removing any leftovers.

I agree that people should read books about a topic, before talking about that topic. Yet, it‚Äôs a fact that many books about feminism are really extreme. I‚Äôve seen a commercial of one that delivers the message that cities are expression of patriarchy because buildings are tall and resemble penises. And it‚Äôs not an e-book, it‚Äôs a properly printed one.  Extreme to say the least.

Another thing that mainstream/popularised feminism fails to reckon is that once one accepts gender theory, then it‚Äôs not about men vs women anymore, but about minorities and underprivileged at large and how we cohabitate the same world without one group exploiting the other.  Feminists need to come to terms with this. As a redditor once ironically said: why feminists still trace all evils of society onto men? What happened to all the other genders?

To me, an equal rights society would be one in which rules and standards (and responsibilities) are crafted based on human nature instead than on gender differences.  Looking for differences tends to create differences, in the long run. Looking for similarities and common traits usually leads to unity.

Then, I agree with you that the fewest people can be the loudest, at least on the internet and that the world is full of persons who are decent, at least when interacting face to face.  Believe it or not, this is a human rights topic as well: can freedom of speech truly exist in an internet discussion where no one is using their true identity (thus risking their face) and anyone can troll, brigade and harass anybody expressing an opinion with no consequences?

My only problem with it is that you say men are sexually assaulted more than women. Which isn't true. Your own sources show that rape victimisation is about equal between genders, but overall sexual assault victimisation is a bit higher with women than with men.

The entire point of showing the truth and statistics that men get sexually assaulted at, not entirely equal but quite equal rates as women is to combat the misinformation spread by a lot of feminists, media, and just harmful stereotypes. So it isn't helpful to then spread misinformation ourselves.

In short, the statistics and data is already in favour of the men's rights cause. To cherrypick, manipulate or exaggerate the stats can only be harmful.

Oh, it's not skepticism. It's life connection.

I'm a practitioner of non-violent communication, and this is one of the core tenets of the practice. \*Every\* conversation can be translated into observations, feelings, and a present request of the audience all with the ultimate goal of meeting some need. Arguments and even violence occur because people struggle to meet their needs through conversation and turn to violence as a tragic expression of unmet needs.

For example, right now I am feeling apathetic because I have an unmet need for more understanding (which I am seeking from you), as well as impatient because I have an unmet need for more efficiency in attempting to convey my point (which could have been met by you stating you agree with me, as I clearly requested in my previous comment). This could easily turn into frustration due to me having an unmet need for effectiveness in having a conversation (which I am choosing to have from you), followed by anger due to an unmet need for accountability (which, if I sought the accountability from you, would be me blaming you and , in extreme cases, a justification for violence).

I imagine you might be feeling the same progression of feelings. It is pretty common in arguments.

I will subvert this by simply choosing a strategy of assuming that you are simply incapable of agreeing with me. I now feel sad due to having an unmet need for mourning. I will meet this need by saying ""it's too bad she doesn't get it"" to myself.

And... I'm good now on my end.

Most of the world, hell most of the first world doesn't even consider it rape. Feminists have fought to  change that in India, Israel, Napal, etc... and have fought against recognizes a woman  raping a man as rape  in the entirety of the first world.

>  Where did I ever say I supported that?

**Do you not support the feminist movement?**

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

Women‚Äôs rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn‚Äôt empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims‚Äô fight for justice.

This said, 200 years ago there was male privilege and its a fact: no vote to women, no free access to professions for women, cultural push on women to pursue marriage instead of higher education, certain civil law rules providing for husband‚Äôs right to control finances, estate and investments, limitations to divorce/split up, more rights over offspring (education etc.) given to the father as compared to the mother and I could go on forever.

So, 200 years ago there was male privilege under a perspective of equal rights and responsibilities. This was instrumental to the idea of a family where the husband/father works and provides while the wife/mother takes care of the household, nurtures and cares and so in the end there was a sort of balance. Yet, under an equality of rights and responsibilities perspective there was an imbalance.

This has been removed now. All democratic jurisdictions have legislation in place to ensure this outcome and they are now removing the last bits. So, my conclusion is that in almost all democratic jurisdictions, including Italy (I‚Äôm Italian), there is no male privilege anymore and where there is a bit left legislation is already there to eradicate it.

All of the above is explaining a tiny part of my argument which was already clear in my original post.  My broader argument (which encompasses that tiny bit above), is that in the current situation of most Countries some equality issues exist against men. Men are actively discriminated in a number of areas and this also is a fact: average lifespan of men lower than women‚Äôs, more men dying at work, more men homeless, higher suicide rate among men and I could go on forever.  These stats show an equality issue.

The traditional answer offered by feminism is that men have to pay for their privilege. My view is a solid no: it is right to remove privilege, it is not right to reverse the privilege. Why? Because those men having the male privilege 200 years ago are not the same men living nowadays and you don‚Äôt have a man paying for the sins of his ancestors. Why? Because responsibility and liability are personal and not transmissible.

200 years ago? No vote to men either. If there was voting, it was based on land ownership (regardless of gender).

But... men eventually did get the vote before women. So let's address that as well.

**Let's say that we announce tomorrow that women from 18 until they die get a thousand dollars a month... free... this is clearly a privilege right?

However, every few years, we'll send 5% of women to their deaths.

And in a time when nearly everyone was one really bad year away from starvation you think this wasn't necessary for survival?

**Hell, I'll go one better. in the early 20th century a group of Israeli's decided to create a commune where they practiced pure gender equality. Women plowed the fields with the men. Men took care of children just like women did. Within a single year, they had reverted to traditional gender roles to avoid starvation and death**

> cultural push on women to pursue marriage instead of higher education

Oh  yeah, in a time where having a next generation wasn't a guarantee, women were encouraged to have a family for survival of the species... **keep in mind that 200 years ago, only the richest men went into higher education, less than 1% of the population. The rest were just trying not to die**

>  certain civil law rules providing for husband‚Äôs right to control finances

Yeah, turns out when a society refuses to jail a woman for any reason... it comes with consequences of things we can allow them to be responsible for (since we refused to hold them responsible).

**You see this same underlying behavior pushed by feminists today... women shouldn't be jailed... ever. If women cannot be held accountable, then they can't be trusted to do things that need someone held accountable for**

Or maybe you just want a fight. Well, you are not getting one.  So, about your statements:

1.  The fact that only some men had good prospects while other didn‚Äôt is a proof that that society was generally unfair, but comparing men with men doesn‚Äôt add anything to the argument about male vs female privilege.

2. Vote to women.  It is true that in 19th century few people were allowed to vote. The reason is that vote was given based on census (ie wealth and contribution to the inland revenue) and not based on citizenship.  It is a fact, however, that women did not vote, as vote was only for men in the vast majority of jurisdictions in which vote was allowed.  Again, comparing men with voting rights with men with no voting rights says nothing about women not having voting rights.

3.  Women were indeed jailed 200 years ago. The idea that a woman is so primitive that she cannot be held responsible was conceived by the Greeks before Christ and got discarded by the Romans afterwards.

4. Why on Earth the fact that people was starving has anything to do with imbalances about rights of women vs men?  200 years ago is the era in which Sherlock Holmes‚Äô stories took place. It was not the middle ages. Illuminism and industrial revolution already happened. In Italy and France no one was starving and I guess in the UK and the US no one was as well.  But this has nothing to do with male privilege: women were given less rights then men, men and women had it hard, yet women had less rights.  Where‚Äôs the problem with that? It‚Äôs a historical fact and has nothing to do with what I originally stated, ie that now women has equal rights and the argument that 200 years ago this was not the case is totally irrelevant.

Ah, the kibbutz topic. Irrelevant. It happened in the 20th century and has nothing to do with the argument about 200 years ago. We can talk about kibbutz experience, but it is a separate topic completely.

So, all in all you proved nothing. You just tried to troll me 

Last but not least, a word for the wise delivered with the respect you are failing to show me:  when discussing a topic, logic rules and feelings stay at bay. Because a discussion is an exchange of ideas, not a fight. Good manners are always a win win game because they take the best out of everybody.  So, if I may: leave rage out of this conversation.

We eventually agree that male privilege apparently does not exist now. This is the point, isn‚Äôt it?  And anything that happened in the past does not matter in this respect because the responsibilities of our ancestors are not our responsibilities. Can you see this?  The argument that since a group suffered privilege 200 years ago then that group is entitled to have privilege now is sick, illogical, ungrounded and utterly stupid. This is what feminism says and this is irrational.  There is no need to discuss what happened 200 years ago. Because it does not matter. Humankind evolves and fixes its own mistakes and improves.  Am I sad that women suffered in the past? Yes, I am. Am I fine with men suffering now because women suffered in the past? No, I am not. And you know why?  Because if this argument that ancestors socially suffering in the past entitles this generation to claim for a reversal were true, then I, as an Italian, should be entitled to claim ownership of the whole world and dictatorship over the same.  Because us Italians gave you guys the law, the Renaissance, the invention of scuba diving, the invention of airborne infantry, one of the best cuisine ever, style, fashion and good manners (yeah yeah  the Galateo was written here) and so many other things totally for free and we are still discriminated.  And God knows how we suffered in the past. How we starved. And how we are not using this as a tool to get privilege now. Because privilege is wrong. All humans are alike. Easy. You and me as well. Even if you don‚Äôt use good manners. We are alike and we have the same rights and responsibilities. Regardless of sex, gender, race, religion and any other factor. We are equal, now.  If feminists don‚Äôt understand this, they will understand it in the future. Because every human being is the same.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""

You see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206

Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.

Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the ""rape"" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey

and

The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey

and

Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.

But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females. These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs ""only"" 1 in 71 men and dismiss raped men because men are one group ""nearly all the men were raped by other men"" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.

Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one. But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at ""rapists"", rather than ""men"".

And it isn't just the US.

Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms

So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.

Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.

https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape

Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...

Women‚Äôs rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn‚Äôt empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims‚Äô fight for justice.

Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys. Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this. Around 10 of them cited here.

For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)

She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the ""victims"" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely ""unwanted contact""

You see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.

Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206

Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.

Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf

She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.

Prisons are a pretty recent thing. In the middle ages, to make an example, they didn‚Äôt exist and punishment was inflicted on the body.  The topic of prisons is a long and complex one, as before talking about prisons one should analyse how criminal law evolved in the first place.

However, women were actually punished in all Jurisdictions in which they were recognised a legal status.  This about legal status is another issue: if you are not recognised legal status, then you don‚Äôt have rights and, as a consequence, you don‚Äôt have obligations and you are therefore not subject to punishment.  In ancient Greece, adultery was a crime that could only be committed by men, because women were considered as not being able to understand right from wrong, to make an example.

Until some time after the end of the Middle Ages most crimes were punished with corporal penalties, not with jail time. Of course prisons existed also back to Rome, but they had a different purpose than that to punish the vast majority of crimes (which is the purpose they have nowadays).

This topic, however, is completely irrelevant in respect of the argument, which is female detention in 19th Century. Females were detained, not in the same place where men were detained for obvious reasons, but if they committed crimes they were actually detained. You don‚Äôt want to call those places prisons, but correction centers, rehabilitation centers and suchlike? Do it. But changing their names doesn‚Äôt take the fact of female detention away.  They were detained. There‚Äôs plenty of books on the topic and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find one in your language. If you want, I can provide some in Italian (my language).

This said, yes I teach law and I am a lawyer. From your answers I guess you are not even attending law school, but whatever.

Finally, I am truly interested in the topic about men‚Äôs rights. I clearly see that nowadays men are discriminated vs women under many respects and I am committed to pushing this topic into the mainstream, against radical feminism propaganda.

To do so, I believe solid arguments are needed and claiming that women had always had it better than men is not one of them, because it can be proven wrong at any stage. To make an example, women were given voting rights in Italy only after world war 2.  My grandmother voted for the first time at the referendum to abolish monarchy, back then. Men, on the other hand had voting rights even before that and, as said, it was vote by census so part of men could‚Äôt vote, but vote was absolutely not restricted to land owners as you claim. My grandfather‚Äôs father had voting rights and he owned zero land.

It‚Äôs really people like you who make it easy for radical feminists to win arguments and to depict people supporting men‚Äôs rights as unreasonable and dangerous fanatics.

So, well before 19th Century, as soon as detention was introduced as the main way to punish crimes, women started to be detained alongside with men.

The reason why this prison was founded, as explained in detail by the article below, is that that was part of the process (commencing in the 18th Century) that progressively modified the criminal law system, by substituting corporal penalties with detainment in prison.

Prisons before 1700 were mainly used for separating from society people considered as dangerous (poors, beggars, homeless, mentally impaired etc.).  The punishment of crimes was in fact usually not done with detention in prisons, but was mainly corporal.

Jun 2007, pag. 447-476.  The piece of legislation quoted above can be found in the Italian State archive, Camerale, I, b, 173.

In Italy, in the 19th Century, other institutions aimed at detaining women existed: correctional houses etc. which were separated from traditional jails. The reason why is that, when it came to women, the predominant idea was the association of crimes perpetrated by women and sin.  So, it was common to detain female criminals in these institutions, which were run by nuns.  Women, in these institutions, were detained and subject to a regime which was equivalent to that of male criminals in prisons.

Considering mens prisons have existed since Mesopotamia, and existed throughout (what we now consider the first world) 200 years ago (despite your literal lies to the contrary), and the first womens prison didn't open on the US until the 1870s.

h6h175p,t1_h6gut5c,2021-07-25 13:41:10,MensRights,"You continue to fail to understand that prisons were used for reasons different than criminal repression until 1700. 

Let‚Äôs analyse your statement: you say that since prisons existed since the dawn of time while specific female prisons didn‚Äôt until way after the 19th Century, then in the 19th Century women were not sentenced jail time for criminal crimes the same way as men were in 19th Century. This is bullshit because:

- looking at prisons to infer that people were punished with jail time is stupid. I explained that punishing people with jail time is a rather recent concept (Enlightenment, so around the 18th Century).

- before 19th Century, people were corporally punished when they committed crimes. Before 18th Century, prisons were used for totally different purposes than detaining criminals.

- during the 19th Century, after moving from a system that punishes crime (eg theft etc.) with corporal penalties (eg whipping etc.) to a system that punishes the same crimes with jail time, men and women have been sent to jail the same way. In Italy, women served jail time in correctional centers and not in the same prisons as men were secluded (for obvious reasons, they can‚Äôt be mixed up). However, the conditions were equivalent. Another reason for women serving in correctional centers was that back then there was the belief that female crime was somewhat of a sin, so that surveillance of these centers was entrusted to nuns. Another reason for this is that in Italy there was nothing like a female penitentiary police.  What happened in Italy is basically the same that happened in Europe.

  - During the 19th Century, as part of a wider reform aimed at making prisons more human, in Italy they started considering closing down correctional centers, because life there was abusive as fuck and also the idea was that prisons must be run by the State, not by private organisations such as the Church, so to give all prisoners (male and female) the same treatment.  This, doesn‚Äôt mean that female prisons didn‚Äôt exist before that, hence the statement of the prison in Rome in 1700 (which, by the way, is not some Chattanooga, Tennessee town, but was, you know, Rome, with the Pope ruling over it).

- All the above is documented, is taught like that in law schools and law courses with textbooks going accordingly and I provided sources.

- Counteracting with decontextualisation and personal offence doesn‚Äôt prove your argument right.

The correct argument to counter the feminist concept that men now need it rough as compared to women because they had it softer in the past is that the sins of the fathers does not pass onto the sons, because of democracy, individual rights and because criminal liability is personal to the individual and cannot be inherited. You use this argument, you see the other one shutting up, because it is objective. Exactly as the person with whom I was discussing stopped when I used the same argument, one second before you stepped in with your rage, insults and strange ideas about the legal system in 19th Century.

You don‚Äôt want to accept the above? I don‚Äôt care. I just highlight that if you go on like this you are going to lose any and every discussion. But alas, your brain, your choice really (pun intended).  Just a question: are you anti-vax / anti-mask / personal choice / Covid 19 is just a flu sort of person?  Do you believe that the world is secretly driven by the Illuminati or by another similar group of people?  I ask, because I feel some resonance between with your way to discuss and the one of said people.",WorshippingLasagna,t2_4p7vbqvn,0,0,reddit3

If you keep extrapolating a few words out of a complex reasoning, you get nowhere, because what I‚Äôm saying is not what you desperately try me to say.  The prisons were there. They were however not used to punish crimes, so their existence is, as said since the beginning, totally irrelevant for the argument at stake. They served a totally different purpose, as said at length.  Therefore, as said at length, the existence of prisons before 19th Century cannot be used as an argument that crime was punished. Because prisons were not used to punish crime. Because crime was not punished with prison time.  Prisons were used to keep socially dangerous (those who were believed to be socially dangerous) apart from society and for other purposes (war prisoners, torture of adversaries, keeping secluded political antagonists whom you couldn‚Äôt execute for political reasons etc.). And these prisons, for these purposes had also hadwomen in them (see Mary Stuart, who‚Äôve been there for 20 years).

First two pages of the essay

1. Il carcere e la pena: brevi cenni di evoluzione storica
 
Il carcere nell‚Äôantichit√†
Il giorno in cui la societ√† organizzata, per salvaguardare la pace e la sicurezza sociale, stabiliva di isolare dalla collettivit√† coloro che avevano violato l‚Äôordine costituito, rinchiudendoli in appositi istituti (carceri), nasceva il problema penitenziario. Tale problema, per√≤, fu inizialmente avvertito solo dal punto di vista della custodia o della polizia carceraria, essendo la pena intesa come vendetta sociale e mirando gli ordinamenti penali ad annullare il colpevole del reato pi√π che a rieducarlo. In tempi remoti il carcere era quindi sostanzialmente concepito come edificio atto a custodire il reo cui doveva essere inflitta la pena prevista per il crimine commesso. Le pene potevano distinguersi in: pene corporali (fustigazione, mutilazione, tortura, morte, ecc.) o pene pecuniarie (confisca di parte o tutti i beni del reo)
 
Il sistema punitivo romano
Il diritto romano conosceva pene di carattere privatistico per i trasgressori di norme di interesse individuale da comminarsi mediante processo civile, e pene di carattere pubblicistico per i trasgressori di norme di interesse collettivo da comminarsi mediante processo penale. Le pene private erano per lo pi√π pene pecuniarie e consistevano in una somma da versare all‚Äôoffeso in risarcimento del danno subito. Le pene pubbliche variarono nel corso del tempo: la pi√π grave rimase quella capitale ma vennero applicate anche l‚Äôesilio, la fustigazione, le pene pecuniarie, la destinazione ai lavori forzati nelle miniere o ai giochi del circo. Il carcere non veniva mai preso in considerazione come misura coercitiva in quanto serviva in linea di principio ‚Äúad continendos homines, non ad puniendos‚Äù. Era quindi considerato solo come mezzo di coercizione, arresto o detenzione preventiva, allo scopo di assicurare il reo alla giustizia.
 
L‚Äôordinamento penale medievale
 
Il sistema penale medievale, basato sui criteri della vendetta privata, non fu propizio allo sviluppo del regime carcerario. Con la caduta dell‚Äôimpero romano d‚Äôoccidente, il sistema punitivo classico, basato sulla pena pubblica inflitta dallo Stato e irrogata tramite processo, non trov√≤ pi√π applicazione e torn√≤ a prevalere la concezione della pena privata. La pena tendeva al risarcimento del danno o alla riparazione dell‚Äôoffesa in una composizione sostitutiva della vendetta in cui il potere pubblico generalmente restava assente 5 .
 
L‚Äôordinamento penale feudale
 
Nella societ√† feudale il carcere inteso come pena, nella forma della privazione della libert√†, non esiste. Il carcere medievale, punitivo e privatistico si fonda sulla categoria etico-giuridica del ‚Äútaglione‚Äù, a cui si associa il concetto di espiatio, forma di vendetta basata sul criterio di pareggiare i danni derivati dal ‚Äúreato‚Äù. L‚Äôunico tribunale √® quello del signore, solo lui emana gli ordini, a lui debbono obbedienza tutti coloro che hanno in concessione la terra o che vivono sui suoi fondi 6 . La prigione, o meglio la detenzione, era solo un passaggio temporaneo nell‚Äôattesa dell‚Äôapplicazione della pena reale, cio√® la privazione nei riguardi del ‚Äúcolpevole‚Äù di quei beni riconosciuti universalmente come valori sociali: la vita, l‚Äôintegrit√† fisica, il denaro. La crudelt√† e la spettacolarit√† assolvevano la funzione di deterrente nei confronti di coloro che intendevano trasgredire le regole imposte dal ‚Äúsignore‚Äù. 7 Nell‚Äôepoca feudale, essendo la giustizia amministrata dal ‚Äúsignore‚Äù, le pene erano determinate in modo assai vario, secondo la volont√† di questo. Le pene avevano carattere pecuniario o corporale, oltre all‚Äôesilio e alla galera, pena che prevedeva l‚Äôimbarco del reo come rematore nelle navi. Detenzione e tortura era principalmente mezzi istruttori per ottenere la confessione dell‚Äôimputato, considerata la prova necessaria alla condanna .
 
La nascita dell'istituzione carceraria moderna
 
Nel secolo XVI si assiste ad un progressivo e sostanziale cambiamento del concetto di pena e si forma il nucleo dell‚Äôideologia penale pre-illuminista. A poco a poco in Inghilterra i ladri e le prostitute, insieme ai vagabondi, ai poveri e ai ragazzi abbandonati anzich√© essere sottoposti alle comuni sanzioni dell‚Äôepoca vengono raccolti nel palazzo di Bridewell (concesso dal sovrano) e obbligati a ‚Äúriformarsi‚Äù attraverso il lavoro e la disciplina. Nasceva cos√¨ nel 1557 la prima ‚Äúhouse of correction‚Äù o ‚Äúworkhouse‚Äù, caratterizzata dall‚Äôorganizzazione rigida del tempo strutturato in gesti sempre uguali e ripetitivi. Questa situazione europea dura fino alla chiave di volta rappresentata dalla rivoluzione francese. Successivamente, le nuove teorie rivoluzionarie borghesi, politiche e sociali, favoriscono l‚Äôaffermarsi di una nuova struttura giuridico-normativa (in Francia il codice rivoluzionario del 1791 e in Germania il codice bavarese del 1813) che stabilisce un‚Äôequivalenza tra delitto e pena cercando di sottrarre quest‚Äôultima all‚Äôarbitrio. In questo clima vengono accolte con favore le teorie di alcuni ‚Äúriformatori‚Äù inglesi tra cui spicca Jeremy Bentham, che assegna al carcere, prioritariamente, un carattere intimidatorio e di totale controllo al fine di realizzare il ruolo produttivo e risocializzante. E‚Äô il progetto Panopticon basato sul ‚Äúprincipio ispettivo‚Äù che i pochi (carcerieri) possano controllare i molti (detenuti), e il controllo possa essere esercitato su tutti gli atti del carcerato nell‚Äôarco delle ventiquattro ore giornaliere. Nasce cos√¨ la nuova struttura architettonica del carcere moderno (carcere Benthaniano), fatta di ‚Äúbracci‚Äù (o ‚Äúraggi‚Äù) e rotonde, costruito cio√® in modo che i carcerieri stando fermi nel posto di guardia posto sulla rotonda possano avere la visuale piena su un intero braccio di celle, o su pi√π bracci (struttura a raggiera). Al contempo ogni detenuto sa che ogni suo movimento √® controllato ‚Äúa vista‚Äù con estrema facilit√†. Sul piano pratico vengono introdotte, dapprima in Inghilterra (legge del 1810 e il Goal Act del 1823) e poi in tutta Europa, alcune innovazioni: separazione tra i sessi, isolamento notturno e lavoro diurno in comune. Le condizioni di vita nelle carceri peggiorano, cos√¨ come peggiorano le modalit√† di vita e lavoro per i poveri nelle ‚Äúworkhouses‚Äù.",WorshippingLasagna,t2_4p7vbqvn,0,0,reddit3

And their changed opinions will start to radiate out into the wider workplace. It may take months or years, but stand your ground and they will eventually accept that you have a right to your opinion.

EDIT: another option would be, if your hospital or workplace has a newspaper or newsletter, write an op-ed about dating in the workplace. State why you think dating someone from the workplace is a bad idea (or at least why you think it's a bad idea for you personally and your career), and invite people to offer a response.

'Good morning, x.

I hope to be able to speak to you later about a series of incidents involving myself and a coworker. 

The incidents have encroached upon sexual harassment and have resulted in retaliation towards myself from individuals not involved, possibly due to slander. The resulting hostile working environment has heavily weighed on my mental and emotional health, and the severity of the retaliations have only increased in recent days, affecting my ability to provide care and focus on my tasks. 

The seriousness of the incidents, the possible consequences to myself and my career, and the environment in which I now find myself have lead me to schedule a consultation with a lawyer specialising in these cases and to speak about the meeting I am requesting. 

I hope you can empathise with my distress and take steps to assess the situation to figure out what has been said and to whom, and that you won't take this lightly due to the genders.

I did it once as a child and was punished for it and told that it was illegal and could land someone in jail (I was just a child and those idiots overeacted, I had no ill intentions, I just had this little tape recorder and I was recording all kinds of things for fun, like a normal fucking kid does and they lost their shit thinking I was trying to cause trouble, it's fucked up how they deny children their innocence and project all kinds of shit on them, like flipping their shit because a 9 years old girl is having fun playing with her tape recorder or falsely accusing a 5 years old boy of being a sexual predator because he was playing house or doctor when a 5 years doesn't even know what sex is, but it won't stop these crazy folks, especially the radical Left Feminazis, from projecting sexual shit on innocent 5 years old boys and falsely accuse them of being sexual predators or Brock-Turners-in-Training). If it's illegal to record or film people without their consent and he does he, he could go to jail for it.

Someone once said: ""So, if someone recorded you without your consent, it is considered a gross infringement on your privacy, and you can initiate a lawsuit against them. If you win the suit, expect to receive a handsome amount in damages.""

Also even if you can record someone, according to law advice lawyers, you still have to prove in court that the voice on the tape actually belongs to the person you are claiming and not someone impersonating them, show that the recording device you used was capable of making an accurate recording, prove that the recording is a true and accurate representation of the conversation (this is usually an issue when the recording cuts in and out because of, for example, wind blowing through the microphone, which could cause the conversation to lose much of its context), and verify that the recording has not been tampered or altered in any way. 

So you see, recording a cracy married chick who is sexually harassing you is not as simple and easy as some people think it is. He should ask the authorities what is legal and illegal and what measures he can take to legally prove that he's being harassed. The last thing he wants is to go to jail, a lot of men experience prison rape in jail.",312Michelle,t2_2fcotuis,0,0,reddit1

You're likely to get zerged by downvoters just as my remark is above. While I agree with everything you said, that wasn't exactly the concept behind my post.

I was speaking about the fact that feminists decry men who express any sort of preference for any type of woman, and they are attempting to indoctrinate their less radical sisters to that ideology. 

Admittedly, it's an attractive ideology for the lazy, selfish, and entitled women out there. 

Western women already have ALL the cards and all the choices when it comes to child bearing and raising and indeed, whether or not a child is even born. The only choice men have is whether or not to have sex. 

The choices I was talking about though have to do with just not playing the game. Simply avoid women who express current day feminist ideas. Ask them flat-out what they think about things if you need to. 

These feminists do not want men to be entitled to choose a woman that they want to be with because it makes life more difficult for them and it takes power from them. Your power is your ability to choose.

Feminists don't want you to have the choice because it means that when they decide it's time to get a sperm donor and 18 year mealticket, they want to be able to choose from the entirety of the male pool, not just those cucks and stooges that are desperate enough to sleep with them.

Do not be a desperate stooge. Choose women who agree with you, they are out there, I promise you they are!

So, that's is what I meant by having choices.

Replace feminists with other people, and you've got it right. 

As for the definition of good, it is a largely subjective thing. People aren't taught anymore how to recognize what they want and expect in a relationship, so when the inevitable breakup happens, they just blame the other person and refuse to learn and grow.

I don't know how to be encouraging to you in a way that won't sound either patronizing or as if I'm talking past your concerns, so bear with me with what I'm about to say:

You have to put yourself out there and be in a positive and receptive mental state. 

Physical appearance is only reasonably important to women when they are young and even then, a rock star personality can convince them where a Bradd Pitt appearance may not exist. 

I do know that looking back over my life, my best times with women were when I was in the best mental state - when I was happy, outwardly projecting ""good vibes"" (for lack of a better term). I also know that I didn't always project the most positive energy, and it was during those times that I found it hardest to find a date/hookup. 

When I was splashing around confience and positivity, getting laid was like taking candy from grandma.

That is DEFINITELY a thing that you have to ""fake it, til you make it"". 

By that I mean that even if you are not feeling particularly confident or even super positive, you gotta fake it, even if you feel super awkward in doing that. The reason is that you consciously telling yourself to be positive literally changes your brain chemistry (little by little) and makes it easier for you to project that the next time, and it goes on and on like that until you just do it more or less automatically. Fake it til you make it.

hyz5ww4,t1_hyy4c8q,2022-03-01 23:14:39,MensRights,"As a person on the spectrum who spends a lot of time with others also on the spectrum, I would suggest this. If you have to change yourself in order to suit others just to get a date, those others are not worth your time or energy‚Ä¶ and a massive amount of energy is expended in order to try to fit in. 

I know several people on the spectrum who have not only managed to get dates without having to turn themselves inside out, they even married and had families. Some of those people (myself included) ended up marrying someone else in the spectrum. Some of those people found loving, caring individuals who understood their differences. Some of those people did learn different coping mechanisms so that they did eventually fit into their relationships more easily. 

Whether you‚Äôre neurotypical or diverse, a long term relationship will involve change, it will involve compromise. However you need to find someone willing to accept you for you first, when you‚Äôre actively in a relationship and find that certain behaviour you do annoy your partner, you‚Äôre more likely to actively want to work on changing that behaviour yourself. Many on the spectrum don‚Äôt necessarily notice or realise when their behaviour causes issues. That‚Äôs why communication is important. If your partner of however many years tells you that you leaving the toilet seat up pisses them off, then you need to listen. However, by the same token, if you tell them that their behaviour in leaving their dirty dishes on the table really aggravates you, then they should show you the same respect in working on changing what they‚Äôre doing also. 

Relationships are a two way street‚Ä¶ but dates are an introduction, not a full blown relationship. They have to like you for who you are first, just as you need to like them.",girlbunny,t2_49wha,1,0,reddit1
hyya3fm,t1_hyy9abg,2022-03-01 19:48:24,MensRights,"I totally understand. I was done dating seven and a half years ago and back then I was 44, dating women aged 27 to 53. I realize things have changed and I'm not trying to be some dating guru. I'm just telling you that feminists do not define the entirety of the choices you have as a male. 

I'll offer you a bit of additional unsolicited advice as well, it'll be worth what you paid for it: don't become a person with a problem for every solution.",CawlinAlcarz,t2_15d22z,3,0,reddit1
hyz4f9t,t1_hyy9abg,2022-03-01 23:04:22,MensRights,"From what I‚Äôve seen, the most important factor - for the men I‚Äôve known in being able to get the women they‚Äôre interested in - was confidence. Which is why the ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù mentality can work, to a point. True confidence works better than faking it, but faking it works better than not trying at all. 

I know some pretty average looking men in their 40s and older who have easily ended up in relationships with much younger women just because of their confidence. This is despite not exactly being flush with funds. 

Sure, it helps when there‚Äôs an extrovert, it helps to be handsome or even just generally good looking. It definitely helps for some women (not the ones you want in a long term relationship IMO) if you have money to burn. However, these do not appear to be the be-all and end-all of starting a relationship.",girlbunny,t2_49wha,1,0,reddit1
