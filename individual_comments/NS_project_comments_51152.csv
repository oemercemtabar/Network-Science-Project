Child care subsidies, paid sick and family leave, and the right to part-time work would lower the job barriers for parents and other caregivers, older workers and people with disabilities.

People primarily work (especially in low income jobs) in order to survive.  If you can answer this question, perhaps you’ve got a clue as to what happened.    

My theory is a combination of things- living with less (no childcare, no commute, no work related expenses) combined with consolidated households (parents, brothers, sisters, living situations much more common in developing nations) have resulted in a subset of the population not needing to return to work to survive. The juice simply wasn’t worth the squeeze, and now they’ve evolved. If that’s true, things are about to get much more interesting in the labor markets.",chubba5000,t2_1vuofvcc,418,0,reddit4

We build a publicly available database that tracks economic activity at a granular level in real time using anonymized data from private companies. We report weekly statistics on consumer spending, business revenues, job postings, and employment rates disaggregated by county, sector, and income group. Using the publicly available data, we study how COVID-19 affected the economy by analyzing heterogeneity in its impacts across subgroups. We first show that high-income individuals reduced spending sharply in March 2020, particularly in sectors that require in-person interaction. This reduction in spending greatly reduced the revenues of small businesses in affluent, dense areas. Those businesses laid off many of their employees, leading to widespread job losses, especially among low-wage workers in such areas. High-wage workers experienced a “V-shaped” recession that lasted a few weeks, whereas low-wage workers experienced much larger, more persistent job losses. Even though consumer spending and job postings had recovered fully by December 2021, employment rates in low-wage jobs remained lower in areas that were initially hard hit, indicating that the job losses due to the demand shock led to a persistent reduction in labor supply. Building on this diagnostic analysis, we evaluate the impacts of fiscal stimulus policies designed to stem the downward spiral in economic activity. We show that cash stimulus payments led to sharp increases in spending early in the pandemic, but much smaller responses later in the pandemic, especially for high-income households. Real-time estimates of marginal propensities to consume provided better forecasts of the impacts of subsequent rounds of stimulus payments than historical estimates. Perhaps because of the substantial expansion in government support, consumer spending remained high even in low-income areas where many workers lost their jobs. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policies can stem secondary declines in consumer spending and job losses, but do not have the capacity to restore full employment when the initial shock to consumer spending arises from health concerns. Furthermore, even after health concerns have abated, changes in labor supply among those who lost their jobs may lead to persistent reductions in employment. More broadly, our analysis demonstrates how public statistics constructed from private sector data can support many research and real-time policy analyses, providing a new tool for empirical macroeconomics.

Is it rewards based, or avoidance of punishment based?

The median value of us housing is over $400,000

https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-house-price-state/#:~:text=The%20median%20home%20price%20in,in%20the%20U.S.%20at%20%24354%2C649.

Suppose i wanted a very modest home, not even half that, at $200,000.

If i put away $2,000 per month of income towards that mortgage, before compounding apr interest is factored in, it would take 100 months, over 8 years.

Median wage jobs, im a truck driver btw and its in this ranges, are $52000ish a year. So every month, just to pay down the mortgage in 8 years for a lackluster, well below median priced home, take half my income. Or 16 years + compounding apr at $1,000.

The psychology of the country around work is changing. We're not going to own our own homes workimg most jobs, there's no retiremwnt or healthcare guarantees. Right now my state congress would rather discuss crt monitors in us highschool history classes, than these working class brass tacks that actually matter.

Well, we're finally tapped out. Manged to put the US under trillions in debt, 4 separate major recessions in a 20 year span, completely decoupled the stock market from fundamentals. Workers left struggling to survive as the middle class has burned away in a country whose majority income is skilled-labor based. All the while chasing off immigration when it's the last opportunity for a system this broken to survive. With the US on the cusp of an ecological disaster as it will be one of the hardest hit nations by climate change. Not because it's the most vulnerable, but because it is the least prepared as was what happened with the dustbowl era.

The system is going for broke. We're one Smoot-Hawley mistake away from an L shaped recovery. Sure, on the surface it all looks fine- but what made the great depression so destructive is the recklessly over-leveraged banks. Well, the federal reserve was supposed to fix that.

This issue is coming to a head with increased technology inputs raising capital inputs much higher than labor input, I believe.

At this point, we should be able to move back to a single income family where one person works for enough money to care for a family, while the other spouse (whichever one) takes care of the kids, house, a part time job *if they want one, not need one*. 
This would give bargaining power back to the people by desaturating the market with labor.

It’s typically 3 ladies and around 15 kids. If each kid’s parents paid $1000 that’s $180k a year. Subtract cost of a modest converted house (typical daycare) and you still have enough to pay three good salaries?

Also, if that’s impossible for x, y, z, reasons, I also would get watched at times by one of my moms stay at home friends. One mom can watch a few kids and that mom gets some income for being home anyway. 

I’ve been nomading the last few years and lots of countries utilize intergenerational living to solve this issue. The parents cook dinner, clean, and child rear (better than any stranger) and in return they can retire and have a place to live and get to see their grand babies everyday.

I probably have really only been putting on 4 hours a day, if that, since COVID. Compared to working customer service for said shipping carrier where I literally made just enough money to pay for my gas to get to work and had to live with my in-laws.

Back then, since the shipping company’s entire business is about being “on-time,” I was frequently put on performance improvement plans and a hair’s breadth away from being canned for literally being one minute late more than three times a month.

That same hourly job was just as fascist about when I could go on break and come back from break; tardiness in those cases resulted in the same punishment as being late. That’s not including the shitty metrics they measured us against like Average Handle Time (how long you were on your calls, sometimes out of your control), how often you went to the bathroom while not on break, etc.

The job was so miserable. As soon as one call ended, another literally drops in, and there’s nothing you can do to stop or pause, save for hiding in the bathroom or signing out of the phone system (and being written up).

Today I work in software, and while I have gone through workaholic phases, I’ve been coasting the last ~3 years. Like there are literally long stretches of time where I’ve only put in 10 hours the whole week (working from home) and I literally make 10x annual (salaried).

8 years is a ridiculously short period for a mortgage. the standard is 30 and 15 is ""well, if you can afford the higher payment why not."" Acting like an 8 year, no money down mortgage is the standard is ridiculous. 

A 30 year mortgage with  10% down payment, a 5% interest rate, and a sale price of $400,000 gives you a monthly payment of just under $2,000. For the $200,000 home it's less than $1000.

If you have more than one kid it's just cheaper for most folks to not work and stay at home. 

My wife and I earn decent salaries, and as things currently stand 100% of her income is used for childcare related expenses. The only reason she works is because she earns just enough to pay for daycare/clothes/diapers/etc. and she's able to avoid tanking her future career prospects by taking a 5 year hiatus to be a stay at home mom.

And don't get me started on the absolute joke of the FSA, it's pegged to $5000/year, enough to cover a little more than one month of childcare for my family. It's a complete joke.

There are several reasons for this.

Some people died off in Covid. More than the expected number of deaths, and while they trended towards older retirees, there were still plenty of deaths in the 40-60 range, prime worker age.

The boomers are aging out of the work force. We have had more people leave the workforce due to retirement than usual.

More stay at home parents. I've heard of people doing the math and, taking into account day care costs, gas/vehicle wear, eating out, etc, it can actually cost *more* to work than it does to stay home. If a job doesn't pay enough to cover child care, you might as well be a stay at home parent. Typically unemployment numbers do not consider stay at home parents to be unemployed.

That adds up to a lot of openings at all levels. People are naturally taking the opportunity to change jobs, leaving low paying, stressful, and flat-out *bad* jobs for new opportunities. This leaves a lot of openings in those areas.

j50rxuv,t1_j4xy5cf,2023-01-19 16:36:17,Economics,"I too have an advanced degree and was working in Accounting until about a year ago. I saw friends working 100% remote in other industries after companies realized it was possible during lockdowns. With accounting being such an old profession that is dominated by old people and old ways, change comes very slow to the profession. After two degrees, ten years experience, and some industry specialization I got tired of the old ways and changed careers. Now I work 100% percent remote in software consulting and really am the happiest I’ve been in my professional career. Sure this is not what I dreamed of doing as a kid, but compared to the last string of jobs this is a dream come true. I know it’s not possible for everyone. I had to quit everything for a year to do it. I was fortunate to be in a position to save ahead of time to make the change. I wish more people were in a better position to do the same, not only because I want for everyone to be comfortable and happy, but also because hitting the bottom line is the only way to get through to companies/industries. If more people could just walk away from bad companies it would cause the hurt needed to bring faster change. Look at the tech industry.

j53aoid,t1_j4zr3zk,2023-01-20 02:25:22,Economics,"I kinda agree with you, but I generally just think the focus ought not to be on how ""hard"" the work is.  People don't pay you because the work is hard.  You're not getting rewarded for being a good little worker.  You're just getting paid for the value of your position.

People in higher skill jobs often get paid a lot more, and they often get taken care of with other benefits like comfortable schedules and time off, because they work in *knowledge industries*.  They aren't being paid to sweat and grind.  They're being paid for what they know, to be experts.  Their job could literally be to make one half hour phone call a week and otherwise sit on their asses, but if that phone call meant a couple million profit or loss for the firm, that's a six figure job.

Folks act like jobs are a reward for trying hard, or a stipend to provide for their living expenses... but they aren't.  They're subscriptions the company pays to get help doing the stuff that makes them money.

As a manager, I don't give a flying fuck how hard my staff work.  Staff sometimes try to impress me by showing that they stayed up all night working on a project.  Great, you billed way more hours than I budgeted and now I have to make cuts.  I don't care if you're working hard, or if you take a 3 hour lunch, or if you jerk off half the day while you WFH.  If we deliver quality work on time and come in under budget, the firm makes a higher profit, and THAT's what matters.

The best way, therefore, is to own the damn company.  Second best is to own a rare skillset that's in high demand.  Beyond that, you're basically selling your time and energy, and that's when the work gets hard.",throwaway92715,t2_f702u,1,0,reddit4

It's not stupid.

Increased viability of remote work has a real chance at *partially* decoupling the geographic element of agglomeration effects in certain roles for certain industries so we'll have to see how that changes.

Minimum wages are normally paid by smaller independent companies, not huge companies. Large companies and franchises often are the ones that are able to pay above minimum wage. But they don't pay much better and they do so at a cost of more intangible quality-of-life trade offs with regards to working life.

So it means that we'll lose an independent coffee shop that can't pay the bottom-line wage, and instead of the people who work there with a more personal relationship with the owner and the business itself, that business will be replaced by a Starbucks, which uses it's vertically integrated supply chains and established brand and practices to heavily optimised business, and that same worker will instead get a very slightly better paid Barrista job there.

Or instead of a small local burger joint paying min-wages, you get a McDonalds, or instead of a odds-and-ends shop, or a book shop you get an Amazon distribution center.

Yeah full remote is tough. I’m in public accounting and our policy during Covid was “full remote but it won’t stay that way”. Now it’s still mostly remote but required to come in for some things so they still want people to be able to come in if needed. 

What kind of roles are you applying for / what size firms, and have you posted your (anonymized) resume to relevant subreddits for feedback or run it by your school? Do they have any interview practice tips? 

Sorry for all the questions. Feel free to not answer. I’m just curious now what’s going on now because it’s so disjointed from my understanding of what’s going on.

Is the MBA a top 10, or a top 100, or a different school?

In my role (a fairly quantitative finance role) an MBA doesn’t really mean much. But it does help with getting promotions past a certain level.  It means more if the role is more “management” and less “individual contributor”, but it’s hard to get into management without some IC experience or connections. 

Also, is there a specific concentration within business / have you worked on any subject matter specific expertise?  I’ve had people apply with bachelors in managerial entrepreneurship and masters in entrepreneurial management, and that just doesn’t tell me anything about what the person knows.

>I see the businesses that are gone, and I see the empty storefronts. Some towns are mostly empty downtown.

Often that is the result of the way commercial real estate mortgages & leases work. They're not like a residential property where if it remains on the market too long, the price starts to come down until you do get an interested buyer/renter. For commercial properties, the way the loans get structured incentivizes the property owner to leave a property vacant instead of lowering the rent. The mortgage payments get paused while the property is empty, and the accrued interest just gets tacked onto the end of the lease for whomever the property gets rented to (or to the sale price, if the property is sold). So if a property sits vacant long enough, it can become near impossible to rent or sell, but the owners & note holders don't care because they 'don't hold the risk'.

But after decades of denial on my part about my ptsd, I started applying for some kind assistance. I had paperwork from my therapist... and was denied for three years. Eventually I hired a lawyer who magically got me in front of a judge, got me the benefits, and took a chunk of it for himself. So, total benefits? $940/month. And if I did any side work I had to report the amount received so they could deduct it from the next check, like I could easily survive in the Bay Area on $940 a month.

Then I found myself homeless as a non vet, single male of 50's, no kids and now living in my truck (which I converted into a stealth camper) and when I mentioned it to the SS department, they bumped the amount to $1018 dollars a month with the same caveat. If caught, then they could cancel my benefit. 

Now I'm searching for a place to rent, Section 8 housing, but there's a catch: you need a voucher, and you need to apply, and keep applying. I was told by the agencies that the wait time would be a decade. 

Every agency, every office, everywhere I would go would give me the same sad head shake and with the same fucking ""good luck"" at the end of it. Like I'm on some fucking game show.

So, homeless, applying for any kind of housing in the entire state (denied), and living out of the truck, showering at the gym. 18 months of this. 

They don't want to help. They just want to do the bare minimum to keep people alive.

I've seen rows of parked RV's with people with jobs continually expanding. I've seen tent cities pop up and growing. I've seen the lines at the agencies, the crowds at the pantries. 

They don't want to build housing because what passes for the bare minimum for human existence is also being touted as luxury accommodations and priced as such. Capitalism decrees the worth. 

I landed a gig ($30/hr) and a place (a trailer for $800) in Jan 2020, and for the last three years I've been running in place. Had the benefit continued, I would have had the ability to save something, but nope.

It's not $1 abroad for every $10 of good services. It's like $100 of fraud for every $1 of good services if you don't stop them

Because a normal user is going to use whatever amount of entitlement benefits that they need and no more.

Somebody exploiting the system for money is going to try to rapidly extract as much money as they can.

So if a normal user costs X, an abuse case is likely to cost X*25. And it's not just one user because if the method to slip somebody past the protection's works then it will disseminate among the people who exploit this. If you can push one person past the safeguards then you can probably do it to 10 or 100 or 1,000 and get 10 times as much or 100 times as much or a thousand times as much in stolen money. 

There is a natural number of people who need these benefits. Legitimately, a fixed percent of a population who are going to fall into a covered category and that's how these programs are built and funded. But there is no upper cap on greed. 

This isn't the case of losing a dollar to fraud for every $10 of benefits that you pay out to people who are using the system in good faith.

This is why. All the commercial property owners could kick their non-paying tenants (failed businesses) out, and just can-kick the mortgage until someone else moved in, even if it took years. This in turn kept the CMBS market liquid, while the MBS market imploded.

This is also probably partly why some areas never bounced back at all, following 2008. The accrued interest on the loans have made these still-empty properties very unattractive to tenants or buyers, so they just sit there. And banks don't foreclose on them, because they still expect a tenant to move in ""eventually"" and get the money flowing again - and if they did foreclose on the property, it's not like that would magically bring in a new (viable) tenant. Or at least that's *their* argument. I'd say if commercial mortgages were treated the same as residential ones, you could foreclose on a bad property and then re-list it at more attractive rates/prices to help encourage a sale.

But your average sky scraper is a different story (no pun intended). You can really add walls to an established structure, unless those walls are themselves also load bearing. If you were to add interior walls to all levels of a sky scraper (to split the floors into 2-4 housing units, and those units into different rooms), you need to add *thicker walls* beneath them. The lower floors would have almost no usable square footage. This is why most skyscrapers use a central core + exterior columns to support their weight. It's what allows them to be so tall, by maximizing their interior volume and floor area, while minimizing their weight. The only ways to turn a skyscraper into housing would be to either tear the whole thing down and build a new design, or to turn each & every floor into its own separate housing unit (and it would have to be a studio, without any permanent walls - and you'd have to get creative with installing a kitchen where one of the bathrooms used to be).",McFlyParadox,t2_wdl41,4,0,reddit4

Not because the model and the method cannot benefit more, but because the reality is, most people are not long time employees.  I haven't worked at the same place for more than 3 years in 25 years now.  Its not that I'm against a longer term, but none of those businesses felt that keeping pace with market was beneficial to them, I felt it was to me.  

So you have to move to stay aligned for yourself.  That's a flaw in the market, in a few of those places, and in others, its simply a business that was too small to grow to that level, to keep pace with the market.

2 of those employers were 500 million+, one was F50 level, and a few others were literal mom and pop 5-6 person companies pushing like maybe under 5mil.  I never expected those ones to keep pace, and in some cases, I did it as a favor to a previous coworker that worked there and needed someone to help them expand what they had.  

But this concept that ""If you can't pay what you want, you should burn in hell and die and shut your business down"" is stupid, and I hate it when people say that.  Because it ends up being that we concentrate workloads into centralized giant only companies, and we end up with less jobs overall.  ""Well then thats a good thing, because the people that cannot afford should perish""  so asnine, there should be no minimum wage, there should be no maximum wage, wages should be negotiated by job and job worker at will.

The problem is, we keep thinking the only solution is a forced floor, but most people don't realize that the floor coming up, also raises everyone elses floor, and we get the reaction by businesses we have now.

You need a minimum of two degrees to make slightly more than minimum wage, or less than minimum wage, when you consider all the hours you have to put in outside of class--roughly one-to-one, when you factor in lesson planning, marking, and ancillary tasks.

You'd think they'd get some recognition for this herculean effort of raising society's children for virtually no compensation. After all, parents will complain about the behavior of their *one* kid, and how stressful it is, but teachers have to not only control the behavior of 30+ kids (including multiples of that *one* kid that all the parents complain about when it's their own kid)--they also have to teach them. And stay up-to-date with curriculum requirements, regulations, standardized testing, new learning initiatives, and other red-tape obstacles to doing an effective job, put in place by micro-managing non-educators who think they can ""solve"" education by means other than properly funding it and treating professionals like professionals.

What kind of recognition do teachers get for their efforts? For putting up with this broken system and doing their best to make it work, despite the lack of compensation? More or less, they get shit on by media and used as a punching bag by politicians.

[NCES has a tool that lets you really dig into all the things TALIS measures](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/idetalis/format.aspx), but I can't for the life of me figure out how to use it, and we can see a report what it thought were the most interesting figures from the latest full TALIS cycle [here](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019132.pdf). NCES also keeps very detailed statistics on American teachers in its [Digest of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/current_tables.asp), with salary data being in section 211.

&#x200B;

Overall, it looks like American teachers are paid pretty well, but it's offset by unusually long teaching hours, leaving little time for planning, professional development (which tends to be of low quality in America, anyway, although REL [released resources to address that earlier this year](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/northeast/OurWork/Resource/7) and WWC is chugging along), office hours for individual attention, coordination with special needs and ELL staff and oversight, and peer engagement. As with medicine, the move toward holding practitioners to evidence-based practices determined by the academic sector (see: WWC) and chosen by administration, while a natural part of the field professionalizing, reduces perceptions of difference-making and autonomy, as does the greater progress-checking apparatus that, at the very least, tells teachers that administration doesn't have blind trust in their self-assessments of efficacy.

Each year you are supposed to get a raise, which are called “steps” in this profession. Steps can be frozen though so some teachers can be a decade in and only make as much as a third or fourth year teacher. General raises in starting pay are few and far between. 

Every 5 years I am required to pay for more college credits to keep up my certification, but then must also pay for the renewal of the certificate. 
I roll in to work at 7:15 each morning and don’t come home until 5ish. 

I host an after school activity for a 2% stipend. 

I get 50 minutes a day to create plans for and set up 6 unique classes that all meet back-to-back. Each day a different set of lessons. Any phone calls/emails/meetings also happen in this time. 
There just aren’t enough hours in a day for that, so I end up essentially working for free (outside of contracted time) just to make sure my contacted time.

I'd argue teachers, as well as all manner of childcare providers, do in fact play a relatively substantial role in raising children.

Clearly parents have a lot to do, but as a parent of a young child, I can tell you that we only get so many hours a day with our own kid. I see her for maybe 10 minutes before my wife takes her to daycare, and only an hour or two at night before we put her to bed. Clearly we do a lot on weekends, but during the work week we see our child for less than half of her waking hours.

Daycare does all the work when she's there. They feed her, change her diaper, discipline her (insofar as children that young get disciplined), comfort her when she gets hurt, etc etc etc.

That is all valuable labor, and it definitely counts, at least in part, for how my child is being raised. The same goes for when she goes to elementary, junior, and high school.

That said, clearly if parents don't do their part, it's pretty rare a school will be able to fully pick up the slack. I just think it's important to recognize that schools very much play a role in raising our country's children, and we need to support them in that functional role as well as their educational role.",VonBaronHans,t2_59lmz,6,0,reddit1

However, I think that most teachers pay is not as bad as people think and it's actually the hours worked that is the problem.

Even in locations that teachers are paid 35k/year that is for 3/4 of the year. I work 2080 hours per year and my wife is contracted for 195 days at 8 hours (1560 hrs). If you take the 35k you get about $22.50/hr. Extend that to a full year and you get about 47k/year. Not great, but not the worst paying job (I have engineering friends that got paid about that out of college). Now most places 35k would represent the starting pay and not what you would expect after a few years. Within 4 years of teaching in one of the lowest paying states my wife was able to get to level 2 and now make closer to 50k. Doing the same math that would be about 66k/ year (32$/hr) . Again not great, but also lots of hard working Americans are making less than 50k/year.

I feel the real problem is the fact that my wife works significantly more than 8 hrs per day and her level of work has significantly increased since covid due to hybrid teaching.

I LOVE teaching, but I can’t ignore the fact that it’s always been a struggle for me. I’ve devoted countless unpaid evening and weekend hours and money from my own nominal paycheck to support my classes. The public education system is propped up by underpaid and overworked staff, from maintenance on up to administration. The ones at the top making decisions are disconnected and don’t seem to truly understand the challenges that we face in our classrooms and hallways. But the problems are too big for them to fix, either. We’re asking our schools to fix the intense issues facing our communities, and it’s an impossible situation. Many times the schools facing the most intense issues struggle with inadequate funding and minimal parent support. I’ve lost 2 students to gun violence (one of them was pregnant) and another to a drug overdose. I had a student skip my class, steal a car from a nearby neighborhood, and crash it into the front of the school after a police pursuit. Ive had to adapt lessons for a student who suffered a gunshot wound to the hand. I’ve regularly witnessed and been involved in violent fights and altercations, including one on the roof of the school. (Like, what the fuck?!) I’ve seen incredibly serious situations be mishandled and hidden altogether, like a rape on school campus. I’ve also had my own personal property stolen and damaged. I could tell you stories for days…

Ultimately I know that my experience has probably been more intense than some because of the schools I’ve taught at.

I know $14,100 per student per year sounds like a lot. But it's $78 per kid per day. If it's 8 hours, that's $7.80 per kid per hour. Try finding someone else to watch your kid for that cheap.

$14,100 per student per year on average. So say 25 person classes. So $352,500 per classroom per year.

That $352,500 has to pay the teacher. And the teacher's health insurance and 401(k) or pension and dental and life and all that other shit. Median teacher made $62,870. With benefits and payroll taxes and all (I know some teachers don't pay payroll taxes, but roll with me here), that might cost the school $100k.

So now there's $250k left. Some of that has to go to just the food, a lot of which is subsidized. Say it's even $2/student/day. That's $50/day. There's $10k right there. Some of it has to go to heating and cooling and lighting and powering the room. Say that's another $10k. And building upkeep and maintenance. Say that's $30k. So we're down to $200k.

Some of that has to pay the other school employees. The lunch ladies and janitors and bus drivers and secretaries and guidance counselors and all that. Let's say an equal share as the teacher gets goes to them. Down to $100k now.

Some has to go to paying off past loans and interest and insurance and all kinds of other junk like that. Banker bills. Say it's a frugal space and that's $50k. If the other $50k goes to administration, then the classroom's money is gone.

I'm not trying to make excuses for it. 

But think about trying to pay to take care of 25 people for 180 days to do anything––not just school. Odds are it would cost you more than $352,500. You couldn't have 25 kids in daycare for that cheap. No way. You couldn't have 25 old folks in a senior center for 180 days for that cheap.

* don't yell at your kid daily as that can cause trauma/develop triggers

* Don't hit your kid. Hitting them on a consistent basis let alone just hitting them does nothing for their development. You only add resentment and more trauma down the line when they're older.

* Give them the attention they deserve. Ask about their day, ask about their friends and evertyhing in between. Make it seem like you're interested in their life.

* Correct a child's mistake/accident in a calm voice while explaining in detail the correct way.

* Talk to your child as if it were you, no one wants to be talked down to as a kid. A child appreciates it when you talk to them normally and not in a cutesy voice.

All those other roles are very valuable, no bones about it, but teachers and class size should always come first, because they are the very reason students are even there. If teachers can't teach properly (class sizes too big) and can't have a proper wage, then there's no reason to have teachers or students, as it is a broken system, period.

Consider the following:

1. Debt could shift to government low-interest (or zero interest) from the fed reserve until it gets paid off (IMO education should never hold debt as that clearly increases OpEx)
2. Invest in reducing the OpEx of facilities by increasing insulation quality of the facilities. (as a start)
3. Budget more.

When was the last time the $14,100 figure was increased? I bet it hasn't increased to match inflation, or any other market shifts whatsoever in a long while (speculation).

hfe7u64,t1_hfe6mf9,2021-10-04 20:08:43,Economics,"1. That's a hell of a policy suggestion. It's just not how America works right now. Schools are funded primarily by local property tax dollars, or by states gobbling up property tax dollars and redistributing to school districts through a formula. Either way, municipal bonds are how schools are financed, and that carries a higher interest rate and risk of default than treasuries. Thanks to Chapter 9, munis can and do sometimes go bankrupt. Fed doesn't really get involved so much, although a little recently with their wild corporate etc. bond buying. 

2. That's possible. And lots of districts do this through performance contracting funded through CDBG or EECBG block grants. It's a whole industry. They push the savings forward to make investments now, but it might cost them in the out years.

3. Sure. That actually works. It just requires towns and/or counties to vote for higher mil rates on real property.

The problem is also that these are public schools. So you get lots of larger classes because there are also lots of much smaller special needs classes. Public schools end up doing a lot more social work than private schools in the end of the day, because they're the schools of last resort.

Like I said, I'm not trying to make excuses. It's just not as much money as it sounds like. I agree with you. More money would help tremendously. And often it does. Massachusetts pays a lot more, has smaller districts and smaller class sizes, and kicks the shit out of Mississippi or West Virginia or Oklahoma by just about every education metric there is.

Well of course that's not how it works, that's why it's a change... I really don't even know why you would say that, it's obvious I'm proposing something different from how it is now. lol

Considering the HS graduation and post-sec is federally ""standardised"" (SAT), I think it's about time the educational system be nationalised. There's so much broken about how it works now, and you can't get a consistent quality of education between different states for so many reasons (population levels, etc). So one can't reasonably expect that a federally defined meter-stick (SAT tests) can be consistently achieved by students with such wild variety in quality of education from one state to the next.

Like, just look at the state highway system before federal interstate happened. Clearly the educational system would benefit in similar vein.

And just to clarify, it's not so much I'm saying _you're_ making excuses. More, the points you're making (as valid as they are), are being used as excuses, so they should be treated as such (agnostic of whom says them).

""Because they believe in accountability and the overwhelming majority of parents care.""

So, what this poster is implying is that the US is unique because Americans *do not* believe in accountability and the overwhelming majority of American parents *do not* care (about their childrens education). I cannot imagine a more culturally ignorant and hateful thing to say about your fellow citizens. I’m offended by this lazy self-righteous attitude that places all non-Americans on a pedestal, while tossing your American neighbors in the garbage with basically no evidence. The assumption is that everything bad that happens in America is because American citizens are uniquely horrible (not the commenter mind you, because they recognize how wicked Americans are), and all other countries are amazing perfect utopias because they have model citizens. 

Having actually lived abroad, I cannot emphasize how ignorant and dehumanizing this attitude is. People in other countries are just as flawed and imperfect and wonderful as Americans. They don’t have ‘better students,’ and ‘better parents’ and frankly I don’t know why you would assume that if you ever spent any time in another country. I love traveling and meeting new cultures because you recognize how much we all have in common despite different traditions, languages, norms etc..

Regardless - I still don’t see this as an “ [attack on all Americans].” We are all aware that there are good students and bad…. attentive parents and neglectful parents (for many reasons). The issue that we have in the US is that a lack of safety net for basic childcare needs results in many parents placing the burden onto the education system. Instead of the people in charge of our education system addressing the issue though, individual teachers are expected to correct the issues all so the bureaucracy can look good on paper. 

It’s really disappointing that so many people refuse to address issues in order to keep up the idea of their perfect world. It is literally the issue that is causing teacher burnout.

Ever heard of Kaizen or Agile methodology? There's a reason Toyota is very good at what they do, they embrace mistakes and learn from them.

I don't know the No Child Left Behind stuff well enough to actually talk properly about it, but when you say something like ""improve scores and funding"" I can immediately see a problem with it. Funding should NEVER be tied to results, that's just fucked up I have to say.

Also, clearly local tax dollars don't work, otherwise the USA educational system would not be where it is now, so don't act like that's a real solution. Furthermore, the High School barrier to entry (SAT) is federal, not state, so another rationale why state reliance honestly isn't working (and proven not working).

I'm talking about federal taking charge here. And yeah I know there's going to be people who are all ""don't tread on me, we're a state, etc"", but like, imagine if people did that with the interstate highway and that never became a thing. Middle USA would be so ultra fucked right now. There's very good examples of successful federal/national programs working, and again, just because you fail once doesn't mean you give up, that's a horrible lesson to ""teach"".

What I'm talking about is setting actual specifics that raise the standard for everyone without having it being a KPI-bs lead shitshow. (Key Performance Indicators). Set the wage for all teachers nation wide to START at $85k, regardless of whatever state you're in, and have that go up as you (the teacher) stay in the system. Make it so parents and students grade the teachers and have that influence performance review for teachers, they're literally the customer here, why can't they influence which teachers get rewarded and which don't? IMO they should.

Next, make it so each classroom is no larger than 25 students, ever. EVER. It's conclusive that students and teachers both do poorly when classes go much over this number, so there is no reason it should go over this number.

Will this cost more money? Fuck yeah it will. But guess what: YOUR POPULATION WILL GET EDUCATED IN THE PROCESS. Your GDP will grow, and it will pay for itself. What a fucking concept, let's invest in ourselves right. Oh my what a stupid libtard thing to say.

Now, I'm sorry if I'm coming across as accusing you of saying that, I know you're not. I'm more trying to say that to get ahead of anyone that _might_ say it. Like, it's okay for people to invest money into businesses and other such things, but tax dollars investing in our future workforce? Get fucked, it's my money, yadda yadda yadda.

Calling out our flaws like this isn’t anti-American though, it’s what leads to positive discussion and change. For example if French schools *are* generally more effective than ours, what are we doing wrong… etc. 

I think the point of the comments here is that “parents in ____ country care more” because they have the opportunities to do so.

Parents often have a “just fix it” attitude toward teachers because the parents do not have the energy to address the issues themselves.

kj71mf1,t3_19dp6ng,2024-01-23 14:07:05,Economics,"From Bloomberg News reporter Charlotte Hampton:

Disgruntled employees cost US companies an estimated $1.9 trillion in lost productivity last year, according to research from Gallup that puts a price tag on workplace unhappiness.

That eye-popping figure stems from more Americans feeling detached from their employers in the aftermath of the pandemic. A measure of engagement from Gallup’s surveys had been steadily rising for a decade, but peaked in 2020. The disruption of the past few years reduced satisfaction in the workplace, with more employees saying they don’t clearly know what’s expected of them — a symptom that reduces engagement.

The stakes are high for companies because an engaged workforce increases productivity and that helps boost sales and profit. Connecting better with staff also ups worker retention.

Having motivated employees is linked to “a lot of different outcomes that are important to organizations,” said Jim Harter, chief scientist for Gallup’s workplace practice.

The research paints a bleak picture of America’s workforce. Only one-third of respondents said they are engaged at their jobs, while half are giving minimum effort — what has been dubbed “quiet quitting.”",bloomberg,t2_1095cgk5,19,0,reddit2

kjjj1nl,t3_19dp6ng,2024-01-25 18:53:01,Economics," Most folks grow up knowing there is a difference between ""Work"" and ""Play"" and the thing that makes Work tolerable is someone pays you to do it so you have some resources available for Play. What the Reagan Revolution did is break that connection between Pay and Play for the American worker. Until the late 1970's, families could get by with a single income, kids were supervised nearly 24/7 by the non-working spouse which made them better behaved which made teachers' jobs much easier and a lot more learning took place in school. Business could count on a steady supply of well educated workers who understood that for 8 hours a day, they had to do what somebody else decided and that not paying attention during that period had consequences.  Flunking a grade or being expelled in school became not getting promoted or fired in the workplace for pretty much for the same reasons. Doing well also had consequences - gold stars, honors, ""first chairs""/leading roles, membership on the Varsity from school translated into pay raises, ATTABOY's and advancement at work. 

What broke this system began with LBJ's tax cuts for the rich that allowed the ones dividing the profits to keep about 6x what Ike's taxcode had, so that's what they did - kept the profits for themselves. One unintended(???) consequence was the need for overseers to keep the workers ""in line"". Since the ""carrot"" of higher pay was gone, more ""stick"" was required. This is why the top 90 to 99% continued to receive real pay hikes - they were protecting the top 1% who got about 84% of all the real increases in compensation since 1981. Reagan's War on Unions and his tax code that destroyed upward mobility in America and sealed the deal - individual effort no longer counted towards advancement at work. Promotions and raises went to those who were best at sucking up to the one's evaluating their performance. 

Thing is, while school performance has been in decline since 1964, people did not lose their ability to assess their situations. As it became more and more obvious working for somebody else was not going to make your life better, no matter how hard you tried to improve your performance, those who would not become sycophants decided instead to simply withhold their best efforts. This has been going on since the early 1980's, and recently psychologists came up with a name for it ""Quiet Quitting"".

This highest management focus on MONEY instead of the business strikes me as the best explanation for what's going on with Boeing. Twenty years ago, their execs were Engineers who understood how to build great airplanes. Today, they're a bunch of grads from The Business School whose focus never really scans beyond the next quarter's earnings. Result: their newest planes fly themselves into the ground and have important parts fall off during flight. This has been going on since Reagan made greed good and hard work meaningless.

Its hard to feel any sympathy when its a disaster of their own creation.

Las week I had a frank conversation with my global tech manager, who thankfully and understandably is on the same page, about how much of the R&D organization is very disillusioned with corporate decision-making regarding thin staffing, looming restructuring, and budget cuts from R&D, even though they are still making money hand-over-fist.  

Then you have McKinsey and all the other paid consultants that seem to know best, except all the times when they're wrong.  Meanwhile its like farts in the wind if any employee questions or at least wants the rationale explained.

I have always wondered if these bad decisions are by design; Investors/institutions load up on controlling shares to get board member seats, elect their CEO and his team, intentionally make poor strategic decisions that end badly in the long term all while loading up on long dated out-of-money put contracts through some opaque family office.  All to create predictable investment window where they can time their options contracts for the largest return.  Its far easier to make bad decisions vs. taking risks to make all the right decisions, when you can make big money on predicting a timed outcome.

We had an operator sabotage a piece of equipment and cost the company about a million dollars. The act of sabotage happened after a group of operators was promised a date to be converted to full time and that promise was broken. The managers were stunned that someone might feel empowered to wrong them in response to being wronged. 

They sounded a lot like you. ""Why wouldn't a personal just leave if they were unhappy? Why would they seek revenge?""

I had to remind them that people are emotional and that getting even with an untrustworthy party is human nature and helps ensure trustworthiness in the future. If there are negative penalties to bad behavior, people are less likely to behave badly.

We never caught the operator who did it. The group of operators did eventually get their conversion to full time employees. And management has been way more cautious about empty promises since then. 

Was what the operator did right? No. Did it lead to an improvement in managerial behavior? Yes.

And I as the engineer who runs the line that was sabotaged am glad that managment cleaned up their act a little. It's hard to do my job when management is alienating operators to point of sabotage. The attrition rates declined as well and now we can actually retain people long enough for them to get good at their jobs. Mistakes are down. Productivity is up.

j11ab2d,t1_j10tmju,2022-12-20 22:58:31,Economics,"Let's say you have low wages in your area and a shortage of housing. If you're a landlord, you COULD raise your rent, but you would be reducing your potential renting pool and hoping to attract only the best and most prosperous renters.

This is a very niche market and those with the money to do so will rent the best they can in a given price range. Nobody will to pay $2,000 to live in a bug ridden pest hole when they can pay $2,000 and live in a nice apartment with a pool, right?

So the landlords expenses have to go up along with the rent and those expenses will be in better maintenance and making his apartments as nice as possible.

Let's say you have an apartment building and it has 20 apartments in it. You didn't build that building with cash, you took out a loan. Not only do you have to pay the loan, but also property taxes and basic utilities. You also have to set money aside for maintenance expenses.

If the building cost $4M to build and you're on a fixed rate 30 year mortgage at 5%, your monthly payment is $21,473. Let's add on another $5,000 for basic utilities and miscellaneous expenses each month.

In this case, you have $26,473 in expenses every month.

Whatever those expenses come to, that is your absolute rent floor. In this case, it's $1,323.65/mo per apartment. Below that, you're losing money.

However, you still want to make a profit, so you have to add a bit on top for yourself. If you want to make at least $50K/yr before taxes, each apartment will have to earn you an extra $2,500 over expenses. That's $208 per month per apartment.

Total cost of an apartment in this building is $1,531.65/mo.

Well, the state and local property taxes just increased and so did utilities and the cost of materials used for maintenance.

Either you take a pay cut to offset the costs and keep rent stable, or you increase rent.

As you can see, an increase in any expense has a ripple effect that is felt by everyone, business owner and consumer.

It is hard to bring down prices that have gone up without drastic changes in both supply and demand as well as the money supply. Reducing money supply is known as [deflation and is a very risky move](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/why-deflation-bad-economy.asp).

A common idea is that a person should spend no more than 25% of their income on housing. If everyone makes $40K after taxes, then a one bedroom apartment should be right around $1,000/mo. A two bedroom apartment should be between $1,500 and $2,000/mo.

If average wages increase to $80K/yr after taxes, then landlords would be foolish not to raise rent prices.",12B88M,t2_byc81bke,9,0,reddit3

j115en8,t1_j10ubd1,2022-12-20 22:24:18,Economics,"Let's test your theory on one of the most frequently used companies in the US, Amazon.

The CEO of Amazon is Jeff Bezos. His annual total compensation is [$1,681,840](https://www1.salary.com/amazon-com-inc-Executive-Salaries.html).

Amazon has approximately [1,500,000 employees](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1324557/quarterly-number-of-amazon-employees/) and the lowest paid position at Amazon is that of [dock worker. They are paid $20,000/yr](https://www.careerbliss.com/amazon/salaries/).

If you took all of Jeff Bezos' compensation and divided it among the lowest paid 50% of all Amazon employees (thus leaving out virtually all management positions), you would have given those individuals a grand total annual raise of of $2.24.

That's not per hour, that's for the whole year.

So tell me again how CEO pay is the problem.

As for shareholders, it's their investments that make those companies possible. They are risking their own money for the potential of profit. Why should they not get paid?

However, [Amazon stock does NOT pay dividends](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/16/why-doesnt-amazon-pay-a-dividend/). They use their money to grow the company by branching out and making Amazon as diverse and secure as possible. This might mean that the value of a share might go up, which a shareholder could then sell for a profit.

So, just like CEOs, shareholders are not the problem, either.

However, Amazon's gross revenue for 2021 was [$469.822B](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue) and operating costs for 2021 were [$444.943B](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/operating-expenses).

j129tci,t1_j11ab2d,2022-12-21 03:26:41,Economics,"Cry me a river for the rich landlords and their profitable investments. A couple MAJOR flaws with your analysis. Most landlords are not deriving their entire income from rental surplus (aka ""cashflow positive"") unless they own a ton of apartments (they normally work a day job). Rental surplus is more like the icing on the cake considering your mortgage and other costs are getting paid by the renters and you're gaining equity with each payment. Also, the home value is generally rising as well at a leveraged rate (usually something like 20% down so 5x) so they'll make a boatload when they eventually sell. Even if they don't sell, they can still use the equity to take out more loans and buy more rental homes. Also, there are major tax deductions they get and reasonably low rate loans guaranteed by the government.

This is the same argument corporations use for passing on costs. THE REALITY IS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO FORCE COMPANIES TO CHARGE LESS/PAY THEIR WORKERS MORE MEANING PROFIT MARGINS WON'T BE AS HIGH. Now the more market oriented solution is to break up big companies with hefty anti-trust laws to prevent monopolies/monopsonies.",ProductivityMonster,t2_6f9rt,3,0,reddit3

Those budgets are here to stay. Either with a few overpriced agents or better spent raising the staffing count / pay across the board. I'd find better value in option two but board execs will sink their hospitals before they admit the medical workers are winning.

I could spend 10 hours making 10 wood bowls from a hunk of driftwood, but it doesn't mean a thing if nobody wants to buy my bowls for the price I want to charge.

Let's say I pay myself $15/hr and the cost of the equipment, lease and utilities for that 10 hours is $50.

That's $200 in expenses making the bottom price for the bowls $20 each.

But if people are only willing to pay $10, there is only one place I can cut expenses.

Utilities, lease and equipment costs remain steady at $5 per bowl, so the only thing I can cut is my labor. 

I'm now paying myself $5 per hour and falling behind on rent, food, health insurance, car payments, etc.

I could increase my productivity to 3 bowls per hour, but that destroys the idea of labor theory because my labor isn't increasing the cost of the bowl. All my extra labor does is increase my hourly income.

Now I've made 24 bowls per 8 hour day for 20 days. The local market is saturated and people are only willing to to pay $5 per bowl.

It would be a waste of my time to continue making bowls, wouldn't it?

Labor Theory automatically assumes my labor is what sets the price of the bowl, not costs or demand. If that were the case, I could make a million bowls and charge $20 per bowl and people would still buy them.",12B88M,t2_byc81bke,2,0,reddit3

If you really want the full breakdown, it really still has to do with Covid.  Hospital staffs (nurses in particular) have been outright quitting the industry altogether in droves since Covid, and most hospitals are *severely* understaffed right now.  Because of the staffing issue, hospitals aren’t able to perform as many procedures as usual, so despite the current outrageous cost of American healthcare, they aren’t charging out near as much money in procedures as they would’ve been in pre-Covid years. My hospital alone has closed over half of their operating rooms, because they no longer have the staff to be working in them. 

In order to combat this, they are forced to dig even deeper with the Agency costs so that they can staff some of the ORs and continue working.  So…

Here's the hard truth, it's way easier to become a doctor than it is to become a sports star or super musician, the entertainer also services exponentially more people than a doctor ever can. 

Like let's say it's an arbitrary musician, that musician tours 30 cities in a year, doing 10,000 person crowds at $80 a ticket minimum.

That tour generates $24 million  and satisfies 300,000 people.

Again, no shit - grocers are much more consolidated than hospitals, and additionally their administrative staff is much less likely to need specialized degrees to do their job.

>the comparison is completely inapt.

It wasn't a comparison. I was simply saying that hospitals are a low margin business, closer to grocery margins than the average of the S&P500. I wasn't making any comparisons of the businesses, just using grocers as a benchmark. That seems fairly obvious, so I'm not sure why you're extrapolating this into something more than what was written.

>Furthermore it directly goes to the wider issue of where top line revenue ends up and goes to the root of the nursing crisis.

For like the third time in this conversation, hospitals are not nearly as consolidated as grocers. The spread between gross and net margin for hospitals is about the same as the average for the S&P500, despite the net margins being lower for hospitals, which suggests that hospitals aren't really overspending on admin like you're suggesting. 

Edit: also, banks and software companies tend to have the largest gross margins and the largest spreads between gross and net margin. Would you say that investment bankers and software engineers are poorly compensated?

The nursing crisis isn't because *hospital execs are making tons of money*.",saudiaramcoshill,t2_11w4oz,-4,0,reddit3

There are so many hidden costs in training a new employee/covering their mistakes. Retaining your current employees with raises matching the market rate is *cheaper* than hiring new people, even if you get them *below the market rate.*  


Seriously, training someone costs money--you can't not pay them while they are training(where they will be providing little to no value for you), and on top of that you ALSO need someone to train them, which will reduce THEIR value provided to the company as well.  


And considering even veterans make mistakes, newbies make many, many more. Mistakes are costly to fix, as you need to pay someone to actually fix the mistake, possible issue compensation to customers, retrain that employee to avoid the mistake in the future, etc...

A new employee likely takes a few weeks, or even months(depending on the job), to break even as an investment. Giving your already trained vets a raise to retain them?

Hands problem off to HR. HR comes up with a rigid system of rules that must be followed before an employee can receive a raise outside of a regular COL increase. 

Those rules will include: no raise without change in job title (incredibly common), no raise within a certain number of years, no raises for certain job levels unless otherwise directed, no raises in certain departments, and so on. Usually there are exceptions at upper management’s request. So at these companies it can be very difficult to *negotiate* a raise because HR has been tasked with completely eliminating the very act of pay negotiation for existing employees, out of fear that too many will be given out. So, you can usually only get a big raise if you’re promoted or if you show a competing offer, which brings matters to the attention of higher management, who then grant the exception.

Meanwhile, pay negotiation is allowed for new hires by necessity. So new hires are able to squeeze more money out of the company for the same work, because the only hard limit HR has put in place is the salary range cap for the position.

I went through this. They had to promote me, and nearly double my pay, because they knew I was going to leave otherwise, and there quite literally was no way to give me a raise without giving me a new job. Luckily I was also right for the new position, but they could have kept me with 10-15%. But due to HR “helping,” it was either jack my pay way up with the new position or watch me walk, even though I was doing more than twice the work I was assigned when I was hired.

iy8tgw3,t1_iy7rqr0,2022-11-29 16:45:12,Economics,"There's probably many different explanations for individual cases, from a-hole bosses, to stupidity, to just lack of attention.

One rational explanation is the number of new vs old employees, or the probability of an employee leaving. If you have to increase 10% to 10 employees, vs replacing one employee, which would cost you, after training, 50% more, then you're ahead.

Another way to see it is that changing jobs also has a cost to the employee; it's a pain. If the cost for you is, say 20% of your annual salary, then your current company can pay you 19% less of your current 'market value'.

Businesses will seek financial professionals who can help them manage costs and enhance profitability. Companies will also value personnel who possess deep technical expertise, are excellent communicators and collaborate effectively with colleagues across multiple departments. 

Positions with the best prospects include:

1.    Tax accountant: Companies will seek tax accountants who can help their organizations achieve bottom-line savings through effective tax management strategies. Businesses also need their guidance to maintain compliance with tax regulations, such as FAS 109 and FIN 48. Tax accountants with one to three years of experience at large companies (more than $250 million in sales) are expected to see an average national starting salary in the range of $46,500 to $61,500.

2.    Compliance director: Firms need professionals who can help them comply with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandates and prepare for the potential transition to International Financial Reporting Standards. New regulations that are issued as a result of the financial crisis may generate further demand for professionals with the requisite compliance expertise. The starting salary range for a compliance director at a small company (up to $25 million in sales) is forecast to be $83,750 to $108,500.

3.    Credit manager/supervisor: Companies need professionals who can contribute to the bottom line by reducing inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. As a result, credit and collections specialists who can evaluate credit risk, manage delinquent payments and help improve cash flow are in demand. Base compensation for credit managers/supervisors working in small companies is projected to range between $42,500 and $57,500.

Giving students unlimited access to loans has simply driven up the cost of education because education is characterized by a high demand market (i.e., highly inelastic market). Think about it, if you need a life-saving prescription or some service that is essential to your well-being you will pay whatever it takes to purchase that service. Most people agree education is also essential in this sense. In fact, you will pay (and borrow to pay) as much as you possible can to purchase such essential services.

The corollary of all this is that seller will charge essentially whatever you can afford. If you can only afford $100, the seller can only charge that much. If you can borrow $900 more and the seller knows you absolutely require that service, they will charge $1000. This is what is happening right now in the education market. The government essentially gives students access to more loans with the intention of making education cheaper when in fact the universities know how much additional loan assistance the government has provided and simply increases tuition by the amount of the assistance.

This is simple economics, really, in a high demand market. By restricting the amount of loans made available to students, this will reduce the amount of tuition universities are able to charge thereby eliminating the amount of debt students are saddled with when graduating. Student loan assistance, while attractive on its face, is unsound in application and actually has the perverse effect of increasing the cost of education.",aleutian,t2_32d39,1,0,reddit1

Sounds about right factually speaking. The question is, what's a college degree worth? 

Look, in 1981 and earlier a person could *probably* make a living without a college degree.  What are you left with now? Coffee Shop? Retail Hell?  

Unless you're in a union town you're basically screwed without a college degree. There's something to be said about starting your own business, but then again - you'd benefit from an accounting degree if you did it.

So don't look at it as the value you receive from a college degree, look at it like how fucked you are without one and factor the costs from that end.  

Yes, yes...I'm sure there are plenty of singular examples that 'disprove' the need for a college degree. The rest of us 'regular' human beings didn't have the right timing, luck, rich uncle, whatever.

c1gnan9,t1_c1gmp0s,2011-02-13 20:30:56,Economics,"Well there is a distinction in America between private and public universities. Most universities are not state funded, and are consequently more expensive. This is unlike Sweden which only has [three](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Sweden\#Private_universities) private universities.

America's university system is a bit like the healthcare system of most of western Europe. Theres plenty of options funded by the state, ex: [New York State Schools](http://www.suny.edu/student/paying_tuition.cfm) and [California State Schools](http://www.calstate.edu/SAS/fa_coa.shtml) (which actually cost less in tuition than your school, between 4,000-5000$ USD **a year**). However, for those who want it, there are private options which are more expensive, that's your Harvards, Princetons, and Yales, much like the private hospitals one can go to in parts of Europe if they choose to purchase private insurance on top of state insurance.

The problem is the difference in views on colleges here, many people see state schools as ""not as good"" or ""for the poor"", which is partially due to an American attitude that people have to be able to succeed on their own without help from the state to pay for things. This is why people spare no expense to send their child to a non-state school, and subsequently take out tons of loans to pay for it, enabling the schools to raise their tuitions because they know their market is limitless and gullible. We're reaching a crisis point here where tons of people who took out thousands upon thousands of loans are realizing that they can't get a job to pay back the loans, letting the loans accrue interest without them paying anything down on it. Many suspect this will be the next financial crisis America faces, and that it contributes to the continuation of the current one, because as more people graduate with these inflated cost degrees, they all attempt to crowd fields which can actually give them enough money to pay back loans (business, medicine, etc...) meaning that these industries will become oversaturated with workers and possibly suffer a decrease in wages and the other negative consequences of a workforce that's too large for one industry.",lolocoster,t2_3l1o8,8,0,reddit1

You still network in your classes and social events, while coming ut of school with 30k in debt instead of 150k in debt.

My wife worked and paid her own way, and finished her two degrees with only 10k debt in total.  It took her a bit longer, and instead of doing 5 courses a semester she did three and took classes over the summer too so she did 9 courses a year instead of 10...  

It took her five years to complete a four year degree, but she didn't have to struggle to pay off her debts...

The total was added to significantly by summer internships. 

Also, keeping costs down was very important to me. I lived in fairly  cheap housing [this was in the early 2000's] (300 bucks a month and shared it with a  roommate, I chose where I went to school based somewhat on cost of living of the town), and ate bulk dried beans, bananas and tuna for most of my meals, (unless I could get free food on campus, in which case I tried to take home as much as possible.) If I could get cheap meat I would try to dehydrate it back at home on my dad's drying rack, and I would bring that to school. 

My sister didn't have to work so hard at keeping costs down because her scholarships (and internships) were much better than mine. (She was a national merit scholarship recipient, had a large grant from some other organization, was the valedictorian, placed first in state debate, was the captain of her debate, tennis, and various other academic teams, led her team to a regional championship in tennis, was all state in Tennis (and we were in the largest division of school that existed in a very populated state). So, she was pretty much set (in fact she could have been more set if she decided to play college tennis, but she decided to just focus on school in college.) 

Anyway, it can be done if you are determined. There isn't a day that goes by when people gripe about student loans that I don't laugh and wonder where these people come from. ",majnunredfoot,t2_3ioah,3,0,reddit1

I don't think it's necessarily irrelevant. The author (or perhaps just the commenter he's quoting) seems to be examining the costs of a single university over time, and extrapolating from that to make sweeping generalizations about how the ""value of the BA"" has changed. 

Maybe it has, or maybe it's just that this particular university is now run by greedy assholes. I don't know. But I think it's a pretty good point to note that it's not really necessary to go to a private school to get a good degree in accounting, since there are multiple good public schools available. 

Sure, he paid more than he needed to back in '81. But I don't think the fact that he could now be paying *much* more than he needs to for his daughter really supports his claim that the degree has devalued, or that tuition costs have skyrocketed across the board. 

Tuition costs probably *have* skyrocketed across the nation, but an argument based off one unnamed university doesn't make for a particularly compelling claim.

Congratulations on your degree, now please proceed to the lineup next to it where you acquire some useful skills.  Oh shit, there's 500 other accountants waiting there in front of you?  I'm saying the market is over-saturated with accounting and the degree is just a stepping stone in a career of uses.  My 'theory' isn't 'flimsy,' the world works this way in every industry and accountants just aren't in demand right now.  These things will change when people actually trust the financial system again.

>Accounting isn't a skill?  Something that requires certification isn't a skill?  The fuck?   

As noted above, going to College/University doesn't make you skilled nor does it necessarily make you more useful to society.  You've basically proved you can learn how to work with numbers by the end of your degree.  It's the same in engineering, you've proved that you can put your mind to solving problems.

> > I know engineers who make less.

>Oh good.  More engineer worship.  I really think most people don't have a fucking clue what an engineer is any more.  I think the word has lost all meaning, given these ""engineers"" have somehow become morally, intellectually and financially superior to every other profession known to man.

You've got a lot of negative feelings towards engineers, which I'm not going to try to change because I truly don't care, but I do want to shine some light on the subject since you are parading your opinion around like some ankst-driven 15 year old.

Intellectual superiority isn't fair on the whole, but some truly great inventions come from engineers: uncovering further space travel plans, development of the large hadron collider, designing pharmaceutical reactors...etc.  It's not what accountants do isn't great, it's just a matter that it's not *fantastic*, it's not worth the cover of national geographic that you balanced your companies books perfectly.  The financial element just comes with the territory, I know accountants who make a lot of money as well, it's completely dependent on industry and experience (I'm in oil and gas); accountants in charge of a few small local businesses simply aren't going to get the same sort of pay-day as people that are part of a billion dollar network.

Morally?  Who just fucked the world over financially?  The bankers.  I took an oath when I received my degree to protect the public.  As an engineer if I see anything that I have knowledge to be unsafe, or if I so much as ever get ticketed for drunk driving I will lose my license to practice the same as a doctor would.  For these reasons alone I must (as must all engineers) conduct myself to a high moral standard, simply to ensure that I keep putting bread on the table.",fyeah,t2_3gcyr,0,0,reddit1

College education exists in a bubble and now degrees are being handed out like candy - driving down the value of a bachelors and masters degree while the costs are driven up and the supply of jobs has dwindled.

Being able to think critically and take in new information is more important than memorizing flash cards and being handed a useless degree.

We know that the government actively works with corporations like wal-mart, monsanto, haliburton, microsoft, and google. They are all embedded and intertwined with one another, this has been well established.  Wal-mart has harmed many small businesses and does nothing for standard of living.

That's a fragrant load of horseshit.  You might as well say learning to read doesn't make you more useful to society.  By that logic, a population of illiterates is exactly as ""useful"" as a population of university graduates.

Bullshit.  This is nothing more than talking down education in order to justify underpaying professional employees.

Nope.  I have negative feelings about worshipping engineers.  Mainly because it leads to people having negative feelings about everyone who isn't an engineer.

Great.  Some truly great inventions come from philosophers, historians, mathematicians, architects and dancers too.

Science and engineering worshippers make their contempt for everyone else quite clear on a regular basis.

One wonders if they could scale, if it's only mismanagement. I doubt this. If you have twice as many students in Flebonology 101, can you double the professors? It's not as if there are necessarily enough people in the world who can teach it at the university level... we didn't get organic growth in the number of students, there are more because people who wouldn't have traditionally applied to college are now doing so. 

So you fill out the teaching faculty with adjunct professors that no one would ever give tenure too. And worse, your tenured professors are teaching less... you have to have them go seek research grants, making it impossible for them to teach.

Meanwhile, do the price tags get lowered to compensate for the lower quality of education? Not really, because it still costs more than it used to, you now have a higher proportion of staff and administration than you used to. So tuition and fee prices increase.

So you're paying less for more, and when you graduate you're competing with so many more graduates that even if your education wasn't watered down you'd still have trouble being hired.

And this isn't even a good summary of the problem. There are other systemic problems here (grade inflation, increased expectations from those hiring entry level people, etc).",NoMoreNicksLeft,t2_7mcb,6,0,reddit1

There's also a reason accountant salaries haven't gone up much; because the job is easy and the pool of accountants is really large.

kganj6c,t3_18yg3p0,2024-01-04 16:23:36,Economics,"This article essentially rests on the idea that unemployment benefits should be revised whenever we have more unemployment. I base this on the fact that the article notes that state lawmakers have broad power to increase benefits, but are being distracted by the good jobs numbers. I disagree with this basic argument.

First, because not every movement in the economy is a crisis requiring state intervention. You could see this a lot in the early COVID recovery, when businesses in some sectors monopolized the media daily to complain about how difficult it was to hire staff (“no one wants to work anymore”). They demanded the government take action. This was, at its core, an assertion that their businesses should be protected from the natural ebb and flow of market activity by state intervention. Nevermind that the PPP had already intervened by underwriting the staffing costs of millions of businesses with easily-forgiven loans. They wanted even more direct interference to force people to change industries and work for lower wages. You also saw this later with the rise in interest rates, the ensuing collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and the weeks of strident calls in the media once again for state intervention. This time, influential tech investors demanded a full bailout for SBV and that interest rates be once again decreased until their hyper-leveraged industry could become solvent again. Once again, private industry reacted to an ebb in their position in the market by demanding manipulation. Whether or not unemployment benefits should increase is of course a somewhat different issue with its political basis in a totally different group of people, but the reaction to a living market is the same. Sometimes things are good, sometimes things are bad. Let’s not react to every downturn by rigging the market.

Second, and more simply, because the benefits should be set at a reasonable level that works while unemployment is fine and also when it is bad. How many people are on it should make no difference, unless the system is about to run out of money.",LoriLeadfoot,t2_iptbfpg9,102,0,reddit2
kgahd7s,t3_18yg3p0,2024-01-04 15:47:01,Economics,"*From Bloomberg News reporter Michael Sasso:*

An unexpectedly strong US jobs market is helping average Americans keep spending while staying up-to-date on their bills.

With the US unemployment rate still hovering near historical lows, advocates for America’s jobless worry that the solid labor-market data is hiding the pain of those stung by recent cuts in sectors like housing, technology and human resources.

It’s also allowing state legislators, who have broad license to set benefit levels for unemployment insurance, to keep payouts achingly low. Five states have weekly payment maximums below $300, despite inflation that’s raised the price of an average basket of goods and services by almost 20% since 2020. A third of states don’t account for wage growth, and by extension inflation, in their payouts.

By the numbers, the average American should feel relatively secure in their jobs. Friday’s employment report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by a robust 170,000 in December, based on economists’ forecasts, and the jobless rate ticked up to 3.8%, still low by historical standards. Weekly jobless claims have remained low as well, while wages keep increasing, helping to offset rising prices.

In Atlanta, LaRon Eskew, 28, lost his job at a large bank’s data center in February. He’s been getting by on gig work — fixing cars and installing security cameras — but the side hustles only bring in about three-quarters of his former salary.

“I wouldn’t say I’m sweating bullets, but I’m up to my neck,” said Eskew, whose rent has climbed to $1,600 monthly from $1,200 per month in the past two years.

No.  The pandemic was not 'the natural ebb and flow of market activity'.  The government prevented many businesses from operating due to a temporary health emergency.  The sensible response to this was a temporary stimulus program to keep the business infrastructure in place so economic activity could pick up where it left off.

This is false.  The stimulus generally required employers to keep paying the same wages.

If we were to callously take your experience as an example for the economy as a whole, you were laid off because the market demand for your role dropped. You struggled to find a similar job because, again, the market demand for your role dropped. This was the market’s attempt to shift you from something unproductive to something productive. Unemployment slows down that process by giving everyone a lot more time to wait around for essentially the same role to pop up again.

kgb8h9c,t1_kgb0hy3,2024-01-04 18:22:42,Economics,"That is how the economy moves people from industry to industry. When the real estate market dips and realtors become unemployed, the cream of the crop stick around because they get good job offers in the industry, and the rest have to find new jobs. This isn’t because we don’t care about realtors, but because there is simply not a demand in the economy for so many of them. When real estate is booming, people leave other industries to become realtors, because the market signals a higher demand for realtors.

You can think of unemployment insurance as essentially a brake on this process. We give affected people a little bit more time to sort out into their “slots” within the economy by relieving the financial pressure of being unemployed. This most often will result in more people staying in their industry, as they’re able to hold out for better offers. But it’s wise to avoid extending this grace period for too long, or pumping the brakes too hard, to refer back to my analogy. That simply disrupts our ability as a society to sort people into the jobs that make the most sense for all of us.

I agree that in a general downturn, where seemingly everybody is out of work, a bit more assistance is warranted. There’s no point maximizing the speed of sorting out jobs if there are no jobs to sort into. But as we all know, the number of times this sort of situation will be invoked will greatly outmatch the number of times that it actually *happens.* People have a tendency to treat slack in their own sector as a general downturn. See my example of Silicon Valley, and I’d also add specificity to my other example during the worker shortage and say that it was often restaurateurs who made the loudest calls for workers to be forced back.

The first is that a lot of unemployment is frictional or short term - you quit your job because you don't like it, but are confident that you can get another job in a month or two. And so you are unemployed for a month or two. 

Or you are laid off and it takes 1-2 months to get a new job in your field.

In both of those cases, you should be focusing on getting the new job, and not going to some government mandated training.

First, the ""regular"" unemployment metric, U-3, is unrelated to whether people are collecting unemployment insurance benefits. It's actually based on responses to the [Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html), a joint project of the US Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That's why I said it includes people who have looked for work in the past four weeks, rather than people who are receiving UI benefits. Receiving UI benefits is not a requirement. This also means it counts people who are ineligible for UI benefits, as long as they are looking for work.

The CPS ultimately collects responses from around 60,000 households each month, which is a shockingly large sample size if you are familiar with sample size math (the ""law of large numbers"" is a good place to start if you are not). That large sample size is so the CPS can collect statistically accurate results not only for the nation as a whole, but also for all 50 states and for the 12 largest metropolitan areas.

So the data for U-6 is of course collected the same way: the Current Population Survey.

Also, [BLS collects a total of six different ""measures of labor underutilization""](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm). U-3 is the oldest and most widely reported, with U-6 being the preferred measure to examine a ""broader"" definition of unemployment.",Ruminant,t2_3pbxt,1,0,reddit2

If you didn't save up enough to do so, then you probably need to attend some money-management classes anyway & you'll be paid by the government to do so.

One person working three jobs counts as one person working three jobs, not three people working one job.

The government does track a form of underemployment, which is reflected in the [U-6 unemployment measure](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE). Their definition of ""underemployment"" means wanting full-time work but settling for part-time because you cannot find a full-time job. That obviously doesn't measure the wages paid a full-time job. However, when you consider that unemployment, underemployment, and multiple jobholding are all at or near record lows, while incomes have seen above-average growth (and low-income workers in particular have seen the largest growth in their incomes), it's hard to take seriously the claim that unemployment is low because everyone is working multiple terrible, low-paying jobs.",Ruminant,t2_3pbxt,7,0,reddit2

kgbmodr,t1_kgbccva,2024-01-04 19:42:22,Economics,"Theoretically, unemployment is an insurance. You wouldn’t insure a new Porsche the way you’d insure a ‘98 civic. When we think of it like a benefit, it feels wrong to “help” one person more than another, but when we consider it stopgap insurance coverage, it seems more reasonable that a higher wage should be insured to a higher level. Then of course like all insurance policies, higher level of coverage comes with a more expensive policy/more pay-in. 

There are benefits to the economy to increasing UI with wage and allowing people to insure their income better. The person making a low wage probably isn’t paying 3k/month to put their child in daycare and local businesses benefit from being able to continue spending in transition. There’s also the complexity that providing benefits toward the mean can incentivize anyone earning in the lower end to find ways to get on or stay on unemployment. There’s obviously some questions tied up in how we handle the system, especially since participation is not optional — are the goals more economic or social support? Do we want to require people to insure their wage at a higher level whether they want to or not?

Some people may not view insurance that way, but if so it's due to poor fiscal theory because insurance is objectively a sub-optimal investment whose only upside is the risk mitigation. I don't believe such poor theory is a good basis for how we structure our society's safety nets.

>The person making a low wage probably isn’t paying 3k/month to put their child in daycare

Providing government benefits specifically to allow people to continue using daycare seems like the pinnacle of bad fiscal + bad social policy. If you are at home unemployed, you can absolutely watch your kids. I say this as someone whose family has given up dual income to have a parent with the kids, and the benefits of doing so are well documented.

If you want to use childcare, you should be able to pay for it. But there's no reason we should be subsidizing it in the very situation where it is no longer necessary.

Everything else you're proposing is inflationary economic policy. Injecting money to raise the mean income will do so by raising the cost of everything. This sort of economic intervention penalizes those who work above-mean to earn above-mean, and penalizes those who have assets and savings.

Somehow many econ wonks have gotten this wacky idea that the best thing the government can do is to stick their fingers into as many parts of the economy as possible and that there are no repercussions for doing so.

In fact, for most POC professionals, the pay is decreasing as are the frequency and quality of job offers. I’m pretty sure that’s not the case for white male professionals on average. 

Fact is, the temp/recruiting agencies were looked at as places to get experience and higher pay due to job insecurity. Now, all they offer on average is no transferable experience, no upward mobility, no benefits, and pay that is as low as non professionals and tradesmen. 

Temp agencies and their jobs are honeytraps for professionals to be debased and reduced to working class status.

I know some experienced lawyers who are routinely overlooked for temporary and/permanent legal jobs paying more than $50-80/hr while inexperienced white lawyers fresh out of law school are paid $250k and experienced white lawyers are paid $450k or more at firms. 

Most experienced POC lawyers working temp jobs are lucky if they’re making more than $50-75.

kgdbqc5,t1_kgd50ag,2024-01-05 01:42:27,Economics,"Before I respond to any of your points, I’d like to clarify, as I did to someone below, that I was trying to show in a reasoned way the two views or approaches people often take when entering discussion on UI. So nothing in that post is what “I’m proposing”. 

I disagree wholly on your view of insurance. Under that premise, comprehensive coverage on a Porsche is “poor fiscal theory”, as is presumably the comparable portion of coverage on a home owners policy, outside of liability, as homes have fixed rebuilding costs and most damage to a home is far from “unthinkable”. I don’t want to accuse, but your first paragraph reads like people shouldn’t have Porsches if the loss of it would be consequential. Risk mitigation is a significant positive factor in personal wealth accumulation as well as economic growth of a society. Without the option, personal savings need to be significantly higher which ties up funds which could be used toward growth and there is potential social burden from people who are devastated by a potentially moderate loss (say, of that ‘98 civic, but instead of paying $50/month in insurance, they’re out 8k to replace the car). 

Second, I think we also disagree on the societal benefit of childcare. Women are disproportionately burdened with consequences of unaffordable childcare. I’m not sure if you were deliberately ignoring the comment on the reality of childcare being difficult to get into and unemployment insurance being a temporary measure in all cases, literally just a stopgap during job transitions, but if one parent needs to give up a career they desire because of 6-10 weeks of job hunting (which can really be a full time job and still require childcare), then I see that as a huge loss both to society and in direct personal impact. It also destabilizes children who may lose friends they’ve had since birth. You may feel a parent should stay home with the children but it makes no sense to dismiss the discussion because you share an alternate view. 

Your next two paragraphs are just ranting about pacing UI benefits with the lost wage being inflationary. Since UI begins its life as a tax, I don’t believe that to be the case were such a policy adopted. However, I don’t feel like digging into that conversation further.",Angiellide,t2_9hzmow2c,1,0,reddit2

Buddy, they call, send letter, send emails, and even visit in person. They do this for everyone. Not just unemployed people.

kgcsqr2,t1_kgc5fue,2024-01-04 23:43:21,Economics,"Yeah, that's a fair point too. I guess the point of the program is so that temporary unemployment doesn't completely derail people's lives, which is desirable for a society. And yes, for a lot of people a much higher is benefit is required for unemployment to fulfill that purpose. However raising unemployment as it works right now to something like the median income leads to a couple of outcomes I really don't like.

1. I don't think people should make *more* money while they are unemployed than when they are working. This discourages contribution and encourages abuse.  
OR
2. I don't think people who make more should get more unemployment money than people who make less. At least not unless they pay for the insurance (or rather their company pays more which my limited research seems to suggest they do not.) Preventing the downward mobility of the people who have more at the expense of the people who have less is outrageous.

So what do we do? We charge employers or individuals more UI as they make more money? Probably, but at least for me, if my employer is going to pay pay 4% of my salary to insure my income, I would prefer they just give me the money and let me save it.

That said, I think a lot of people won't do that, or will become unemployed before they have a chance to build enough savings. And boom we are right back in the position of a temporary stint of unemployment becoming a complete disaster for that person.",stansey09,t2_5mmci,1,0,reddit2

Unemployment as a total % might be low, but no one over 15+ years of experience is getting a job for example, but due to the number of positions available and the people who have that experience, it gets lost in the stats.

“Most interestingly, the present analysis suggests that the application of experience-rating formulas to UI taxes, while commonly seen as providing a significant tax incentive for limiting the number of layoffs, is actually structured to limit the impact of layoffs on an employer’s tax rate (both in terms of marginal tax costs and with respect to the number of layoffs needed to reach the maximum tax rate in a state’s tax schedule). This conclusion appears borne out in the results of the analysis and in the experience-rating formulas themselves. Because the benefits assigned to employer experience-rating formulas in any given year are averaged either over the previous 3 years (in the benefit-ratio formula) or over all other years (in the reserve-ratio formula), the impact of changing experience levels is considerably mitigated.”

kgdjs8k,t1_kgdj8h0,2024-01-05 02:34:53,Economics,"And the BLS says layoffs don’t affect them that much…

Most interestingly, the present analysis suggests that the application of experience-rating formulas to UI taxes, while commonly seen as providing a significant tax incentive for limiting the number of layoffs, is actually structured to limit the impact of layoffs on an employer’s tax rate (both in terms of marginal tax costs and with respect to the number of layoffs needed to reach the maximum tax rate in a state’s tax schedule). This conclusion appears borne out in the results of the analysis and in the experience-rating formulas themselves. Because the benefits assigned to employer experience-rating formulas in any given year are averaged either over the previous 3 years (in the benefit-ratio formula) or over all other years (in the reserve-ratio formula), the impact of changing experience levels is considerably mitigated.

Whenever you have more demand for the same amount of stuff you expect prices to go up, and they did.

But ""higher price for the same thing"" is basically what inflation is.

If what you're worried about is stopping inflation then you want to see things that either cool down demand (such as wage growth slowing down or proxy measures like job openings slowing), or improve supply availability, or both.

Wage growth is obviously nice but it's nice for everybody, which just means inflation, which means your higher wages get deflated back to what they had bought you before, which just gets back to the opening argument.",mpyne,t2_3w2b6,4,0,reddit3

Which is legitimately a stupid thing to do and most financial advisors even recommend against holding the stock of your employer.

The issue with holding onto your employer's stock is that you are putting your working capital and your investment capital into the exact same basket. When people did this in the early 2000s during the tech bubble, people went from multimillionaires to broke and jobless overnight. 

You need to spread out your eggs. Take advantage of all the employee stock plans to their fullest, but you need to understand the vesting period and slowly sell and diversify over time. To do otherwise is to have poor risk management skills.",Godkun007,t2_v04nq,21,0,reddit3

Additionally, the demand for goods and services has been pretty robust despite all these price increases. The sellers read that as a signal that there is still room to increase prices.

When the price of eggs and milk goes up 5% are you going to consume 5% less eggs and milk? Probably not, you will likely demand at least a 5% raise from your employer or find a new employer willing to pay you more.

You are looking at the problem backwards. Why did the price of eggs and milk go up in the first place?

You are making a bad assumption that if often made when trying to approximate general economic behavior: linearity

Economic systems are highly non-linear and wage increases do not necessarily imply higher cost of production.  For example, wage increases maintain your best employees, motivate them to perform well in their jobs in hopes of reward, save the company on training and on-boarding costs, make your company more resistant to poaching providing a competitive edge, and prevents employee burnout which again helps with production.  

It is an investment in your workforce just like any other.  Employee quality very much degrades with lower pay, and the fact is with inflation, every year without a pay increase is a pay cut.  Letting the tools you use to grow your firm degrade rather than maintaining them is generally more costly in the long run.

This is kind of the problem though because the assumption of linearity is a good one in the short term, so many companies in the interest of short-term profit will find keeping wages static is the direction of maximizing profit, as the employees get cheaper with inflation when giving the same pay and the difference is absorbed into the company's profit.  But if this goes on too long, then the system will eventually deviate from the linear approximation and secondary effects (like employee retention) will begin to take effect and the system will no longer be behaving optimally.  This lagging timescale of course will be directly modulated by the rate of inflation as it is the rate at which a static wage decreases in value.",Rodot,t2_5qfnf,1,0,reddit3

jpcu73r,t3_14hujdb,2023-06-24 15:12:43,Economics,"Research belies trope trumpeted by thought leaders:^1

>The historical parallel often trotted out in discussing wage-price spirals is the 1970s. Price and wage inflation seemed to interact throughout that decade, much as the spiral framework suggests. 

>Each surge in general price inflation was followed by a surge in wage inflation, which was followed by more price inflation—and on it went. 

>But the 1970s are flawed as evidence for the existence of spirals.

‘Wage-price spirals’, according to evidence, “are a caricature of what happens to an economy with an inflation problem”:^1,2

>Late last year a group of economists at the IMF interrogated the historical record, creating a database of wage-price spirals in advanced economies dating back to the 1960s. [...] Judged by this longer standard, the IMF economists offered a more upbeat conclusion: the “great majority” (they omitted the exact percentage) of short-term spirals were not followed by a sustained acceleration in wages and prices.

Wage growth is a lagging indicator, confounding hot takes to the contrary:^1,3,4

>[...] the spiral thesis claims not merely that wages matter, but that they predict future inflationary trends. 

>On this count, the Chicago Fed economists found the relationship unidirectional: inflation helps to forecast changes in labour costs, but changes in labour costs fail to predict inflation. Service providers, in other words, raised prices before rising wage costs hit their bottom line. 

>Mr Barlevy and Ms Hu posit that employers may have been ahead of the curve in anticipating the effects of a tight labour market. That makes wages a lagging, not a leading, indicator for inflation.

>Adam Shapiro, an economist with the San Francisco Fed, has been even more critical of the wage worries. In a note in May, he isolated unexpected changes in wages to argue that rising labour costs were only a small driver of non-housing service inflation and a negligible one in broader inflation. 

>Like his Chicago colleagues, he concluded that wage growth was following inflation.

Yeah this is what sucks. Every cycle of wage and price inflation takes a chunk out of the working class and hands it over to the owner class. It's weird because productivity has constantly been on the increase so in relative terms buying something simple like a spoon or a pair of socks has gotten cheaper but things that aren't massed produced like housing (land) have gotten way more expensive. 

I really have no idea how we can raise the floor for wages and eliminate poverty since that does lead to higher prices. I guess it would take literally nationalizing things like housing and then rationing it. Otherwise, you're constantly trying to get ahead of everyone else to be comfortable since it seems that consumer spending adjusts to whatever amount of money people have. The only way we act frugal as a society is if everyone is broke. If everyone has money, as a collective we are just willing to spend more to get the same things so we can have more things. 

I guess the lesson is to concentrate on your own finances to get ahead of the median instead of hoping the economy will ever become ""fair"" where the lowest paid people (and those on benefits) have what they need.",KnownRate3096,t2_vrst1e27,9,0,reddit4

That's just inflation. If we can't produce enough, then the cost of everything rises to the point that all that money everyone has is no longer worth what it was. 

On a nationwide or worldwide scale, money is just the tokenization of all goods and services and assets. If suddenly everyone became a billionaire, a Big Mac would just go up to costing $1M because it still takes the same amount of work and resources to produce it.

Our main problem is that while we are getting better and better at creating stuff with less work and resources, the savings aren't spread equally - they go to the top and stay there. And now we have started hitting the point where doing things cheaper is causing global crises like climate change and resource depletion.

A lot of scenarios make sense in your head, but what matters is what happens in reality. I lived in a country where the conditions you described happened. Result of it was extreme stagnation. Everyone parks their money things like property and land (since they’re safe and value keeps up with inflation), many don’t even bother renting them, with little investments being made anywhere else. For wholesalers, prices would move between the payment time and delivery time so much that they had to make add a huge spread to not lose money. People generally start hoarding consumables since it’s cheaper today than tomorrow. Nobody puts money in savings accounts so banks can’t give out loans. There’s virtually zero liquidity in any market since everything is just shooting up in nominal value and nobody is selling. People often try to trade with the barter system, like buy land by exchanging it with another land, but it’s such a hard thing to do since rarely you have a situation where both parties actually like what the other party has to offer (I.e. nobody wants to trade an office building for acres of farmland, even if the value is the same)

At present, we live in an individuated world, in which we consider ourselves and each other as competing providers of labor and knowledge, whereby both of those things are services we can charge for. Accordingly, we also see ourselves as individual competing consumers of resources for our individual sustenance.

Consequently, in order to secure our individual sustenance, we're motivated to demonstrate our individual worth as labor-knowledge providers.

But our worth as labor-knowledge providers is judged according to the established paradigm: what labor and what knowledge is already determined as valuable. The established paradigm in economics is, as above, one that models us all as competing labor-knowledge providers.

So, we have a situation in which bright young people need to assert themselves as valuable labor-knowledge providers according to established paradigms. In economics, these bright young people do this by parroting the foregone conclusions of the discipline as a form of groupthink. They thus appear as though they understand the way the world works, at least within the present paradigm.

In other words, in order to secure their means of subsistence in a paradigm in which they are competing labor-knowledge providers, economists must claim that we're all competing labor-knowledge providers, because that's what the field has already concluded that we are.

In doing so, the individualizing paradigm is continually reproduced, and continually sold, falsely, as a clear-eyed appraisal of the natural way that things work.

And as long as the paradigm is stable, it's assumed to be correct. But, of course, shocks both exogenous and endogenous occur, and tense contradictions in the paradigm are noted in its everyday workings, and then the paradigm has to snap, shift, or set straight.

But the paradigm will resist changing, because it's already established as the collective belief that people must voluntarily reproduce to assert their value in order to secure their means of subsistence.

We may reach a point where the contradiction between (a) how people use the paradigm to secure their sustenance and (b) the paradigm's incongruence with reality will become so great that there emerges a 'critical juncture' whereby assumptions and conclusions break down.

If that happens, that will be when the 'fantasy book' will get rewritten, the clowns will be seen for the circus performers they are, and the religion will be challenged.

Inflation, by definition, is the general increase in prices. If price increases are set as direct reactions to increases in production cost, then net profit would remain constant in absolute terms. The only way that profit increases is if price is set higher than relative cost increases. Of course, given a constant in goods sold.  

An increase in sales quantity is not a market signal for firms to increase prices. If the general money supply increases, and that leads to a proportional increase in buying, and the firms supplying are able to meet market demand with proportional or lower increases in production cost (due to economies of scale), there is no pressure there to drive prices up.

jpgj1vp,t1_jpg5ajp,2023-06-25 12:21:27,Economics,"I'll answer your last question first as a tldr type of thing. 

>So where is the inflation coming from?

Inflation comes from the aggregate ability to pay more for goods. Eveyone selling something wants to at least be able to live the same lifestyle this year as last year. When the money supply increases, the value of each dollar decreases. So you have to raise prices to that level so the *value* of your profit stays the same. 


>If price increases are set as direct reactions to increases in production cost, then net profit would remain constant in absolute terms.

Margin *rate* will stay constant in a perfect vaccum. Profits will increase with a generally inflated economy. Think about it like this: lemonade mix costs me 50¢ a cup and I sell lemonade for $1. I'm making a 50% profit margin. Now there is some inflation in the economy and the lemonade mix increases to 75¢. If I increase my prices to $1.25, I will make the same profit of 50¢ per cup. But since everything is now 50% more expensive (my rent, gas, going out to eat, etc) I need to sell 50% more lemonade to earn the same purchasing power as before. So increasing my lemonade price by exactly my cost increase would be foolish. I would increase by the same *percent* as my COGS increase. So I actually raise lemonade to $1.50. That means my profit *rate* is still 50% like before, but my actual profit is now 75¢ instead of 50¢. I now have a record profit! Except since prices for everything I'll spend that on are up, I'm realistically making the same amount of money I always was. Record profits are to be expected during inflation because each dollar is worth less than it was last year. 

>If the general money supply increases, and that leads to a proportional increase in buying, and the firms supplying are able to meet market demand with proportional or lower increases in production cost.... 

Well first, which is what we saw post covid lockdowns, firms can't increase supply as quickly as demand can increase when money is injected into the economy. That leaves an imbalance which cases price increases. Look at microprocessors - there are some really large projects underway to increase the manufacturing capacity but those plants take years to build. People want new phones and cars and gaming systems today. So chip prices increase to meet the demand. If that demand increase is temporary, prices will come back down. If not, they'll stay high as long as people are willing to pay. But at the scale of the entire economy (where we'd measure inflation) demand will only stay that high if the money is there to make it feasible. Eg money supply increase. 

In general, prices trend down as firms take advantage of economies of scale and technology makes manufacturing cheaper. But it's prices in the sense of purchasing power, not raw dollars. 

If increased money supply didn't cause inflation, then prices for goods would still be where they were when we left the gold standard. The price of a car in 1971 was under $5k. A car company would go out of business in a week of they were selling cars for that today even though they're selling way more units every year. That's because there's a ton more cash floating around.",Kolada,t2_51545,4,0,reddit4

For investments not in a 401k, if you reinvest or not doesn’t matter because it’s still a taxable event to receive dividends either way. In fact, reinvesting is a perfect example of why dividends are worse than buybacks from a tax perspective. If you receive a dividend from a company, and then reinvest the money back into the company, all you did was take money from one hand and give to the your right hand and then back… but the government took a % of it so you end up with less.

75% of Americans are incorrect in their assessment. Most ""talk show"" economists are incorrect. People in general just do not have a good grasp of logic when they allow emotional fear to steer their conclusions. 

There will be structural unemployment, as AGI is tried and reliably used, in say, a call center, those workers will be replaced by it, but this will just mean there will end up being more call centers and there will be an equilibrium point between the hardware and maintenance required to use AGI and human labor.

Secondly, AI does not have bodies, physicality will have a higher cost (and lower equilibrium as a result). Ironically a fast food worker will likely not see as much structural employment due to needing to physically be there. 

The average person has no notion to the cost associated with AI, Open AIs GPT costs billions... granted AI investment world wide is multiple trillions, but these investments want a return. The cost will decrease exponentially, but the transitional period will not be stark and immediate, it will be slow and methodical... employees will be retrained, people will still work though our work will be different. 

Then we will use AI personally, likely through BCI. Which will slowly become a standard across industries, then will become societally expected (those who refuse will end up like modern day Amish).

The reason this is all more probable than not is opportunity costs. It is more costly to immediately adopt AGI. It is less costly (in terms of time) to use human labor. The most successful businesses will be ones that most effectively integrate AGI with their employees.

AGI isn't a requirement and we should stop inserting it into the discourse as it only invites naysayers to the conversation , because there's no evidence we're on track to develop AGI. The singularity is not the concern, it's the transitory period that gets us there which will take many years, if not decades.

Instead, we should focus on the socio-economics and how AI shifts things on a fundamental level. Previously, automation eliminated low skill jobs. Generally, these were manual labor. Unfortunately, this meant a lot of low wage earners were put out of work, but the good news is that these are also the sort of people who can relatively easily retrain for another role. Most of the time, this training is provided on the job. AI generally replaces highly skilled work where employees are expected to come ready to work already having the skills and experience required to do the job. Software development, actors, musicians, photo editors, video editors, music producers, accountants, xray and mri technicians, financial planners, and so on are but a few examples. There are a large number of white collar jobs at risk. This will impact people who have spent their lives training and building up expertise for the work they are doing, often including significant financial burden as well (e.g. college). These individuals will not be able to be simply retrained and slotted into a new role earning a similar income.

The net net of all this is that we could see AI accelerate the collapse of the middle class with many individuals suddenly finding themselves having to choose between low skill work or going back to school and resetting their careers.

Initially AI will probably cause a huge consolidation of capital in the hands of a small number of individuals, but if they want to stay alive they're going to need to keep the populace from rioting and dragging them into the streets. That means ceding enough resources to keep people comfortable enough to avoid that. 

There is also only value to be had in a capitalist economy if there is somebody to consume what is produced. If nobody has the means to consume, then there will be no distinction between rich and poor beyond military force.

It seems much more likely to me that manual labor, artistic expression, and personalized conveniences like those that are currently found on Etsy or other marketplaces will become a bigger part of the day-to-day economy.

Progress towards providing for the basic needs of all citizens may be slow, but it will continue. Governments may drag their feet but if they fall too far behind they risk losing legitimacy and being toppled.

Authoritarian states may be able to hold off for longer, and the “culture wars” of the last 30-40 years definitely bought some time. But is basically an inevitability. 

One thing to bear in mind is that often times intellectuals severely underestimate just how much of the economy is driven by what they’d likely think of as “unskilled labor”. They look at their peer group that they’re familiar with and see people with advanced degrees who value education highly and are capable of fully harnessing the productivity gains that AI will unlock and they assume the whole economy must look like that.

The reality is that (especially in enormous 100+m population countries) huge portions of the population are not positioned to take advantage of those productivity gains, and it will be likely a century-long effort before the new technology today is the norm for 99.9% of the population. 

Electricity was harnessed in the 19th century but only post WW2 did it quickly become the norm for every home to have electricity. 

Cell phones and the concept of the internet were invented decades and decades ago. But still roughly only about 80% of the population in the US has a high speed internet connection in their home, and roughly 90% have a smartphone. Sure that’s a strong majority, but 10-20% of the population not being on board with the new technology is a huge hurdle. 

We’ve just finally gotten to a point in at least developed countries where you can safely assume pretty much everyone has access to some kind of computing device (laptop, desktop, tablet, smartphone, etc), but we can’t assume that everyone has a smartphone or high speed internet at home yet. 

In the same way, it will be decades at least if not a century-plus before we can expect AI to be normalized for 99%+ of the population. And until we reach that point, every 1% of the population not on board represents literally millions of people that have wants/needs/etc, and are a source of labor that can still provide value.

So while some sectors of the economy will embrace the new technology quite quickly, there will remain huge swaths of the population for a long while that will want no part in the new technology either as a worker or as a consumer. The key is that it’s both. The consumer will demand products not produced using AI, and the worker will refuse to use AI in their work.

There isn't going to be an *increase* in demand for plumbers though. So even while AI can't in itself eliminate *all* jobs, it will certainly, at some point assuming any nonzero progress indefinitely, be able to eliminate all jobs which can be done at a computer. That is a very high percentage of jobs. And there is no reason whatsoever to believe it will increase demand for jobs that can't be done on a computer at all, let alone in proportion.

We don't know what the timeline is, of course. It might be a century or more. Or it might be ten years. But the eventual end state is quite clear.

The brain is a system of computation. We know that computation is platform independent. Computers are already vastly better than human brains at many tasks. They will continue to be better at more tasks as long as we improve the architectures and add computational resources at it. If we do that for long enough they will be better than us at all cognitive tasks.

It requires magical thinking that no neuroscientist I've ever met has agreed with to even imagine otherwise, such as imagining that there is something fundamentally magical about the human brain such that what it does cannot possibly be replicated on other hardware.

Assuming the brain is not magic, and there is nonzero progress in this space indefinitely, it will eventually be outclassed at all tasks. It's only a matter of when. Historically betting on the answer to a scientific question being magic has always been a bad bet.

The luddites were wrong because they were wrong about what a human's most valuable skillset is. It wasn't rote labor, it was cognitive labor. It's hard to imagine what could possibly emerge to allow that pattern to generalize a second time to the devaluing of all cognitive labor.

While we do know that human intelligence includes several measurable spectrums, and we do have a minimum threshold for counting as ""intelligent"" aka the turing test, we do not have any way of classifying things below the turing threshold.

Because this time were automating cognition.

When talking about history, we mostly think of mechanical automation. Machines with much more strength doing the work of humans or animals. 

The same will go for cognitive work. Infact, computers are already way better at some tasks than humans are. It's all still limited to single tasks for the moment. But once we start integrating those...

It's just not that well known among the general populous. People won wake up until they see the applications arise. 

Chat gpt is a great example. LLM's have been around for years. And now they opened a strong one to the public people are astonished. But chatgpt pales in comparison to what googles deep mind can do. 

Google deep mind has beaten humans at go. It has beaten humans at StarCraft. It has just released a catalogue of proteins folding (a problem our best scientists couldn't solve) it has discovered new mathematics. It has discovered unknown forms of cancer. And it's now working on drug discovery. 

It can learn tasks by looking at YouTube video, it can teach robots how to move, and program them, oh and it aced an entry exam to a tokyo university beating 90% of human applicants keep in mind that only the top 20% of society even attempts those entry exams. 

Here's some more info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind

And not to say google is the only player. Because Microsoft is also doing great ai stuff on for example their GitHub repository, Microsoft copilot and many other Microsoft products.

It's going to start in the simple office space, where we ask ai to write and review documents. Like copilot, where humans are in the driver's seat. But it's going to move past that quite quickly.",MrZwink,t2_a2fcnns4,-1,0,reddit2

To put it bluntly, this is some grafuckery if I have ever seen it. For fuck sake it shows single women with children at $7K! 

What it amounts to, not having children, more often than not, means that both sexes make more money and/or have more disposable income. As there are more men without children than women without children, the MEDIANS are far different. The women without children are likely fewer and have different careers. And good lord, MEDIAN vs AVERAGE is a huge difference.

>The jury ordered NAR and others to pay nearly $1.8 billion in damages to a class of more than 250,000 home sellers. Under antitrust law, that figure can be tripled to over $5 billion, at the court’s discretion. 

>Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, was impressed that the jury understood the complex antitrust arguments about market power well enough to rule for the class. 

>“It was unclear whether a jury would understand the economics of price-fixing well enough to see NAR’s rule of having the seller pay the buyer’s agent as a scheme to prevent competition, but they did,” she posted on X this afternoon. “Bravo to the [prosecutors] for their economics communication skills.”

>The case, *Burnett et al. v. NAR et al.* is the first of two antitrust lawsuits centered on NAR’s commissions policy to go to trial, and it could upend the structure of the entire real-estate industry, which the class of plaintiffs claims amounts to a giant price-fixing conspiracy. 

>The “cornerstone” of this conspiracy, according to the complaint, is the requirement for home sellers to pay commissions to the agent representing the buyer before listing homes on the property database used nationwide, the Multiple Listings Service—which local NAR associations control.

REX Real Estate chief executive Jack Ryan told the New York Times that the verdict is “extremely good news for Americans.” If commissions can be lowered, “the price of every home will come down, jobs and wages will go up, tax revenues will increase, people can easily move to better and more fulfilling jobs,” he wrote.

NAR released a statement to say that the association will appeal the verdict. But an appeal may require an appellate bond amounting to over $5 billion, that NAR and its co-defendants may not have.

As an Australian this arrangement strikes me as very strange. Here:

- typical selling agent commission is 2% in the main markets but you can negotiate less, particularly if the house is very expensive or likely to be easy to sell

- buyers rarely use an agent and if they do the fees charged are either flat (up to about $20,000) or around 1% commission

- if a buyer uses an agent they pay the buyer agent fees/commission themselves, the idea that the seller should be paying for the buyer's agent is bizarre and obviously creates risks of conflicts of interest",planck1313,t2_chuvllz0,18,0,reddit4

>Do you know how Zillow makes money? They take a cut of the agents commission that works with Zillow lead generation. Zillow spends millions on their platform to make money from the realtor fees. If their are no realtor fees, then there is no Zillow and then there is no central database for you to find homes. Their whole model is based on buyers agents getting paid from the seller and taking a cut of that money. You (real estate buyers) are the product they are selling to agents.

This is just one way Zillow makes money. They make money seve other ways, such as advertising and marketing, and middle man fees for other real estate professionals (mortgage brokers, insurance agents, etc), and fees from rental brokers. Although their first forray ended disastrously, they are actively trying to get into the home buying/brokering market themselves and will at some point in the future (Zillow Offers). They are making an active bet against Realtors, while letting the realtors fund their growth at the current level.

It's absolutely random, and no amount of truth, facts, or law will effectively guide them. Like a monkey knife fight.

I would venture to guess that the defense wanted a jury because, for complex issues, it would be easier to confuse a jury than it would be to confuse a judge (which itself isn't that difficult to do sometimes because a lot of judges are fucking regarded; but juries are more regarded than judges on average).

So the defense rolled the dice with a jury.

Plus, for appeals (at least in my state), an appeals court is more likely to overturn a judge's findings than a jury's findings. So if the realtors could prevail with a jury, then it would be a lot more difficult for the other side to prevail in an appeal.

Judge rules that time with the kids will be split 50/50 between the parents. Literally the same result if the parents did not have a lawyer. Am I a ""winner""?

I'm a criminal defense attorney. Client gets a DWI, his first one ever. I know that the law provides first time DWI defendants with a specific standard deal. Judges don't have discretion to change the standard deal. Prosecutors don't have authority to offer anything other than the standard deal. The Client gets the standard deal with or without a lawyer. Client hires me anyway. We go to court. Client gets the standard deal. Am I a ""winner""?

Probate case. Client's dad recently died. Dad was never married. Dad did not have a Will. Client is an only child. Everything owned by Dad now, by law, goes to the Client. I file the paperwork. No one contests the proceedings. Client gets everything that belonged to Dad. Am I a ""winner""?

""Winning a case"" makes for good TV, but rarely does a case come down to a singular issue that goes to trial which results in a clear winner and a clear loser.

Most cases consist of administrative actions that just require a judge to rubber stamp because there is no controversy between two opposing sides.

And when there are cases with two opposing sides, +90% settle out of court before trial.

So ""win-loss ratios"" aren't exactly a proper metric when describing a lawyer's efficacy. You won't find any attorney advertising their ""win-loss ratio,"" mostly because defining the concept of ""winning"" or ""losing"" a case isn't exactly an objective or black & white standard.

MLS isn’t the monolith that is appears. It’s thousands of separate entities that is loosely controlled by NAR. There are many legal details and agent policing that each MLS does in the background to ensure standards are kept from legal and safety aspects. It’s very localized and based on decades of legal processes and all the problems that arise in real estate transactions over time. 

The amount of detail Zillow would have to cover and the local and state laws governing the transactions would require Zillow to create an infrastructure of immense proportions. They are right now fleecing the lamb by riding all of this infrastructure for minimal cost. If they kill their lamb for the chops they will have to recreate this infrastructure themselves or face unending legal challenges to maintain the semblance of order that the MLS boards now create. 

Their plan is to create a monolith so that they will be the new monopoly in the business. This will not end well for the consumer. Many real estate transactions are fraught with legal issues, and there are many scammers, liars and cheaters without the realtors getting involved. If Zillow becomes the go to they will have major dual agency issues, fiduciary liabilities and will lack the local expertise to exist in many markets. 

The value of a good realtor isn’t in finding you a home, that’s the easy part. The value is knowing the history of the local market and guiding the buyer to making the right choice while avoiding all of the myriad of pitfalls, scams, problems and legalities that go wrong when given bad advice and counsel. Attorneys aren’t going to manage the buyers or sellers personalities, handle showings, do offer negotiations, inspections and appraisals. In some cases the buyers or sellers who are more sophisticated can and will (and already do) do these things. And all the whole have the assistance of the attorney. 

But that’s already available to them and many still choose to use realtors to manage the sale or purchase of their transactions. Especially on the higher end. 

Zestimates are very inaccurate. They don’t take into account intangibles. That’s why appraisers still have jobs as well. Could it improve, sure. But it will never provide the detailed knowledge of a experienced person. 

And then if they do win out on all of these things we just have a new centralized corporate monopoly on our entire real estate system in the US. How is that better then the current model where everyone still has the choices they have right now?  

Even the biggest developers and builders use real estate brokers to sell their properties. No one has more market knowledge and expertise then them in the space. So there is obviously a great deal of value in the front line sales management of a real estate transaction. 

My opinion is that Zillow is going to cook their golden goose and create chaos in the market place that will only serve to give consumers less choice and worse outcomes. They aren’t cutting out the middleman, they are trying to become the middle man and then will squeeze the average consumer like any large corporation does while providing worse service and less human touch. 

I’m a Zillow premier agent and I’m a realtor so my take could have some level of bias. But I’m also speaking from inside the machine. So I have additional insight as well. Many realtors are terrible people and terrible at their jobs, same as any industry.

Buyers get a realtor because, why not, it's free? There is no direct cost to them, and (because fees are set by the sellers agent before the buyer is even involved) foregoing a realtor does not save the seller any money that could then be passed on to the buyer. There literally is no incentive most times to not get one. 

Now, if buyer's agent's commissions does not need to be disclosed, there is no incentive for a seller to offer a buyer's agent any commission at all. Buyers' agents will have to start charging buyers directly lest they risk getting stiffed for their work entirely. Once they have to charge the buyers directly there is now gonna be massive pressure by clients to lower their fees. 

Sellers pay the 6% fee because they essentially HAVE too because of the monopoly the NAR has via the MLS. Buyers now have Zillow, redfin, Trulia, realtor.com, etc. They are gonna really quickly say ""fuck that"" when they realize all they really need an agent for is to physically open the door to the house and to help guide through the paperwork process.

Literally, nothing about this ruling makes it anymore easier for Zillow and all of the other sites to not use the MLS. They could have stopped using the MLS a long time ago.

If it doesn't affect supply, it can.

k7t3v5w,t1_k7t0r8l,2023-11-04 16:49:15,Economics,"That's not how real estate transactions work practically. Even if you list FSBO on MLS through one of the direct agencies you are still being effectively cock blocked by every realtor who won't even mention that property, show that property, or do anything else unless they get their full 2.5-3% rip. Moreover, potential buyers are blocked from even looking at that property on their own if they have retained a realtor for \*other\* properties. So a buyer's agent can refuse to show them a property that won't pay them their vig, but then prevent them from effectively trying to pursue that property as well. Now, you can argue that the buyers signed a retention agreement, but that's the problem, they are largely being forced to retain a realtor in order to go down this road. Even if they don't retain a realtor and the seller has the realtor, it isn't as though the seller agent is suddenly going to walk back the commission either.

Every realtor representation agreement I have seen says that during that time window any property you pursue you owe them a commission on. Doesn't matter if they never mention it, refuse to show it, etc. So imagine this.

A new couple is moving to Nashville, they don't know anyone in the area, so they hire a realtor. They sign a rep agreement, the realtor shows them the area, maybe some houses, but then the couple becomes aware of a home that is either FSBO or not even listed at all, they can't buy that house without paying their realtor. That precise situation has happened to several people I know, or at least the realtors have tried to pursue that.

This isn't a criminal offense, but the realtor could sue you claiming they are owed a commission and they might win depending on the verbiage of the agreement.

No, the land I purchased was not FSBO, it was a listed property. I simply refused to deal with their agent and would only speak directly with the owner. The seller agent tried to blow up the deal repeatedly saying I was required to go through her. I walked from the deal and then the agent was fired and the deal was closed. The agent did nothing. She offered zero value. She was an idiot. She didn't understand the land, the comps, the survey, the zoning, the soils, etc. She was a school teacher who worked part time as a real estate agent and suddenly because she can use MLS she thinks that is worth $100k? If anything, she harmed her client.

Her position was it was that it was already discounted at 5.5% and she was willing to reduce to 5%. There was no buyer's agent, I did everything myself with my attorney.

Cut it in half. How in the world is that worth $50k? Where was the value? Was she bringing prospects to the table? Or did she list it on MLS and just wait for the phone to ring? Answer, the latter. 

Look, if you bring value in a competitive marketplace then that's great. However that isn't what real estate is now. Look at it on an hourly rate. Let's run with the above at 50k for each side. How many hours is that? Selling agent is going to have some photo, listing, and advertising fees. I will be generous and call that 5k. That's 45k for labor. If this woman had 50 hours into the property I would be stunned. So, $900/hr? For zero ability? Zero talent? Zero knowledge? She literally had no idea what an ALTA was. She had no idea on a geo/soils study. She didn't even know the utility runs. 

The woman was an elementary school teacher who wanted to be paid like a neurosurgeon. That's fucked. Moreover, in a world where people are struggling to afford homes (not claiming that is my situation) you can't have realtors gigging people for 5-6% of total value. Imagine someone has 30% equity in their home, they are supposed to lose 20% of their equity in a transactions? Fuck that.

There needs to be a law where rather than a commission it is an hourly rate/cap with mandatory alternative structures etc. Make it a la carte or something, but the system is totally screwed.

This deal wasn't complex at all, and the realtor was still getting shit wrong at every turn. She was literally stirring the pot with the neighbors, thinking she was generating future business, but in reality submarining deals left and right because of the agitation and animosity it was creating. 

Or we can talk about a property a few months ago where I offered full asking price, north of $4MM and the realtor couldn't explain to their client that it wasn't fair and reasonable for a seller to expect a client to purchase a property ""as is, where is, no inspections, no conditions, no disclosures"".  

How does this happen? As a whole, a large portion of realtors aren't simply very good at what they do. Again, think about the money you are asking for compared to the time. If you expect to get paid $500/hr+ you better be incredibly good at a job which is of significant scope and scale. Not someone who can Vanna White their way through a house pointing at crown molding.

The idea that a realtor knows more about real estate values than me is comical. You realize all the comp data is incredibly easily available, right? You realize the questions for valuation and variability are pretty damned standard, right? Property valuations aren't all that hard, especially for raw land. If you wanted to talk about cap rates, market conditions, carry cost, zoning or easement restrictions you could do all that. However when you are looking at a piece of land which your intent is not to develop but rather build a homesite, there isn't really a lot to worry about. Particularly when you know by a title search that the property has been family owned and operated as a farm for nearly a century, it's pretty simple.

The reason no one is ""on the Realtor's side"" is because most people have no idea how real estate works and instead rely on stereotypes.

You have consistently ignored all of my arguments and instead reverted to anecdotal evidence and generalities.

Anyway, people like you are the worst. You're such an arrogant person you actually believe you are right about all this. You actually think someone who lives and breathes real estate every single day to make their living knows less than you because...all realtors are bad/dumb? Or because you're super smart? I don't know.

All I know is clearly YOU are the moral arbiter of who in the world deserves to get how much money. If anyone is compensated an amount of money that YOU think is too much, it MUST be because you are getting fucked. It could not POSSIBLY be that you have knowledge gaps about the process, that as a consumer you only see certain sides of how things work. So why bother listening to others with a new perspective or risk changing your own opinions? Clearly that could only be a step backwards.

Nevermind that you have millions of dollars to throw around on land. YOU earned that money! Every dollar you have earned in your life was FAIR compensation because YOU work hard.

It's unfortunate you've never encountered a good realtor worth their salt but perhaps you did but just overlooked and discounted them. They would have saved you even more money on your transactions. But ... it seems like no amount of money in the world is worth your feeling of superiority.

Quote me where I said all realtors are dumb or bad. I'll wait. 

What I said is that they almost never represent value. Meaning, they advice/work they provide rarely justifies their 2.5-3% of the deal.

Seriously, what do you think a realtor is doing that is worth that value? Do you think the realtor is a savvy negotiator? Do you think they are spotting issues/damage that a home inspector wouldn't? Are they doing any legal work? Title work? No. Again, they are playing Vanna White pointing at the floors, the crown, and the new roof. Neat. All that stuff is incredibly obvious to all but the most oblivious buyers. 

What is the selling agent doing exactly? Ohhhh, they arranged to get some pictures for a few hundred bucks and post them on MLS and then handle some scheduling. That's worth 3%? 

Now, if you are going to tell me that their ability to negotiate or determine pricing is viable, then again, that might work in the realm of $200-300k houses, but that doesn't happen with affluent areas. No one is out there dropping $1MM+ on real estate who doesn't understand how comps work, how to look up sales data, how to do even the most basic homework.

So, you are just pissed that I have money and a strong opinion? Can you tell how much I care? You're a failed realtor in the easiest real estate market in generations. I made my money through doing precisely what I preach, offering value to the consumer. I didn't have to collude within my industry to price fix and manipulate the market, the very basis of this court ruling. That's a pretty big differentiation there slick. I made my money by offering goods/services/capital in a free, transparent, clear, value oriented and non-collusion based manner. The people who I did business with did so because of precisely what I am preaching here, they saw value in my services and prices. 

The idea that you think a realtor \*would\* have saved me money is comical. Do you have any basis whatsoever for that? None. I have dealt with a number of realtors, at no point did any of them drop an iota of wisdom, information, or knowledge on me that influenced any deal that I made. Every real estate transaction, many of them mind you, have been done without agents involved on my side and I don't think you would find anyone pointing to me having ever overpaid.

As to the last point, this is precisely why I don't think realtors are real professionals of value. You don't see the issue with a seller demanding that, in addition to full ask price, no inspects, as-is/where-is, no disclosures, and no conditions"" is unreasonable? Great. So that proves my point. You are defending a realtor who was so unable to manage their clients expectations from the onset, something you are still defending mind you, that it was wholly unreasonable.

I would add that because of that, the realtor not only lost the commission, but the property has sat unsold for a year now because their client is retarded. Moreover, the realtor is even more retarded because they continue to manage that listing and deal with an impossible situation they will never get paid on.

Conclusion is really this, the industry is crooked, that's why it went to court and that's why public sentiment is so strongly against the industry you couldn't manage.

We have a list of applicants a mile long and work very hard to do the right things: good onboarding and training process, GREAT benefits for our industry, safe and respectful workplace, guard against burnout, etc.  The amount of potentially very good candidates that we screen, select, hire and onboard only to have them not show up after the first 1-5 days is unbelievable.

These numbers come from a massive survey that asks a bunch of questions. Employment numbers come from asking people if they have a job.

>If Amazon cuts the average hours worked for their warehouse employees down to 18 hours a week, from 36 hours a week, but doubles the number of employees (basically to avoid paying full time benefits), then Amazon warehouses added a lot of employees to the headline payroll numbers.

Total employment would go up, but underemployment would also see a massive increase. Instead we see underemployment at historically low levels.

We'd also see an increase in the part-time employment level. However, that's largely been flat over the past 15 years, despite the constantly increasing overall population.

However, the MEDIA tends to alternate between reporting headline CPI numbers that exclude food and energy, or include food and energy, based off their particular angle (want to promote the idea that inflation is under control OR that it is not) AND how the volatile categories are performing (include or exclude to further angle).

I remember when energy costs plummeted shortly after Europe’s energy situation stabilized after the Ukraine invasion.  At that point, since energy costs were pushing down CPI, the headline numbers widely published in the media included energy costs.

When energy costs were alternatively soaring (earlier in the war), the WSJ and others were using the CPI numbers that were excluding energy costs.

Here is what I just learned: previously if you were over 49 years old, and fully able bodied, you didn't have to work for SNAP benefits.  Now if you are over 54 years old, are fully able bodied, and do not have children -> then you don't have to work for SNAP benefits.

Also in the new law anybody raised in foster care doesn't have to work for SNAP benefits regardless of age.  

I'm so confused.  If somebody is fully able bodied, and doesn't have children to take care of, why wouldn't they have to work 30 hours per week until age 62 to get SNAP benefits?

jyoc7ty,t1_jyo77pz,2023-09-01 15:02:21,Economics,"Amazing. Everything you just said was wrong.

1) I am not virtue signaling. Virtue signaling implies that someone doesn't actually care much about the underlying issue, and is only acting out to stroke their own ego. What I am doing is criticizing the right-leaning groupthink that is so prevalent on this sub, because people who still believe in \[politically\] conservative economics need to have their bubbles pierced when it comes to how their policies have actually been performing in the real world. Nothing I do on this sub is performative - my goal is to let the capitalists know that there is a growing chorus of voices calling them out for getting so many things wrong.

2) As I said in another comment, my point was not about the current unemployment rate, my comment was about the implication that a rising unemployment rate is a good thing. It's not, because the labor-vs-capital pendulum is in desperate need of rebalancing, which in this case means swinging back to labor's side. Which means labor needs leverage, which is why it's a good thing for the unemployment rate to stay low.

3) ""\[Capitalism\] is the only economic system that actually works"" - oh great, tell that to the countless millions of people who will be displaced and killed over the next hundred years due to the effects that profit-driven pollution are having on the planet's climate.",KryssCom,t2_kgeks,-6,0,reddit1

Second, I wasn't commenting on the current unemployment rate, I was commenting on the implication that ""it's good to see people losing their jobs!"" My position is that the unemployment rate needs to stay extremely low right now, because the labor-vs-capital pendulum has been in favor of capital for literal decades at this point, and workers are being crushed because of it. Labor needs leverage in order to bring balance to the system (for a change), which is why it's such a great thing that union participation is on the rise.

Third, I'm in this sub because it's r/Economics, not r/Capitalism. I'm not even actually a Marxist (although I do recognize that he was right about an awful lot of things in retrospect).

I'm not OP, but how would switching to some other economic system change that?  I'm honestly asking.  The USA currently uses CO2 emitting things like gasoline to drive to work and drive the store.  Switching to socialism or communism or a dictatorship might be totally great, but it seems unrelated to using fossil fuels, people will still need to drive to work and drive to the store.

Climate change is a tough issue, but I think we are slowly navigating it.  We have to balance so many different variables: the delicate balance between quality of life and transitioning off CO2 emitting things at a rate that is fast enough, but not too disruptive.  Look at how we have actual useful electric cars now, from many manufacturers, and their adoption is really quite significant.  It isn't a ""niche"" anymore.  I can imagine a future where 80% of new cars purchased are electric in the next 15 years.

Solar panels have matured to a pretty remarkable place, where it is some of the cheapest wholesale energy available.  That's a game changer.  Solar energy is CURRENTLY producing 4.5% of the world's electricity and is 46% of new USA energy deployments because it's so inexpensive it makes more sense than fossil fuels.  And that is only going to rocket forward better and better as fossil fuel costs rise and solar costs drop.

Yes, many people are going to be displaced and have hardship because of climate change, but I just don't see how removing capitalism (that brought us solar panels and electric cars) will help them.

The prime age labor force participation rate is ""What percentage of people between the ages of 25 and 55 are working or looking for work?""

It's an important distinction, because during times where there are a lot of young people or a lot of old people, the first number can't be compared to other time periods when there aren't a lot of young people or old people.

Right now, we have a lot of old people. A higher ratio than U.S. society has ever seen. That's because people live longer now, have fewer kids, and because there was a huge increase in birth rate between 1946 and 1964 (all the WWII vets coming home and starting families). That baby boom led to a generation of people known as the baby boomers, and they've always been this outsized population bulge for their age group. Now they're retired, so there are a lot more retired people now than ever before, with not necessarily all that many more working people than ever before.

Therefore, the general ""labor force participation rate"" isn't easily compared to other time periods in which we didn't have a retired boomer generation.

Are high interest rates killing supply faster than demand?

Inflation is too few x being chased by too much money. The interest rates are taking the money out of the economy. The inflation is and interest rates are cooling the economy so the demand and supply are in balance.

>Housing is too inelastic. No matter how much you make people hurt, they still need a place to live. All the other more elastic consumption will fall away before you cool demand for housing during a housing shortage.

But housing demand is elastic. If housing prices are high more people will live in a place to keep the per Capita cost low. If housing is cheap more single people might take a 2 bedroom but if it's expensive I've seen 3 individuals take a 2 bedroom and 1 in the living room. Housing prices are high so more people stay with their parents and the household formation rate is low.

>Higher rates makes shelter costs go up. Mortgage interest goes up and rents go up. It also makes building less profitable. It directly increases inflation and reduces supply.

Building is still going up and the supply that will be there next year is mostly already built. 3% of housing being built in a year is a boom. The boom is caused by reduced regulations and higher prices.",goodsam2,t2_iqbr6,1,0,reddit1

Supply responds to demand more than it responds to interest rates. Until very recently demand has looked very strong, all while inflation has been falling. That doesn't happen if it's demand driving the price increases.

>Inflation is too few x being chased by too much money. The interest rates are taking the money out of the economy. The inflation is and interest rates are cooling the economy so the demand and supply are in balance.

You're reciting the sermon, but the data do not agree. There are other causes of inflation.

[Real consumption has not dropped](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=187qo) and the [unemployment rate has been steadily low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE). Total lending also accelerated to the [highest level since the financial crisis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASTLL) all while inflation has been coming down. There's no evidence that the decline in inflation has been due weakening demand, because there's been no evidence for weakening demand until very recently.

The [growth in bank credit plummet recently](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=187qv), which should come through on that total loans chart for Q2 and Q3 and the labor market is slowing with the latest job numbers and unemployment ticking up in the most recent month.

So all while inflation fell from 9% to 3% demand stayed very high, and only now are we starting to see net negative effects from higher interest rates on the economy. It seems pretty clear we now have a big risk of just causing a recession and needlessly putting tons of people out of work to solve a problem that isn't really a problem anymore.

>But housing demand is elastic. If housing prices are high more people will live in a place to keep the per Capita cost low. If housing is cheap more single people might take a 2 bedroom but if it's expensive I've seen 3 individuals take a 2 bedroom and 1 in the living room. Housing prices are high so more people stay with their parents and the household formation rate is low.

Wait, your solution to the housing shortage is to increase the cost of housing? Or am I reading into that too much? You're not solving the housing issue by pushing prospective buyers out of the market. That makes the shortage even worse.

>Building is still going up and the supply that will be there next year is mostly already built. 3% of housing being built in a year is a boom. The boom is caused by reduced regulations and higher prices.

>There's the temporary causes but we are still at 3% inflation. That last % was always going to be the hardest. I mean without interest rates we might have settled at 4-5%.

Or it might have settled lower. After all, it's [shelter costs driving inflation right now](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/10/homes/forecast-shelter-inflation/index.html), and higher rates push up shelter costs. Inflation without shelter [is only 1.0%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=18kPW) after only being 0.7% in June.

You can also look at Japan who didn't raise rates at all. Their inflation never went above 4.3% and is still trending down.

Believing things would be worse without higher rates is just accepting the gospel even when there's no evidence for it.

>It's to lower demand, housing is being built still.

>Demand shifts faster than supply here.

So yeah, equalize supply and demand by pricing out so many people that want a place to live. That's being too focused on the models and not remembering we're dealing with real life people here.

Or maybe [completions just lag starts](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=18kRL)? You do need to start a house to complete it. Do you think completions can continue to increase if starts decline?

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q

Spending can increase by the same amount as wages without affecting people's ability to save. Combine that with the fact that anyone who had a mortgage before the pandemic simultaneously was able to refinance at rock bottom rates and then get an inflation adjusted wage, many people have far more disposable income then before the pandemic.

To use myself as an anecdotal example, I bought a house in 2019. Originally, servicing the mortgage was 27% of my salary. After refinancing, 20% inflation, and an accompanying wage adjustment because I threatened to leave my employer if they didn't, my mortgage payment is now 18.5% of my income. That 8.5% of my total income is now potential disposable income because my wages tracked inflation, but my debt didn't. All the rest of my expenses more or less increased with inflation and take up the same percentage of my income as they did before.

There are millions of people like me. Anyone with fixed debt benefited from inflation and many of them are using the increased disposable income to continuing spending and consuming.

Edit: The government also just shoveled money into people's pockets during the pandemic while people spent less because they weren't going out. It's anecdotal, but I know several people who just kept taking unemployment as long as possible, because they made more than when they were working, and stashed it away. When they went back to work, they got higher wages, and kept the $10,000+ they saved from unemployment as their emergency fund.",Jest_out_for_a_Rip,t2_xaov4,5,0,reddit1

hbg4qc0,t1_hbfypqy,2021-09-03 14:03:04,Economics,"Of course restaurants and bars are down. I've been telling anyone this who would listen––even if government is out to lunch and not mandating any public health measures, tens of millions of smart people are going to voluntarily stop going to bars and restaurants for fear of covid. Demand side matters too. Beyond that, retail is way down too.

It's very spotty. I think talking about the top-line jobs number in the post-covid period conceals a lot.

In August we were down a total of 29k retail jobs. We were down 3k construction jobs. We were down 2k utilities jobs. And we lost 8k government jobs. So that's who's laying off. That was offset by 74k new professional/business jobs and 54k new transportation and warehousing jobs. So we're looking at a shift away from in-person retail and construction and government work and towards private sector cubicle desk jobs (likely remote) and warehouse jobs.

> hard working blue collar worker from the 70s was part of a union

25% of the US workforce was in a union in 1970. Union membership was in constant decline from its high point in the 40's and 50's.

>On top of that post-secondary education was cheap in the 70s because it was subsidized by the US government and it had low administrative costs compared to today. Throw in the changes to housing, healthcare, and investment regulations and we've only begun scratching the surface of why life has become so unaffordable, and none of which is related to switching to a fiat currency.

Post secondary education *has* become significantly more expensive. But life is *more* affordable now than it was in 1970. The homeownership rate is higher today than it was in 1970 (if only by a percentage point or two). 

>When you compare social mobility in the U.S. to other developed democratic nations, the U.S. ranks dead last.

Yes, and no. But mostly no, as most people understand social mobility. 

If a person living in Denmark is born in the bottom income quartile and earns $50,000 per year more than his parents, he will be in the top income quartile. 

If a person living in the US is born in the bottom income quartile and earns $80,000 more than his parents, he will *not* be in the top income quartile. 


So *if* you define social mobility as moving from one income quartile to another...yes, the US has less social mobility than most places in Europe. This is because fewer rich people means it takes less money to move between quartiles. 

But that's only measuring relative income mobility with moving between quartiles being the relevant metric.

And that's useful academically, but IRL, it's kind of ridiculous to argue that the Dane has more social mobility than the American because he earned $50k more than his parents, while the American only earned $80k more than is parents. 

The American certainly won't *feel* any less socially mobile. And in terms of income, he is well ahead of the Dane. 

So this is a pretty weak indicator, too.

The _most_ obvious solution is to relax zoning laws so that offices that are commercially viable can stay, and ones that aren't can be turned into something else, including residential buildings.

The issue is that we just don't know what is and isn't commercially viable, remote working has changed things too much - for commercial and residential buildings. The only way to solve this problem is to put the incentives in place to find what is viable, which means letting the market work.

The problem with bitcoin is that its value is tied to the dollar and the volatility. Bitcoin has hype because of the valuation place against the US dollar. Lets say I told you I would pay you one bitcoin in January when it was high for work completed today. You would receive significantly less than what it was. Its not even stable enough to transfer funds. Also banks have several ways to transfer funds. There is checks, wire transfers, etc. why is bitcoin necessary. You don’t have to transfer gold or hard cash. Besides America was transferring pallets of US Dollars to Afghanistan to prop up their economy.

Bitcoin only works in significantly developed areas with technology. You currently can’t use bitcoin in New Orleans or in undeveloped countries or in some rural areas of America. 

You can’t use bitcoin with the average person. The average person can’t even comprehend the idea of bitcoin. The idea of bitcoin was that my grandparents would buy groceries with bitcoin. Why would they use something that does the exact same thing (in their understanding) just differently. That is inconceivable to believe the the world will adopt bitcoin over their current currencies.

Bitcoin is terrible as a currency because the price literally fluctuates 5% up or down nearly every day.

2. [The B.1.617.2 delta variant is significantly more contagious, and now accounts for between 98 and 100% of all infections in the US.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) That's a fact. 

3. [Vaccine efficacy is not as high against the delta variant.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02261-8) That's a fact.

4. [This is why CDC is immediately recommending booster shots to immunocompromised people who were fully vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) As of yesterday, that's a fact.

5. [This is why HHS is recommending widespread booster shots as of next month.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html)  That's a fact.

6. [This is also why major corporations are delaying a return to in-person work.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-delta-variant-return-office-delays-policies/) That's a fact.

7. [And right now covid infection levels, hospitalizations, and deaths are approaching all-time highs in the US for the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) That's also a fact.

I never said vaccines don't work. I never implied it. Not once, ever. I myself and all my eligible family are fully vaccinated. And I will be first in line for a booster when I can get one. I also will not go out drinking and eating in public indoors and maskless, and I will continue to avoid large crowds. Nothing I am saying here is anti-vaccine propaganda.

Boosters and child vaccines will help tremendously. But we also have to get the community spread in check.

hbpcl1z,t1_hbizj78,2021-09-05 16:40:27,Economics,"The US dollar is backed by commodities. Not the us Military. 

There are several things that give the dollar its strength. One our debt is in US Dollars. If the government wanted to it could print its way out of debt. (It would be horribly dumb for the US to do this) the inflation of the US dollar makes the debt cheaper.

This is why countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe fail. Their debts we’re in the Russian Ruble and US Dollar respectively. When they got into economic crises they tried to print their way out of debt, but the more they printed the less value it had in comparison to their debt.

Almost all oil in the world is sold using the US Dollar. That means about every country has to convert their money to US dollars to buy oil. There are a lot of other commodities that are traded this way as well.

Almost every bank in the world has reserves of the US dollar. The only thing that it takes to make the dollar is a printer. Whereas bitcoin, it takes thousands of mining rigs to produce it. It also takes mining rigs to process transactions. Compared to the dollar where I can just hand it to someone. Crypto transactions don’t happen because the internet said so.

And I don’t think you understand when you say everywhere will have WiFi. You expect some kids to run into a store and buy candy with their bitcoin off their phone? You expect your local bake sale to except bitcoin? The Salvation Army bell ringers to except bit coin? The people that sell food on the side of the road need to except bitcoin? 

Look at New Orleans right now. They have no electricity and won’t for weeks in most areas. You can’t even run a debit/credit card. If you’re not fortunate enough to have a generator to have power you can’t even charge your phone.

I think once people realize that there will be significant limitations to bitcoin it will fade. Bitcoin will present itself like Tesla’s promise for self driving cars. Incapable of doing what its promised.

Interest rates went up and companies started pulling back on open offers. Not really surprising to me. Particularly in Tech where borrowing is necessary for them to hire and expand.

>What is interesting, however, is that these declines are both persistent and unseasonal relative to pre-pandemic job scraping trends. This should not generally be happening as seasonal postings are cyclical and largely insulated from variables such as churn, given that they are by nature not year-round positions. This is also strange as that we are not seeing equivalent payrolled employment growth in some of the sectors that drive new job postings in the autumn (e.g., Retail Trade). As monthly hires levels have also declined near-continuously since February 2022 and by October were at pre-pandemic levels, increased hiring also does not seem to fully explain this new development:

Not really sure what you're trying to get across here.

Monthly jobs growth is coming down from extremely high levels. Plans didn't include the federal reserve booming the interest rate to 5% so now plans are to hire less.

>As far as UI claims, I feel that elevated job openings, labor market tightness, and the exhaustion of pandemic UI benefits/lack of program eligibility in the wake of pandemic era crackdowns on unemployment benefits in many states decrease the value of this metric as a barometer of labor market health. We are also far enough out from the exhaustion of pandemic and extended UI benefits that those individuals who want a job but may have only been actively seeking employment as a condition of their receiving UI are no longer captured in the U-6: this would point towards what is likely a significant increase in the ranks of the shadow unemployed over the course of the pandemic.

I have no doubt there are more people outside the labor force. The biggest chunk of which may be Long COVID. There's some other chunks who don't even see the point of working (young people).

Given 150 million workers, claims at 220k is extremely low. When people are laid off, they seek UI.

This is \*initial\* claims. None of the things you mention would negate people filing initial claim. It's not like UI only existed as a COVID benefit. People are going to file UI like they have been for 50 years. The other rules you mention apply to continuing claims.

>All of this said and much like you, I do find it incredibly hard to believe that BLS revisions wouldn't have picked up on the absolutely enormous gulf that the Fed is reporting.

I'm not taking issue with the BLS' numbers, saying the Fed is wrong, or saying there were massive layoffs--just that a more holistic assessment of the labor economy beyond CES data does show things aren't truly ""booming,"" so to speak.

I appreciate your responses.

In the context of the labor market, the market for jobs, and translating that to ""economy"" the labor market is booming.

Are people's conditions good? There's a lot of other factors beyond the labor market. Like the US shit healthcare system that bankrupts people to death, like COVID still hammering away at life expectancy now reduced to 1996 levels, like capitalists raising prices far in excess of cost to produces, and much more.

>Again, I know this--that's why I said it in the first comment. I was merely saying that if we were to believe the Fed's release, these rather precipitous month-over-month declines would be largely attributable to jobs pulling open offers rather than open positions being filled--and that is if we are to take the Fed's estimates at face value. I'm not saying that the Fed is right, merely that it would imply that the number of open offers being pulled due to rate hikes and recession fears is relatively massive (although I also acknowledged that the number of openings remains significantly elevated, and so this trend isn't having much of an impact at this time).

I wouldn't use the descriptions you do. Massive, precipitous. To me the draw down in JOLTs is more or less expected.

BLS establishment survey tries to ascertain filled job changes from existing businesses, uses birth/death model for new firm creation. The impact of pulled offers or closed jobs is already reflected in the monthly BLS reports.

>What I was subsequently alluding to in referencing new posting activity was merely that the rate at which new job postings are declining is greatly exceeding even elevated hiring activity especially given reduced levels of churn, and it has been significant enough to mask seasonal posting trends in recent months. This merely was lending further credence to the idea that a significant proportion of the decline in nonfarm job openings were attributable to offers being pulled and subdued talent demand among employers, pointing towards a potential slowdown in jobs growth in the near-term that could potentially align with the Fed's claims (not necessarily that this was true of Q2 2022). That new job posting activity is down in service sectors such as Retail Trade is also significant as their occupational composition is almost entirely low-skilled jobs with minimal educational requirements, a trend at odds with the oft-mentioned layoffs/pulled offers in high-skill sectors such as Information.

Not sure I follow. Perhaps put it more simply?

All these reports are seasonally adjusted. So I don't think anything is being masked seasonally.

Jobs growth has been slowing all year. I would expect it to be slowing for a lot of reasons. Interest rates, less fiscal support.

>I'm aware of how UI works. What I was saying about shadow unemployment and benefits exhaustion is that, from a holistic perspective, the national labor economy is not doing as well as is portrayed, a fact further evidenced by declines in the LFPR and EPOP in recent months among the prime working age cohort (and sagging participation among 20-24 year olds remains bizarre). Yes the BLS' monthly jobs numbers are solid; it is just that there is a dark undercurrent to the current situation in the form of widespread labor disengagement and the rise of employment barriers. This also again merely reinforced the notion that a lot of the decline in nonfarm job openings we are seeing is attributable to employers axing unfilled positions and reducing talent demands.

>Like I said, I think we are talking about two completely different things and I think you thought I was saying something in my original comment that I wasn't, haha.

Initial Jobless claims remains a strong indicator of the labor market \*as it is measured\* it's a proven first indicator for recessions and would still be so today. People who are working are going to claim UI when they lose their jobs. Even people that are fired for performance claim it.

If claims pops over 300,000, we are gonna see a problem in monthly jobs.

You are really talking about what is outside the labor force. Which, inherently, is not going to be reflected in reports that measure the labor market and doesn't actually mean the labor market itself isn't strong. Business is good.

But capitalists aren't offering people a quality of life. They bust unions. Jobs have no greater purpose. They're running around denying global warming. They're ridiculous decrees that you sacrifice your life to work for them.

Young men are on a temper tantrum about not having entitlement to a woman. That's a whole other thing.

There's demographics at play too in the LFPR. Which peaked more than 2 decades ago.

Some of these things require solutions not within the scope of the labor market.",Robincapitalists,t2_5vsdu8dz,1,0,reddit3

Janet Yellen Is Struggling at the Treasury Job She Never Wanted

The ex-Fed chair has been sidelined by the White House on some key issues.

It was supposed to have been a capstone. Instead, Janet Yellen’s stint as Treasury secretary threatens to become a stain on a storied career.
The former Federal Reserve chair was recruited to help steer the US economy out of the pandemic by lending her gravitas and credibility to the Biden administration’s pursuit of a robust and lasting recovery. It took some arm-twisting to persuade her to take the job.

Eighteen months later, Joe Biden’s presidency is in trouble, with inflation soaring to a 40-year high and Democrats on course for a wipeout in the midterm elections. The 75-year-old Yellen finds herself trapped in the inevitable blame game, fighting to keep her professional reputation intact.
On May 31, Yellen took matters into her own hands and did something that caught the White House by surprise. She admitted to the American public on CNN that she “was wrong” about the path inflation would take. The administration had thus far been relentlessly trying to paint the surge in consumer prices as temporary.
With her statement, Yellen broke ranks with Biden’s inner circle—which doesn’t include her—and exposed the dysfunction at the heart of an administration that’s botched its communications around the country’s economic problems. Americans haven’t felt this dismal about the nation’s—and their own—prospects since the recession of 1980, according to the latest reading of the University of Michigan’s gauge of consumer sentiment, while polls show the majority of voters disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation.

Some of Yellen’s travails come with the territory. US Treasury secretaries are supposed to take a leading role in formulating economic policy but at times wield less influence over important matters than the president’s own cadre of advisers. The job demands sharp elbows and assertive salesmanship, helpful in dealing with Congress. These are qualities frequently associated with Robert Rubin, Henry Paulson, and Steven Mnuchin, all of whom worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before being tapped for the top job at Treasury, and not with a soft-spoken technocrat like Yellen, who’s accustomed to the more predictable and measured world of central banking.
Yellen’s most tangible accomplishment so far is the progress she has forged on an international tax agreement designed to halt a global race to the bottom on corporate tax rates, a goal that has eluded negotiators for nearly a decade. The framework has the support of almost 140 nations but US voters, preoccupied as they are with kitchen-table issues, have not taken much notice.
This account of Yellen’s struggle to find her footing is based on interviews with almost two dozen current and former senior officials in the US and elsewhere, most of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly. Yellen declined to comment for this story.",ImpossibleHandle4,t2_5p3gy4rk,186,0,reddit4

That’s actually such a powerful move.

Also I’m an idiot - I thought she’s still the Fed chair 🤦🏻‍♂️ It makes sense for a Treasury secretary to admit fault if that’s what it takes to gain back trust.

We threw economics out the window because the US has the reserve currency so we thought this crap couldn't happen to us.

Corporation not paying taxes isn’t just a US problem. It’s global. If only a few countries have the law than its useless because they can relocate somewhere else meanwhile countries around the world running deficits and unable to raise the proper tax dollars to make their nations better. But if everyone obeys the global minimum tax than it removes the incentive for companies to relocate and outsource to dodge taxes since they’ll be paying them to where ever they try to relocate too.,Quelcris_Falconer13,t2_6aze3ty8,1,0,reddit4

As in the CEO will only make 200x as much money as their average employees instead of 380x that? Oh. No. Those poor poor millionaires. How dare they pay more taxes to help society as a whole. 

Your whole outlook is greed focused around maximizing profits and totally is oblivious to the very real problems it creates at the bottom for the poor and almost absent middle class. These aren’t numbers on a screen, this lack of tax revenue compared to what we used to have is literally making our country fall apart. We have schools with moldy rooms and textbooks falling apart, roads going I repaired and bridges falling down while rich people just continue to get more rich. This is just one of the harmful effects.

Yes. The numbers are seasonally adjusted and they factor in the fact that the unemployment rate tends to move in certain ways at certain times of the year.

Big Business has done well because liquidity was injected into the financial sector as well as into the pockets of everyday people. We didn’t do enough, but we did do a lot. Unemployment benefits helped tremendously.

Throughout the pandemic people stocked up on essentials and largely switched to online shopping. Who has a big online presence? Big business. On the other hand, small business suffered tremendously for obvious reasons. For small business, a lockdown is essentially a total loss of foot traffic.

Keep in mind that many small businesses actually did very well. But a whole lot of them didn’t, especially as people cut out unnecessary expenses like eating out.


>Why hasn’t the financial sector and stocks been hurt by the fact that like 30% of the population has been negatively affected in some form by Covid?   And probably 10-15% in a catastrophic way ie these people may end up homeless, surely this is gonna cause some wide spread issues.   But nope stocks are high, housing is still exploding in value, white collar jobs I guess are fine.   It seems weird.

The ability to borrow has never been better. Low interest rates, tons of financial liquidity from the Fed’s market operations and increased savings. 

There is a tremendous amount of suffering, but many people and businesses made off very well through this crisis. The suffering of the least fortunate is squarely the responsibility of both the bungled health response, and lack of aggressive federal action on issues most important to the average american.

gil7pfs,t1_gikdrze,2021-01-08 21:59:53,Economics,"> But nope stocks are high, housing is still exploding in value, white collar jobs I guess are fine. It seems weird.

This is the heart of why. It is the same reason California is going to have a budget SURPLUS, instead of massive deficiet.

To be blunter then a sledgehammer: The people who are poor got screwed, hard. Anyone on the bottom end of the economic ladder (poor, young, not as educated, service workers, etc) all got nuked and are suffering. The thing is, those same people

1. Don't invest, so they weren't directly contributing to the market much
2. Don't pay taxes, the progressive nature of our taxation systems means they simply don't pay in absolute terms, and even in percentage terms they don't pay much. Most high income tax states have 20-30% of the taxpayers covering 50%+ of the taxes. Bottom 20% of taxpayers contribute almost nothing at all.
3. Don't have any way to streamline their life, they already are on the raggedy edge

Contrast with the white collar workers still working. They tend to be higher paid, they pay the bulk of taxes, they are the ones with 401k, and other investment vehicles, they have houses already, and thus equity. They also are blocked from spending money in many ways because of lockdowns, so they are either investing, saving, or changing their habits to do things more efficiently, because now they don't have a choice (more online ordering, more takeout, more stuff done at home). Anything that a monthly membership service is getting hammered (gyms are the big one), because once people are forced to do without something, many are realizing they don't need it, and won't go back.

In short, the people who have the most money, who contribute the most to investing, and to taxes, are still doing so, they weren't hurt much at all. Those who who had neither, got wrecked. But it is easier to just ignore them, as well off people sit behind gated fences, or inside their apartments, working full time remote (like myself). Easy for me to ignore any hardship around me, when I can just order literally everything delivered to my door, food included and only really step outside to walk my dog, and take the trash out, and do laundry (and if I had an in unit washer/dryer, I wouldn't even do that).",ArcanePariah,t2_7x73s,21,0,reddit1

The reality is that monitoring labor force participation rate - especially when adjusting for demographics - is important to understand the health of the employment market. A 3% YoY reduction in labor force participation rate is huge and cannot be solely explained by demographic shifts (although some portion of that 3% does reflect elderly people taking an early retirement package from their employer during COVID of course). 

I prefer the [25-54 LFPR](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU01300060) because it is less biased by changing demographics or increasing education participation rates (which is of questionable value but that's a separate discussion). And, looking at that data, there has been some sustained decline in that data since 2000 with some ups and downs. With the pandemic, we're back down to mid-1980's levels - a time in which the ""women in the workplace trend"" - while reaching maturity at that point - was still going on. 

It's something worth noting. It's not necessarily a *bad* thing - aiming for the highest possible LFPR is not a goal in and of itself (hey, if only one household member needs to work to sustain quality of life, that's a good thing) - but there is something there.

- So many people work more than one job (incorrect)

- There is such a backlog of unemployment benefits that the “real” number will be much higher (UI has nothing to do with this number)

You either buy bonds and accept guaranteed negative returns; or buy stocks which risk even greater negative returns than bonds (I mean, come on, even if you assume that S&P 500 earnings will be $200 in 2022, forward earnings are still 19x, and what do you think bond yields will be by the end of 2022?).

In effect, at market-clearing rates, there is no incentive for employees to remain loyal to their jobs or employers. Because of this churn, the training efforts of firms to train employees places drag on their MPL (Marginal Product of Labor), which is exactly the issue outlined by the title.

By paying above market-clearing rates, the MPL increases to not only reduce employee turnover, but to increases the incentives to try harder and maximizes the MPL at a rate higher than equilibrium and the additional production (more than) covers the increases in wages.

Why CEOs aren't required to take and apply Labor Economics is beyond me.

But my problem is the average employee and the attitude of ""Let them quit.  Big deal.  We can find another.""  On one hand, finding another average employee these days ain't so easy.  On the other, just to be an average employee takes a LOT of training.  It is so easy to fixate of what an average employee doesn't do well or how they fuck things up sometimes, but - my god - at least them know how to get into the parking lot, how to mark their vacation time, how to sign up for benefits.....much less things specific to our group like, ""How to use our data management systems?"" and ""What people to also invite to such a meeting?""

I love how sound this logic seems, but in the US, in the last 50 years, this hasn't been true at all. These gains in productivity have been directly funneled into shareholder or top management's pockets with little to no substantive wage growth for workers. With the meteoric rise in cost-of-living, workers have finally reached a breaking point. All of this turnover is a symptom; companies need to accept lower profits and pay more in wages and benefits if they want to retain workers and continue to grow productivity gains.",yeltsa,t2_ns78o,3,0,reddit2

j2w2h7h,t3_102rwko,2023-01-04 09:55:50,Economics,"TLDR: Harsh reality - over 3 years I switched 3 jobs. This resulted 3x salary increase, free luxury company car and 100% working from home office in my private garden district house so that I can munch on my own home grown ripe juicy tomatoes for lunch or walk my dog in a close by pine forest while still living in a capital city.

Full story (bragging):

1-st job 2016-2021: I was 24 when started it in this innovation centre, spent there 5 years working with scientific research, R&D, MVP, POCs.
Started as an engineer on country average salary. After 3 years become a Head of Prototyping lab. Salary doubled, responsabilities doubled. Used my own car and gass to visit customers. Had to work extra hours to deliver. Bonus - free worldwide trips and business trip to Burning Man (yeah, I know... but I was an art builder there). For 2 years saraly was the same. Bought a house which needed lots of renovation, so neither the budget, neither the spare time was sufficient to have a comfy life.

2-nd job (2021-2022): they found me on LinkedIn and bought me. Design engineer in a foreign capital company. Salary 4 x country average (double from previous work). 8 to 5 job, close the door and forget one. Gass compensation for trips to work. Life in a cubicle. 4 days work weeks on summer months. Bonus - travel to USA for trainings, trips to other countries to support customer site tests. Con - 1h15min drive to the office.

3-rd job (2022-present): they found me on LinkedIn and bought me. 6 x country average salary. Working as a tech. consultant for tech. companies. First time they checked me in 2018, offered way less (3 x country average), but my qualification was now much higher and they doubled the old offer. Free company car (Lexus), free gass for personal use, 100% working from home office, except the trips to visit customers F2F. I am considered as an independent contributor, so much flexibility. As long as numbers are met, I can work the way I want. Since I live in a private house on a capital city garden district it was a no brainer. No traffic jams, fresh air, pine forest, small veggie garden, apple trees. Sometimes working from a hammock under an apple tree. Bonus - wordwide trainings and working with bleeding edge tech. Cons - the one can get draged down to daily overtimes to deliver if not being efficient. But I try to optimise my effort and workmanship so that 8 hours of work with a healthy rest breaks in between would suffice.

So that is my past 3 years. I was lucky that my speciality rolled out from my hoby, so it was relatively easy to get the skills and knowledge in the field or adapt super fast to a smal pivot in speciality since it was personal interest, not only job. Though, it was constant effort all three years to improve myself.
So the wins are definately a better income situation, better life/work ratio, more prestige if that matters.
The loses are - first job was actually fulfilling me as a human being, as I helped others. Got to work with young talents, got students involved to get their first hands on projects on R&D. Also tought youth and developed STEAM labs at schools.
Current job is less fulfilling, since it is just a big corporate world I got into. Though I will try to gain some fulfillment while helping smaller and younger tech. companies by helping them to develop good products, but it won't be the same as seing some student finish his first real prototype.
So I guess you gain something, you loose something.

My colleague who took my place at my first job got about 15% rise over those 3 years, while I tripled my salary. So changing jobs is worth it as long as you are ready for extra stress as a new hires get while they adapt. For me - I might stay here for a while now just to get more in to the comfort zone and then maybe start my own business or something. What is rarely worth it is climbing the ladder, since salary increase is usually lesser that the extra work burdened over the ones head...",Ciakis_Lee,t2_ds7vyjn3,4,0,reddit2

If we are talking economics, the discussion should be about how revenue within a company is being spent training new hires? Ancillary, costs for that company to obtain employees. And how it is affecting the company’s bottom line. Thus affecting tax revenue? If a business has to divert resources away from the product it’s producing, using funds that potentially could be used to generate income it’s an operating loss. Essentially it’s gambling on that new hire that time and money spent will benefit the bottom line. If an employee gets trained for x amount of time but quits two weeks after…back to square one. So now the company is hemorrhaging money into hiring. If they can’t keep the doors open local, sate, federal tax revenue disappears.

College grads don't know the job and are for quiet a while an expense to the company but they think they deserve to make a good wage because they went to college.  Companies don't want to train anyone because they believe as soon as someone has experience they will leave and employees leave because they are being treated poorly and somebody else will likely pay them more.  Both sides are correct.  The issue is the companies have squandered all their good will with their employees and most workers will drop their company in a hot second for a home office and an extra $2/h.

>""If non-wage factors are negative, then higher wages may be insufficient to boost productivity.""

It is also worth noting that labor providers also have different preferences in their job-seeking behavior. For example, some employees prefer going into the office (not me, but some people) or working towards a particular mission (I've seen an extremely talented collegue take a lateral wage to move into a role with less upward mobility because she wanted to focus on sustainability and helping ecologically responsible firms thrive).

We have more complexities and more as consumers involved in every aspect of our lives, and more we have to read the fine print of to simply protect ourselves (esp in the US, not sure about other countries) - variety of bills, retirement funds/savings, health insurance, etc.  Cost of living is higher, housing costs are higher, daycare costs are higher, college/grad education costs are higher, while even basic savings plans are less efficient.  

I’m in my mid 30s now, but when I was a preteen, I put money I had saved from family over the years into a CD with a 7% interest rate, which is something that doesn’t exist anymore.  My parents had two bills they paid when they were still renting and a bit younger than my age - one for rent, one for their landline.  Their employee benefits were super clear (in the 80s) and they were able to build real stability even once my mom switched to part time after I was born.  They couldn’t have done that today.

While true, the current labor market is very strong. The Nov. 2022 seasonally adjusted U6 Unemploment Rate was 6.7%, which is several points lower than the 10.3% long-term average.

Given the above figures, it is likely that many firms are paying the efficiency wages right now. Eventually, these become the new market wages as more and more firms adopt and the supply & demand curves shift to accommodate the changes.

>Only a few firms in each labor market (i.e. FANG in tech, the big 5 in accounting, Big Law firms, etc.) can be paying efficiency wages.

I'm bemoaning the system at large companies that makes it very difficult to hire and retain any of our workers.  I find it very unfortunate and inefficient that people have to quit for us to offer raises.  I find it frustrating that I might have to hire an unproven Year 0 employee at a higher rate than a good Year 6 employee....and then use that proof of current market rates as the evidence to get the Year 6 employee a 25% bump.  But......this is how large organizations are.  If I wanted unilateral authority to give out raises, I should manage the corner pet shop.  

And while I find the red tape annoying at times, it serves a purpose other times.  When you take away all organizational controls, that's how really bad pay disparities happen.  That's where discrimination comes from.  That's where sexual harassment occurs.  

I just wish we could have the good part and not the frustrating part.  

And I especially dislike how difficult it is for me to get average employees a raise.  I really value those folks, but it's common for organizations to see them for their weaknesses.  Like if we have a person who manages our divisions website, my Big Boss only remembers that one time 5 years ago when his name was spelled wrong......and gives little credit for everything else that has been mistake free on the website all the rest of the time.

I've noticed the target for exit for many people being somewhere around 25%. Once people hit that much of a difference in their real salary vs potential market rate, intangible - or non-monetary - perks start to fall in priority. 

And when a 25% pay increase is required to bring you back to the buying power you had less than 5 years ago, it becomes required. 

That's the real kick in the teeth. Leaving for a 20% raise sounds like a huge win. For most of us, it's just resetting us back to where we were in 2017 from a buying power perspective. I live in a market where housing has gone up something like 60%-200% over the last 5 years. If you are a young person renting or a young family trying to buy your first home, you are spending an enormous portion of your income on housing to begin with usually. Now, suddenly if rapid inflation hits, you go from spending (an egregious) 40-50% of your income on housing to spending 60-80% of your income on housing.

It’s different from both the employer and employee perspective. Employers have long had a set of tools for identifying if a person is the right fit. They aren’t perfect, but it was OK because once they were hired, the employer could be right there paying attention to how they were fitting. It would be obvious what’s right and wrong, and they’d take steps to find out if the employee can adjust. 

Now that is no longer the case for a few reasons. The talent market has shrunk dramatically after covid, and the highly competent (or talented) individuals became much more valuable, giving them the best leverage to WFH. Now that companies need to go for remote employees more often, they have a much stronger reliance on their tools to measure performance. There’s a two way game played in-office where employers walk around to see if people work, and the people pretend they’re working (a game everyone has played), but now, without that psychological push & pull, it leaves companies with weaker means for incentivizing work. They have to look at the numbers and blindly trust things are going well. Trust that virtual happy hours are keeping people engaged. Trust that there aren’t any gaping flaws in how they’re operating, because there isn’t a group of people sitting there to spontaneously fix it.

It is proof of how weak business operators’ tools to understand their own companies have been. Also proof that people don’t love being at home, they just never really liked being at work.

iu5xwsx,t1_iu3bq45,2022-10-28 20:09:04,Economics,"That's less a WFH issue, or a management issue, and more an issue of your devs being bad at communication.

Whenever I bring on a new dev I make sure they understand a few key points that will affect them for their entire life. This is all small team stuff; large teams have different rules, but the theme is the same.

1. This is the most important lesson. It is NOT YOUR CODE. It is the company's code. You just get paid to write it. Don't get attached to it. Don't try to claim ownership of it. Don't throw a fit if it gets removed or rewritten. Think of it as somebody paying you to get better at your craft. Your reward is the money you make, and the skills you develop. The code is just the outcome, and it belongs to the one paying the bills. Hell, with time you will learn to hate your own code, because every line is a potential future bug that you may need to solve when you least want to.

2. Constantly ask questions. Start on group chat where someone might just answer it quickly. Escalate to the block owners if you can't find an solution and it is significantly affecting your ability to work. Escalate to team lead if it's critical and will knock you out of commission for days to implement/debug.

3. As a corollary, constantly answer questions. Finding good answers is a skill, and like all skills you get better with practice. At the same time, be careful about answer too much, too fast. You still want your juniors to develop skills, so make sure they struggle just a little bit before you give them the answer.

4. Keep up with what the team is doing, and how you can help. If someone is stuck on a problem for 3 days, and you can solve it in 30 minutes, then those 30 minutes are probably going to be far more advantageous to the team, even if it might set you back by an hour. Obviously you need to prioritize here too; I don't want a senior dev spending an hour on a problem that a jr dev could tackle in 2, but 

5. Everyone should participate in discussions at all levels. Even a jr dev should have an idea of the strategic, multi-year decisions being made. It's a lot easier to swallow the idea that your code is going to get replaced in 2 months when you understand that the thing getting released in 2 months is a major strategic initiative that's been in the works for years. When you empower people with information, they will inevitably make decisions based on that information. Whenever you deny people information, they will still make decisions, only now those decisions will be based on God knows what, and the outcomes will never be the same.",TikiTDO,t2_3yp3u,0,0,reddit3

The opposite is not true. If you get a very challenging tasks that requires a lot of expertise, you're not going to get the same result from 10 juniors as you would from one expert senior.

So inevitably you wind up getting your own insurance because their plan is about the same cost, and you don't really see much benefit in having a 401k.

And forget about vacation days. As a contractor, you get paid per hour worked and nothing else. I've been with 3 agencies and they all have this policy.

If you get your work done very quickly in order to direct that attention elsewhere (like on Reddit), you aren't actually fulfilling that expectation.

I know that's backwards. It's not like they write anywhere that they are paying for your attention, but that's the only reason your time is valuable to them anyways, at least in their eyes.
