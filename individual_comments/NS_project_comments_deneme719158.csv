What has not been said however:

* The altercation starts with DW's wife being distraught and DW grabbing her hand.

* Only after her hand is grabbed, wife slaps DW, **trying to free her hand**

* DW lets go of her hand and slaps her

* Wife tries to walk away, DW grabs her and **slaps her again**

They example i give is Chris brown and Rihanna. While this situation with Dana white seems mutual and as I said I believe that makes it completely forgivable. They both owe each other an apology. Maybe publicly for displaying domestic violence as celebs but other than that I don‚Äôt think he should lose his job or anything close to that.

But with the whole Chris brown Rihanna they would fight each other fairly equally apparently until one day he almost beat her close to death. She never even came close to doing that to him and likely wasn‚Äôt hitting as hard as he was. That to me is a clear example of when it‚Äôs no longer fighting back and it‚Äôs a man abusing a woman.

Most rational people thing a woman getting hit by a man should get out and contact authorities bud. Not slap him back and **again**, simply escalate out of anger. Largely because again, a man vs a woman is not a fair fight.....for most..

>Secondly, you are treating someone as a threat based on who they are, rather than what they do.

I just told you the law bud. It is based on both who they are and what they do. It again, depends on the person's 'reasonable belief' that they used necessary force.

As far as different pt tests for different jobs? It would never work out, you expect too much of military infrastructure. The AVASB passing score for the marine corps is 50 ok. Those chuckle heads can barely run two annual fitness tests, let alone 7-20 varieties of tests. 

There are allowances for age, older you get, the more lax the standard becomes. You still have to run 3 miles, fast, though.  

As far as gender discrimination? Good luck with that. Your best bet to make change happen, would be to find a compelling argument as to why women need to have higher pt standards, and if they can fight that, then the next fight you need to have is to lower the male standard to its female equivalent. Either way this will fuck up mission readiness, if too many female marines fail a higher pt standard, they can't deploy, if males are held to a lower standard, it will cause unexpected labor issues. 


Ultimately however, these arguments have already been made, and the at the time honorable Mr. Mavis of the office of the secretary of defense said ""its OK that women are weak and lack mission readiness, we can rely on them as much as we rely on the men, on the condition that we continue to rely on the men to the same standard as before, while expecting them to pick up the easy to calculate slack that the equally trained women will need picking up after once the going gets too hard.""

Nowhere is ""defacto equality"" specifically defined for this or any other purpose.

I recommend everyone review CEDAW - the [United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-elimination-all-forms-discrimination-against-women?fbclid=IwAR2fUZvdCG6nfG_unHS8ankixh8zUX1zKFdQz1Jezgkxemzc88zlY9o_TmQ), Article 4 (with reference to Article 1).

Article 4:

1. Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved.

In every country that has ratified CEDAW, there will be a Sex Discrimination Act that references this UN Convention. Eg. [Australia](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00002):

""The objects of this Act are:

  (a)  to give effect to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and to provisions of other relevant international instruments;""

The point here is that **the US has not ratified CEDAW**. They are the only country to have signed it but not passed legislation enacting it.

applicants for military service are regulated. During fitness  
testing, the same tests are administered; however standards  
and scores are adjusted to recognize biological differences  
between women and men. All remaining selection tests are  
the same.  
Description  
The physical selection test measures the physical potential of the applicant taking  
into account biological differences between men and women. The score on this  
test is included in the overall score of the applicant. A ranking, of the applicants,  
based on this overall score is made up.  
In the case of a limited number of vacancies, the best applicants are recruited.  
Standards for physical tests related to certain functions (e.g. pilot, combat diver)  
are the same for men and women.  
Advantage  
‚Ä¢ The test measuring the physical potential of men and women is no longer  
gender neutral.  
‚Ä¢ Women are no longer put at a disadvantage, so their chances to be recruited  
increase.  
‚Ä¢ Increase of the number of women recruited.  
‚Ä¢ Recruitment is seen to be fair and unbiased as the best candidates are  
recruited, regardless of their gender.

This makes sense, because when people are being brought into military service, they aren't necessarily going in for a purely combat role. While strength matters, our military isn't engaged in sword-fighting, so there is a practical limit on how big or strong someone needs to be in order to shoot a gun, throw a grenade, or drive a vehicle. While it may be true that women on average may be less capable of say, carrying a wounded comrade out of danger, this is also going to be true of some men.

Let's take, for example, the biggest gap provided in the fitness standards - pushups.

On average men under 30 are expected to hit a minimum of 33 pushups in 1 minute versus just 18 for women.

Taking the heaviest people on the youngest end of this chart: [https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards](https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards)

We are looking at women being as heavy as 227 lbs' versus men being 235 lbs' and as light as 119lbs vs 132 lbs respectively.

That means that both men and women are on average maybe 8 to 13lbs apart? In a combat situation where a woman might have to carry a wounded comrade out of danger, it seems VERY unlikely that someone capable of hitting either minimum benchmark for ENTRY into the military would somehow not be fit enough to do a fireman's carry.

&#x200B;

Basically, while I can see the minimum standards allowing for women to have weaker upper body strength on average in order to be accepted, I don't see these standards as being so VASTLY different as to require a change in pay that wouldn't more reliably correspond to a change in their assigned duties (which would better reflect the specific reason that individual was accepted for). 

These guidelines are broad, but active duties seem, in my understanding, to be quite varied. These are minimum fitness requirements, and the minimum requirements don't seem to be off significantly enough to result in significant differences in individual performance for positions candidates wind up being sorted into.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,5,0,reddit3

Places like figher fighting. Or military. You need need the physical requirements to be met. Cause if your buddy gets hurt in any way or form. You trust your life to yea partners to safe you. As the so you. 

And everykne knowing the can do that in when needed cause its a requirement to stand next to you. Gives trust and give piece of mind to the people that do those dangerous jobs.

But people dont seem to get if you make. 1 not have to be held up to the same requirements. That same bound and trust from knowing the person got your back is simply not that. Cause the nevwr had to prove that the could. So places where people get hurt like on front line in wars. Or figher fights the should be no where in the building where that requirements are needed. 

And even do its already happening and girls just not take serious and why would yea take them serious. If you put a lot of pride in your job. And where you are. And see people left and right have to do 50 procent less. Where you basicly saying 2 off those girls makes 1 of you. And the cant do the job thats requirement off them so you have to pick up the slack.

People say thats not true. But i work os a physical demanding job. And you can call me ass hole all you want. If you get payed the same. You wil do the same job as everyone else. No pick and choose the easy jobs. Cause its simple pride in your work. As a professional. Cause job titles mean something.

Cant say your a plumber. But wont do any of the dirty of physical demanding jobs. You should not be allowed to call yea self a plumber. Thats the simple fact. If you in a typ of job. You should be required to become able to do everything that job requires of you. To be called a professional.

Same way i cant go to woman dominate fields. Like teaching. Or day care. Pick and choose what jobs suits me right. Simple rule tale it all or none. Why the fuck is subpar work acceptable to meat dumb quotes. That often make work for more people. Dubble work loads. And slowly burn out people. Cause you need 2 often 3 of those girls to 
Fill one man. When physical demands a requirement in almost all parts off the job. And all the easy jobs. That people often seem as a small break of back breaking work houre after houre. You dont even have that anymore. But the get payed the same as you. Fucking funny as hell. Who would try there best anymore seeing that shit day after day.

In general, men are about 10% taller and have 50% more mass than women.

But that is in general. Many women can run longer and faster than a subset of men. Some women are stronger than even most men.

Equal opportunity means everyone has the opportunity to do a job, regardless of physical attributes.

Women overall, are not as strong as men, and physical standards for women in the military, just as for men, are significantly higher than for the overall population. Basically women, like men, have to be fit, be capable of running non-stop for two miles, be capable of lifting their bodies. But the standards for women are based on things like shorter legs and less upper body strength. 

Lots of guys make it through basic training requirements who are > 50 lbs overweight at the start. It is amazing how a low calorie, high protein diet and burning 7000 calories a day can radically transform the human body in 8 weeks.

BTW, this argument that women are too weak to do the job goes back > 40 years. It wasn't true then and it is not true now.

44% of women failed the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) in 2021. 7% of men failed. People who fail the ACFT multiple years can be denied re-enlistment. It depends on whether recruitment is high or low, because the military sets requirements for the total number of soldiers.

And as for your moaning over why it is that standards are not the same- they are in other ways. For instance, female and male Marines attend the same basic infantry school together and are there held to the same physical requirements. They have to complete the same rucksack hikes, complete the same obstacle courses, complete the same warfare training and manuevers. 

Further, in terms of specific infantry MOS Marines, there are very few female Marines because they are held to the same physical standards and most cannot complete the school training.

But, outside of general fitness and sound mindedness, your ability to carry a fallen Marine or soldier would hardly enter any real life combat scenarios for the majority of enlisted.

HOWEVER, both in USMC basic bootcamp AND infantry school (which all Marines attend and must pass) female AND male Marines must carry simulated fallen platoon members from a prone movement position (that is to say, carrying an actual person on your back while you low crawl) across field lengths AS WELL AS running movements.

Either way this will fuck up mission readiness, if too many female marines fail a higher pt standard, they can't deploy, if males are held to a lower standard, it will cause unexpected labor issues.

Let's just say that if our base was in danger of being overrun and females were not issued grenades I'd be happier, for everyone's safety, because of my personal experience. I'm not blaming them. People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do. But rather than weeding people based on gender, they should do that by giving them a test that makes sure that they can throw a grenade properly (the grenade throw event wasn't a test. There was not pass/fail criteria. I don't know why).

If the military were the first to buck political trends it could be seem as an attempted coup de'tat, so, military will always play as popular a fiddle as they can see themselves getting away with. 


The military exists today in a state that intends to not be used or seen as a traditional military, but the needs and standards of a military still need to maintained to traditional standards. As far as I can tell, everything should funnel into one of the following:


1. Military standards continue to degenerate due to psuedo-peacetime which turns the military complex into a weak and ineffectual office waiting to be exploited by actors foreign and domestic.


2. Military ground forces are finally replaced with terrifying Boston dynamics robotic drones piloted by VR, Thus eliminating the gender issue, but raising tons of moral and ethical questions. 


3. A real no-shit war occurs, and current politics crumble under the stress, allowing a return to traditional form for the military as they move into a war time mindset. 


One of those three realities with caveats surely.


 (Probably Boston dynamic drones will be piloted exclusively by female marines maybe) 


Or maybe another major, real, no-shit war never occurs again. 


Or maybe we move into an Era of globally warring nation-states in a bid to establish a global hegemony. 


A lot of unanswered questions floating in the air, with mysterious actors throwing more questions out from behind the scenes that nobody asked yet, like, why are all the baby formula producing plants in America burning down? Can baby formula burn hot enough to melt steel beams? 


Why do new energy initiatives never take necessary output and scalability into consideration when they are being considered to replace the primary power grid for the country? 


Why will no one touch nuclear power with a lead insulated 65 foot pole?

I see you've never attended military training where you have to throw grenades. It's part of the US Army basic training. I wasn't aware of this before, but during the grenade throw I became aware of how horribly ineffective the average female is in throwing stuff far away. It's a well known thing.

Let's just say that if our base was in danger of being overrun and females were not issued grenades I'd be happier, for everyone's safety, because of my personal experience. I'm not blaming them. People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do. But rather than weeding people based on gender, they should do that by giving them a test that makes sure that they can throw a grenade properly (the grenade throw event wasn't a test. There was not pass/fail criteria. I don't know why).

I don't doubt that women won't throw the grenades as well as men, but this is a fundamentally different claim from the idea that ANY man would be a better, safer candidate simply because he could out throw a grenade better than any female soldier.

If this is the only criticism you have to offer on my position, I don't find it to be a compelling one. Because my position involves far more than a comment that was fundamentally about the distinction size differences make between modern and ancient warfare. Which I don't see women underperforming compared to men in distance throwing to be the only factor worth considering in whether or not someone is qualified to be a member of the military.

I mean, have you considered that the men who don't qualify are potentially worse at throwing than these women? Some men suck at throwing, some women are great at it, that's why these averages matter.

It exists to weed out people who are undisciplined and cannot commit to a goal to achieve it. It helps ensure that enlisted personnel are less likely to experience adverse health conditions. But to test for those things doesn't require a set amount of strength or endurance. On average, women have less upper body strength. That's just a fact. A perfectly disciplined and committed individual woman can be at her peak health and fitness and still not do as many pull-ups as a man. The key is to look at the demographic. Whatever an average woman who achieves an excellent level of physical fitness can do, that should be the standard. They should be at the top of their demographic. A man who performs the same number of pull-ups as an average woman of great fitness is likely well under his own peak for fitness, just based on physiology alone.

Just look at the Army page: [https://www.army.mil/acft/](https://www.army.mil/acft/) Is the purpose of the test to measure abilities? Instead it lists: ""improve solider and unit readiness;"" ""transform the Army's fitness culture;"" ""reduce preventable injuries and attrition;"" and ""enhance mental toughness and stamina."" These things aren't ties to the exact physical abilities of the individuals, but to their overall level of fitness and health.

inuglp8,t1_insm4li,2022-09-10 12:00:58,MensRights,"Sure, but my point about the standards was that they didn't result in a significant variance between recruited men and women. Yes, men will outperform women on average with some of these tasks (like grenade throwing) more often than not, but if the women can reliably throw a grenade over 250 meters at a minimum, they have reached a minimum physical requirement for them to be qualified candidates.

That it's easier for men to meet that minimum physical requirement doesn't mean that this should be an advantage for ALL military positions that might be filled either. There are benefits to having a gender diverse military that outweigh the advantages imposed by gender neutral physical requirements that result in an imbalance of men and women recruited. For example, when the military goes in to occupy an area they will have to deal with the civilians that live in that area. Just like police, there is a benefit to deescalating conflicts that might arise, and some of those conflicts might be more easily resolved because a woman is available to do the deescalating. Not because women are better at de-escalation, but because the civilian might be able to trust or relate to a woman more in that particular circumstance, making a woman the better soldier to use in that situation.

The point is that there is a balance of factors at play, and the complaint that the physical requirements are gendered doesn't mean there isn't a benefit to having different physical requirements if they still allow for the same ""minimum requirements"" for a candidate to be deployed in a specific way.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,1,0,reddit3

Fitness is important, even if actual strength is not, and men are physiologically better at certain things, like pull-ups. So we can't easily say they should reduce the number of pull-ups for men because that will allow unfit men to pass. The goal should be for all fit people to pass and all unfit people to fail. On the other hand, for deadlifts, the standard should really be a percentage of body weight, although honestly, the standards are low enough that a weak man can easily pass them. The minimum for a male under the age of 21 is only 140 pounds.

That's why I actually think a medical exam would be better. They could test bone density, muscle mass, body fat, and cardiovascular health. Of course, I recognize that there are many reasons why a basic fitness test would be easier and more cost-effective to administer.",countrymace,t2_mjhctq3w,2,0,reddit3
inrebyd,t1_inr70uf,2022-09-09 18:47:59,MensRights,"Was that the Marines? I think they deploy more often, which is probably why the age limit for first time enlistment is so much lower? 

The scope of their duties is obviously different. There is a pretty minimal level of physical fitness required for that. Any man or woman who is has reached a great level of physical fitness can manage to get into a truck or helicopter. I mean, did he have to climb up a rope to get in the heli? 

Even assuming that a deployed JAG officer does need an elevated level of fitness that directly translates to performance on a fitness test, does it make sense to hold everyone to that deployment standard throughout their entire time in the military? There is plenty of legal work that needs to be done in the U.S. and in other non-hostile locations. Everyone needs to be disciplined, committed, and healthy, but not everyone needs the upper body strength that they could climb up a rope or jump to catch a moving vehicle or anything else that could come up. 

I'll give you an analogy to firefighters. I see a lot of people complain about lower standards for women who apply because they think everyone should be able to do all of the jobs in an emergency. Now that's not a bad idea- if it's possible- if you have enough applicants that are physically and mentally capable of performing all jobs satisfactory. To be clear, where that is possible, that should be the goal. Where I'm from, that's just not possible. Our fire department is small and mostly volunteer. There are no women, but many of the men are very fat or older. Should they be booted from the department? No! We literally need them, and it's better that they are willing and able to perform some jobs, even if it's not all of them. If the team is well rounded enough, this works out just fine. If a woman wants to join, but she couldn't carry anyone out of a burning building, that doesn't mean she would be useless to us. If she is good at other roles in the department, then that benefits all of us and frees up others to focus on the roles that she can't do. If we had a strict fitness standard, we would not have very many firefighters at all. If you call EMS, and the paramedics can't get you to the ambulance (referencing that story about the guy who fell in a hole that was posted recently), you're really not any worse off where I live. They can't get you out of the hole, but they were the only available paramedics in the county, so you're stuck in the hole either way. You are just lucky that any EMS showed up in a reasonable time.

That‚Äôs why the Army is thinking of having a separate test for combat positions where the job actually requires specific abilities. It truly may not be enough to be ‚Äúin shape‚Äù for combat, for instance if you have to carry something heavy. You can be fit as hell but too small or not enough muscle mass to do that.

Why does this matter? Why not always pick the best of the best? Well for JAG specifically, I‚Äôll be blunt. The best of the best do not go into the military. There‚Äôs too much prestige and money in private practice. Get too strict with the fitness requirement, as in more than is actually required to do the job that needs done, and you make the pool even smaller. More generally, recruitment rates for the military are at an all time low. It makes sense to think more carefully about what level of fitness is actually required for the job, rather than limit applicants to those that would be fit enough for combat or deployment. We could have a military filled only with all our toughest, biggest, fittest guys, and it would not be successful because there are so many different skills and abilities that go into the operation of our military.",countrymace,t2_mjhctq3w,0,0,reddit3

For a woman or older man to perform the same as a young man, they would have to be more fit than the young man, on average at least. The difficulty for an average woman to do one push up is similar to the difficulty an average male would have doing four pull-ups. Notice how low this standard is for both genders. Do you really think that every guy who can do four pull-ups is fit or not a liability? A woman who can only do one pull-up is no more a liability than a man who can only do four. 

And why is it so lax? Why not only enlist people who are at peak fitness and ready for combat? Because that's the reality of recruitment. Recruitment is at a record low.

It may still be hard for some people but just because its hard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong/unfair and needs to be adjusted.  What is unfair and should not be the case, is having one person have to run that mile in 8 minutes and someone else being allowed to make the cut by running it in 9 because of their gender.

To add to that sentiment, I feel having the separate standards for men and women, just increases the divide between men and women.  If the men are held to higher standards that make them bulkier and heavier, then the difference in standards is going to show even more.  

As for the non-combat positions the physical requirements make sense and should remain the same for them IF they are in area that there is a possibility for combat.

You said:

""This assumes that the point of the physical fitness test is that it literally translates to required abilities to perform the job.  
It is""

You've changed your position here because later you agree that the purpose is to ensure you're ""in shape."" That does not directly translate to ability to a job. It's like the LSAT for law school. It shows you're mentally ""in shape"" but it does not directly indicate that you have the skills or abilities to be a lawyer or even law student. It just serves to weed out people who are definitely not smart enough to be a lawyer.

  
""Sometimes that is true, but many times, it is not.  
The main PFT is the minimum just to be in the military. You may not have to pull yourself up into a helicopter every day, but you better be able to when the time comes. If you need someone else to help you into a helicopter, you are putting yourself and others at increased risk.""

Someone who is physically fit will be able to do this. You're just looking for someone that is not carrying excess weight in the form of fat and has normal muscle mass. Different gender standards do not effect this as long as they are tied to the average performance of a physically fit person of that gender. 

  
""Men and women simply have different performances for the same level of fitness.  
The tests are based around your own body weight. Pullups, pushups, situps, running: You are only moving your own body weight. A 110 lb woman is not required to pull the 200lb man up, but she needs to be able to pull herself up.""

Well, that's just not true. The Army changed the test to include deadlifts, among other things. And it allows both women and older men to pass while lifting a lower weight. Young men have a higher standard because it's needed. An older man or woman that can deadlift X pounds is likely to be able to lift themselves and has demonstrated physical fitness. A young man that can only deadlift X pounds doesn't need to be as fit and could be overweight or unhealthy, so young men must be required to lift Y weight to prove fitness. Even bodyweight fitness tests, the difference between one and four pull-ups is not that great. If you can do a pull-up, you can pull yourself up when needed.

She will experience the same difficulty at a lower number that he will at a higher number. Therefore, for them to be equal in terms of effort and fitness, it‚Äôs necessary to have different pull-up standards.

Firstly it's done via a survey site, which means it's self reporting, which is less credible than an actual interview. 

The questions that are posed can in itself nudge the participants in answering in a certain way, and self-reporting is very susceptible to that.

The women that choose to participate may share some characteristics, for example they may have been dissatisfied with the division of labour in advance and therefore be interested in venting that frustration, hence skewing results. 

Secondly, and this is an important fact, the women that was included in the study had to meet the following criteria; ""cohabiting with someone who identifies as a man for six months or longer and living with a dependent 12 years of age or younger.""

This means that there is a child involved which means this is a study about mothers or foster mothers, not women in general. The distribution of household chores may be a proxy of the satisfaction with the quality and distribution of the tasks in child rearing.

I wouldn't consider results from a study with this method to be particularily good evidence.

Now let's look at the contributors and references.  


we've got something published in the 'Archives of Sexual behaviour' a peer-reviewed academic journal in sexology, which should have us worried for a start since sexology is tied pretty strongly to Socialism and feminism, not to mention has a nasty history of promoting child abuse. As a case in point the Archives founder Richard Green argued for attraction to minors being declassified as a mental illness and claimed it was found in ""a substantial minority of 'normal people'.  


as for the paper in question,  the contributing authors include 3, potentially 4  women as the authors one of whom is a representative of the Gender studies department of the Canadian Queen‚Äôs University, Kingston Ontario.

And a boatload of feminist studies in the references including the likes of:

>Wanna turn your lady on? Clean the house without being asked

That's a gross oversimplification.  Too many guys think just ""doing more"" is the answer on how to be more attractive to her to turn her on, but it's not.  Taken to the extreme, it ends up just being simp behavior which ends up backfiring and turning her off even more.   

It can work when the situation is that you **are already** attractive to her but the dishes piling up ends up basically being a c*&# blocker, because her mind drifts toward things that need done instead of sexy time.

j00e4zc,t3_zk39xp,2022-12-13 04:04:20,MensRights,"> Women perform approximately 2.5 more hours per day of household labor relative to men

What the fuck are they doing for two and half hours every single day?   How can that be possible?  So I had to look it up:

From the source that quote is from (emphasis mine):  [source if youre curious pdf warning](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2019/statcan/89-503-x/89-503-x54931-eng.pdf)

> The total work burden of women and men was equivalent in 2015 (7.8 and 7.6 hours, respectively). However, when unpaid work performed as a **simultaneous activity** was included, women‚Äôs total work burden was an average of 1.2 hours greater per day than men‚Äôs in 2010 (9.1 versus 7.9 hours).

Simultaneous activity means that for the last two surveys the researchers have allowed respondents to list multiple things they were doing at once.  So if you both vacuum and dust for 30 minutes, thats not 30 minutes of housework, thats 60 minutes of housework.  Or if you watch tv for 30 minutes while you put a pizza in the oven for 30 minutes, thats 30 minutes of primary activity and 30 minutes of housework as a secondary activity.  Pretty fucking clever huh?

Otherwise the authors wouldnt have anything to talk about but see by fudging the numbers a bit, you can get a woman's day to add up to about 30 hours.  So she has time to do about two and half hours of housework every day.  (this is the average between those with and without kids) Canadian houses must be goddamn immaculate.  I cant imagine how clean my house would be if I paid a housekeeper for just 1 of those hours every day.  I used to have one come in once a week and it was practically brand new feeling, but every fucking day?  It must be how billionaires live.

I dont know about women I wouldnt speak for them but if I felt it took me two and half hours to get my house in order... EVERY DAY.. of my life, I would be overwhelmed with what a giant fucking waste it all is.

I pointed out the double standard regarding how gender roles for men are still expected while they vanished for women and got downvoted to oblivion.

A poster said they would not want to date a lazy man child but that parent-child dynamic is supposedly okay when men are the parent. Men must adhere to their gender role by earning more, protecting their wives and doing all the dirty jobs at home like home and vehicle maintenance. If she calls him daddy it's okay. He must provide and protect like her dad did. But if she must cook and clean like mom did we have more of a problem with it.

It is hypocritical of women to want men to adhere to their gender role while expecting men to not want women to adhere to theirs. Imagine if a study came out saying men lose attraction to lazy wives who won't cook or clean. How well would that be received?

He also went to INSEAD, one of the top ranked business schools in the world and was such a good student he received the Henry Ford award for best student of the year /outstanding academic performance. The he went to Harvard for a business management program.
He was a professor in the Portuguese bank training institute and the Catholic University of Portugal while being the VP and head of capital markets.
In Brazil he was CEO of Banco Santander Brazil , also the chairman of the Santander Group. Then was CEO of Santander UK. 
He was recruited to turn Lloyd‚Äôs around.  He worked so hard he once stayed up for 5 days without sleeping and he had to take time off for a month for his mental health. Due to this His leadership at Lloyd‚Äôs  he made their business profitable again, and helped thousands in Britain needing loans. With increases in vehicle and mortgage loans(Lloyd‚Äôs is Britain‚Äôs biggest mortgage provider )by appealing more to account owners or customers.. And he helped fully restore the banking group to a private nongovernmental ownership at 900 million euros above the value they were paying back the government for. All while eradicating government regulation violations that were present at the the group. Gradually throughout the time of  all these achievements, his salary was sequentially increased. He didn‚Äôt start with that figure, he essentially saved the banking group and was awarded it.
He did so well in banking and leadership he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from: university of Edinburgh, university of Bath, and the university of Warwick. 
He was awarded the Gr√£-Cruz order of merit by Portugal. I don‚Äôt know much about Portuguese awards but from what I‚Äôve read just now, it‚Äôs one of the highest civil honors.
It seems like he earned his salary and I don‚Äôt know why they feel the need to portray him this way.

The biggest difference is the bonus and stocks/options portion... and those are all about negotiation. They're not handed out like candy.

Even if female CEOs do get less bonuses on average - you can't make the conclusion that it is due to systematic sexism. There are too many studies that show that women in general don't negotiate as much or ask for what they think they deserve. There've been multiple best sellers on the subject.

A non-executive director (abbreviated to non-exec, NED or NXD), independent director or external director is a member of the board of directors of a company or organisation, but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from executive directors, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as corporate officers). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.

It isn't twisting the article at all, it is seeing through the narrative being portrayed in the article. Board level roles are overwhelmingly pushed towards women in order to make boards more gender diverse. This is so obvious and consistent with all statistics about how board demographics have changed over the past decade or so that is [doesn't need sourcing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors#Encouraging_gender_diversity_on_corporate_boards)

If anything to do with exploitation it is mutual exploitation. They then started shitting on him and calling him a creep then left and gave him the cold shoulder after that. He actually got fired within the week because every woman there went to HR and made shit up about what he actually said.

TL,DR; A colleague (27M) joined our firm last year and since then he has had zero issues socialising with the guys we work with but always finds an excuse or says no to hanging out with the girls after work, even if we go out together as a whole he rarely talks to us and its making some of my friends uncomfortable.  
So early last year our firm hired Dan (27M). In the first few weeks he was really quiet and didn't talk much and that's just how we thought he was. Every conversation with him was short and to the point and never deviated from work, asides from pleasantries (Have a nice weekend etc). About 2 months in he started becoming a bit more friendly with the guys in our office and they would hang out every so often and have normal conversations. However, whenever any of the girls in the office tried to do so he would quickly change the conversation back to work or just not reply. Even now after a year of Dan working with us he straight up refuses to socialise with the girls in the office and it is making them feel uncomfortable. He avoids any discussion of himself outside of work related events and future plans and doesn't ask any of the girls either. Where as he is, what I can only assume, pretty good friends with the guys in the office.  
Even on work meals out to celebrate events he is only doing the bare minimum when it comes to conversation with the girls where again with the guys he talks to them like there is no problem whatsoever. I don't know if I'm overreacting but one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. Dan treats us like he treats clients we work with; cordial and strictly about business and its wearing thin now.  
Any advice is appreciated.""

I said I hope my wife is saying that to me when I am 65. Haha, right. It was just the two of us.

And most have a very difficult time handling disharmony.  If a man (or woman) is being too friendly or not friendly at all, its on an extreme, and becomes disharmonious.....creepy.

But most men are not like that.  And since they were boys they were mostly with boys and boys do not work so hard to manipulate a group into a group of harmonious equals.    Group dynamics are based more on what one can bring to the group, and social harmony is not much considered unless there is a serious problem, like constant fighting.

And between those two cultures, especially in a large work group,  there is no way to have balance.   One or the other has to dominate or there is confusion and trouble.

I am used to working in female dominated work environments....but even I am not always perfect at this.   I am well aware of my tendency to withdraw and seek out space to be alone, and I know that makes women feel they are being avoided (they are) and that its due to there being something wrong with them (there isn't...I just need privacy, space and quiet).    And while this is a source of tension, I know I am doing it and so I have strategies to make up for it.

So I don't really feel that anyone here is ""wrong"".   What I do feel is that those people can't work together because one is kind of too male and the other is kind of too female.

So what does it come down to?   It comes down to one feeling the need to complain and the other not feeling a need to complain.   So I would tell the complainer to go find a work environment more suited to her and wish her good luck.",TheNewMasterofTime,t2_v9f91r25,-2,0,reddit2

juktmdj,t3_113lgp5,2023-08-03 04:40:47,MensRights,"I almost think that the OP (the woman complaining about the man not talking to her) might be a trolling post.  However, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that this sort of thing would happen.  Hell, it probably happens a lot, but posting about it on Reddit (in relationship advice no less) seems a little suspicious.

I guess there's no way to know for sure.  The anonymous profile makes it a little bit suspect as well.

I will say that if this is real, then it's toxic femininity in the extreme.  I'm a tall handsome dude and I used to be really bad at talking to women so I just wouldn't do it and I think it did make women uncomfortable... not as uncomfortable as it made them when I did try to talk and came across like a bumbling dork who had no game.

I really had to learn to play to my strengths and eventually I did figure out how to be charming and to come across as desirable.  
Now as a man in my mid 30's most women are happy if I just leave them alone and I'm happy to oblige them.

I've been in a bunch of trainwreck relationships and my synopsis is that romantic relationships are highly overrated.  At least within certain groups in our population.  My stepbrother was MGTOW for years and he ended up marrying a girl from the Dominican republic who is ten years younger than him and very traditional.  I hope it works out for him in the long run.  He seems happy.  I haven't met his wife yet but from what he tells me about her, he seems to have made a wise choice for himself.  A woman like that is more in line with what he wanted, and he is the kind of man she wanted as well.

Damned if you do damned if you don't... Yes, in my experience, but maybe it's just our postmodern culture here in the west still getting it's footing.  We are growing and changing as a culture and unfortunately the strict political divides have put men and women on opposite sides sniping at one another in a culture war that is blown way out of proportion by social media and the like.

Men were creeps towards women for many many years in many many ways.  Now women are getting the upper hand in some ways and I think that without any institutional foundations in place to ease the transition to a more balanced social framework, the whole thing is erupting into chaos where no one seems to know how they are supposed to act towards one another.",Creatural_Shade,t2_jkd859gp,1,0,reddit2

Work from home has so many synergistic benefits, including reducing workplace sexual tension, but it tends to highlight the inherent friction in relationships through men and women spending more time together. Current society is very good at minimising male-female time spent together through external work, resulting in a home being more a place to sleep and eat than actual cohabitation. It's why Covid was so devastating as relationships had come to rely on that separation.

he4b20u,t1_he49k12,2021-09-24 18:06:39,MensRights,"> Interested to hear why that's historically incorrect? 

While his point is historically accurate, it is a [red herring](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Red-Herring) and has nothing to do with whether contemporary Western societies are ""patriarchal"" in that they are dominated by men as a cohort.

The social construct of gender as a whole is indeed rooted in historical patriarchy. However, [as I explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/o1z40x/cancel_culture_is_when_mods_remove_content_that/h2a3zli/) to a [fauxgressive](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/fauxgressive) (pseudoleftist) male feminist who argued that this means contemporary society, in which the gender construct still exists, is patriarchal:

> > Patriarchy does influence gender norms, and it has shaped it.
> 
> Sure, but this doesn't mean they're the same thing. Just because these norms were fashioned back when society was actually patriarchal does not mean it's retained these patriarchal features to this day.
> 
> ___
> 
> > Saying that ""gender norms =/= patriarchy"" isnt entirely correct, don't you think?
> 
> The term ""patriarchy"" is variously defined as ""[a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS930US931&sxsrf=ALeKk02ViA20wcziPW1r-Uein-esp3Tqkw:1624066183432&q=patriarchy+definition&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDu9H_xaLxAhVJTd8KHcvfAZoQBSgAegQIARAw&biw=1093&bih=526),"" ""[dominance of a society by men, or the values that uphold such dominance](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/patriarchy),"" ""[a society, system, or group in which men dominate women and have the power and authority](https://sociologydictionary.org/patriarchy/),"" etc. Additionally, as I explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/haivde/trans_people_of_reddit_would_you_still_be_trans/fv6m1ak/):
> 
> > ""gender"" is variously defined as ""[social norms, attitudes and activities that society deems more appropriate for one sex over another](https://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/),"" ""[attitudes, behaviors, norms, and roles that a society or culture associated with an individual‚Äôs sex](https://sociologydictionary.org/gender/),"" ""[roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men](https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender),"" etc. Basically, gender consists of sex-based behavioral norms, attitudes, and perceptions that govern male and female behavior.
> 
> Patriarchy simply refers to male social domination (of women), whereas gender norms regulate the behavior of and apply distinctive rules against both sexes. Not only can the latter exist sans patriarchy or even within a matriarchy, but the former can exist sans the latter, i.e., it's possible in principle for men to dominate women in a genderless society. There is no necessary connection between patriarchy and gender; again, they are not the same thing.

I don't feel targeted as a rapist or scum when looking at feminism. Nor am I threatened by the more mainstream goals of feminism (healthcare, wages, justice). Again I think a lot of people get caught up in the trap of listening to loudest and angriest individuals in a group and thinking they represent the entire group.

It's the Zero Sum attitude between the genders that I think gets my goat the most. Women gaining more agency and power in society does not mean men get less. When working for a more equal society we are hurting ourselves by working AGAINST women.

Think of the draft. No it's not right in my opinion that I had to sign up for selective service and women don't. The solution is not to drag women down and make them sign up for the draft. The solution is dismantle the draft for everyone. 

Likewise think of the justice system. Men get harsher sentences on average. The solution is not to give harsher sentences to women. The solution would be to remove bias (gender, racial, and economic) from the justice system.

OP's post was divisive in that way and I disagreed with him. The whole all men are an active part of the patriarchy didn't ring true for me. I don't think of feminism as anti men nor do I feel the need to stand in the way of women and their goals of equality.

We have a similar problem with paternity leave here in the UK - only about 18% of men claim their legal entitlement.

Example: my husband took a small share of his paternity entitlement, and paid for it with workplace bullying by his boss and uncompensated increased overtime.

There have been some high profile scandals, e.g. finding that the top female BBC presenters were being paid a lot less than their male counterparts, which came to light because the BBC was forced into transparency over salaries.

2. Staring is rude
Thats what i was taught growing up, so nobody should be staring at anyone, least of all where alcohol is involved, because two guys staring at one another in a bar or club is likely to result in a fight.

Staring ar someone lustfully is just creepy (be it a man at a woman or a woman at a man), it kinda reminds me of the smiler logo (alton towers ride, google it if you dont know of it)

So for me its unnatural, so i do see their point on harrassment as it is antisocial behaviour

But... How does that get policed
Ie how do you tell the difference between a malicious stair vs an innocent one

Examples:

25 yr old in a club, sees a girl across the club, he thinks he went to school with, but cant be sure as shes older and hair style, colour changed and might of put on a bit of weight, might of lost a bit so face has a 80% recemblance

What if he has a lot on his mind and just staring into space but happens to be a girl other side, he isnt intending to stare at her his just dazed

Now this one is illegal, he could be on drugs and monged, again his no threat to the girl, he isnt thinking of the girl, he just isnt concious of his actions because his drugged up (i suppose the club will welcome kicking him out for licence purposes)


What does amaze me is

that's why it's always going to be enabled by rich capitalist men at the very top pretending to be white knights who are for things like this bc it reinforces their dominance hierarchy and gives them permission to publicly shame to make examples of their competition when an opportunity comes up to spin a situation to make something innocent appear malevolent, bc it makes them more powerful as well. so it's a win win for women and rich men. 


bc obviously this bar owner who's implementing this system is immune from being kicked out of his own club no matter how many women he approaches or what actual sexual harassment he does. 


rules for thee but not for me is the history of our species, its important to remember that freedom and democracy are the exception not the rule. in every system except democracy, dumb rules exactly like this were used to keep the average guy down with stupid rules like royalty, caste systems and bullshit religious customs. and now the feminist agenda is trying to bring those same dumb types of customs to a free democratic state. 


it's no exaggeration to say bringing violence and the police state into nightclubs is an attack on men's freedom. creepy men who get handsy or aggressive and sexually harass women are already kicked out of clubs or pulled away by men like you and me bc 99% of men AREN'T criminals. only 1% is. so an unnecessary extra - ""don't even look or talk to them"" without asking rule on 100% of men that they're trying to enforce , is only made so they can abuse it on people they dislike.

""The fresh policy states that ""Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to 'pick up'"".


when people want to go to a place to not be picked up and hangout with only their friends and family - they go to a fucking restaurant where you get your own table and it's considered taboo for strangers to approach YOUR table and try to pick you up. 


restaurants are perfectly happy to serve your exclusive group of friends just drinks instead of food as long as you're paying their upcharges and everyone expects to be kicked out if they're disturbing guests with horniness bc it's not the place for it. that's what this ""club"" should switch to- a fucking restaurant.


but when people want to meet new strangers to pickup - they go to bars and clubs.


of course people are usually more subtle about it instead of being that obvious about it going up to each other saying - ""hey , we're at a bar/club instead of a restaurant , so we obviously both want to fuck, let's go fuck."" 


sure, some people do the direct approach with the ol ""do you wanna get out of here?"" - and sometimes it works tbh 


other times it doesn't work, so they're simply told no thank you. 


and 99% of the time that's fine and everyone goes on with their lives bc we all accept that we're adults and we risk the slight discomfort of being propositioned if you go to a place designed for propositions... what do they think alcohol - the sole beverage of nightclubs - is for ?



 it's for getting enough liquid courage to talk to strangers and ask each other out. how that's done is usually polices itself by what works individually- very good looking guys get success by doing pretty much anything. less good looking guys have to be a little more personable a little more creative and of course buying women alcohol helps them get success too.


but to single handedly attempt to police drunk people even TALKING to each other ? ya i don't see that ending well. why not just go to a Christian dance at that point? either their atmosphere is going to be so incredibly dry and boring that they'll make the already difficult low margin nightclub business even harder than it already is and go broke.


or it'll somehow work and people will come and try to play their stupid little feminist game to impress each other - for a whole 6 months while the fad is cool- and then move on to everywhere that's not so uptight. 


so it'll hopefully fail sooner than later. bc if this shit catches on it's the end of nightclub culture . creepy guys already get kicked out of nightclubs, they don't need to kick out regular guys just for shooting their shots where they should be shooting their shots.",mindset_grindset,t2_h9cqpgm0,14,0,reddit4

""We adopt a policy of ‚Äòalways believe the report‚Äô in cases of harassment and feeling unsafe.


""If we receive reports of any behaviour that has made someone feel uncomfortable, the reported individual will be removed from the venue and the police will be called.""


so basically - you're minding your own business walking up to get a drink, some girl happens to be in your eyeline, for any reason whatsoever she decides she's uncomfortable - maybe you didn't offer to buy her a drink and she's mad, maybe she doesn't like your race, maybe she just hates men- so she immediately waves the feminist white knight police over and no questions asked they jump you and kick you out AND call the police to send you to jail. 


my guess is if this happens a lot then the police will just hangout nearby or outside like they do at hotspots in my town, so it'll be very litteraly straight to jail if you get kicked out. my guess is they'll hire off duty cops for security anyway to basically skip the middle man so these pink vest white knight feminists are essentially police , so if you try to argue or drunkenly throw an elbow as a natural reaction before you know what's going on then you'll have the police throw the book at you for disorderly/resisting arrest. 


so essentially now at this club and others if it catches on- any woman regardless of income, mental health or believability- will have the direct and encouraged armed police state to enforce any ""uncomfortable"" feelings or false accusations they have out of spite or any reason whatsoever.

ilqhdkl,t1_ilq7tta,2022-08-25 14:08:57,MensRights,">Any man that goes to this club is an idiot.

I did a stint as a bouncer in a club during college, and let me tell you that any man that goes to a club is an idiot. They are pretty much money extraction pumps for thirsty guys. We had quotas of who got let in, and pretty much hot girls could walk right past the line. The logic here was that lots of guys would come to where the hot girls are at, and spend a fortune on drinks to try to get in their pants. The girls were aware of this and a lot would just plan on free drinks. Furthermore, some establishments would have paid girls there in the crowd with the express purpose of getting guys to buy them drinks.

So repeatedly Id see a PUA type 'work' a girl all night. She'd literally just walk away from the dude when the local football star showed up, and he'd seal the deal with a nod and grunt then leave with her. All in under half an hour... without buying single drink. Which was absolutely the worst scenario for the club, TBH.

As an aside a girl I was with in college had two roommates who were identical twins. They would openly brag about going out to the club and getting free drinks from guys. If he tried to get their number, they'd give him the number to the local pizza joint. They thought this was hilarious. 

Bottle service was a massive scam. Most of the time the venues just kept refilling the expensive import vodka bottles with cheap stuff from the local supermarket. The 'VIP' room is pretty much the same concept, but for suckers who are known to have loads of  money. Especially the ones that get boozed and cause damage, which they will charge the customer for at an up-charge. 

Even the parking was a scam. One of the venues I worked had VIP parking for $25 bucks. Pay your fee and the guy across the street would undo the little chain across the drive and you got a convenient parking space in a nice grass lot. Thing is they didn't own the lot, and the church that did sent them a cease and desist once they figured it out. 

Working the front doors, you'd better believe we had quota's. 10% minorities, 50% women, 40% white guys. Because for a thirsty dude you want it to appear that there's lots of hot available girls for him to buy drinks for, and if one doesn't pan out there's more you try your luck with. It's akin to slot machines, and I'd say the psychology is pretty much the same.",RunawayGrain,t2_i6tf1,42,0,reddit4

That's most of the West to some extent nowadays, but particularly English-speaking countries, which have it by far the worst imo with the exception of some outliers like Sweden which are equally messed up. Sure, other countries also have problems with feminism, and it has filtered into their discourse and some cases legal systems, but the Anglosphere nevertheless stands out for how pervasive its influence is, and how much it has come to influence nevermind political discussion, but simple daily interactions.

As an example of this phenomenon, France is often seen as a very liberal country, but surprisingly to some, not very feminist. I live in Canada, and it's quite common to see French people immigrate to Quebec (I've been to Quebec and speak passable French, but don't currently live there), and a sentiment that you hear again and again from French expats is that Quebec is far more liberal than France, and feminism ""is taken seriously"" and ""not a joke"". Of course, Quebec is not exactly an English-speaking region, but most people speak English to some extent and most of Montreal is fluent in English, although French is still the native language for most people, so the influence is not as great, and this is reflected in the attitudes. While Quebec is certainly feminist, I certainly find its women more feminine, open, and less angry and judgmental than English Canada's where a significant portion of women seem downright crazy.

Also, I immigrated myself as a kid from an Eastern European country and have always found English cultures to be rather cold, reserved, and restrained in comparison, with few people expressing their true feelings, creating an ideal environment for something like feminism to take hold and thrive. About the only English-speaking regions that are not fully crazy yet in terms of male-female interactions are the Deep South  and states like Florida, where there is a more conservative culture and there are more Hispanics, who are warmer, and tend to be less feminist. In most of the rest of the English-speaking world, normal interactions between the sexes are pretty much a thing of the past.",shydude92,t2_vi41h,1,0,reddit4

Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night.

If want to you feel sexy you can just as easily dress up that way when you're having a wine party, sleepover, whatever with just the girls. However guess what from all the girls I know, they don't dress up in the sake sexy clubbing clothes then. Nor does the majority of girls/women ...  
If it's just to feel sexy you can put on music at home and dance alone or with 1 or 2 friends, then there's no reason to go to that club.

The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind. 

However this is the crux of the problem.
You can either get angry at everyone when they keep on flirting/staring/whatever after you say you aren't interested or at no one. However enough girls will first get pissed at a guy they don't find attractive and then do the exact same with a guy they do find attractive but play hard to get. That's just dumb and inconsistent and even hypocrite behaviour. 
You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. Most guys in clubs just do what they had the most succes with ... Or often what they see others do that are successful. 
Either that behaviour is okay or it's not, shouldn't matter if it's done by person A or person B, assuming they are both strangers to you. However that's not what happens in practice and that's part of the problem ...

You want consent and no staring, then you need to be extremely consistent with that to everyone. However that's not going to happen in practice because most women and many many men, aren't consistent in that regard.

Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...",NwbieGD,t2_3kfvddv,18,0,reddit4

> Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night

Because men and women can like to look good for themselves, it can help you feel more confident, show off to friends, you‚Äôre dressing for the occasion. That‚Äôs ontop of the people who would also do it for attention

Dressing up at home isn‚Äôt an occasion, it‚Äôs not exciting, you aren‚Äôt really doing anything. If you‚Äôre going out clubbing, you want to look good, you want to dress up in clubbing attire, you want to dress to match the energy of the people and the music at the event you‚Äôre at. You can‚Äôt get that same energy or atmosphere in you‚Äôre basement with ¬£5 wine and a handful of friends, it‚Äôs a different vibe 

Not to mention how it doesn‚Äôt really matter, dressing up still isn‚Äôt an invitation for unwanted interactions. Dressing slutty isn‚Äôt ‚Äòasking for it‚Äô, because people are individuals and have their own reasons. Making grimy assumptions is the incorrect way to approach strangers. You probe, you get a response, and whatever response you receive you respect, simple. 


> The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind.

Why not? Personal preference or their individual choices absolutely should be respected. An invitation for one person isn‚Äôt an invitation for everyone, that‚Äôs common sense. If you ask someone not to stare or make it‚Äôs obvious you aren‚Äôt interested and they carry on, it‚Äôs unwanted, it‚Äôs making them uncomfortable, it not unreasonable for them to be told to stop

> You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. 

Doesn‚Äôt make it at all appropriate, and it‚Äôs not restricted to men, woman can be pushy too

> Either that behaviour is okay or it's not

Not really, it‚Äôs not black and white. You can want to interact with person A and not interact with person B, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that

> Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...

And that just boils down to respect

If you‚Äôre staring at someone for a prolonged period of time with no response, maybe you should take the hint? 

If you‚Äôre staring at someone and that attention is being reciprocated, equally you should take the hint and take it further. It‚Äôs just being respectful and having basic communication skills, understanding the ‚Äòyes‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äôs‚Äô",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-13,0,reddit4

VIP service is a scam. At best you have someone of the opinion that they are a big shot and don't want to be bothered by the public.

In fact there's plenty of places you probably also get a beating from security after being escorted out, even if you really did nothing just because they can, nobody will see anything and the police will do nothing because it's much easier for them to look away when a few testosterone junkies beat somebody up who didn't yet get the memo than having to respond to some bickering every ten minutes.

The only difference is that usually women didn't care what anybody was doing as long as they didn't intentionally interacted with them over and over. And why would they? However a policy this explicitly laying down that women can get men thrown out even if there is no evidence against them and there is no possibility that they won't be believed, and even the police gets involved, will only have one effect: it's going to encourage even women who never cared and still don't care to be ""empowered"" and ruin at least the night of somebody they think shouldn't be there for whatever reason. And if the insanity continues and we actually see laws pop up making ""staring"" and other thought crimes illegal, men will get their lives ruined even by just not looking good enough and standing ""too close"" to an ""empowered"" woman in a crowd of hundreds where dropping a needle would be impossible, like subways.",,,1,0,reddit4

You're right about this part. But the yes and nos aren't in English. These communication skills aren't at all 'basic' for some, especially men. It's a skill that needs to be developed and can only be developed through interaction, not being told do this, don't do that etc 
intellectually.


I think it would be good for all men to learn and develop these skills but there is no manual for what these yes and nos are. What is lacking is strong male role models and father's demonstrating how to be a man and how to understand and treat women, a lot of which is obviously thanks to feminism. But because of this, a lot of men don't know how to be men and aren't even allowed to be men except only when given permission from a woman.  'Explicit' permission that comes in indirect so called communication, just basically hints.

Dating and engaging women for men is becoming more and more like being a tomb raider. You have to decipher heiroglyphics you haven't been taught or shown how to read and any wrong turn is booby trapped. 

This is how it feels, basically. Yet women in traditional mens roles get to complain and have the world bend to them. That men aren't allowed exclusive spaces, that any women no matter how unwelcome they are have every right to not only exist in any space men can be, but demand that it must cater to them and overlook their deficiencies. E.g. women 'not being heard' or promoted in certain areas needs quotas to address any perceived imbalance against women. Why is it never asked that women just work on their competativeness and assertiveness.

In the dating and social world where men are typically disadvantaged, it's not hey, we have to be inclusive of everyone and their relative skill socially, like it is now with skills in the man's world. It's no, you're not reading the hints correctly and you have 'upset' a woman, get the fuck out you creep.

I think you are wrong about the feeling sexy part. It's not the vibe that makes you feel sexy, it's being desired. What you are wearing inspires desire in men and that in turn makes you feel sexy. If the same scenario of you and your friends hanging out happened, except a guy you were attracted to was coming, I imagine you would also want to look sexy, but sleepover sexy or whatever. The difference is the man to be masculine to make your time worth while being feminine, getting dressed up and looking good. Not the vibe.

So you having done your part in being feminine and dressing up to go out to the club a guy then has to be masculine and make the move. If you don't like the guy and his 'masculine' in the way he approached you, you can have him removed.


Imagine if there was a club where men could be 'offended' by a woman's appearance and have her removed, it would be extremely dehumanising and disgusting.

 But thats happening now apparently to men and it reflects I think a deeper truth. That a lot of women don't see men as human. I think the constant dehumanisation by women drives up the 'creepiness' of the guy. If a lot of women talked to men like humans and not rapists and murderers in waiting, a lot of men would be able to get over whatever it is that makes them appear 'creepy'

I think the position you are arguing from has some truth to it. But it's also shit from the other side is what I'm trying to portray.",,,2,0,reddit4

*So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago.*

While feminism is able to get away with passing off hate as progress the MRM cant do so. Remember they have the high ground.

Personally i think you should frame this as being pro male rather than anti feminist. 

By doing that if your experience became a major incident it would force people to ask whats wrong with helping men and rob feminists of the ability to cry about it being antifeminist.

Remove mention of feminism and they have to stretch to make it all about them.

Frame this as several companies turned your pro male shirt designs away and when people ask why you THEN you show them the termination letters you got and make sure to highlight that last one.

It puts feminists on the defensive to either disassociate from feminists like that and admit that being pro male is not inherently bad or they will remain silent and the public is left wondering why feminists are against pro male material.",Leinadro,t2_5xunv,78,0,reddit2

E.g. if a customer asks for a cake with a couple of dicks on it, the bakery may certainly dismiss them saying ""we won't make dick cakes"" so long as that's a fairly consistent policy. On the other hand, if they make dick cakes for every bachelorette party that walks through the door, it looks more like ""we won't make dick cakes *for you*,"" which is discriminatory.

While I find these shirts awfully tame and assume anyone who disagrees with them is a terrible person, I have no doubt that the business does plenty of business with men, and thus it would be reeeaally hard to make a case that their refusal to print a certain slogan stems from demographic discrimination. 

No, they just have stupid politics, and were willing to lose money for it. If the shirts get printed, that money will go to a business less intent on opposing gender equality. I count this as a win, even if it came with some inconvenience.",tectonic9,t2_9zewj,9,0,reddit2

E.g. if a customer asks for a cake with a couple of dicks on it, the bakery may certainly dismiss them saying ""we won't make dick cakes"" so long as that's a fairly consistent policy.

Except, there's a far cry from dicks on a cake, which is arguably considered vulgar, and the sort of shirts OP wanted to print. 

>On the other hand, if they make dick cakes for every bachelorette party that walks through the door, it looks more like ""we won't make dick cakes for you,"" which is discriminatory.

I think the Civil Rights Act only covers discrimination based on specific criteria, such as sex, race, religion, etc. I could be wrong. I'm not a lawyer. If I'm right in my understanding, then being discriminatory against an individual is okay, just not okay if it's fueled by a larger discriminatory context covered under the CRA.

>I have no doubt that the business does plenty of business with men, and thus it would be reeeaally hard to make a case that their refusal to print a certain slogan stems from demographic discrimination.

You're probably right. But flip the script. What if a MRA guy owned a silk screening place, and a feminist wanted to print some innocuous women empowerment shirts, but the guy refused because he found it offensive because he was an MRA. I think you'd see outrage, even if the guy came out and said, ""Hey, I sell to women all the time."" But is there a case there? Dunno.

As far as my personal politics, I believe any business should have the right to refuse doing business with anyone for any reason, but fair is fair.

cu1ap0l,t1_cu198uj,2015-08-13 05:31:24,MensRights,"Could be. Is that evidence of illegal discrimination? Doubt it. Imagine a few ways that a printing business might respond to customers:

* ""We print shirts for female clients but not male clients."" - Discriminatory, grounds for lawsuit.

* ""We print pro-woman slogans for female clients but not male clients"" - Discriminatory, grounds for lawsuit.

* ""We print pro-woman slogans for *any client,* but never pro-man slogans or pro-equality slogans."" - Does not suggest illegal discrimination. Political views are not a protected class, and if the job is refused on the grounds of *content,* that's very different than if it's refused on grounds of gender or race. 

Naturally, this goes back to the gay cake thing. Couldn't a baker make a case that they gladly serve gay clients, but that they are politically/religiously/personally opposed to content promoting gay marriage, and thus never make gay-themed wedding cakes for *any* client, gay or straight? Not a lawyer, but I'd think that could be a consistent, non-discriminatory position, though they might have an uphill battle demonstrating it, particularly with gay marriage now legally equivalent to straight marriage. 

It's risky territory, because further down the slippery slope is the rural pharmacist who won't sell Plan B because of religious scruples.

Because stuff like this is actually pretty difficult to track back to someone. Swatting has been a growing issue in the gaming community for a while now (popular CS:GO players have been swatted while livestreaming several times before) and there really isn't much the cops can do about it. They show up at the victims house, look around, and after a while they realize that they've been played, by which time the swatter has hung up the payphone and gone home.

Up here in Canada, there was recently a case where [some teenage asshat](http://www.theprovince.com/news/Coquitlam+teen+swatter+jailed+told+grow/11201987/story.html) got busted for swatting and sending fake bomb threats (even to Disneyland! Who the fuck goes after Disneyland?!), and it made national news! People need to learn that using the police as a weapon is not ok in *any* context.

As for mail, it's easy to make it completely untraceable. Just don't write your home address on a package when you send it, and wear gloves while handling it if you want to be really sure that nobody can trace it back to you.

You have apparently never gotten a ticket. If you get a ticket, you can go to a small court hearing to contest the ticket (and 50% of the time the cop won't bother showing up, so it gets dropped right away), or you can just mail in a cheque or pay with a credit card. You don't even need to go into court to pay the fine. As for ""on threat of greater violence,"" you're a paranoid asshat. Nobody ever got beaten up by a cop because they didn't pay a speeding ticket.

> From the moment they flash their lights / turn on their siren, they're threatening the use of escalating physical force.

No, flashing their lights or turning on the siren is just telling the person in the other car to pull over. It could be because they were speeding, it could be because their tail light was out, or it could be because the cop noticed their fuel door was open and wanted to let them know. It's no more threatening than someone saying ""Excuse me"" to you on the street. It could be leading up to a mugging, or they could just want to tell you that you dropped your wallet.

In this article the decision to only empliyee women is sexist. My experience has been a result of a lack of men being interested in the field of developing female leadership. Over the years, I have experienced and witnessed examples that are almost verbatim to what was described in this article. I would also add that in some industries the straight vs lesbian cliques can be an enormous problem. I have worked with many women who have a growth mindset around a personal topic and lack any willingness to grow when it comes to supporting their fellow female coworkers. Instead they pretend to be kind in the office then talk shit about the other person behind their back daily with very little work being completed. This behavior can go on for years. You must be willing to find the strength to remove yourself from the situation and return to a male-dominated workforce that has balance, reduced gossip, competition and rational minded employees instead of overly emotional large groups of women.

Our women VP's are smart and assertive, personal drama rarely ever comes into play. Everything you would want in a employee. Really this is not a gender issue.

As a HR consultant, I would hazard to guess this CEO was too inexperienced to manage people. Employees generally look to their bosses on how to behave. It is actually pretty amazing how much a leader can influence the way things are run. If you are not cracking down on toxic behaviors it tends to create an environment where their employees believe it is okay to behave any way they want.

From the article, it was clear that she had no control over anyone, even her deputy manager:

>My deputy, Sarah, the general manager, first showed how much style mattered when she advertised for an office assistant and **refused to hire the best-qualified girl because she could not distinguish Missoni from Marc Jacobs**. This girl would have been making tea and running errands. **But I didn't challenge the decision not to hire her because I had a policy of picking my battles carefully.**

In any other field, these people would be reprimanded, then fired. As owner of the company she is the only person who has the power to stop this kind of bullshit.

cqxzzvc,t1_cqx771f,2015-05-04 15:04:13,MensRights,"Respectfully, I disagree. I don't expect to change your mind, but I will explain mine:

A) This example does not prove that all-women companies fail because of their gender exclusivity. Maybe (maybe!) this one failed because of the infighting described, but to say that the infighting was a result of hiring all-women is sexist. I could create a company of exclusively women that would be monumentally successful, and I could create a company of exclusively men that would be monumentally successful. This is because the success of the company is based on the individuals, not their gender. To claim otherwise is sexist, and inaccurate.

B) By holding this up as an example of ""see-told-you-so"" to feminists we weaken our message of equality. why? Because inevitably there will be a successful all-women company, and then we will have to acknowledge that with the same fervor that we have 
clung to this one. And the truth is that it doesn't matter (see point A) and has nothing to do with mens rights. Yet in some peoples minds it will be a point against us. By sticking to the main point of our narrative - equal rights for men - instead of trying to whack-a-mole everything that feminists could say we are more immune to this.

B) No ones rights are harmed by this. Some overzealous and confused men's rights adherent will say ""But men didn't have an opportunity to be hired!"" Yes, you are right technically. But we have a much more important and bigger fight on our hands then a small ~5 person company and what they choose to do. If it was an enterprise then yes, it would be an issue, but there are already laws to prevent that. I suggest you refocus your priorities. Men and boys are being killed right now over seas in wars. They are being raped with no community support. Right now there are way more homeless men on the streets in a city near you. Right now more males are being incarcerated for crimes that females are walking from. Talking about a small businesses hiring methodology in light of what is really important makes us look trivial, and the problem of equal rights for men is not trivial.

>The __pound sterling__ (symbol: [¬£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sign); [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217): __GBP__), commonly known simply as the __pound__, is the official [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency) of the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey), [Guernsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey), the [Isle of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man), [South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands), the [British Antarctic Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Antarctic_Territory),  and [Tristan da Cunha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha).  It is subdivided into 100 *pence* (singular: *penny*). A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the *[pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(currency\))*. At various times, the pound sterling was [commodity money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money) or bank notes backed by silver or gold, but it is currently [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), backed only by the economy in the areas where it is accepted. The pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use and which has been in continuous usage since its inception.

Let's not pretend, however, that this isn't a significantly gendered issue.  Even in households where there's no kids, if there's one person at home not earning an income, it's over twice as likely to be a woman than a man.  Add in kids, and that ratio skyrockets in favour of women.  This is a luxury choice *women* get to make (and that white knights willingly hand them - no offense) that men largely do not have available to them. 

We all know the odd single Dad and the stigma that father faces, we know the fight in our legislatures and in the media over shared parenting, and we know that the overwhelming majority of spousal support is paid by men to women.  Our society is plenty pleased to let men financially support women at the moment, and that's not ""equality"" in any shape or form. Women love the earnings gap conversation, but they don't love the single biggest driver of it, because it would mean having to get off their collective asses. My province's earning's gap is double the national average, and that's because we have the oil patch paying men so well that their wives and girlfriends opt not to work at higher rates than the rest of Canada.

You have more patience than I do, clearly.

Excuse me, that is a vile lie.       
1. Generally, it is women only who get that choice; as Farrell has said, women have the choice to work full-time, work part-time, or stay at home; men have the choice to work full-time, work full-time, or work full-time.      
2. That's obviously not equal rights, but will not change soon; female hypergamy will ensure men stay in their wage-slave place.

In recent years, the stress related illnesses men used to die from are now taking the lives of women in droves, and many feminists have suddenly ""discovered"" the idea that a woman working from home is now an acceptable role for a woman if she chooses it. 

I have a wonderful wife who has a Ph.D. and makes as much as I do at a local university. I'm very proud of her. However, for 1/2 a year I was the bread-earner. She wanted to go back home after the birth of our second son, and I agreed and worked under a load of stress that culminated in our discovering our child had a medical condition that would require over $170,000 in medical costs. The same week we found out, I got laid off. The stress was killing me and finding a job was our priority as a family. Luckily we both found something quickly, but the result was me being left with an emotional scar and a fear of being laid off that has followed me for a long time.

My wife has a lot of pressure from other women in her family who work from home to do things she just doesn't have time to do (parties, church stuff, vacations, etc.) I work from home a lot (developer and consultant), and she gets a lot of negative comments from her family and friend about my taking on the primary caretaker role for our kids.

In a good partnership, no one should be a parasite, but among the many, many passes women get in our society is the idea that a ""man should take care of his woman"" even if she doesn't do anything. My brother-in-law recently went through a divorce with a woman who had that attitude. She found someone else to be a bigger ""sugar-daddy"" for her.

Again it is a choice we made to see that our many children were well raised and got the best start in life. As the last one has been getting older she has started volunteering and working part time at various jobs. There are some positions where they hire volunteers and pay them as a way to compensate them for the hours they work free of charge. It's essentially a way to get back into the work force full time and start earning a decent salary; people seem to prefer to hire workers who are known qualities in the community. The youngest is in full time school now so she is heading back to work full time. It's really a matter of necessity as I am expecting to take a significant pay cut for medical reasons and have to leave my current job in the military in the next 2-4 years.

Modern feminism or 3rd/4th wave feminism is indeed, sadly, and poisonously so. The ideal of feminism is equal rights for men and women under the law, in the home and in the workplace. That's not totally crazy. Just because there are so few that live up to the ideal, doesn't make it as an idea completely invalid.

the reason this is the case is because women are born inferior to men. that's why they have never been able to compete evenly with men for the last 10000 years of human history. so before it was kinda ok because women were inferior and they knew it and men knew it. men accepted it and men trade their suppport for submission. now suddenly women are saying they're actually equal to men and the only reason they lose is because men are oppressive them. well pray tell, how does a group of people who have a 50% population ratio manage to oppress the other 50% if they were actually equals? 

so now it's fucking irritating what they're doing. they're gone way too far and try to set up laws that give them a competitive advantage ALL THE WHILE saying they are equals. then they step outside into the dating world and can only date up because they cant stand a man beneath them. if they have a college degree, all men without one is invisible to them. they sleep around and only get wet for alpha men leaving the rest to be supporters in their old age.

My wife was feminist, as were most of her friends and workmates.  So I got to see several feminist marriages from up close.  

I've had a few GFs who identified as feminist, and others were sympathetic to feminist ideas.  So I've been around a bunch of feminists over the last 35 years of my adult life.   

As for gender roles, when I was struggling in a job my wife repeatedly suggested that I stay home and look after our young son while she supported the household.  (When we got together with the intention of mating for life I was unemployed with no assets, I'd just graduated in my early 30s.  She had a career and a house.)  

Another small example.  The common complaint about paying for dates for women?   I've not paid for a single date or drink for a woman in my life.  It has never been expected.  And if you tried to pay for a date with the feminist women I've known I don't think many would let you, I've heard that described as ""creepy"".

Because the system doesn't allow him the agency he needs to get to a better place. He divorces her, and he loses half of his stuff (or more), risks having to pay her in the future with alimony (and failure to do so risks jail time), and overall has a higher chance of things getting much worse than better.

When /r/mensrights talk about women's agency within sexual assault and domestic violence cases, it comes with the package that there is a system that also allows them to exercise that agency. There are a plethora of help programs, both legal and support, for both sexual assault and domestic violence.

In AITA
A man is the asshole for dating a single mom and wanting alone time away from the child but a woman dating a single dad who doesn't want to move in with him because she isn't interested in having a child around is fine because they want different things in life.

In relationship advice
I saw people performing mental gymnastics again to defend a woman who would slam cupboard and room doors when upset.


In all subs
A man expressing boundaries is controlling and manipulative but a woman doing it is protecting her mental health.
A man clearly depressed is useless and needs to be kicked out and is a loser but woman with depression needs to see a therapist and needs help immediately.
A woman being abusive to a man needs help because she is obviously having mental issues but a woman who is receiving abuse needs to leave immediately.
Any couple with a toddler having issues and the woman has ppd regardless even if op says the she has seen professionals and hasn't been diagnosed with it

And post anything MRA and be prepared to get hell rained upon you

Edit:

There's a post on Relationships about a guy whose wife is constantly breaking or damaging stuff and he was fed up... Below is the top comment

>Ask her how this happens? Maybe she has an underlying medical issue that is making her lose control in her movements, or maybe she has attention deficit issues. These things can be worked out if you find out what is causing it and work on finding a solution.

Now reverse the genders, the man would be called abusive, dangerous, the guy is careless and needs to pay for the damage and she needs to leave him because he obviously doesn't respect her or her belongings.

Always remember that the surveys that women respond to about household divisions of labor are self-reported. One of feminists' favorite surveys reports the following:

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 45 minutes a day cleaning.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 23 minutes a day shopping.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 8 minutes a day helping children with homework.

Their favourite is post partum depression. That woman can abuse her partner, her child, be lazy and negligent, but it isn't her fault!

They diagnose her like the medical experts we all know they are and absolve her from all responsibility.

By contrast, a man who is having a tough time adjusting to parenthood should just man up, have greater empathy for his partner, offer HER more support and stop complaining.

I know that there is growing sexlessness among young men but they are also marrying far less when they get older and do get into relationships (usually in their 30s). And I don't blame them for not wanting to take on these burdens when the expectation is they just labour for a lifestyle she wants, labour for the kids she primarily desires, and must labour even more so she *feels* like there is a proper split in domestic duties (that actually favour her).

There is no expectation placed on women in the same way and to suggest it is sexist.

On those subs a woman just has to cry unfairness and she gets support. A man must come in with multiple examples to show as evidence he is being slighted and still someone will try to make it seem like the woman is not to blame.",CentralAdmin,t2_5e4v852d,15,0,reddit2

Liberalism is different from leftism in that liberalism is a globalist pro-capitalist ideology, and leftism is a spectrum of a myriad of competing radical and moderate ideas (Most left-wing ideologies focus on economic issues such as labor unions, worker's rights, democratic workplaces, regulated economies, welfare and social programs, etc)

> Leftists swing to the totalitarian right when there stupid ideas don't work and people don't obey. 

Leftism can either be democratic, or authoritarian, just like rightism. Rightism can cover from Social Libertarianism and Constitutional Monarchism, to State Capitalism and Nazism. Similarly varied is leftism. From Social Democracy and Unionism to Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism.

> Genocide usually follows.

Not all left-wing countries have genocides, you're confusing them with communist ones. (USSR with Ukrainians and Germans, China with Uyghurs, Pol-Potism with intellectuals, etc)

> Look at how the Democrats and Hillary reacted to Trump winning they basically poisoned the pussy well. Started the Me2 blackmail movement. They falsely accuse their political opponents and attack their mental health.

American politics isn't everything, bud. Plus, the Democrats are just more moderate capitalists, not communists or socialists. They agree on almost everything except for notably their social policy (identity politics, feminism, gender issues, etc)

Raising any concern of bias is a ""Protected Act"" and any retaliation is Victimisation and actionable through both courts and employment tribunals. 

When raising any concern it is wise to state that you are Undertaking a ""**Protected Act - Section 27 The Equality Act 2010**"", as this serves notice to any party that they are obliged to protect you from any form of Retaliation, Harassment etc as they can find themselves being sued. 

**[27 Victimisation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/27)**

(1) A person (A) victimises another person (B) **if A subjects B to a detriment** because‚Äî

... (b) **A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.**

(2) **Each of the following is a protected act**‚Äî

...(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

...(b) giving evidence or information in connection with proceedings under this Act;

In the US, those things are segregated by gender but, with the exception being the two shelters, all of the others have equivalencies for both genders. The boy scouts have girl scouts. Schools have been sued many times for having a male team sport and no female equivalent. Even with the exceptions, it's not discrimination per se. It's an attempt to improve utilization.

That being said, in both the UK and the US there is still a ton of gender bias in favor of one sex or the other, a gigantic amount. I doubt that there's a university that exists that doesn't offer some level of sponsorship for women going into STEM fields that are unavailable to men.

Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen. OP's situation is a case in point. Worse still, if he did try to press the issue legally, he's likely to fail. Those laws are institutionalized to protect *women* not men. Men are only included so that the law seems fair. The laws are rarely ever practiced that way. Don't believe me?

For example, the concept POSITIVE ACTION: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action

>In Europe, positive action, roughly synonymous with affirmative action, is the promotion of people based on belonging to non majority identity groups in the workplace, educational institutions and positions in society, purportedly without prejudicing the criteria of selection by merit. In the United Kingdom in Harriet Harman's Equality Act 2010 ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

Now, I'm not 100% sure whether this applies specifically to this situation. But people here went all in on complete blanket statements about discrimination (""it's the same for boys and girls""), and now suddenly you are completely certain that this particular section provides the only answer.

I am going to sound very negative with what I'll say next, but please understand that I just want you to realize where you stand. I hope like hell that you are completely exonerated in this case.

With that said, I hate to tell you this, but in your case, as a male being accused in the workplace of something, it's not like an actual court case.

If a woman is making a complaint, she is automatically believed, and it is up to you to DISPROVE her allegation. You will have a considerably more difficult job DISPROVING something that is believed without any actual proof required for that belief. Make no mistake, it will be on YOUR shoulders to prove your innocense, not on her or HR's shoulders to attempt to prove your guilt. That's just how this shit works. It's not fair, it's not even reasonable, but it is what it is.

Further, the absence of photos in your picture gallery doesn't prove you never took a picture, it only proves that it's not readily visible there right now. Forensic analysis of your phone could provide exonerating evidence.

No offense, but you're probably not rich enough or well known enough for your employer to dig that deeply into the case - honest to God, I'm not breaking your balls, I'm just saying. People on the tier of famous athletes, or huge business magnates are rich/famous enough to have forensic examination of their devices done to sort out those kinds of accusations.If HR decies they like her story, there's nothing you can do. They may not fire you for this particular situation because they know they would open themselves up to a potential lawsuit, but they may fire you for some other reason, or present you with the ultimatum of resigning or being fired ""for cause"".

Even if HR drops the whole thing, unless they discipline the false accuser, you will face the stigma of this for the rest of your time at this company. That female who accused you will tell her bosses that she is uncomfortable working on projects with you, and they will tell your bosses, and the whole issue of keeping you two separated will be annoying. Meanwhile, that woman is telling other females her bullshit story, and they will say the same things to their bosses and so on and so forth.

So... best case for you is that they believe you, and discipline her and she leaves. Unless that happens, you probably need to get your resume out there.

I would complain that company policy mandates that HR harass you and investigate you when there is no evidence at all. 

When I say no evidence what I mean is the testimony given was the picture was taken of someone at work but all they saw was the back of a camera, they did not see the other side. They did not see the photo app up, they did not see him press the picture button. They couldn't if the camera was faced at them to take their picture.

All they have is someone holding a camera nearby and then putting it away.

So with conclusively no evidence HR then told him his job was at risk for doing something they have no evidence of. After that, they ignored my attempt to protect myself by providing actual evidence of the claimed event not happening.

It is the legal responsibility of the company to provide a safe and harassment-free workplace and that is going to be very difficult when HR is the one doing the harassment.

While  I know I come across as extremely abrasive and arrogant in any sort of debate situation, I'm actually a very humble and friendly person that always assumes the best of people I interact with. At bare minimum  I assume that others are of the same level of knowledge, intelligence and experience as me... if they demonstrate otherwise then my rating of them drops as needed.

.... for me to have identified such enormous groups as SJWs/feminists as being the absolute bottom of the barrel, putrid scoriae humans, took a LOT of very consistent stupidity from a lot of people in the top and street level. So it is somewhat disconcerting to me, even if I don't show it, that such a profound level of idiocy can aglomerate and be effective.

> That's not what they really want. That's why it's not Marxism. They want a better outcome than anyone else without working for it. Put simply, they want female supremacy.

You are correct.

Feminism is not marxism, I was not clear in this. My point was that feminism as an ideology was founded on marxist principles and then adapted towards , as you have noted, female supremacy. What the feminists lifted is undeniable.",TheMythof_Feminism,t2_q0mv3,0,0,reddit1

My father was a ladies man, a real vag slayer type. He told me that women are strongly receptive to the environment men create around them. I believe he has a point and that women, to some degree, can be molded to be less like other women and closer to what the ""ideal"" (I.e. not horrible) is. 

As a quick anecdote, in the past , almost a month or so, I had been talking to a girl that I met at work, not a coworker where I work but is dropping by semi regularly for a project that is being done.

Anyway, we really hit it off, she is cute and seemed like a girl I could really invest in.... yesterday I went out drinking with a buddy of mine. Turns out he met her sometime ago, he had pictures to prove it. Apparently she's a massive slut and he did her every way he could, in every place he could.... I looked into it and everything indicates that she was, and probably still is, incredibly slutty. 

I feel like an idiot for thinking I had found a unicorn; A cute, hard working, non-hyper entitled girl that could hold a conversation quite skillfully.... I legitimately don't know how I could have been so foolish as to believe and hope in something like that.... sigh.

So while I agree with you that maybe this subreddit should be for strict activism, it is refreshing to you just express a very observable and widespread opinion (that women gossip heavily) without being called a woman hater. But of course there are always people like you to insinuate that we are XOXO

But one can also argue that it is a mens rights issue (although a small one) because it discusses gendered behaviour. When one gender performs an action it has a reaction on the other one. 

For example it used to be common place amongst men to use pretty aggressive language when talking to one another (""come on get that report done so we can do to the pub, you lazy shit""). Men do not mind and it is quite common. Of course this does not work well for  women in the workplace,who on average prefer more neutral language.

Similarly when women gossip and bully themselves but also form solidarity together in public effects the way men interact with them in teams. for example I had to sit through a painfully bad presentation presented by a female college in my team meeting, most of the team are female. When I or my other male team member showed any sign of constructive criticism we were shunned and all the female team members showered the presenter in compliments.

Maybe women, like men, need to adapt their most natural behaviour in the workplace in order to achieve a more functional team structure, or maybe i need to learn the ways of the queen bee and start validating and gossiping too. Who knows...

But as soon as they have a chance to speak to one another they first validate each other in order to demonstrate they are part of the same group, then through this validation a social status hierarchy is established and a queen bee emerges. These groups tend to agree on everything by consensus and tend not to fight amongst themselves publicly. Later the group splits off into small cliques and then a all bitch war begins where different women are covertly attacking or protecting the queen bee in a effort to establish themselves in the hierarchy.

The women... Oh the women. They were so sure that they would beat the men out because girl power! We know how to work as a team and the men will all try to be independent and do their own thing. They said the men would start fighting with each other and nothing would be accomplished. Guess what happened when it came time to put up or shut up? 

They failed, miserably. They almost immediately started fighting with each other, calling each other names, and gossiping about their teammates. They never got a shelter built, and they never found any food. By the end of the second day, the women's team was reduced to blubbering, crying, and complaining about how unfair and hard it was. I believe they had to end the event early for them as they didn't ever get shelter or food and were a real safety risk to themselves.

dy2bi22,t1_dy21bbx,2018-04-27 15:23:39,MensRights,"There are some interesting paradoxes at play.   

Take a small-to-medium sized group of men and set them to some task and you'll find a degree of cooperation second to none.   They will naturally organize themselves into hierarchies of ability* without the need to create leaders/rulers, and an honor system will develop.   If disputes arise they will be solved quickly, sometimes (though not usually) with physical violence, after which the competing parties will [make up](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).   

Take a group of women and set them to some task and you will find a long, drawn out attempt to establish consensus about the most trivial of matters, combined with a great deal of passive-aggressiveness, malicious gossiping and repeated cycles of emotional turmoil.   Conflicts often take the form of Machiavellian social violence.

But what happens when you put the two sexes together?  

In the case of men, competition dramatically increases.  In the case of women, *solidarity* dramatically increases.   So the exact opposite effects for either sex.   If one woman is harmed it is viewed as an attack on ""all women"", whereas if one man is harmed it is viewed as an attack only on that individual man.   

Whereas men band together to protect women (sometimes at the expense of female autonomy), women band together in solidarity *against* men, evidently for safety and protection.   This would seem to be a protective evolutionary mechanism that, with the feminist movement, has now become profoundly dangerous.   

*Hierarchies of ability are different than institutional hierarchies.   The former are meritocratic and do not require coercion; different people are better at different things, so it makes sense for people to have different specialities.   Institutional hierarchies are usually based on violence and coercion, though may also include meritocratic elements.",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,22,0,reddit2

If you're somebody who has been targeted by these sorts of groups in your lifetime, you'll see what I'm talking immediately.

If you see people who don't hang out with others or interact with other people there's usually a reason for it. Some people just want their own space which is totally fine, but particularly with larger societies it can end up with people self-segregating to the point that they don't even realise what the rest of the world thinks of them and have little knowledge of the outside world.

Especially the last point,  I always see it in the subreddits about abusive relationships or women on women sexual assault.

Something you would almost never see if the perpetrator is a man. Hell, even the comments are different between the cases where the assailant is a male and where the assailant is a female.

Now being integrated into greater society is great but in greater society non feminist positions are generally undervalued disallowed or simply shouted down.

dy303n6,t1_dy2estw,2018-04-27 21:23:21,MensRights,"> Why are ""feminists"" grouped into one large group and not considered to be individuals?

It's a collective label. It is a term that describes a group of people who share a similiar ideology.

They are grouped together because they are, in fact a group.

>There's no memo that goes out and there's no specific person calling the shots.

Then the group designation is meaningless. if all feminists are only individuals with no ""memo"" or central ideology then the label is completely useless and serves no purpose because it conveys no useful information about the person or group. 

In order for the word to have meaning there have to be distinctions and ways of measuring what is and is not a feminist. A term that can mean anything, means nothing.

This is a rhetorical scam called a motte and bailey doctrine which feminists will attempt to pull all of the time. They will claim that feminism is not a hivemind or has no teachings/dogma/central ideas/etc as a means of deflecting criticism for the bad things done by their group (we'll call this proposition A). Then they will turn around and make claims about how feminism fought for the vote for the women, or how feminism is all about equality, or feminists don't hate men, etc. (Proposition B).

Note that both of these claims are contradictory. If there are no central ideas or tenets of feminism and it is all just individuals then feminism cannot be credited with women getting the vote, nor can they say that feminists don't hate men or anything else.

The reason they do this is because if feminism is portrayed as a group of individuals then the ideology cannot be held to any standard and it gives them a way out for any responsibility for the things that they do. The downside to this however is that, as I mentioned, it renders the entire concept and authority of feminism useless and irrelevant.

Which is why they will quickly switch to the other side when they need to speak with authority. That however opens them up to being disproved and held to standards. Which is then they quickly retreat back into ""Feminism is just about equality"" or ""There are many different ways of being a feminist"".

It's the typical behaviour or any cult or religion when it gets called out on it's doctrines or dogmas and their effects.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV5JoFLnikg

>There is no vanguard feminist organization.

There is, however, a central ideology and core tenets adopted by nearly all feminists. There are mountains of feminists texts and scholarly work one can read. You can look at the most supported and vaunted feminists and see what they say, advocate for and think, you can look at the organizations.

You can look at all of feminism and see VERY clearly what their goal is and what their ideology stands for and represents.

My choice to involve a female lawyer who I met through a family member (one of his in-laws) was a mistake on my part I admit.

>There are no billionaires in the legislature you realize, but you'd have to really stretch to argue that this means they don't have power and only have ""Influence"". They control society through lobbying, and as the post notes, women have the second largest lobbying complex in the world devoted to their interests. This is the key part:  
>  
>Men do not have such a lobby. The interests lobbied for are stuff like war, oil, and so on. In the same way as we are oppressed by oligarchs abusing campaign finance and so on by those organizations forcing through their special interests at everyone elses expense, feminism oppresses men by forcing through womens interests at the expense of men.  
>  
>The trick you are pulling is to argue that because men fill the roles of ""Oil lobbyist"", that makes them balanced out with women holding the role of ""Lobbyist for women"", but that's simply not the case. The oil lobbyist cannot use the funds at their disposal to begin arguing for mens issues. They can use them to argue for the interests of the oil company, and that's pretty much it.  
>  
>I also think the actual sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists is largely irrelevant.

So. Men when they lobby act on behalf of their interest group, individuals of which are both men and women, at the expense of another group, individuals of which are both men and women. That is, men's lobbying isn't gendered. Women, however, can uniquely lobby in favour of women at the expense of men. That gives women, specifically, additional advocacy on their behalf. Thus, that's more power for them.

In other words it doesn't matter if the lobbyists for any given cause are all men so long as they represent the interests of a group that's comprised of both men and women at the expense of a group comprised of both men and women. Women aren't unrepresented nor are they uniquely targeted simply due to the lobbyists themselves being male. But men are most definitely not represented at all by feminist lobbying - in fact, the lobbying is done for the benefit of women at the expense of men. And men have no such male equivalent.

Anyway you're basically arguing from the perspective of what the lobbyists ultimately represent and how much power this ultimately affords each sex instead of the sex of the lobbyists themselves or the sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists. Your interlocutor in that thread almost exclusively focuses on the sex of the lobbyists and the sex of the politicians without really considering what they stand for, which I think is a myopic take.

I think Karen Straughan noted this behaviour is something paralleled in chimpanzees, too - males form coalitions to enforce the interests of their entire group onto out-groups. Females form coalitions to enforce the interests of females on the group. Males have no such ""male coalition"" for males.",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,3,0,reddit3

They might be great at managing admin or financial staff etc., but those skills don't transfer to managing multifaceted disciplines.

Correct and as I said above, someone can be an excellent manager in one discipline and an absolute disaster in another.

Yup, what you should have done (*for the future or in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation*) is the following:

* Document everything, record every conversation that you can, print out every email & keep a written daily record (get a journal with number pages that can‚Äôt be removed & each day write the date & list every event which happened that day - it is actually admissible in court as supporting evidence).

* At least once a week, but preferably daily or as frequently as the occur, bring the subject up to your manager & schedule a meeting with HR to review each of the transgressions that you have documented in your notebook.

* Write a written summary account of every meeting or conversion that you are in which relates to any of the following: Any incidents of harassment you have experienced, your attempts to report said harassment, the managers or HR persons response & especially any conversations about your performance of your job duties - then email it to your manager, their manager & the HR dept & BCC a copy to an email address that you control & the company can‚Äôt access (because they will end up locking you out of your email account).

* Avoid using any terminology that could be perceived as hostility, frustration, sarcasm - remember a judge is going to be reading every single document which you bring to court in support of your claim & any document the company can find which will make you look bad. You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.

The goal here is to be the annoying as fuck squeaky wheel & make it obvious that you are documenting **everything** (*just for clarity & to prevent any misunderstandings of course - don‚Äôt ever actually say that you plan or intend to sue them,* **again** *You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.*)

They **want** you to quit because they know how much harder it will be for you to get a lawyer to sue them if you quit.

So don‚Äôt let them win - make it a game of figuring out how much of a nuisance you can be (*innocently of course*) until the fire you.

Quite frankly, most companies will fire you not long after you start documenting everything - because their position in court can only get worse from there.

They are trying to harass you into quitting & the longer they let you document that fact, the bigger your settlement will be - so (*& I‚Äôve witnessed legal counsel advise this exact thing*) it is better for them to trump up some bullshit reason for firing you than let you keep collecting more & more evidence of their wrongdoing.

gwa0dwa,t1_gw9ydbo,2021-04-29 09:35:08,MensRights,"Well there's a lot to respond to here, which is amusing.

- Yes, i'm office based. This isn't really a surprising thing, a huge amount of jobs are office based, including (based on interpretation and OPs history) his job in question. If it were manual work, it would be a different kettle of fish, as there are substantially less women in those areas.

- Studies do not generalise, this is misunderstanding how studies work, exactly the same way that most people misunderstand how statistics work. Actual scientific studies simply provide information, and a summary of information found. They are intended to inform you, not to tell you what to do. If a study finds that men are more likely to be in a car accident than women are (note, not an actual study, just pulling a scenario out of my head), it is not telling you that you should only be in cars where men drive, it's giving you the information so you can make an informed decision.

- Your lived in experience is a small sample size, as you yourself have stated. If you apply your lived in experience as a whole to an entire set of people, then you are applying a bias. Even if you have had prior experience with it, you are still applying a bias, and biases historically result in poor results. Apply your same bias to something like skin colour, and see how that works. ""Well i've worked with 3 black people in my life and they all worked less than me, so I refuse to work with black people now"". It doesn't sound good does it? It doesn't sound good because it's inherently incorrect. If instead you'd added in qualifying information, it becomes much less biased, and much more appropriate. ""X people who belong to Y location over the period of Z years have proven to me that {insert possible bias here}, I therefore aim to limit my interactions with X people, to reduce risk. I've also improved my ability to detect when people are {insert possible bias here}."". Qualifying information is incredibly key, and applying a bias, even if it's based only within your life and on your personal life experience, on a _single_ criteria is simply wrong.

- I have no idea what you're trying to say with attracting insane women 2 out of 3 times. I don't know where you've got the 3, I don't know how you're taking interpretation of data out of this, I pulled a scenario out of nowehere to show an example of incorrectly applied generalisation.

- Applying a generalisation is mostly applying a risk factor. I can take an example from my field, to simplify this matter. There are multiple published studies regarding working with third parties overseas, which explain the difference in working standards - particularly for indian overseas teams. I can use the information within this study to inform me that when i'm working with an indian offshore team, I need to have incredibly clear documentation, I need to ensure that anything I write has no assumptions in it, and no vernacular specific to my country, as this can introduce risk. This is not a generalisation, this is using the information within a study (and in some cases, from experience) to prevent risk, which is perfectly acceptable.

- You have not said that gender was your only data point, but in the context of the post, it was the only data point you provided.

- If you don't work well with female managers, there are two interpretations of this (without knowing any additional data points). Either there is something inherently wrong with the female gender, or there is somethign inherently wrong with you. If you provide additional data points (age, marital status, job description, role, location, company type, etc etc etc), then separate assessments can be made.


I do find it slightly funny that based on a very limited interaction, you determined that I need to work on interpretation, particularly because i'm in IT. 

Not only am I excellent at it, and have multiple commendations on data analysis (despite it not being my primary role), I've also taught a large amount of people and companies about accurately applying statistics within a work environment.",majestic_tapir,t2_1ckdoarz,1,0,reddit3

I'm both office and field based, thus the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualified to manage us.

Application bias not withstanding, there's also a cultural bias to address in that scenario.

Biases exist, applying them for your safety makes sense.

- I never said there weren't qualifiers. I'm saying that in the context of this post, the only qualifier provided was gender, which is not an accurate qualifier when left on it's own, it's a bias. You've then doubled down and stated ""the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualifed"", yada yada. This is actually a completely incorrect statement, there are no studies I can find that would suggest a woman is incapable of leading a group of engineers. There are less women in engineering, compared to men. You're more likely to find an incredibly competent man, because there are more qualified men. That does not mean that the vast majority of female managers are not experienced or qualified, just that there are less of them.

- Go and read the rest of the article that you copy pasted your generalisation definition from. In this case, you've copied it from a clinical study on hydrocephalus. In fact, the funny thing is, if you google generalisability, you'll find its application is prevalent for medical purposes - and much less so outside of anything medical related. There's a very good reason for that.

- I already agreed that you applied your lived in experience only to yourself, I also stated that you're therefore applying a bias.

- There is no cultural bias to address, because I have once again only provided an example to nail a point in, which is failing to get in for some reason. There is a large difference between applying a bias to a scenario vs applying a risk factor to a scenario.

- Applying a bias for your own safety is entirely incorrect. Take a racial one, as America seems to love racial things lately. You're more likely to be mugged by a black person than a white person - statistics confirm this. This does not mean that you should attribute the bias to all black people, because it fails to account for the _why_. And the why is simple - more black people in the US are in impoverished locations. Your bias therefore should not be against the race, it should be against a location. You're more likely to be mugged in Detroit than California, for example. And once more, i'll hammer this home in case it aims to derail - this is an EASY EXAMPLE TO GET A POINT ACROSS.

- Correct assertion that there are few qualifying bits of information about your future manager. But you yourself have said you've learned to identify that someone will be a poor manager due to decades of experience, so what are your qualifiers? So far, the _only_ qualifier you've ever provided is that they're female. What else?

- Again, regarding female gender as a whole, I will repeat again that this is within the context of your post. ""I will not work for female managers"" - the only qualifier you've provided is that they are female. If you like, I can add that a qualifier is that they're a manager, so now we're down to 3 commonalities: You, female gender and managers. So either you are the problem, the female gender is the problem, or managers are the problem. Yet you've already asserted you have no problem with male managers, therefore the problem is either you, or the female gender.ee",majestic_tapir,t2_1ckdoarz,1,0,reddit3

Less than 1% of people in my field are female. Of that percentage, about 20% are managerially qualified. Keeping with averages, about 30% of them are good managers.

No, there isn't. There's absolutely NO legal basis. Employers have a legal requirement to not discriminate against employees, there's no legal requirement for prospective employees (or existing employees) to not discriminate against employers.

You can quit your job arguing that you don't want to work for a company owned by a white man (for example) and nobody can do absolutely anything, unless of course you violate your contract by not giving proper notice or whatever.

Great. That still changes absolutely nothing, the law does not protect employers from discrimination. If you're hiring an assistant and you don't hire them because of characteristics they can't change, that's illegal. If you're hiring an assistant and the assistant doesn't want to work for you because of characteristics you have, tough luck, it's perfectly legal.

The documents the Democrats are seeking to be released are confidential papers from the top level of the Bush administration when he was the staff secretary. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would willingly release confidential presidential documents this soon after the end of their respective administrations.


It isn't like Kavanaugh has been hiding either. Not like he could take part in halting the release of the documents anyway. He was made available to meet with anyone who wanted to meet with him, not a single Democrat did. Some of those confidential documents were made available in supervised setting open 24/7 to every single Democratic Senator, not one showed up. This was never about documents or wanting to learn more about him, the loudest Dem Senators had already gone on record opposing him, this was about delaying the hearing until after mid-terms when they think they have a better chance at shutting him down.


What perjury? Also, any evidence at all that Kavanaugh is totally in Trump's pocket?


The clown show has almost exclusively been coming from the Left. Booker literally used his Day 1 line of questioning to help fundraise immediately after the hearing ended. Harris insinuated that Kavanaugh has had conversations about the Mueller investigation with a lawyer who works for the firm that represents Trump. As far as we know that was totally fabricated. Booker ""broke the rules"" by releasing confidential documents that he knew were actually cleared to be released the night before, but acted like he didn't know they were cleared in an attempt to be censured. Afterwards he said it made him feel like Spartacus, since that's the whole point of this shitshow.


Kavanaugh is a milquetoast pick, a Constitutionalist through and through. There were many on the Right disappointed with the pick bc Trump could have easily gone with a more clear right wing judge and had them been a shoo in. Please save the histrionics for the actual controversial things Trump does, there is plenty of it.

I refer you to this section of the article linked below. 

Health is not only about disease prevention, but also about well-being and the avoidance of harm. How harmful is routine non-therapeutic circumcision? The overall rate of immediate and long-term complications arising from newborn circumcision is a matter of debate and in truth unknown. The estimated rate of complication worldwide has been reported as lying between the extremes of 0.1% and 35%.27 Minor complications such as bleeding, infection and prolonged hospitalization are thought to occur in less than 5% of cases. Tragic partial or complete penile amputation, urethral injury and even the rare death have been reported. Meatal stenosis requiring intervention occurs in 5%‚Äì10% of males circumcised in the newborn period.28 This is believed to be secondary to dermatitis of the unprotected glans exposed to wet diapers. Circumcision revision under anesthetic for penile concealment, skin bridges or an unacceptable cosmetic result is probably the most common long-term complication prompting a urological referral: in one survey, fully one-third of pediatric urologists in the United States reported experience as an expert witness in circumcision litigation cases.29

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries‚Äî27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen‚Äîhave undergone the procedures.Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.

Now articles like this are coming out and it's a combination of vindicating and infuriating. Is it really too much to ask for the government just to keep the playing field even?

The republicans just put out a statement about how the corporations should hire based on merit. It's sort of too little too late for me. My young professional adult life was basically ruined and sabotaged and the entire time I suspected I was being fucked over and it looks like I was right. The worst part about it is they made it seem like there was something wrong with me. And now you think I want to work with or for these people? You think I am going to respect any of them? Seriously. Fuck them.

Luckily for the democrats they have a whole new generation young people to sell their tolerance bullshit to. There's no tolerance every person wants the same thing. You're just putting these people on a. pedestal at the expense of the people who were here first. And a lot of them are not successful yet either.

The student loan thing has me pissed because in any other situation this would be tortious interference. It's why the government shouldn't be allowed to act as a business and loan people money. It's so fucked up. You can't tell me not to be racist and make policies that literally take from me on the basis of race. It's a zero sum game assholes.",RichLong77,t2_m50hswx7w,69,0,reddit1

And I feel white men in general have not been allowed to really have the same influence on the propaganda that other groups have had. Hip hop has had basically a monopoly on machismo and what used to be rock n roll since the 90s. It's funny how the criticize the white influencers for toxic masculinity while hip hop has been the bastion of toxic masculinity since day 1. I have always recognized art as propaganda. And if you look at mainstream media you have basically hip hop on one side and cable network cop shows on the other. So women are basically looking for government employees or black criminals.

For awhile I was going to raves and it was awesome tons of hot european girls in fairy wings. And then sometime around dubstep that got sort of shitty. It stopped being as underground and cool and became mainstream. For a brief moment because of it's wierd status it was it's own unique culture. The day I stopped being interested was when some rapper came on one of my festival sets and said, ""Electronic music has finally arrived."" And I was just like I thought ""no one listened to techno"" . But as usual where there are hot european girls there is that hollywood crowd trying to liberate them in some way. There were black DJs in the scene that were cool and that's sort of the point I am trying to make. It's not just race its propaganda and culture.

There seems to be this group that just fucks everything up by taking whatever art you have and vandalizing it with their racial agenda. The reason I switched over to electronic music in the first place was because I just didn't want to listen to people bitchin' and talking shit anymore at my party. I definitely don't need some dude acting like he's hot shit on my stereo when a bullet goes through him just like everybody else.

A black person who shoots up the block and kills a bunch of innocent people he is a gangster and revolutionary. If a white boy shoots up a school hes mentally ill and crazy or you can work the government or be a retarded doctor. Those are the molds society has placed white men into and how women perceive them. TV is literally dominated by the same narratives. African and Muslim violence is excused while white violence is maligned. So you end up with a huge portion of the population who feels since their violence is justified they must be oppressed and vote in their favor to make it stop. Meanwhile a white kid shoots up a school and we need to do something about the guns and mental health hes crazy. They have taken the protective aspect from normal men and put it in the hands of black gangsters or cops/military.

What is produced by the American media establishment today is really not art but bullshit propaganda. Part of the reason the women believe what they believe is because hollywood and the music industry has conditioned them to believe it. All you have to do is look on reddit to see how many comments are practically MSNBC talking points rather than actual original opinions to realize how the vast majority of people are informed by media rather than experience. That's why as much fun as it is to talk shit about women you have to realize it's the men who are hiding behind them that are responsible for your problems.

There is literally a show on appletv that makes the outlaws of the wild west out to be serial killers. Great they found gangster white men from the 1800s and turned them into creepy serial killers as well. I guess only muslims and black people get to commit murder and be cool revolutionaries. But thats always been a thing for the people from those areas of the world. Vandalizing people's culture. What Joe Biden calls a history of white supremacy and domestic terrorism has largely been white self defense starting with the barbary wars and they attacked us. It's annoying because we have to constantly battle false equivalencies.

Maybe we've hit the continuity of continuous bullshit because of AI. The propaganda is so blatant and also so in your face it just like holy shit. Talk about no talent or creativity whatsoever.

Agreed.

And the people who benefited from discriminatory hiring practices during Jim Crow, much of whom are still alive and in the workforce. 

&#x200B;

I don't disagree with your points, I just think a lot of you have your heads up your ass if you think that what is happening now is only because of slavery. Jim Crow didn't end until 1964, which means that legal, race based segregation and discrimination, didn't end until 59 years ago. Many of the people who benefitted from those hiring practices just retired in the last 15 years. 

I work in construction, and there are companies in my city that were being sued into the late 90s because they were found to have been participating in race based discriminatory hiring practices. They were only sending white people to the biggest jobs, or keeping them on the payroll through the winter but laying everyone else off. One of those companies just had a case re-opened because someone that won a case in the 90s just retired, and now the court has to calculate how much pension they lost because the company was being racist when giving out jobs. 

That's not slavery, that's modern day racism, but y'all are crying on the internet about ""I wasn't a slave owner"" instead of figuring out a way to fix this shit ASAP so that you're no longer getting fucked by the decisions of someone's racist ass grandpa!",Red_Dwarf_42,t2_jbf6yns4h,-2,0,reddit1

They always talk about WWII while ignoring the fact that WWI was basically the British drafting and brainwashing Irish and Italian immigrants to fight to defend their empire. WWI resulted in the holocaust because the Germans basically got revenge. And as usual the allies are just the poor victims and they can't believe it happened. After war usually food is in short supply so the women will literally prostitute themselves for it. So if you take out all the bullshit propaganda and all the ""good guys vs bad guys"" nonsense basically they killed a bunch of German men during WWI and then fucked their women. Then cried about it when in WWII the Germans did the literal equivalent of a ""call the cops bitch"". And pre nuclear age might made right and it applies to all European colonial powers.

My biggest issue is that I have read so much random history that I have heard all of the bullshit before. American propaganda has basically inversed Nazi propaganda by making the black people the victim of oppression when largely they are the oppressors and the most violent people in the community. I use the Hutu as an example. No one ever brings that up. Even when BLM says ""the struggle is real"" I laugh because they're the burden. Anyone who thinks that looting stores and rioting is a political revolution is definitely a burden on all of us. The shoplifting is so bad where I live they don't carry designer shoes at Nordstroms anymore. Yay for exporting American culture throughout the globe.

The same way I laugh when I see some of these people walking around with swastikas who look like they've been vacationing at Chernobyl. You would think if you were going to start an evil empire you would come up with something original. And a lot of them don't really meet the brand standard in terms of looks or intellect. If you want to take over a government and murder millions of people tattooing a swastika on your face doesn't exact scream strategic political brilliance.

My major concern always has been the preservation of my constitutional rights. It's not the governments job to insure ""racial equity"". It's their job to protect the constitution from all threats foreign and domestic. And forcing businesses to hire people based on race is violation of their rights to freedom of association. And quite frankly I feel they are essentially seizing peoples property without due process by denying people jobs while charging people interest on loans they issued. They are also unjustly killing them simply by destroying their potential and time while vilifying them which is a very british thing to do. The problem is most white Americans don't want to be seen as the oppressors and DEI initiatives pray mostly on white women the same way a Nigerian Peanut farm scam does.

[https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/)

The woke mob is basically using the same tactics Woodrow Wilson used to suppress people during World War I on white people in America today. It's funny to me because even in Ukraine they use a similar tactics. Where there are blondes there's some American Jew trying to liberate them from oppression. They are probably going to do the same thing they did to me in America virtue signal and put them in debt and enslave them once the war is over. I assure you living in America filled with all this middle eastern diversity ain't that great. And quite frankly their only export is bullshit Abrahamic shit religions and slavery.

It's funny simply because their argument is they are saving culture and spreading American ideals. What culture? America is nothing but a bunch of fast food chains and hip hop. It doesn't even live up to it's own bill of rights at home. And its slowly coming under control of a bunch of bitter resentful minorities who want to control 70% of the population.

The American government literally indebted the entire white middle class children and then sabotaged their ability to pay back the loans they gave them. Usury how interesting. Somehow I always end up drawing conclusions and going down paths that I specifically try not to go down. The concept of racial equity is nothing more than a power grab and is extremely intellectually dishonest and subsists on a victim narrative not an actual accounting. If they want to do some kind of racial discounted cash flow analysis to value the equity of each skin color in the human race I am down. DEI is literally reverse eugenics. And I reject it for the same reason I reject eugenics who the fuck thinks they have the right to make these decisions? White and black aren't even fucking races. They are colors. And if you want to get technical black is the absence of color.

Once the government or the media starts promoting behaviors of any kind it changes the nature of the objection. For instance do I care about interracial marriage not really. But considering the african american community has had the bully pulpit on American musical culture for 30 years and have been pushing violent propaganda that threatens emasculates American Europeans while pretending they are apart of some revolution. And its not because your music is that great. You just suffocate practically every other genre by bullying your way into it and taking advantage of the fact that most young white people are to stupid to know anything else. Then Prince Harry goes around with his interracial bride talking writing books about how much he loves America. AWESOME.

The confederate planters wanted nothing more than to blend with the British aristocracy. These are the same people who's major complaint was poor white immigrants were hard to enslave because they blended in with the free white people. These are the same people who would impregnate the black slaves because they felt mixed raced children were more ""docile and industrious."" So while you may think your on some next level shit with your mixed race child. In reality your just making it easier for these people to differentiate one class from another. Because similar to world peace as long as humanity exists they will have preferences and discrimination in some form or another will exist. So once the media or the government starts pushing agenda I stop listening and start thinking about all possible outcomes. It may be a beautiful car but just because the car salesman is telling you the car is reliable, cool and a great buy doesn't mean he cares whether you can make the payments or how what he is selling is going to affect your life in the long term.

Let me just save you some time I am every -ism in the book. And it's way better than being a fucking muppet. It's a zero sum game. For the same reason DHS would watch Muslims after Sept 11 because they were the ones blowing up planes, if the US Government is going to start taking away my opportunities based on race I am naturally going to criticize them for it.  It's a zero sum game there's only so many mansions.

Have you ever noticed that the Geneva convention seems to only apply to Europeans? It's the same as HAMAS who hides behind civilians and engages in all these bad faith attacks. It's also funny because its the democrats who support them. And they fight the same way HAMAS does. Except they do it politically and they just slowly destroy your family with their shitty policies and agendas while hiding behind these stupid virtue signal Don Quixote style political ideals. They use -isms as a way to hide their injustices.",RichLong77,t2_m50hswx7w,7,0,reddit1

You are taking something at the expense of someone else. WTF makes you so special? Is that not a form of racism. And if you are going to use race as a basis for theft do you not think the people you are stealing from have a right to defend themselves. DEI justifies racism by making it a basis for governmental policy. The same way HAMAS justifies Israel's bombing of hospitals by hiding behind civilians in hospitals. They use the same argument as ""it's not all of us"".",RichLong77,t2_m50hswx7w,3,0,reddit1

k96hibm,t1_k969lwl,2023-11-14 06:12:49,MensRights,"Unless you understand how United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Environmental and Social and Governance (ESG) work. Companies are punished if they don't enforce the racial and gender 'equality' standards and are given a bad rating, that will impact their ability to borrow money on the stock market, value of the share price and even sales.

 Why sales? Because even if it's a small company that wouldn't be interested in discriminating its employees as it might be privately owned, the pressure to comply is still very high. 

Why? Because bigger companies that would buy their products such as supermakets or any big brand owner and manufacturer are generally listed on the stocks markets. These bigger companies are directly affected by part SDG/EDG, sustainability goals and are required to control and push their suppliers to follow the same principles.

It is just another form of coercion with real economic consequences.",Oscarwildwasright2,t2_ljbjqpti,30,0,reddit1
