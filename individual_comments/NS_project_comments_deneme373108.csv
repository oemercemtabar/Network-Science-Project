A coworker cannot be treated professionally if she's a woman bc he thinks the possibility of sex is there.

I read that this was studied and that when men look at attractive women, the 'tool' part of the brain lights up. There's a national geographic article about this. They literally can't treat you normally the way they would treat another man because their brain categorizes you as something other than equal human being. You're a sexual object to them.

These are exactly the things women friends do for each other, a shoulder to cry on, a ride if she needs it, a meal brought over when sick, a confidante. It's just men who are expecting sex in exchange for being a bsically decent friend. The man is the problem.

Also stop calling women females, it's gross.",Iamnotokwiththisshit,t2_6w4re100h,30,0,reddit4
jyv03tz,t1_jyuxo78,2023-09-02 21:16:18,TwoXChromosomes,"I dont think that feeling resentful that a woman hasn't returned your secret feelings while you're pretending to be a genuine friend is a platonic relationship. I think that's deceitful.    Also, if it was a genuine friendship, how was it a 'waste of time' as you say?  Do male friendships also distract from the goal of romance? 

 There are so many posts on this sub about women finding out years down the road that their guy friends were hanging around the entire time on the off chance that she might sleep with them someday or be a potential boyfriend.   So many men genuinely cannot conceive of a truly platonic friendship with a woman.   If you would take the chance to sleep with her if she offered, that was never a platonic friendship. They were just willing to lie and pretend to be a friend and wait for an opportunity to swoop in and be her man.     

Maybe it's an attraction thing? Maybe men can only truly be platonic friends with women if they don't find them sexually attractive. Thoughts?",hadenxcharm,t2_3476tqwe,16,0,reddit4

I'm not sure how true this is of most women, honestly and if it is we are all SOL because how many men even have wealth and power? I think the desire to paint women as if they are just as calculating and objectifying as men are is bullshit. I literally have not seen that to be true.

Additionally, men should not use this as an excuse for poor behavior.

If I know a man is sexually attracted to me, then the feelings are not secret. 

I will give you an example from my life. I went through grad school with a man and we were both hired on at the same company. We always had a positive relationship and helped one another out while in school and at work. We were on adjacent teams and would regularly provide one another feedback on projects and whatnot. We have a large circle of common coworkers/friends and are often at the same social functions, but if it were just him and I available, we'd both be good to go for lunch or coffee. At a point where I had known him about 10 years, and been happily married the entire time and him married for about two years, he texted me after a social event about how he has always been in love with me and how we should get together, etc., etc., etc.

Yeah, I had no idea, and was dumbfounded. I'm not sure how I should have just known this man saw me as a potential sexual partner and not as a colleague and friend.",Infamous_Smile_386,t2_6acube06,9,0,reddit4

I’ve experienced plenty of harassment from both women and men. A lot of men are socially taught that it isn’t a big deal if a woman harasses them, so it oftentimes goes unnoticed. 

We in general have a big issue with people not respecting others, thinking that they are owed something or that their perspective of what is considered okay, is the only that matter.

Try some massage techniques for your migraine and neck, sleep when you need it, so if you want a nap, have a nap, sleeping in is ok too.

And you don’t need an excuse or to be sick to take them. 

A great piece of advice I got recently from a friend was this: “women feel the need to spill their guts, and feel so guilty taking time for themselves. Don’t spill your guts. You don’t owe anyone any explanations. Just take what you need and don’t be apologetic.”

I kept telling myself I can push though it. I figured others would see me as weak for taking time just to relax. Stupid looking back at it... long story short I wound up in the hospital for about a month. The stress caused ulcers, massive GI damage, internal bleeding, and my brain was fried to the point I couldn’t remember who I was before I started working. In recovery the mental rebuilding was the hardest part as it was broken the longest. It’s been almost 2 years since then and my head and body still aren’t right. 

I’m just thankful my now Wife was there to help me out of that spiral. I can confidently say I’d be in much worse shape without her even if I was still moving. 

Anyways my point is that mental health is so much more important than anything else. Please take mental health days for yourself. If they become frequent, reach out to some help. There is NOTHING negative about asking for help. If anything it shows strength and courage to admit you’re struggling. 

To anyone reading, you matter more than anything you do. Take care of yourself so you can keep doing those great things and allow yourself to grow and move onto even better things. Take it from me; if you are going to work to exhaustion mentally/physically, do it for yourself and your own future. Not so another can make more money from your blood, sweat, and tears. And if you’re already a leader at the top, well, you can lead others if you’re too mentally or physically drained to direct yourself. 

TL;DR Be kind to yourself - it’s fucking important. ",Clueless_and_Skilled,t2_126rzr,2,0,reddit1

I got fired this past March because my performance did dip a bit. Mostly because I had to miss some time from work because my dad a one of my brothers passed away two weeks apart from each other. My brother passed away on my birthday. 

They were aware of this.

All this happened during the holidays last year. It really tore me up inside. I haven’t worked since I got fired. Thankfully I made a ton of money working there so I’ve had the luxury to take these past 6 months off and I’ll probably take the rest of the year off to get.

I’m allowed to have someone take care of me, allowed to admit I’m tired, allowed to admit I need help. Next time you feel the urge to cuddle up and cry, please just do it. My therapist has been telling me how letting that emotion out might feel shit in the moment and the guilt may linger, but it’s so much easier to deal with than bottling it up until it explodes. It’s taking some getting used to, but I think she might just be right. 

The most important thing though is to do what feels right for you. What works for someone else won’t work for you, and you can’t help someone else if you’re broken. So please take care of yourself. ",fillyourselfwithgold,t2_14h2zh,2,0,reddit1

If you randomly call out and he asks, tell him you ate some bad Mexican food and got the shits. Everyone’s been in that situation.

You get 30 days of paid leave per year, and can roll over no more than 45 days into the new fiscal year.  This is called ""use or lose"" (i'm sure it is called the same in civilian world).  Leaders take leave, because you want to encourage subordinates to take leave.  With 13 x 4 day weekends (1/month plus thanksgiving), 2 weeks of optional block leave during winter holiday to use leave, weekend passes, etc, there is a big incentive to avoid burn-out.  This applies to the civilian world too: you are absolutely useless to your organization if you burn out.  Don't get to that point.

Or you can say you have a migraine, which sounds like it could be true based on what you have described. 

Regardless of how you handle it, always take days to mentally and physically recoup whenever you need to. And go the extra step of encouraging your employees to do the same if you can. It’s important for them to see their boss being mindful and it gives them permission to follow suit.

No, you don't. In fact, it's probably _better_ if you don't. The people who are under you in the reporting structure do indeed look to you for a model of what's expected, that part is true.

It goes a _long way_ toward building trust in you when the people under you can see that you have bad days and get frustrated too, but that you handle it appropriately. It goes a _long way_ toward those people feeling like they have permission to take care of themselves if they see that you do.

Donna Kate Rushin (1981)

I've had enough 
I'm sick of seeing and touching 
Both sides of things 
Sick of being the damn bridge for everybody

Nobody 
Can talk to anybody 
Without me Right?

I explain my mother to my father my father to my little sister 
My little sister to my brother my brother to the white feminists 
The white feminists to the Black church folks the Black church folks 
To the Ex-hippies the ex-hippies to the Black separatists the 
Black separatists to the artists the artists to my friends' parents...

Then 
I've got the explain myself 
To everybody

I do more translating 
Than the Gawdamn U.N.

Forget it 
I'm sick of it

I'm sick of filling in your gaps

Sick of being your insurance against 
The isolation of your self-imposed limitations 
Sick of being the crazy at your holiday dinners 
Sick of being the odd one at your Sunday Brunches 
Sick of being the sole Black friend to 34 individual white people

Find another connection to the rest of the world 
Find something else to make you legitimate 
Find some other way to be political and hip

I will not be the bridge to your womanhood 
Your manhood 
Your human-ness

I'm sick of reminding you not to 
Close off too tight for too long

I'm sick of mediating with your worst self 
On behalf you your better selves

I am sick 
Of having to remind you 
To breathe 
Before you suffocate 
Your own fool self

Forget it 
Stretch or drown 
Evolve or die

The bridge I must be 
Is the bridge to my own power 
I must translate 
My own fears 
Mediate 
My own weaknesses

I must be the bridge to nowhere 
But my true self 
And then 
I will be useful",Grebni34,t2_wx9ge,1,0,reddit1

As a guy who's girlfriend is the exact same way and who's struggling to get her to understand that this way of thinking is unnecessary...let me say to you: TALK TO YOUR MAN! (or WOMAN, FRIEND, PARTNER, PET, WHOEVER)!  Your husband loves you and will  not think you're weak, lazy, or less of a person in any way if you need to just open up and talk and cry and just BE run down.  And not just for today...even if it's for a week! Or two weeks!  My girlfriend does this to me constantly; she's told me that in her mind she's trying to ""spare you pain because it's my problem and I don't want you to deal with it and I can take care of it on my own"" only it's the complete opposite effect...by bottling herself up until she explodes, she ends up making herself deeply depressed and exhausted, exacerbating the problem which we both have to deal with inevitably anyways!  At work we have to put a kind of mask on in a lot of ways, but home is NOT the same way.  At home, you should be yourself! And COMMUNICATION has got to be the most important thing in any relationship...I know people like to think they can read minds, or send signals, or interpret this or that....STOP IT.  Just TALK to the people you love! They won't know unless you actually tell them how you're feeling.  Let them help you! They WANT to help you! And it will make you feel much much better!

It is only fair to spend a little more time with yourself and I strongly suggest you also speak to people around you who are very close to you. Even if they don't understand, it will help you comprehend your situation much better and feel relatively laxed.

We don't have sick days, we have extra PTO. Sounds weird, but the reason behind it is because they didn't want to make people feel like they had to lie when they needed to take a personal day and pretend that it's a sick day. We all get the exact same amount of time off (I think it's around 2 weeks for a new employee of actual vacation time + a normal amount of sick days per year) but it's all lumped together as PTO so people can just stay home and all they have to say is ""I'm taking a day off"" and there's no questions at all.

It's also the idea behind the companies that say you get unlimited PTO. At those companies it's about freedom of responsibility so as long as the job gets done you can do whatever you want. There is one downside to that method (and some of it comes across for us as well) is that sure you can take two weeks and go to Hawaii but there's an important call in the middle of it and you better be on that call, so sometimes you can't actually break away fully. For us the downside is that people end up hoarding PTO and rarely using it, instead opting to just work from home as a bit of a recharge. And that's because our PTO rolls over where as sick days normally don't so people are reluctant to use it.

Mental health days are the main reason behind this approach we've taken, though, because people don't consider that being sick but sometimes you need to recharge and that should be 100% acceptable. My HR director fights for that all the time and has made us all feel very comfortable taking those days, and I hope more HR people do the same.",Theothercword,t2_rcly9,1,0,reddit1

Sometimes you just can't fucking deal and you need the mental recuperation. Just like sometimes you physically can't fucking deal (due to a cold, flu, pulled muscle, whatever). 

Life is already too short. Working yourself to an early grave doesn't get anyone anywhere (except 6 feet under). 

When I do mental health days, I typically look for a day where I don't have meetings and there are no deadlines and make sure I have work at a good pausing/stopping point. Then I take it. 

And I come back refreshed and more productive.

HOWEVER, our culture (at least in the USA) heavily emphasizes the protestant work ethic, meaning that success is only accomplished through hard work. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But so many individuals, myself included, take it to an extreme where we feel guilty anytime we're not working or doing something productive.

During the work week, I typically put in 12+ hour days between grad school, my job, studying, interviewing, etc. By Saturday, I'm exhausted and often find myself laying around watching Netflix or being pretty lazy, and all I can think  about is how *guilty* I feel for not working on something and being proactive. My mind wanders to all the chores I could be doing, or homework I could be completing, or grocery shopping I need done and I just feel immensely guilty and hateful towards myself the entire time. 

It's taken me a long time to get to this viewpoint, and I still struggle with accepting it, **but it's okay to allow yourself to enjoy your life.** It is absolutely okay to take a mental health day and just do things you enjoy and take a step back from work. Life needs balance. Tipping the scale too far to the leisurely end has its consequences, but so does tipping it too far to the work end. If you're not taking care of yourself, your work performance will be affected anyways.

Take the mental health day. Lay in bed, watch Netflix, read a book, have a good cry, do whatever you need to get back to where you want to be again. Self-care isn't just important, it's *necessary*.

Even if they believe they don’t, they absolutely do. And not via modeling behavior, typically it is via direct irritation at others prioritizing life over work from time to time. 

Everyone.... everyone... should encourage people to take time off. Not only for mental well being, not only for a more positive work atmosphere, but because when someone takes time off you get to figure out how things run without them. Hopefully, their absence makes things a bit challenging for others who are forced to learn and grow. Perhaps becoming good backup for the person.  Perhaps giving the opportunity for someone to step into leadership as interim. And if things go BETTER without the person around, it shows that maybe it’s time to reorganize roles.

Whenever the C's are reviewing this, they always assume it's because the pay isn't exactly competitive. My dad is one of the C's and I work IT so I travel to every location. I tell him that the problem is not the pay, it's that the managers are shit making it so that nobody is happy. The managers are just simply detached from the employees at best and directly destructive to morale at worst. So of course everyone leaves because they never felt any connection or loyalty to begin with. Those that stay do so because of their fellow employees not managers. The moment one does leave, they all shortly follow. We have two locations that have had 0 turn over for the past 5 years. A new manager just moved into one and within 5 months half the employees left.  


Everyone just got a pay bump, and the employees took it as an offense. Essentially, they feel that it was corporate acknowledging that they've been underpaying. Managers make or break a company.

e76pm7d,t1_e75vz4t,2018-10-05 00:20:02,TwoXChromosomes,"The ironic part is you’re not getting the mental health/relaxation benefits if you’re sitting there with anxiety and guilt the whole time you’re playing video games. 

I had to train myself to reframe the way I think about my hobbies. I like to knit. Previously, everytime I would knit, I viewed it as me being lazy, procrastinating from what I actually needed to get done, and wasting my time. I sat there and felt guilty and angry at myself the entire time, and filled with anxiety about what I should be doing instead (like you said how you feel when you play video games). 

Now, I’ve been tying to train myself to view my knitting time as a productive action I’m taking to allow myself to relax and take care of my mental well being rather than a waste of time. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes I still feel those subconscious feelings of guilt, but part of the process of reframing is acknowledging how hard it is to extinguish those prior heavily ingrained emotions. 

My relaxation thing is knitting. If your relaxation thing is video games, then you’re absolutely 100% allowed to take that time to sit down and play. Additionally, it might be helpful if you try to intentionally schedule a slot of time each day to allow yourself to relax and enjoy your games. This might help begin the process of extinguishing the anxiety you feel.

I went to my boss directly after finishing a project in which I temporarily took over a neighboring department after only 5 half days of training (I am in IT/Marketing, the other job was in charge of shipping/order processing for the whole company) managed to improve departmental efficiency and even trained a new employee to take over using the new policies I implemented, all within 2.5 weeks. It was a huge undertaking and not my responsibility at all, but I managed to pull it off.   
Anyway the point is, the next day after completing my time in that dept and handing everything over to the new person, I went to my boss and respectfully told him that I felt I had demonstrated my commitment to the company and willingness to do go above and beyond my job title when called upon, and that I felt I had earned a raise. He thought about it for a minute, asked how long since my last raise, and offered a dollar more per hour. I said that would be great but I was thinking two - then explained my ongoing involvement in a cross-departmental project I had begun to digitize important shipping policies and documents to the company server that were currently only stored as hard copies.   
He gave me the $2 more per hour.   
And I paced around in my office all day before I went to talk to him, I was crazy nervous and almost didn't go. But my friend and office-mate told me something that I couldn't shake: You will always be your biggest cheerleader. No one else is going to do that for you. (Almost) no one is going to voluntarily give you more money just because you are doing more work. Be your own cheerleader. Toot your own horn.

I saw so many people get fired, all of them for actual reasons, like starting fights or not doing their job. People would just hang out when they were supposed to be working, people that couldn’t meet their quotas would take longer lunch breaks than they should’ve, just general laziness. The higher ups wanted to let go of all the temps in my area so I was on the chopping block, my floor manager practically played a shell game moving me around the stations until they could hire me so he didn’t have to get rid of me. 

What was the reason I had so much job security? It wasn’t because I was particularly good at any of the jobs they put me on. I started out shit at most of them, I got better the longer I stayed at any one station, but I wasn’t the best at any of them. It was because I worked.

If you’re (the general you, not you specifically) afraid you’re going to lose your job it’s probably because you realize someone else can do it better than you, if that’s not your fault and you suffered some injury that hinders you, I’m really sorry that sucks, but if you’re just being a lazy asshole you’ve earned your paranoia.

Sometimes, they would come in and there was no one but unmarried women there and they would be a little mad and leave? Like it was our fault?

We tried having special coffee and tea for them to feel welcome. We put special music on to make them feel welcome. We tried to let them know that in the immediate area there were hookah/tea lounges they probably would like better and could accommodate them. Our hookah wasn't the kind they wanted and we could see the displeasure. We didn't try to tell then they weren't welcome or we wouldn't serve them.

They either didn't want to listen to us or they really just wanted a nerd lounge with mostly women working? It was fucking weird. They didn't like the bathrooms either because we had feminine products available in both genderless bathrooms.

At a certain point we hit the paradox of tolerance -- you can't support fundamentalism if you're against misogyny. You can't support fundamentalism of you want to dismantle the gender binary, or be queer affirming. At a certain point, you do clash up against the fact many religions have bigoted beliefs systems baked in



Personally I do not respect fundamentalism as a result of that bigotry. But I also hate shaking hands with a passion.  I wouldn't have internalized it as feeling ashamed of myself, more would have struggled to not roll my eyes. 


I'm not gonna go on any rands about the Jews and Muslims because I know many who are not fundamentalist, in the same way most Christians are not fundamentalist, but no I don't respect fundamentalists or their backwards practices. Just like I don't support the vaccine hesitancy or the child/wife beatings and coordinated rax evasion and fraud. (The last 2 aren't even religious, just deeply tribalistic behaviors from groups who tend to be fairly hostile to outsiders)

The whole ""respect for their wives"" thing? That's basically saying that any interaction with another woman is inherently disrespectful to their spouse, which is absurd. It's like they're reducing all women to potential home-wreckers or temptations, which is both insulting and objectifying.

""Ritual impurity"" in Judaism is a very flawed translation of the Hebrew *tumah*, a term that refers to the status of one who is not ritually capable of offering sacrifices at the Temple or even entering the Temple precinct. There are a whole lot of things that can cause *tumah*\--genital emissions regardless of sex with the exception of ordinary vaginal discharge, directly or indirectly touching a human or animal corpse, touching certain animals while alive, and presenting certain skin conditions--and one form, corpse-impurity (which is ""transmissible"" and can only be removed via the ashes of the red heifer, which has not been agreed to be possible since the days of the Temple), is considered to apply to all people in the present day and age. Considering that we are, courtesy of the Romans, currently Temple-less, it doesn't hugely matter these days. At the same time, many more observant communities still try and avoid incurring unnecessary forms of *tumah*, and certain types can also affect the permissibility of having sex in traditional Halakha (of which that resulting from menstruation is far and away the most notable). Nonetheless, no moral judgement is meant to fall on someone who happens to be ritually impure--indeed, certain actions that can convey a higher grade of ritual impurity, namely burying a corpse, are considered extremely noble acts of charity!

Virtually all of these forms of impurity probably originated as taboos that, in a society without modern medicine, gradually gained prominence as a form of unconscious avoidance of potential disease sources: while we know today that menstrual blood is essentially safe, in a society without a firm understanding of how STDs are transmitted it's understandable why a taboo around it, along with other genital fluids, might have developed.

Likewise, there are certain states of ritual impurity in men that result from genital emissions, namely *zav* and *keri*, that are in many ways analogous to the specific ritual impurity resulting from menstruation, called *niddah.* Personally, I think that the Orthodox world is somewhat too soon to dismiss issues with touching a man on the basis of potential *zav* impurity, as well as equal treatment of men and women for the sake of *kevod habriyot* and *lo chillulu et-shem*, though that's somewhat besides the point in some respects.

Finally, I think it's important to note that many Jewish women in my experience, far from viewing *niddah* as shameful, have a profoundly positive connection to it. On one level, since a woman can unilaterally judge and declare when she becomes *niddah*, it has probably functioned as a valuable tool for women in unhealthy relationships where consent is not well valued, but even setting aside this a lot of women find it intensely significant and positive to observe their cycle and to immerse in a *mikveh* after it, a profoundly spiritual act. *Mikveh* immersion is mandatory for both men and women under certain circumstances, but because of *niddah* it is a ritual that is both required and accessible for women far more often than for men. In parallel to this, because of the privacy that has traditionally been observed for women in matters of *niddah*, it has opened the door for women in some religious circles to acquire a leadership status as *yoetzot halakha*, advisors for women on *niddah* and other mitzvot relating to sexuality and familial life.

None of this is to say that there aren't issues at play here. But unlike in the mainstream Christian world, which has inherited Aristotle's conception of menstrual fluid as a uniquely impure substance tightly tied to conceptions of female inferiority, *niddah* in Judaism is one of many prohibitions of a general category that is not unique to men or women. It's an idea that can come to play in a misogynistic way and in a misogynistic society, but on it's own I wouldn't necessarily say that it's an intrinsically misogynistic idea.",Matar_Kubileya,t2_4bf2sab4,80,0,reddit3

k1wqff6,t1_k1vxxox,2023-09-23 21:34:15,TwoXChromosomes,"Refusing to do business with someone because of their religious observance is a one-way street to a discrimination lawsuit. You can argue that it isn't about religious beliefs but rather practice all you want, but in order to win against a religious discrimination lawsuit like that you have to prove that accommodating the practice is an undue burden on your business, something no judge in the country would consider not shaking hands to be.

Theoretically a female employee in this situation could sue her employer for creating a discriminatory work environment, but unless she can prove that as a result of this accommodation for customers she is materially being harmed by the policy she wouldn't really have a case. It's possible this could be the case, e.g. if it was leading to her being disciplined for lower performance metrics resulting from the policy or if she was passed up for promotion because of it, but on its own I doubt it would be actionable. 

Personally, I think the ideal policy for the business in this situation, both from an ethical and legal standpoint, is to say that ""we welcome your business and we respect your beliefs, but we expect you to treat our employees the same regardless of sex. Whether this means shaking everyone's hand or no-one's is your decision.""",Matar_Kubileya,t2_4bf2sab4,114,0,reddit3

The student came over and I reached out my hand to shake his (all the other students were doing it, it’s not like I wanted to. Talk about clammy hands) and he very politely declined. He proceeded to shake the two men’s hands at our table. 

I will give the guy credit, he was very polite and briefly said it was due to his religion. He actually sounded apologetic. I wasn’t bothered by him, but by the concept. So I decided, that’s fine, but if he doesn’t want to shake my hand, then he doesn’t need to hear my spiel about the company. So I checked out and let the other men talk about our company. At one point, one of them tried to steer me into the conversation and I thought - oh no, no. That’s not how this works now. You want to talk to the men, talk to the men. But all I said was something along the lines of “sounds like you explained everything.”

One of my coworkers gave me the guy’s resume to write notes on, but I put it back in his pile. I did not at all want to religiously discriminate against this student, but I also had no interest in writing notes about him either.

While I agree with a lot of your points, I’ve gotta disagree with the idea that there aren’t a lot of ideas within Orthodox Judaism that don’t do exactly this. My husband is ethnically but not religiously Jewish on his mom’s side, meanwhile my SIL (his brother’s wife) was raised Orthodox and is now very progressive, but I’ve seen a lot of things through her family/others she and my BIL know that are very much “my way or the highway.”

Not being able to sit with my husband when my BIL had his (late-in-life) Bar Mitzvah sucked. Not being able to dance with my husband at their wedding sucked. Not being able to come over [edit: to my SIL’s family’s place] for any holiday gathering (that they’re always sweet enough to invite us to) since they’re Kosher and I don’t eat meat or dairy (they always cook with one or the other, and I can’t bring my own non-Kosher food into their Kosher home, understandably) always sucks. Sure, none of these things are oppressive, but do they not control how I’m supposed to behave? Rules are rules, I get it, but when said “rules” lead to things like my BIL signing a religious contract when he and my SIL got married that more or less states, “Hippity hoppity, women are property,” I think anyone’s entitled to be a tad bit incredulous.

I’m also part of a marginalized community (I’m Ojibwe), but it’s still hard to get the justification for this level of control and disregard for an entire gender. Sure, this situation is different in the sense that you’re right, nobody is entitled to be able to touch you without your consent.

For what it's worth, this isn't how Kashrut works, to the point where if it continually becomes an issue I might suggest getting in touch with their Rabbi in order to see if he can lean on them about it. While it is forbidden to mix meat and dairy, including to cook besari in a halavi kitchen or vice versa, there is absolutely no Halakhic problem with cooking pareve in a besari or halavi kitchen, and by corollary no reason religiously speaking why they shouldn't be able to cook food that accomodates you if and when you visit.

>when said “rules” lead to things like my BIL signing a religious contract when he and my SIL got married that more or less states, “Hippity hoppity, women are property,”

I really think that you might be mislead on what exactly a Jewish marriage contract, or *ketubah*, actually says. Even the most traditional versions of them include basically only a listing of obligations a man has towards his wife (and sometimes *vice versa*), including an obligation to pay child support in case of a divorce. While they were first developed in a deeply patriarchal society and reflect that fact, they aren't fundamentally different from a secular pre-nup. Heck, it was originally developed by the Chachamim as a replacement for the Toraic practice of bride-price, or *mohar*, that within a still very patriarchal society was designed to provide better protections for a woman in case of a divorce. 

Now, there are substantive issues at play in some of the more traditional versions of it, most notably different levels of alimony/financial support being prescribed based on the bride's sexual history. At the same time, however, a ""hippity hoppity women are property"" *ketubah* would be wildly beyond what's expected even by the most stringent Jewish sects, let alone ones that wouldn't effectively disown your husband for having married outside the Jewish People. Quite frankly, I really think you're misunderstanding it in this case.",Matar_Kubileya,t2_4bf2sab4,6,0,reddit3

>Also, if an Orthodox woman worked with 10 women and one man, she would shake the women’s hands but not the men. I’d be surprised if anyone were upset with that other than MRA types.

I'd like to see that happen in practice, because one or the other of us would surely be surprised at how it went down.

I'll come clean: I personally think that in that scenario, the handshake would somehow be given a tactical miss by the Orthodox Jewish woman *and* her female colleagues. The women would not all shake hands with each other, and leave the man out; some other act/word of mutual respect would be brought in instead. It would just...mysteriously happen, in exactly the way it did not mysteriously happen for the OP.

I'm not going to shake peoples' hands without their permission. I wish we had a universal, global non-touching greeting ritual with no pre-existing religious connotations (the hand-to-the-heart/slight bow thing seems to come closest). But at the same time, if some people get to shake on a deal and others (at the same event) do not, that's a ready-made social isolator switch for women trying to enter areas of discourse that are traditionally reserved for men.",Velinder,t2_17bdkj,7,0,reddit3

longer relevant to our modern lives. Reform and reconstructionist Jews, for example, think that we live in a world that’s different than the one our religion developed in, so many rules don’t apply.

I do have a question, but you don’t have to answer. Does this mean a woman is more likely to have to spend more outside her health insurance network than a man if there are more male doctors?: 

“…although the Shach and other Poskim agree that a male doctor may examine a female, there is no blanket heter for a woman to go to a male doctor for no reason. She should certainly seek out a female doctor, even if she has to pay for it. Only when there is no female doctor available, or if the male doctor is more qualified or experienced than the female, may a woman see a male doctor.

The Sargent took me to the SANE office and stayed til 1 am before bringing me back. They connected me with a counselor on campus and called me twice a day with an update on the investigation and to check on me, and picked me up/dropped me off when I had to go in for questions. They found the dude after 3 days of looking for him (which was tough bc he turned out to be a complete catfish who was couch surfing), interrogated him and arrested him.

I thought it was bad til I got to the end when you said he wasn't even scheduled that day and still came to work fully dressed to stalk you. That's a whole new level of terrifying. 😳

If that was revealed I would have pushed to have him fired immediately because that's FAR over the top and not only should he be fired, but I feel like a police report should be submitted for trespassing as that's certainly a violation of a lot of policies, including his access rights and all that.

I used to work in a hospital and had to occasionally visit the psych unit (computer support), so I know those doors you're talking about very well. There's no reason for someone who doesn't have a business purpose in the unit to even be in that corridor, and it's not unusual for the corridor itself to be dedicated to that purpose.

I'm so glad you stumbled your way into this getting fixed. I've been on the end of useless HR, including outright collaborative HR bc the head of HR in one company I worked for was known as a sexual harasser himself.

I thought it was bad til I got to the end when you said he wasn't even scheduled that day and still came to work fully dressed to stalk you. That's a whole new level of terrifying. 😳

If that was revealed I would have pushed to have him fired immediately because that's FAR over the top and not only should he be fired, but I feel like a police report should be submitted for trespassing as that's certainly a violation of a lot of policies, including his access rights and all that.

I used to work in a hospital and had to occasionally visit the psych unit (computer support), so I know those doors you're talking about very well. There's no reason for someone who doesn't have a business purpose in the unit to even be in that corridor, and it's not unusual for the corridor itself to be dedicated to that purpose.

I'm so glad you stumbled your way into this getting fixed. I've been on the end of useless HR, including outright collaborative HR bc the head of HR in one company I worked for was known as a sexual harasser himself.

jlyxc9z,t3_13u3ene,2023-05-28 17:50:40,TwoXChromosomes,"You're getting some very good advice. I'd like to add something: 

You can train yourself out of the freeze or fawn response to threatening behavior. It takes self awareness and a lot of practicing at home or other safe spaces. So many of us don't know how to set boundaries because our boundaries were disregarded when we were younger; we don't feel safe telling someone to stop. Many of us who have witnessed sexual harassment don't know how to advocate for victims of harassment for the very same reason. 

Validate yourself. Affirm your own strength. Imagine scenarios where you're being creeped on by someone undesirable and you come up with the perfect words to shut it down. Visualize setting boundaries and walking away. 

-I don't like the way you're talking to me; it's inappropriate. 
-I will not discuss my body or my tattoos. 
-You are grossing me out.
-Excuse me, I'm leaving.

Having the skill to set boundaries and leave unsafe spaces does not guarantee that you won't be harassed or victimized. It merely reduces the odds of unpleasant behavior escalating to something worse. 

Creeps always flatter women about their body and appearance. Consider setting a boundary around this behavior and training yourself on redirecting conversation to something like the weather, movies and music, pets or children, or the latest bingeable shows. If they persist in being inappropriate, leave their presence and go somewhere else. 

I think you might be able to talk to those women about what happened without accusing or shaming them. 

*Hey, can we talk for a minute about last weekend when X was hitting on me at the table? That was really awkward and stressful for me, and I've felt insecure and uncertain ever since. I have been thinking that perhaps you felt awkward too. It would be good if we could support each other in weird moments like this. I want you to know that if I ever see/perceive someone being inappropriate with you, that I'm willing to say something to intervene if you're comfortable with that. I'm hoping that other women here would do the same for me. We need to support each other, and I want to be supportive of you.*

That guy was a fucking asshole and I hope that you talk to HR about his boundary pushing. I anticipate that he'll persist in doing this. I encourage you to do some emotional strength training to prepare yourself for your next run-in with him.",Johoski,t2_1vom0b2p,703,0,reddit1

Here's a bit of unsolicited advice (I am not a lawyer) :

If you report this to HR, **please make sure it's in writing**, preferably an email, with your personal accounts BCC'd as a way to keep a copy of yourself. Here's a template:

Dear Employer, 

I am writing to report harassment I experienced on \[date\] from \[harasser name\]. The harassment is severe, pervasive, and it's causing a hostile work environment for me. \[Briefly explain what the harasser did\]

What can the company do to help?

Respectfully,

u/StolenSweet-Roll

I ripped it straight from an employment lawyer's Instagram (Attorney Ryan Stygar). Feel free to edit as necessary. It is critical that the complaint (or recap of the report to HR) is in writing. If they don't do anything, contact an employment attorney (a lot of them offer free consults and work on contingency \[you don't pay them until you win\]). If they fire you, you have proof of retaliation. Sexual harassment is illegal in all 50 states, and so is retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.

I don’t like that they left you there, and that they didn’t suggest some way to leave the table. 

But I also know that often people don’t intervene because they aren’t sure what will be effective e. 
Often, even the target of a creep will not “speak up” or something because what they want (what the bystanders want) is for the unpleasantness to have as small an impact as possible. Either by not getting really bad or unpleasant or chaotic, or by ending quickly. And often, making a stink makes things much more unpleasant, more impactful in a bad way

They m ay be waiting for a cue from you—are you uncomfortable, scared, grossed out? If you’re focusing on appeasing, they. May leave you to it—either because they misread you, or because they’re acquiescing to your method of handling it. 

There are some takeaways here.

For you—you’ve been in this situation now so you can think about how you’d handle it as the target, should it come up again. You can decide on a script. You can learn to recognize the signs (how intimate were those body parts, tattoo discussion, etc). You can decide how to read someone else’s signs, and you can decide that YOU won’t discuss tattoos on “private” body parts, or other sorts of things that might give an opportunity or encouragement to someone looking for it.

For you—you’ve seen how bystanders can make a difference in a bad way; you can prepare yourself to be a bystander making a difference in a good way. 
   Maybe you’ll practice or prepare to intervene with an escape (“Susie, I need to go potty. Come with me, I can’t go alone, it’s the girls rule, I might fall in. Move over, George, let her out, come on Susie, we’ll be back pretty soon.”).
   Maybe you’ll prepare to intervene in the convo more strongly, or to flat-out criticize someone in the moment 

For us—We’ve heard this story—and WE can make plans to intervene somehow, if only to buy the target some time to decide how to act, to create an escape if they want it, because they can always go back and pursue.

And we’ve heard the stories of people whose colleagues didn’t intervene in the moment but went to HR and provided evidence. .",TootsNYC,t2_wamg8,8,0,reddit1

If you hate the job and you've got other options, move on. If you don't, then you've got a choice - go the ""official route"" or go the direct/informal route.

If you go the ""official route,"" (write it up, document it, name witnesses, who will be dragged in and not necessarily appreciate it, file complaint with H.R. and supervisor, then wind up potentially with finding out H.R. isn't there for you, it's there to protect the company, etc., etc.), the unfortunate reality is, this is a PITA, and can result in blowback.

If you're strong enough (and there's no reason for you to give the dinosaurs any power over you), the much simpler way is to assemble a couple friendly witnesses, march into the dinosaur's office and say, ""You know, the other night in the restaurant after the softball game, you said something like 'If you're down, I'm down.' I wanted you to know three things - First, I'm not down. And I never will be. I say that not to insult you in any way, just to be sure there's no misunderstanding in the future. Second, I expect after I leave your office, to never have another interaction with you like that. Third, I wanted to let you know I chose to come directly to you rather than go to H.R. because we all make mistakes and that's the way I'd want someone to handle things if the shoe was on the other foot. BUT, I do need you to know, if anything like that were to happen again, I would know it's not an accident or a mistake, and that would result in me going straight to H.R. Also, I have gathered written statements and drafted my own detailed contemporaneous statement. If this was just a one-time simple misunderstanding, then they'll never see the light of day. But if I experience even a hint of retaliation or inappropriate behavior, they will all very much see the light of day and show a pattern of behavior, and then there will be lawyers and great big, very expensive mess for the company. I've always thought you were a nice guy, and I'd like to continue thinking that, and believe this was just a one-time, one-off mistake. Now I've got to get back to work. No need ever to speak of this again.""

Think about it. This dinosaur has no power over you that you don't give him. The momentary discomfort you felt, you shouldn't have had to deal with, but you are strong and you are resilient, and I'm pretty sure you're not crippled or otherwise permanently damaged by this, right? You're stronger than that.

People do and say stupid and inappropriate things all the time. Are you the person that looks them in the eye and says ""not appropriate, back off,"" then goes on with your life not looking back or giving it a second thought, or you're the grand victim, thinking about how injured and crippled you are. Young people today are being taught a victim's mindset. It's really hard to watch. Be bigger. Be stronger. Don't give petty grievances power over you, and don't let them live rent-free in your head.

I've tried to look at the experience as a learning one--I try to empower myself to always speak up when a situation feels uncomfortable, motivated by the knowledge that I don't ever want others to feel the way that I felt in that moment. But I also try to remind myself that not everyone has had the experience I have, so they don't have the same perspective or approach. Some folks find rocking the boat too uncomfortable, or don't know how to advocate for friends, or any other possible reasons. And I don't necessarily think it's about making excuses for them? But that understanding has helped me, and allowed me to let go of the sadness and betrayal 😂  

I think all we can do is have compassion and love for ourselves, and just try and lead by example, and normalize the need to rock the boat when necessary, so that others don't have to have these experiences in future.

jlz24pu,t3_13u3ene,2023-05-28 18:23:32,TwoXChromosomes,"My advice or you is to go scorched earth. Detail the event as you have here, with names, date, time and location and get as specific with behavior as you can. Include names of witnesses. 

Put it in an email with the subject ""Sexual Harassment on date XX/YY/ZZ"". 

Close the email with a one or two sentence mantra that you will repeat over and over in your conversations with management or HR, something like: ""You have a problem with sexual harassment at this company, and if you don't fix it, I will have to take further action."" (If they ask what action you plan to take, just say you will have to consider that based on their actions. Never commit to any definite action until you are ready to do it.)

Send the email to your manager and HR. If you have a corporate HR, copy them. You want to force them to do the right thing, rather than the easier thing (which is almost always pressuring you to shut up.) 

Inform your ""friends"" that you have identified them as witnesses to sexual harassment. 

I know you don't want to make waves, that you don't want to live with feeling horrible. But if you don't shove this grossness back at them, you are the only one who will suffer *right now*, and they will keep getting worse. They will do this to others, because this is a pattern. They have done this before - guaranteed.

I did just what I outline here: I reported 3 harassers in my first two weeks on a job. I decided I would not compromise my statement, no backing down (and boy, did they push hard at me...that I just misunderstood, that I was imagining things, that I didn't know how to interact professionally, on and on.) I just kept repeating my mantra, over and over.

 What I found is that when they can't bully you into backing off, they **will** address the situation. They would rather not deal with it - you have to make doing the right thing easier than doing the wrong thing. 

And then! The guys that I had been hiding from saw me and ***avoided ME***! That changed ***me***. Changed me internally.  Suddenly, I felt like I *did* deserve respect and I was going to demand it.

It wasn't all roses. Lots of people were very cold to me for months. But two of those guys ended up getting fired, because - surprise, surprise - they were problem employees, crappy workers - and everybody knew it. And I got a reputation for being very effective in my work, but don't screw with me, which made a lot of interactions easier. People treated me (at least outwardly) with respect.

And now, I feel good about what I did there. Those guys felt some pain from their actions, and they changed - at least somewhat because of it. I had been harassed and assaulted at a previous workplace, and I just scuttled and hid. I feel crappy about that now, because those guys almost surely harassed and assaulted other young women after me. 

If you think you are going to quit, why not make it better place for others that will come after you? Why not feel how good it feels to know that you matter?",sezit,t2_ax1yw,2,0,reddit1

Point here is they made a proposition. Accept or not is your choice. The proposition itself is no offence, it just means they find you attractive & would like you.

HR will follow their policies, which includes limiting the company's liability, but often the policies depend, to some degree, on how bad/serious the victim makes it out to be.  For example, reporting Event A as, ""I actually don't mind a bit, I love being one of the guys, but I'm worried that Jim isn't showing good judgment, and could hurt someone who has a different outlook, or even expose the company to liability,"" might result in mandatory training and a warning, while that same Event A being reported as, ""I know it might seem like an overreaction, but I've got a level head and I've never felt this way before-- work used to seem like a safe place where I could count on everyone being professional and where I was developing some friendships, but now I'm constantly wondering how many people think the same way that Jim does, and how many people don't think that way but also are perfectly find going along with it,"" might result in Jim getting terminated.  This wouldn't be because their policy directly corresponds to the perceived harm, but because the perceived harm is one of several inputs and considerations they use when deciding which parts of their policy apply in this case.  Even if you present the information as judgment and opinion free as possible, your feelings are very relevant, and if you don't volunteer them, they'll ask.  The only thing I'd advise you to do is to make no mention of lawyers or suing, either way: don't raise them as possibilities, and don't try to reassure them that you wouldn't go that route.  Just avoid using those words/concepts altogether, at least for your initial report.

My other opinion is that you should talk privately to the two women who left the table, either separately or together, and just lay out how you feel and what you hoped their reaction would be.  I would focus on your feelings and your thoughts; those are facts that can't be denied or argued with, and are less threatening than framing things in terms of objective reality.  So while it might be a fact that they got up and left, stating that might put them on the defensive, and they'll shut down and not engage in an honest way.  Instead, saying something like, ""I realized that I was hoping for and to some degree even expecting you to help change the way the discussion was going, so it felt to me as if your simple act of leaving the table was like being abandoned.  I have no idea if that's what you were thinking, and I don't know how some impartial third party watching us would have perceived it, but that's what it felt like to me,"" invites the person you're talking with to look at it like a problem they have a chance to help with, and makes it easier to empathize with you-- you're talking about your feelings, not (directly) about what they did or didn't do.  You still wind up learning what they were thinking at the time, what (if anything) they'd like to do better at in the future, and so on; but narrating the events as objective facts about a chronology of events is perceived differently (by most people) than talking about how you felt, how you are now feeling every day, etc.",,,0,0,reddit1

Unless your employer has a no dating policy between employees, there’s nothing wrong with a coworker letting you know they’re interested in you or with other employees thinking you might be good together, so for that part, you should just let them know you don’t reciprocate, and you should both move on.  
2.	Where it sounds like you may have a complaint is if the other employee actually confined you and whether one or both of them persisted after you demonstrated you were uninterested or uncomfortable (which you did, right?).  
3.	If either your company has a no relationships policy, you couldn’t have left from the other side of your seat, the conversation got raunchy or the two of them persisted despite  your demonstration of disinterest or discomfort, report them to HR (might be worth talking to HR anyway in order to understand company policy and put them on the lookout for future trouble from those guys), and if you don’t think talking to HR is appropriate (yet?), at the very least, be sure to explicitly inform the guy(s) you don’t want further attention of that type, since SA is defined as unwanted advances.",NotInKY,t2_9ssjn,-1,0,reddit1

It was after the team dinner and there were about 15 of us at a long table in the hotel restaurant/bar having drinks (this is about 20 years ago). I was new to the group (not the company, but the group) and was sitting next to an older male colleague who was one of the team leaders. He was obviously drunk and getting drunker and leaned over and whispered his room number or said something about my coming to his room (can't remember exactly) and I did the same thing: froze, and then I slid my chair a bit away and tried to pretend it didn't happen, just ignored him. He then got angry and started saying stuff, then grabbed my purse and threw it down on the table with everything spilling out. Nobody did anything and I, mortified, collected my stuff from the table, put it back in my purse and said goodnight and left. I don't think I made eye contact with anyone at any of the sessions the next day, and nobody said anything. On the next business day back in the office, the woman from HR came to me and said someone had reported it and she wanted to know if I wanted to provide any additional detail but it wasn't necessary because they had enough from the person/people.

I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure sexual harassment off the clock is still illegal (I googled ""does sexual harassment off the clock count"" and most of the websites I saw said yes because it can contribute to a hostile work environment). 

Here's a bit of unsolicited advice if you want to make a complaint (copy pasted from my previous comment) :

If you report this to HR, please make sure it's in writing, preferably an email, with your personal accounts BCC'd as a way to keep a copy of yourself. Here's a template:  
  
Dear Employer,  
  
I am writing to report harassment I experienced on \[date\] from \[harasser name\]. The harassment is severe, pervasive, and it's causing a hostile work environment for me. \[Briefly explain what the harasser did\]  
  
What can the company do to help?  
  
Respectfully,  
  
Emma\_Kay  
  
I ripped it straight from an employment lawyer's Instagram (Attorney Ryan Stygar). Feel free to edit as necessary. It is critical that the complaint (or recap of the report to HR) is in writing. If they don't do anything, contact an employment attorney (a lot of them offer free consults and work on contingency \[you don't pay them until you win\]). If they fire you, you have proof of retaliation. Sexual harassment is illegal in all 50 states, and so is retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. Good luck!

I'd ask him about his job all the time, I asked if there were women at the job sites too and he was like, yeah sometimes there are and they do the same stuff we do when we work together. So I thought oh hell yeah I wanna do that, cause uncle was in the same local, grandpa retired from that same local, I thought it'd be cool to do it too.

I’ve noticed a trend over the past 10 years especially wherein employees seem to feel disempowered and unable to resolve matters of conflict on their own, preferring a more punitive top-down approach defined by having HR resolve matters—speaking more broadly, and not just when dealing with sexual harassment. In the case at hand, however, I think from your description of events that it’s entirely possible an expression of disinterest on your part might well have concluded matters in the moment—based primarily off your description on your interactions from the rest of the day/evening. Hopefully, shutting-down that advance in the moment would relieve matters sufficiently-enough for you to feel safe and comfortable in the environment you were collectively in together, but I know others who would not have felt so afterwards. But either way, a note or email at minimum to HR at least to document that the incident took place would likely be in order so that you can have it for reference in case you should need it in the future—hopefully you don’t, though, and things do return as they were!

I've personally met those who were very much into it & those who themselves were the ones to try seducing me (perks of being a single man), just as I've met those who weren't into it & I let them be upon learning their disinterest. Besides the world is full of 70-90 year old men marrying hot 20yr old models (not saying that's ideal, but that's women gladly chasing after men old enough to be their grandpa for money or whatever other reason) . There's no ""one-approach fits all"" esp when it comes to women who are way too difficult to understand. 

I'm not saying their approach was ideal, especially as we don't have the full picture here. But from what we see here, ""I'm down if you are, just so you know"", emphasis on ""IF YOU ARE JUST SO YOU KNOW"". There's nothing forceful or pushy here. Just letting you know if u are interested, I am too. In this case, she wasn't, so let them know that & leave, case closed. They persist after learning that, then it becomes an issue.

I'm not being unsympathetic to the plight of women who have been abused out there.

Sexual harassment can be not directed toward you, such as an inappropriate conversation between two people in the workplace or work related events.

Does the work event call for an all nighter? Where does the event begin and end? Where is the transition from leaving work to a “night out”?

This is where I’m saying everything gets gray, and it changes depending on workplace relationship if they were a supervisor.

Best advice in this thread is to address the HR handbook and see what it says

Some things that can clarify my thought process:

-“For workplace harassment to be illegal, the conduct must either be severe (meaning very serious) or pervasive (meaning that it occurred frequently). One instance of harassing conduct is generally not sufficient, unless the conduct is very serious, such as a physical assault.”



https://www.eeoc.gov/youth/harassment-faqs#:~:text=No.,at%20a%20work%2Drelated%20conference.


OP may have a legal duty before anyone can take actions to inform the offender that what he said made you uncomfortable and was inappropriate, but actions must be pervasive for the employer to become involved and constitute as harassment.

The comment was lewd and rude, but may not be considered harassment. There is no clarification of a quid pro quo situation.

Sexual harassment outside the workplace can take the form of a boss becoming too pleasant or making physical contact with an individual at an offshore work function. It can also be harassment that takes place on social media networks. While on business trips, employees may engage in inappropriate behavior.

Yes, some men don't take rejection well. Yes, some women don't feel comfortable being asked out under specific circumstances. As I said, there is no one-approach fits all. It's up to ppl to be responsible adults & learn about each other, relate accordingly & if rejected by either party, gracefully accept it & move on. Plenty of fish in the sea.

I'm not advocating disrespect towards women, I love & respect women (well those who respect themselves anyway). But what one woman may find disrectpectful, another may find bold & like that. Human beings are different, it's why we should learn to keep an open mind & learn about ppl.

If we pay her ""under the table,"" true she doesn't have to pay income taxes, but we're not paying any payroll taxes either, which means she gets *no* credit for working towards social security, disability, or unemployment. :-/  Not to mention, she has a green card, and if she were found to be working illegally, she could lose it and be deported!

Getting paid under the table is short-term gain for long-term risk and loss, and it benefits the employer way more than the employee overall. :-/  Keep in mind that the first $5,950 you make doesn't pay Federal income taxes at all... but your employer is supposed to be paying $428.40 in payroll taxes on that money, which is for YOUR future security.

Paying under the table is also often a way to get around Worker's Compensation laws, so that if someone's injured on the job, you don't have to pay, because they can't prove they were working for you. It keeps your insurance premiums down, too.",Pixelated_Penguin,t2_5abpb,10,0,reddit2

He came home with his severance package and paid off their mortgage.

As a guy, I’m always happy whenever I hear or see female friends or acquaintances doing trades stuff. Fixing cars, welding, building airplanes, etc. None of that should be limited to men.

If they handed you some cupons and your weld was up to snuff you were hired!

We even had some female welders.  One was part of a group that we hired on for a job and another was one of our regulars who stuck around for quite awhile.  

I was a tech/troubleshooter, not a welder.  The same held true for my field.  If you were actually skilled, we wanted you and didn't give a shit about sex, race, or anything else.  

Yeah, assholes are everywhere and you will find a group of racist or sexist fucks no matter what field it is but for the most part people didn't care.

Which, their advantage still remains. Sexism is huge in tech, and it's virtually never levied against men, only women.

They take it as a personal attack against them as indivuals and a collective.

To a degree some resistance is understandable imo. For example certainly the average man can't do anything by himself to change society and they as indivuals have things going on in their own lives but the fact that the near default response to calling out misogynistic behavior, sexism and inequality is to essentially respond with a childish ""I'm rubber and you're glue whatever you say bounces of of me and sticks to you!"" mentality is disheartening.

Let's take the word misandry. A term now in the common lexicon that was made as a reactionary response by men to changing social structures that put women on an increasingly equal playing field. But to men it was perceived as a loss of status and control. A challenge and a derision  to their masculinity and the concept itself.

Just yesterday in true unpopular opinion I observed several men allude to this view point.

Saying things like men should basically collapse society to punish women.

That actually men being accused of rape is really the issue and rape is overblown and not a big deal. 

That misandry is the default in western societies. Which is actually  delusional, which I let  them know.

Men absolutely can not stand that women have any perceived power or advantage  over them. And ultimately it comes down to the fact that  Men imo know intuitively that they need and want women more than women want them.

They will do whatever they can to turn it around and blame women but the reality is men see women as objects of conquest and dominance. Living breathing proof of their validity as men, the guaruntee of their lineage. A caretaker emotionally and domestically. A sex toy who owes them regular satisfication because they are hard working good men and protectors who have needs. Instsbitabke constant needs right lol? Men are just dumb kids in adult bodied right? . They just need a full belly an empty sack and a clean house. Lmao so cute and adorkably mysoginistic.  But also the way men are portrayed on TV is awful and misandrist  and women did it!  Why do feminist never think of men?

I don't hate men, and the reality is as a trans woman transitioning as an adult  I don't have the experiences my fellow women do, I have and still have for now male privilege but I do have some insight into men when they definitely don't think anything resembling a woman is around. And I've seen how sexual assault is dismissed and justified starting  very early in adolescent boys as boys will be boys.  I have heard basically every woman I've ever known have some story of if not sexual assault, rape and abuse, being sexualized  as children by adult men, not even always post puberty. I have heard so many women explain the uncertainty of an unknown or new man and I've seen men dismiss it as hysteria and sexism, and then pretend they are brave protectors from the usually unspecified but implicitly male threat when they hear about later but in the moment? The average man understand the danger another man poses to him.

As a woman (who works in tech), I will readily admit that I AM emotional, particularly when it comes to men. 


I am SO emotional when men aren’t around - and I think that emotion is called happiness. I actually experience deep, pure, overwhelming JOY when I find myself to be completely devoid of their presence in my daily life. I am tickled PINK when men are nowhere to be found throughout the course of my day, whether that be in my immediate space, or in my line of sight. I might as well have an orgasm. 


It’s a real damn shame that men refuse to use their supposedly “superior minds” to recognize that when an event is advertised for WOMEN, they ARE NOT welcome. 


I used to be reasonable and thoughtful in my interactions with men, but since the majority of them are egocentric leeches, my well of fucks has officially run dry. 


I adore the men in my life who are good, gracious, thoughtful, and kind. These men are incredible, loving, and sensitive souls who advocate for and protect their female (and queer and NB) friends. Even better, they shut down and ostracize men who don’t. But the number of men that I know who possess those qualities is LOW, and I’m tired of pretending otherwise. 


Men, disrespectfully, GO AWAY. Quit infiltrating spaces for women. Quit harassing women. Quit forcing your presence on women. I know you can’t comprehend that we DO NOT want to “network” or “collab” or “connect” with you at a women-only networking event, but I am VERY confident that one day, it’ll click. Especially when you boys start getting a reputation and are subsequently blacklisted from these events.

I run a sapphic space that welcomes enbies, including AMAB enbies, regardless of their presentation. It would still be *painfully obvious* if a cis dude were trying to invade. Because the intent is **so clear**.",InfinitelyThirsting,t2_3btb7,22,0,reddit4

k3p01vx,t3_170nkh1,2023-10-06 09:14:51,TwoXChromosomes,"I think people missed the point, this is not like...a ""women only"" concert.

&#x200B;

This is ""we need people of a specific type to do a specific job.""

In this case it's people who want to work in tech.

Who are also female.

So no women who want to work in beauty...

No women who want to work as a vet...

And no men or non-binary people who want to work in tech.

&#x200B;

There are companies which need female employees for certain roles and want female presence within their team (we have a biologically different mindset, that's a fact.)

In tech, most employees are men.

Therefore any job fair will give you lots of men to employ.

If you want to find female tech employees, you may need to specifically search for them.

**That's what the fair was for, to make that search easier.**

And the guys who showed up will not have got jobs, because those employers were not looking for that.

&#x200B;

This event was designed to specifically bring in female potential employees, which are otherwise hard to find.

The guys showing up was like astronauts showing up at a farmer job fair...you guys are not the intended audience, employers are not looking for you. This is not for you. You will get nothing.

But you will waste time and make these employers less likely to take part in these events in future...thus making it harder for them to find female employees and for female employees to find jobs.

**You win nothing.**

**You punish companies and female tech employees...because you think you are the victim here.**

&#x200B;

TO THE MEN WHO THINK THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO BEHAVE...

Everything is not for you

You are not the victim of someone not wanting you.

And if that bothers you so much, you should talk to someone about your mental health problems.

Also, if you are the kind of guy who shows up at female job fairs because he has no job...

Your mindset is the reason you have no job.

You are staring at the problem.

Also...

Do you also show up to other peoples weddings uninvited too and complain that weddings should be open to all?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FINALLY, A PERSONAL STORY...

I NEVER wanted my sex to define myself or my career.

I have NEVER used my sex to benefit my career or my life.

I have NEVER wanted or appreciated special treatment for being a woman.

However I have had companies come to me because I am a woman.

They have tried far more experienced, very competent men who cannot do the job as well as a woman.

And I'm learning that, even though I was trained to write for very conservative, male audiences and am masculine in personality...I can write for female audiences as well as I write for male.

MOST male writers however cannot write well for female audiences.

But they will kick up all shitting Hell on a job post if a company is only hiring female writers.

'According to a 2021 study done in the USA by Xactly, women make up only 29% of sales representatives and just 26% of sales managers even though they are proven to outperform their male colleagues.'

Full of other interesting facts, like how a fifth of Aussies agree that gender inequality doesn't actually exist. 

More general impact of women on performance from Entrepreneur.com: https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/remember-the-ladies-5-reasons-your-sales-team-needs/300990

""... McKinsey reported that companies it looked at in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. 

And a report by Catalyst found that those businesses it surveyed that had the most females had on average, a 42 percent greater return on sales, a 53 percent better return on equity and a 66 percent greater return on invested capital.""

The article goes on to report that in response to losing a multimillion dollar deal due to not being able to connect with women decision makers, Deloitte spent a bunch of money on a report they found so compelling, they hired paid actors to learn how to sell to women.

As another example, I come from an evangelical background, and in that world it is ""known"" that only Christians are capable of being good people, and so their view of the world makes them significantly more likely to hire other evangelicals if they think they can get away with it. But in their heads that is always ""hiring the best people"" as an unassailable axiom. It is just how it is, because it is how it is. They don't question if, because questioning it would be a lack of faith.

Then they will constantly complain about ""quotas"" because they *know* they are only hiring the best, and how can that be discriminatory?

I think there is a level of arrogance there that cannot be discounted. It is not just that they hire people they have experience hiring, that is actually a pretty charitable interpretation, but also that they hire people who look, act and think like they do because they clearly believe that people *just like them* are the ""best.""",Caelinus,t2_emecd,4,0,reddit4

By that reasoning all emotions are survival responses. Love, for example,  helps people find someone to mate with and raise a child. So, according to you love is not an emotion. It's just a survival response.

k3o9r06,t1_k3niulu,2023-10-06 03:48:48,TwoXChromosomes,"They're not mutually exclusive. None of the CS classes I taught in h.s. were close to parity. The math club was majority girls, perhaps because the genius who started it was a girl. In a class I took on equity in CS, we were taught that stereotype threat is such that the teen years are too late to inoculate the underrepresented against the tech-geek stereotype. It must be opposed by middle school at the latest--the bubble-up theory.

As recently as 1980, women held 70% of the programming jobs in Silicon Valley: https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/11/1056917/tech-fix-gender-problem/ (claims the problem is not enough women at VC firm--a trickle-down theory)

Another headwind is that whistle-blowers tend to be women. Anonymous whistleblowers are, by extension, *presumed* to be women, creating misplaced tension.

Previous discussion here
https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/11rffgi/computer_science_teachers_what_have_been_your/
indicated the solution is to start out at parity in the first place, by having women teach the subject in grade school. One CS department chair I met had great success with girls enrolling in her classes, but she was the opposite of the geek stereotype--very pretty and preppy. She had little CS training, though, never mind CS ed training. That may be a worthwhile tradeoff, though.

Much of what underrepresented groups need to be inoculated against is the inevitable frustrations of debugging being misinterpreted as an indication one doesn't belong: https://quorasessionwithalinelerner.quora.com/How-should-software-engineers-go-about-preparing-for-technical-interviews-1

To complicate things further, I've seen in (private) high school teaching and read that in tech industry, those hired later get more money. Employees who figure this out are incentivized to be disloyal and jobhop.

There are some incredible respectful and wonderful men involved in the women's ERG at my workplace, and I love to see them there! Just like what happened at this event, women in tech are often bombarded with messaging that we were diversity hires, or part of a hiring push to only hire women, and that we are being given advantages that men aren't.  Seeing men like yourself wanting to raise women up and be allies really helps people like me that struggle with imposter syndrome.  It is important for women to be able to have their own spaces, but something like a professional conference I think is fine to have men at, as long as they are willing to listen and learn and give the women around them a voice.  Sure, some women there could be bothered by it, but for others, and most importantly your students, having you there will be a benefit.

So if you WANT to go, you absolutely should.  But if you don't want to go and are only considering it because of pressure from your students, go ahead and sit it out.",Cupcakes_4_All,t2_7cj5l,2,0,reddit4

Know your worth. You deserve to stand up for yourself and speak up when things are causing you any discomfort. If you don’t think you’re worth it, get therapy because you definitely are. If men can be unafraid of speaking up for themselves when they don’t even have a leg to stand on, women can speak up for themselves as well (especially since we tend to not speak up unless we are SURE we’re right*). It’s okay to shake because that is your body’s way of preparing you for a fight or flight response. Keep your voice loud, level and not too high or too deep. You want to think of your words and tones as knives cutting straight to the bone of the point. Practice in you alone time (I like the shower) to say what you REALLY want to say.

A scenario happened this morning and I was doubting how I’d handled it because I wasn’t very nice but your post made me feel a lot better.

Me and a few other people were standing outside an allergist office waiting either to get our immunotherapy shots or to have a nurse approve the injection site. We were all wearing masks and standing 6 feet apart.

One man starts scooting closer to me and every time he steps closer, I step away. First of all, social distancing... second of all, what the fuck.

He goes: I don’t bite

My response: that’s okay (thinking it was maybe his way of acknowledging he made me uncomfortable? Idk)

Him: well I might nibble a little

Me, firmly: no thank you 

Him: it’s just a joke

And then I ignored him. All morning I battled with myself about if I should’ve just laughed at it and moved on? 

Your post reassured me that I don’t need to make him comfortable about his sexual harassment after he made me extremely uncomfortable.

There 3 proper steps to an apology. First is to be remorseful and say the words, I’m sorry. Second is to admit how that person has wronged you, in this case, using your personal contact for personal gain off hours, which lead to the constant pushing of boundaries and discomfort at your expense. Third is to promise to never do said thing that has wronged you.

State the remorse and apologize (I’m sorry), state the real problem at hand (using your personal info for gain and not respecting your boundary of your personal life), promise to never do it again.

Apologies feel heartfelt and sound sincere, but if it’s not proper, it doesn’t matter and it’s to make the abuser feel better.

I’m not trying to humble brag or anything of the sort but I really do worry every time I’m starting a new job or go into a new situation that there’s gonna be some guy who will creep out on me and make things awkward and generally bad. Usually it’s my customers. But I’m going into a new career and started an internship a few months ago. Thankfully, it’s been good. The guys I’ve been working with have attachments so I don’t feel bad being friendly with them. We also have had to exchange numbers for work communication. Honestly I was wary of that but for fuck’s sake it’s needed. 

Now, here’s a couple of stories about customers:

Walk out to my car and there’s a note about how he likes me and wants to go out. Damnit. I go back in and show my coworkers and they have my back and my manager will butt in if needed. I start my drive home. It’s a two lane (when cars go the same direction) road and who drives up next to me and keeps speed? The customer who left me the note. Yelling to me asking if I got his note. I had to roll my window down and tell that I have a boyfriend and then nonchalantly speed up. He caught me at work in the drive through to apologize for a very long and awkward time. 

Customer at a different branch: talks to me about how he likes foreign women and asks if I have a boyfriend. Next time he comes in, again, talks about how attractive he finds me and double checks if I have a boyfriend. Next time he comes in again talks about my looks and asks if I plan on being with my boyfriend much longer. He asked me about my relationship status and how long we’ve been together and plan on being together two more times. Whenever they could, my coworkers ran interference but it just wasn’t always possible. 

I swear, there should be a class taught on how and where it’s appropriate to hit on someone and how to accept rejection.",,,13,0,reddit1

I think it created a lot of good discussion (along with bad but that is part of the territory). It gave me new information on the women's perspective.

First of all I want to address your specific situation. What that man did was completely inappropriate. He should not have abused the access he got due to work to hit on you. I'm almost positive he knew what he was doing was crossing a line, and calling people like him out as a bad example is important.

But your post has also brought up the discussion of a lot more subtle things that make women uncomfortable, which I think a lot of men genuinely do not know. 

I think education about these things is important because certain men might not ever think of these on their own, not because they lack empathy, but simply because they lack a woman's perspective.

This was not an innocent mistake, at best it's an ignorant mistake. Like this sounds like a dude that is not aware of anyone's reality aside from his own. And when confronted with another reality, he resists it and pushes back. 

Like I feel like a lot of men might read this story and think"" but he didn't do anything wrong"". And this may come from a place of empathy, because dudes May feel for the dude having reached out and been rejected. Especially because it seems nonviolent.

I can see this train of thought, and where it comes from. The story changes as soon as OP says she's uncomfortable though. Like put yourself in that position as a dude , maybe you misread something, maybe you just find her attractive, so you reach out to her and be vulnerable.

First and foremost When You're vulnerable and ask someone out you have to respect how they react. By being vulnerable you are making yourself uncomfortable, understand that reaching out and asking someone a question like this has a chance of hurting. Trying to put that hurt on the person that you asked out is fucked up. 

That's aside, the main point, you decide to ask someone out, which in this situation on paper it's not an okay deal. This man should not have asked out someone within a week of working with them. They have no relationship , so therefore is there is no trust. But again that's not the point. He just didn't see this through his own ignorance and decided to ask her out. So he doesn't know anything oh, your girl out, and as soon as they say they are uncomfortable. Now he knows.

Even if he didn't know anything before , he now knows that he made her uncomfortable. At which point a reasonable thing to do is profusely apologize, and take a couple hundred steps back. It isn't to push forward. This to me is truly Unforgivable. I can understand or older man not understanding how his actions can make people uncomfortable. It's fucked up, but understandable. Pushing forward, even though they know, make the dude an hole. 

In summary , it tracks to feel for the dude in the original context of asking. Even though having enough social awareness to not too, should be the goal. I can understand why people don't see what he did as problematic.

I worked in a manufacturing plant as an engineer and would talk to the machine operators on my way in to my desk. Just friendly things, like ""how are you"", ""how was your weekend"", common decency things. One guy that I chatted with, who was at least 30 years older than me (fresh out of college at the time), asked me out for drinks after work after inviting me over to his house (which I declined). He blew up at me about how I would go to lunch with a group of male coworkers but wouldn't go get drinks with him. He later came to talk to me again about how he hoped that we would still be able to chat and things wouldn't change. Absolutely no fucking way. I don't even want to think about how badly getting drinks with a coworker could have gone for me. At my next job a male coworker I was friends with and around my age and I were talking about how to establish good working relationships with the mechanics at our facility. He explained he gets along with them and grabs a beer with them after work occasionally. I explained how that is in no way appropriate for me to do and how that could be dangerous for me and told him the story I shared here.

Women are too frequently sexualized in these scenarios. As a female engineer I'm usually surrounded by mostly men, which isn't a huge deal for me. I therefore end up with a lot of male friends and coworkers, also not inherently a problem. When rumors then spread about who all I'm ""seeing"" of those coworkers, that's a problem that is damaging to my reputation and thereby my career.

One last bit for me to get off my chest, before leaving my last job, I would avoid sitting at my desk as a creepy director level manager got an office with a glass wall right next to it and would watch me as I left or sat down at my desk. All the reports about him never went anywhere, because the culture within management normalized and excused this behavior. He had made blatant comments at another female coworker and me about our appearance and our personal lives and asking if my coworker was single.

Forcing someone else to do your work is the fundamental exchange of injustice. 

Whether that takes the form of chattel slavery, or hostile social environments, or just making someone else manage your emotions for you. It's all different flavors of the same insidious dynamic, and it hurts all of us.

Our society is not some static set of conditions, it is something each of us helps shape. Every action and interaction in which we participate every day is another dot on the scatterplot. Anytime we men are not doing our own work we're shifting that picture toward injustice.

Every time we handle our own shit, or respect boundaries, or listen to women, or reject patriarchal bullshit in any of its forms, we are helping others and helping ourselves.

g17k6pr,t3_i7pb9f,2020-08-12 12:59:26,TwoXChromosomes,"I think that the only way this is going to stop is when men realize that women having to live in pain is not working out for them and hurts them and backfires for them at the end of the day. You cannot have half of your team and half of the population constantly living like this (sure it feels good for your ego) and expect it to work out for you. (It’s frankly the same scenario when women of colour talk to white women about things they did that were hurtful and racist and they say they did not mean it so it doesn’t count. And the same occurs with many other oppressions.) It’s not a recipe for prosperity or for people to thrive. Look with the coronavirus the world is projected to be in a recession and the economic effects felt for decades. This could be like kids that grew up or turned 20 in the middle of the Great Depression. Their whole life almost is now  more constrained.

We have got a bad situation and the best thing we can do to have more prosperity in this awful situation is for people to seek equality.

One persons feelings being priviledged over another persons feelings and one person getting to make the other person uncomfortable and then the other person can’t talk about it because that’s hurting their feelings does not make a good team. It’s like if you have to carry a 1000 planks across a room with a friend and you don’t split the load evenly. It’s  is going to make the work much harder and eventually there are going to be big problems. The one person carrying more of it will eventually collapse or be slower and it will be less efficient.

The only thing that benefits in these sorts of situations is ego. It’s not helping men these sorts of situations it’s backfiring horribly for them too.",mixedmary,t2_10yfmr,2,0,reddit1

prime example of his approach is first asking to ask a question and then asking if OP is single.  I feel like a lot of people are overlooking this and that you really shouldn't be making advances if you don't know what your doing.most people who aren't honest with themselves are the problem, whether they think they got it, or justify selfish actions with being nice. 
People meet in the workplace all the time, subordinates, peers, etc. it's always going to happen , but I think if you ever fancy someone where you shit and sleep. you should educate yourself with proper etiquette. Even if you completely disagree with what OP is saying.... it would still benefit you. and yet still benefits OP. it's a fucking workplace, why would you assume anything is okay to do without looking into it at the very least.
   
    
It's not wrong to shoot your shot, but this isn't taking a shot, this is you beating around the bush and not even making motives clear. Said person can't even say no, and is forced to live with your awkward creeping and predictable attempt.  Confidence makes other people comfortable,  there's also nothing more uncomfortable than a flimsy/awakward & weak attempt at others that people can see coming  a mile away with their elbows , and you cant see with your elbows (for the thick headed).

g14fitj,t1_g13qdex,2020-08-11 17:44:23,TwoXChromosomes,"The Sheldon part makes me *so mad*, which has to do with how he’s presented as a character. 

Sheldon has high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Now, the creators and writers of the show will **never** verify that because then it wouldn’t be fun to laugh at him - you’d just be laughing at autism. But every quirk he has (everything has an exact place where it *must* be, always saying things that aren’t socially acceptable, terrified to drive because there are too many unpredictable variables, has his spot where he must sit, etc) are autistic traits. I know this as someone with autism (HFA, but I’m female) who use to get told *all the time* that I remind them of Sheldon. 

Now, misogyny? That’s not autism. There are autistic men like that, but autism does not make you a bigot or a misogynist. I’ve never met an autistic man like Sheldon in that regard, but I’m sure they’re out there. Here’s what makes me upset : to make a character who is obviously autistic a blatant misogynist is normalizing this behavior in men who have a harder time recognizing why that behavior isn’t right. You may think it’s obvious after watching this video, but a laugh track is affirmation to someone with autism who is trying to learn what is and isn’t acceptable. Misogyny is in there along with all of the nerd stuff that looked down on by society but is actually perfectly fine. It’s adding someone bad in with things that are good/okay and blurring the lines between them.

The women put up with so much absolute *bullshit* from the men and no one seems to learn anything.

However Howard getting turned on by women in that gym scene seems like it should not be sexist. Which is dumb because almost all of Howard's lines are sexist. He didn't really engage with them in any way (irl he would have drawn their attention, but I'm working with the lore the show presents that he did not)... he just had a reaction to their appearance that was presented as not involving them. Is that sexist? You could say it's unfaithful, but the line he delivers sounds like he and his wife outlined boundaries that he's honoring. He didn't try to speak with them, he didn't obsess over them, or even leer at them intentionally. it seems like he didn't do anything except glance at women and privately over-react to his arousal. Is sexuality sexist?

g13q52m,t1_g13mwry,2020-08-11 14:12:27,TwoXChromosomes,"I used to work for a very popular local pizza place, taking phone orders when I was 19. We had rules that female delivery drivers weren't allowed to work nights, which was our busiest period and you got the most tips, because men were so freaking creepy. One time some guy stood behind my coworker's car and wouldn't let her out of his driveway, demanding she go on a date with him.

There were also many instances where creepy people would hit on me OVER THE PHONE while I was trying to take their order because they realized I was a young girl. I was asked multiple times ""Are YOU going to be delivering my pizza?"" When that happened, we always sent a male driver. On more than one occasion they were greeted by a naked man, a man in his boxers, or a man in their robe who ""accidentally"" let their dick fall out as they opened the door, only to be greeted by a disgruntled 45 year old dude instead.

We also ended up having to get a set of store cell phones for our female delivery drivers because they would often have to call or text customers to say that they were outside of an apartment complex or something. The amount of times men were harassing, texting, calling, etc. the female drivers after they delivered the food was insane, which is why we had to get the store phones. Sometimes men would call the store and ask to speak to our female delivery drivers as well to ask them out, which was just infuriating.

I had some guy hear me talk as I took his order, tell me it was like ASMR and that my voice was beautiful, then switch his order from delivery to carryout. This fucker showed up in the store and was trying to secretly record me talking using his phone! It was really weird and when I noticed I refused to talk anymore and someone else had to do it.

EDIT: for all the people claiming the store was great for protecting us, they were not. They got the phones for legal reasons and hired a sex offender who harassed the hell out of the female staff until 5 of us quit.",RedPlanit,t2_1673gu,1660,0,reddit1

g1496ks,t1_g13mwry,2020-08-11 16:54:22,TwoXChromosomes,"I hate how common this is. I used to work as a security guard in my early 20s. This company mainly employed senior citizens but was trying to get more young people to apply. So this got me a lot of attention, unwanted attention. Being a young female security guard, a lot of people approached me more often than my coworkers. A lot of them also felt that it was appropriate to touch me. Touch my arm, my waist, my hand, my back, I hated it so much. Everyone did this and it was infuriating. But then there were the people that would take it too far and thought that their advances were welcome.

 There was the time I got a new position as a secondary supervisor at the biggest hospital in my city. Our security was contracted to oversee the parking lot as well as the parking booth. We were different from the main hospital security but as we handled money, we had a lot of contact with them. On my first day, I went to the cafeteria in the basement for my lunch where one of the hospital security guards saw me and introduced himself. Turns out he also worked for my company and was looking for extra shifts in the parade. He asked if I would be able to help him get more shifts and I said sure, that if we need spares that I would consider him for those shifts. He asked for my number and I did give it to him but that was due to my number not being on a contact list yet and being a supervisor, all the staff would need to gwt a hold of me. This was a bad idea. Few days later he texts me and asks if I'm single.. i end up going off on him about how that is an inappropriate question and that i am his supervisor and that him having my number was strictly for work purposes. He apologized and I didn't talk to him again. I went out of my way to make sure that any time I had a hospital security escort (needed to get to the booth and as we handled money) that it was never that guy. I also made sure to report it to my own supervisor. 

That wasn't as bad as the time I was contracted to work at one of the bigger malls. The security cameras were broken and they needed extra guards that were essentially just walking talking cameras. The mall of course had their own security which lead to the problem. I had worked there for about a month and I was friendly to everyone. I would talk to a lot of employees in the stores and make sure that they're having a good day. As I would do my normal rounds, one of the mall security guards crossed my path. This happened regularly and I didn't think anything of it. We got to talking and he asked if I had any contact numbers of the malls security, I said I just have my radio to contact them. He offered to exchange numbers and said it would be a good idea to be in contact with them in case I don't have my radio. I agreed it would be a good idea, especially if I was starting work and no one was in the office for me to get a radio. Again, bad idea. This guy started texting me during my shift and it started getting weirder and weirder. He eventually asked if i have a boyfriend. I was weirded out but said no and his response ""what?? I can't believe you don't have one?!"" I was obviously creeper out, tried to make a joke of it and stopped texting him. One day I stopped to talk to a kiosk employee as he was by himself working. He did end up flirting with me but I laughed it off and walked away. Immediately I ran into that same security guard who looked PISSED. I was friendly and asked how it was going. He had a death glare on the other guy saying he was flirting with me. I cautiously said yes, I knew but wasn't interested. He just kept glaring at him, then said i can't believe you dont have a boyfriend. After that I immediately left as I felt incredibly uncomfortable. A few days later, I saw a couple of kids kicking a ball near the escalator where people were walking. I kindly stopped the ball and asked them not to kick it in here as people were walking and pointed out all the people around them. They said sorry and they wouldn't do it again and we had a pretty nice talk about how the ball was a gift, good kids. I later ran into that guard again where he made a comment about me talking with those kids. That took me by surprise as there were no other guards around at that time. I hate that it took me longer to realize he was watching me on the security camera (one of the working ones). At this point I did a nervous laugh and said yeah, those kids were just being kids. Made an excuse about doing my rounds, saw my coworker and tried to walk towards him. The guy got angry and said that my coworker was into me and stormed off. I was shocked and tried to shake it off as we did do our rounds immediately after that. I also made sure I wasn't alone the rest of that shift. Once I got home that day he texted me again. He started out with ""i cant believe you dont have a boyfriend"" again.. after that he said if he were my boyfriend he would do this and that with me (it was years ago and I dont remember exactly what he said. It wasn't secual though). At this point I got angry, this guy was married and he's saying and doing all of this. So I just went off about how I dont appreciate him talking to me like this and I'm sure his wife wouldn't either. And for him to never speak to me again. He apologized over and over again but I never answered him. After that, I was scared to go to work. I was scared to be on camera. I used to make funny faces or smile at the cameras cause I felt I was friends with all of the guards. But never felt comfortable around the cameras again. I'm extremely impressed with how things enfold next, as I started a shift on a Sunday and there was only 1 guard working then, I took the bus so I was an hour early for work (either that or being late). I went in to grab the key to our security room to just sit there until my shift but he said i should hang out with him in there instead. This guy was extremely fun, super nice, 0% creepy so I felt comfortable around him and I did. We got to talking, lots of laughing, he like the others were trying to recruit me to work for them. He then made a comment about the creepy guard and how uncomfortable it can be around him. I made a small comment about how it would be worse for me. He just stopped, looked at me, and asked straight up if he had tried anything. I looked at him and felt I could trust him and told him what happened, everything. He got really upset and said that he was immediately going to report it to his assistant supervisor, as he was the one working that day and said that he was sorry that had happened to me. Later during my shift, I got called to their office and not just the assistant supervisor was there but the head supervisor. They both apologized to me and said that they never want anything like this to happen let alone for me to feel so uncomfortable. We talked it out and I felt much better about the situation. The next day, I was called into their HR to discuss this, i told them first hand every interaction I had with him which as I was telling them about the kids amd the camera, I realized that he had been stalking me on the cameras. This explained why on my rounds I always ran into him and in the weirdest areas. HR and the head supervisor already came to this conclusion and just nodded while I looked horrified. Luckily I saved every single text which I gave to them as well as written up a 4 page report. A few days later I ran into the creepy guard as he was being escorted into the locker room by the supervisor and another guard. He got his stuff and I found out later he was terminated. 

In both these instances I only exchanged numbers specifically for work and both of them took advantage. After that I never gave out my number, even to coworkers unless we were actually friends and if they had zero creepiness.",OminousNinja13,t2_3p7sedo9,6,0,reddit1

That sounds like HR questions about their liability in this situation from a lawsuit, since they are more likely to get a lawsuit from an upper level executive than a entry level associate. 

They can certainly argue is wasn’t sexual harassment since it (idk from facts here) likely isn’t repeated, and maybe unwanted by your answer, but I could see the company argue that it wasn’t even a sexual advance since he just recommended a hotel (again, facts presented here) and didn’t say explicitly that he wanted to take you to the hotel to have sex. Now, a single incident can be considered sexual harassment if it deemed by the court to be very severe.

Again, I am not saying it’s not clearly implied by the hotel remark. However, HR is there to PROTECT the company, not you.

He could have wanted to ask her for an honest opinion about the company or about whether she thinks he is a good fit for the job. Or maybe he had had a bit of an uncomfortable experience with someone else at work and wanted her take on it. Or perhaps he wanted to ask her if it upset her that he texted her after hours so he could genuinely apologize. 

Those are just a few examples off the top of my head of questions he may have found uncomfortable to ask or unsure of the appropriateness, but would not necessarily have been inappropriate to ask.

g15upmi,t1_g141j8x,2020-08-12 00:24:06,TwoXChromosomes,"Honestly, the men that do this don’t do it in front of men who don’t. And often times the women in our lives don’t talk about it, because they are simply used to it. As a middle class white man, I was about 20 before I actually saw a man harassing women in real life. Before that, it was at most stories on the internet. The problem with stories like this on the internet is that for all we know it could be a one off. Just a singular creep in a sea of nice guys. But in reality, for every one story like this told on the internet, there are probably thousands of women who had similar experiences but said nothing.

Back in my first or second year of college, I was in a group conversation with a handful of women and a few men, and one of the guys made the assertion that public harassment doesn’t happen. Now at the time, I believed the same thing. After all, who would be brazen enough to do that in public? I didn’t even have the confidence to talk to a women I didn’t know in public, and I’d never witnessed this behavior myself. But every single girl there immediately turned on him to tell him how wrong he was, and they all had stories. And that’s when I realized that the reason I never witnessed this myself, is because a man won’t do that to a woman who is with another man. It doesn’t matter if I’m out with three friends who are all ladies, and I’m the only man. Other men won’t take the chance that the one they hit on is “mine” so they leave us alone.

Honestly stories like these are important, and they need to be told all the time. Men can’t actively dissuade this behavior because we don’t see it. It doesn’t happen around us. So we need to be told, and reminded, that this happens. This is real. This is what your sister, your girlfriend, your cousin, your coworkers and even your mother, have to deal with as a member of our society, and it’s not okay.",Jimmyginger,t2_e6lc1,3,0,reddit1

Someone above put it well, I thought. 

“In my experience, the kind of man who will hit on you in an inappropriate setting, will also take rejection inappropriately. And that can have huge consequences for women, especially in the workplace.” And it has. 

This man hit on this woman inappropriately. 
The only way he could’ve saved himself, imo, is if he addressed the situation with her the next day AT WORK, apologized and acknowledged how invasive his act was. 

If you didn’t already know, you don’t use your coworkers number, trusted to you for work purposes alone, as a personal invitation to invade her private life. It makes people uncomfortable and honestly pissed off and too many times we’re expected to make the guy feel better for their stupid actions. 

The very fact that so many women on here are supporting op = so many women also feel the same way and this dude and all the guys that do this are wrong and need to check their actions BEFORE they do shit like this.

This sounds like he's sorry she's not comfortable. It does not imply he's sorry he made her uncomfortable, and is a very standard half-apology. The wording helps shift the blame off the person apologizing, at least partially.

A good follow-up would have been ""I overstepped and made you uncomfortable, I'm sorry. I will not do that again."" This could be followed by ""I hope this doesn't impact our professional relationship.""

He messaged her while at work, and instead of owning up and realizing how inappropriate that was, instead he just wants to make sure things are okay between them and just sweep it under the rug. No, and even if he did apologize well, OP is not under any obligation to feel comfortable around him. This should not have happened in the first place.

Also, side note, he didn't just ask about her relationship status.

If the answer was no, she isn't mad (even though she *already said she was uncomfortable*), he gets to pretend everything is fine and he did nothing wrong and then if she is cold toward him in the future, he gets to feel upset about that because she said everything was fine. 

If the answer is yes, she is mad, then he knows he has to put some more effort in to save himself from consequences - not because he actually cares how she feels.

If you don’t think someone not responding to two of your text messages and not interacting with you at all outside of work necessity is not a sign of absolutely no interest then idk what to tell you. 

Sure, guys can’t help being big and strong. They should however, understand the position they put most women in when they make weird advancements such as these. OP is right. What if this guy can’t handle rejection well? She works long hours with him at night where he could easily take advantage of her. How is she going to know whether or not he’s capable of something like that? She doesn’t, because she literally does not know this man.

So then he found out why he had to look up words and had to figure out which facial expressions are appropriate for what time (making apparently)  

He may be autistic, but he's also a genuinely kind, caring person with a love for cats and helping people. He works hard and has a great job. Unfortunately people use that to expect him to always pull 120% when everyone else is barely pulling 60%. But then he's asked why he isnt pulling 150% because 'you're good at it'. Well, that's the point of a specialized skill set isnt it? But that doesnt mean the fucking ceo can badger him to fix his decade old computer with a dead harddrive. 

He's been working on recovering the 'super important' data for weeks. That drive is dead as a doornail. But of course after trying everything in his power he'll get 'its a real shame you couldn't recover that data it was really important'. 

Well dude, if you'd brought it to him several months ago when he asked he could've fixed it. You didnt back up any data and this is your fucking home computer. Dont force IT to do your bitch work for you because you know he cant refuse. 
Same guy demanded my husband set up his wife's new phone. That's not fucking IT work dammit.

I love my husband and hate fucking assholes who take advantage of him. He hasn't had time off since February and even that was fucked up because he was expected to set up an entire telecommuting system in like, 2 days. In a town where we dont even have stoplights and thus lack the infrastructure to telecommute. 

Now with everyone telecommuting they've been bitchy as hell and expect that since they work through lunch or after hours that IT NEEDS to be available like a fucking butler whenever they want. Its 'unacceptable! for them and they all act like it's the fucking end of the world when they turn off their monitor and cant figure out how to fix it. And when he gently and kindly explains he gets 'well someone must've been messing with my stuff, MUSTVE BEEN YOU because it was FINE before you worked on it!'

Or the outright liars who start a ticket with 'and I already restarted' will waste 6 fucking hours going back and forth and then he has to physically go into work because some moron cant be assed to do remote support because it requires clicking a button and reading. 
And he'll restart it and see th at uptime of several weeks. But he's not allowed to call out their lying because it's always fucking senior management that pulls this shit. 

Sorry for the frustrated rant. 

Tldr; my husband is also autistic, I love him and people take advantage of his helpful nature. Treat your IT and sysadmins like human beings please.

They actually lost a lot of what was an in interesting and creative aspect of the show and it got more boring.

After a while I had to stop watching the show because it was too upsetting.

You are right that there is a difference between men with trouble reading social cues and autism and being misogynistic. People with difficulty reading emotions are just like black people or  south asians or east asians or jews or poor people or women or gay people or any other oppressed group. Some are cruel or nasty and self destructive, some are average and some are kind and will go out of their way to help when they have the power. The ones who are kind are improving their lot in life and making beneficial choices.

A person can be disadvantaged in one way and make choices to bully others with less power which disadvantage themselves further or they can make choices to not bully or be a bystander to bullying which improves their lot in life.

I think that there are people with struggles reading emotional cues who got very far in life because they are kind people and for instance men with difficulties this way it’s not easy for them and they do really struggle. It’s exhausting to try to figure things out socially and in terms of what other people are feeling and often they appreciate bluntness because it reduces the burden. (Think of Ian Turing in the Imitation Game when he complains “Why don’t people just say what they mean?!” (btw The Imitation Game was a tad enabling both to him as someone with difficulty socially and also to him as a gay man.) And while they might get a free pass to make women uncomfortable it’s the opposite if they make other men uncomfortable, they can easily get beaten up and many of them were/are bullied and were easy for other men to bully. 

But I think the men with these struggles who were kind to women made friends for themselves with women and the women often helped them surmount and work around their inability to read people and emotional cues. Then some of them got very far in life and accomplished a lot for someone with these struggles through allying and being a team and working together with women in this way. But they would not have been able to have this if they were misogynistic or unable to be together with women without tearing them down so these sorts of shows are actually doing them a disservice in a sense if they are teaching people to enable them in this and teaching them that this sort of behavior is how to be.

Delivery driving for a pizza joint was my first fulltime job out of high school. I was 18, mostly doing night deliveries, and was one on 2 female drivers on staff. The place I worked is well-known in the area, but it was an awful company in so many ways, not least of which the way they treated their staff. We delivered to whatever house was on our rotation next, no matter if they had been creepy over the phone. We drove alone, and so had no backup or protection when things were unsafe. We had to use our own phones to contact customers and let them know we'd arrived/couldn't find their apt., etc. Which meant that we'd get harassed on our personal lines all the fucking time. Sometimes I'd deliver to a naked or almost-naked man, sometimes thered be a long, intentional dick slip, sometimes they were excessively creepy, and sometimes they tried to talk me into not leaving or try to get in my car. Once I was almost jumped for 2 pizzas and a 2 litre of pop (and the nonexistant cash I was supposedly carrying) by 7 adult men who were all drunk. 

And I was lucky. I'm not conventionally attractive, I'm fat, I have no hair, and when on shift I never wore makup and let the ugliness of my uniform do the rest. I look pretty cute when I try, but for my safety I went the opposite direction while working. It took a year before I decided that $5.45 an hour wasn't worth it.

I worked at a fairly well known donut/sandwich shop when I was 15ish. We had creeps all the time.

But it's like slapping someone in the face, and then trying to make them feel bad if they defend themselves. It's not that one shouldn't feel bad for causing distress, it's that it should be on the *initial instigator,* unless the response is so grossly out of proportion as to make it super inappropriate (like if one calls another a bad name and the other person punches them in the face), and harmful to the initial instigator (which running out of the room certainly is not).

The point is it's not healthy to completely absolve yourself of responsibility for how your actions make other people feel.

So there's an entire field of study in evolutionary biology called [Signalling Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory) that looks at how animals signal to each other during situations like sexual selection. It explains this behaviour surprisingly well. There's one section from that wiki that's particularly apt:

> Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, at the risk of undermining the signalling system for the whole population.

So funny enough, wearing a wedding ring when you're single is a ""dishonest signal"". Great way to protect yourself as an individual but you can sort of see how if *everyone* wore a wedding ring it'd stop being a useful signal, people would ""evolve"" to ignore it, and we're back where we started. Not going to happen but it's funny to think about.

Not only does it cut out unnecessary filler, it lets the person know what they are getting into.

For example, if I was going to message a coworker about covering one of my shifts, the proper way to do it would be to message them like this “hey, I need my shift covered next Wednesday, are you available?” You’ll notice that I didn’t include a reason, and I got right to the point. My message is a self contained request, and the recipient is able to make an informed decision from the get-go. Often times what people will do is ask “hey, are you busy next Wednesday?” And now I don’t know if you are looking to invite me out, or get work covered, or something else. I now have to try and navigate that, and figure out what I want before responding. If the initial message had lead with intent, I wouldn’t feel trapped later if I had said I was free, but really wanted my day off. Another bit I threw in there was the lack of reason. It doesn’t matter why I want the day covered, we’re all adults, you shouldn’t need a reason from me, and I shouldn’t use a reason to guilt you into switching shifts.

On the flip side, I just know well enough not to text any of the females I work with on their cells outside of work about their relationship status because it puts them in the uncomfortable position of having to anticipate turning someone down and still maintain a work relationship with them. Male or female, it may be extreme, but I'd say it's practically never a good idea to try and escalate a work relationship unless there's already an outside of work relationship there; like at least getting together socially or something.

I agree he doesn't owe it to anyone to affirmatively make them feel comfortable or safe (although I'd argue he should do it anyway because we should look out for each other) but it definitely was his responsibility to not abuse the contact she gave him, which directly caused her to feel uncomfortable and unsafe.",LikeARealAccountButN,t2_3zkw10u8,3,0,reddit1

I have taken a lot in my 24 years and I just got fed up. I’ve always practiced in the shower what I would want to say after the fact... so I started practicing what I’d want to say BEFORE a confrontation happens. I can’t prepare for every scenario, but I’d see or hear about something happen, and practice what I would want to say and how I would want to say it if I were in said situation, and it weirdly helped! I found that when I had to confront people, I knew what points I wanted to hit and the tone of voice I want to use.


With this all being said... I still shake when I confront someone. I want to shake. It’s OK to shake because that’s your body being ready for potential confrontation and you DO NOT want to let your guard down! Don’t feel bad that if you shake when you confront, but just make sure that your shaking isn’t affecting your voice. You want your voice to stern and loud but controlled.

g146ixd,t1_g13yjk3,2020-08-11 16:34:45,TwoXChromosomes,"The thing is, it’s almost always inappropriate to ask a coworker out. The cases where it isn’t inappropriate are few and far between. The exceptions are basically:

* You’re already friends in a non-work capacity, and you aren’t asking using work resources or on work time, and are asking in an environment where it’s safe for her to say no and/or leave.

* You work in separate departments, and don’t collaborate, and you ask directly if she’s interested in a date, in an environment where she can easily say no and leave (e.g. as you’re leaving to go to your cars). 

* You work together and you’ve gotten to know her fairly well and she’s been actively flirting with you. This doesn’t mean being friendly, this doesn’t mean smiling at you or helping you with things, this doesn’t mean nodding when you flirt at her, this means that she is actively flirting with you and moving the flirting forward, not just smiling and going along with it. Again, this should be asked directly , and in a situation where it’s clearly safe for her to say no and leave. And even this is better to aim for friendship out of work first. 

In all of these cases, the same rule applies for women asking male coworkers out, or any other combination of genders. 

The reason the OP’s situation was inappropriate boils down to basically:

* They did not have the personal rapport to make it appropriate for him to ask her out. 

* They work too closely together to make it appropriate. 

* He used “work” resources (the cell phone number was specifically for him to ask work questions)

* He asked in a way that she couldn’t leave the conversation without his “permission”

* He didn’t ask directly - he instead asked in a way that traps her into bad responses. If she wanted to reject him, there were a few ways it could go. Option 1 would require her to lie and say she had a partner to cut it off at the pass. Option 2 is to say “I’m single but I’m not interested in dating you” which is a pre-emptive rejection and is easily interpreted as rude. Option 3 is that she says “No, I’m single” and not immediately reject him, which is interpreted as interest, and then either he asks and she rejects him (a potentially dangerous prospect if she doesn’t know him well, especially since he’s bigger and older than her), or he doesn’t ask immediately and he works under the assumption of interest (an easy path towards sexual harassment) or he asks later, and either way she’s accused of leading him on. 

* He’s significantly older than her and therefore asking her out requires even more confidence of interest. 

No, he shouldn’t be a wall, but he doesn’t need to ask directly if she’s single. Ask what she’s up to this weekend. Ask if she’s watched anything good recently. 

If he had to ask her out, the more appropriate way to do it would be:

* Develop a friendly rapport first, ideally. 

* Wait until you’re both off work for the day. 

* Physically speaking, keep a healthy distance between the two of you when you ask. Don’t get up in her face or touch her arm or anything while you’re asking. Don’t be hover-y. Just stand a couple feet away facing 3/4 towards them, hands in pockets or on hips or otherwise relaxed. 

* Just ask. “Hey, I’m heading out for the day and I wanted to ask - do you want to go out on a date some time? No pressure, but there’s a great <bar/tapas place/etc> nearby.”

I’m also gonna break down why that ask is good, from the POV of a person being asked this question, who isn’t interested. 

* “Hey, I’m heading out for the day” = “I’m not going to take a lot of your time or hover after this.” Good because it means I know you’re leaving, regardless of the answer. 

* “I wanted to ask” = “I’m about to ask you on a date, but I want to give you an extra second to compose yourself to say yes or no”

* “Do you want to go on a date some time” = “I’m interested in you but I know you may not be interested in me”

* “No pressure” = “If you reject me, I’m not going to freak out at you.” Good because it means you considered that this could be an unsafe or uncomfortable situation for me and you want me to feel safer. 

* “there’s a great <Thing> nearby” = “I’m giving a suggestion if you’re interested, or an extra second to compose yourself if you’re not.”

These situations all made me VERY uncomfortable, and led to them acting immature and ignoring me after walking past me at work and pretending not to see me after I said I wasn’t interested.

It is not okay to randomly ask out a colleague who’ve you not had a conversation with outside of work, or after having her express flat out to you that she is interested.

g17q9de,t1_g16towy,2020-08-12 14:00:02,TwoXChromosomes,"Yeah I have no doubt there are men that think that way. They should not be making fun of you even if they disagree with what you said. I think there should be positive discusstion about this stuff. It is the only way we grow to understand each other better. 

First of all I want to point out there is a difference between understanding why someone acts a certain way and excusing their actions. I am about to try to do the former and not the latter. 

To give a man's perspective: 

I imagine why a lot of those men act this way is because they know they have done similar things or at least might do a similar thing in that man's situation.

Why? Because asking people out is actually pretty complicated. 

It is difficult enough to get up the nerve to even do it, but then men are beginning to be told (rightfully so) that they can also be a bad person for doing in the wrong way.

This can be frustrating for men especially for men who have very little luck with approaching women. 

They might feel like they are being pushed into a smaller and smaller box, given fewer and fewer opportunities to meet someone because for men it is a numbers game. 

And the numbers are even worse for those who aren't really charming or attractive.

All of this boils into a large amount of emotion (sadness covered by anger) and they take it out on you.

As I prefaced this does not excuse their actions. But I do think it is important to put ourselves in their heads, so we can better get through to them.

I think men who have figured it out need to do a better job of guiding those who struggle to do it the right way. Find solutions for their problems that don't involve pushing the boundaries and hurting women.",offxtask,t2_8i4k5,1,0,reddit1

g15kr2k,t1_g15ebrx,2020-08-11 23:00:43,TwoXChromosomes,"I really appreciate the honest questions and I’m happy to expand. First of all, after being told you’ve made someone uncomfortable, to be concerned with their madness is selfish. It’s selfish because if someone who has power over you is mad at you, that is a threat to you. That’s why you would be concerned with their madness. Conversely, if you genuinely felt bad and concerned over having negatively affected them, you would be apologizing, and assuring them it won’t happen again.

It’s difficult to explain the nuances of social interaction, as so much of it is learned through observation. But a lot of the implied responsibility of the woman to rectify the situation is conditioned by society. There’s a really good YouTube series I got sucked into today that addresses a lot of tropes in tv series and movies. And so many of them revolve around men treating women terribly, and women rewarding them for it. Look at the movie Passengers, he’s basically a psychopath who ruined this girl’s life, and he’s rewarded for it. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of movies/tv shows that reinforce this social contract. And as a girl growing up, you’re being shown that if you want to be accepted as a likable person, you need to forgive men immediately for their bad behavior, it’s your job as the cool girl who people will like.

To add to this, the fact that women can so often be stalked, raped, murdered, etc. over simple rejection. What would make her think this man is reasonable? He used his very temporary position to get her phone number for personal means. He doesn’t even know her and he’s hitting on her in the workplace. It’s not socially acceptable behavior at all. So no, he can’t be trusted to be a reasonable person when he’s been completely unreasonable and selfish from the get-go. Work relationships can happen and be successful. But they happen over time, when there’s a noticeable shared attraction, flirting, etc. You don’t get someone’s cell number out of the company directory and hit on them after one conversation, which is no different than what happened here.",Thr0waway0864213579,t2_4buo5atv,3,0,reddit1

Luckily this sub, brushing your teeth, and showering, can perform their primary functions and with 0% extra effort and also provide a second, unintended, and significantly less important function.

So I know it’s not popular, but we do have a policy in this country of “innocent until proven guilty” even if in the civil courts it’s more “you’re not liable until proven liable” for claims against defendants. It is upon the Plaintiff (that would be you if you went to court) to prove the act was sexual harassment. The defendant, clearly a male, is going to ensure that he has some men on the jury. Then the men on the jury will likely know where he was trying to go with it (I’m a male BTW), but because he didn’t explicit say “let’s get a room after lunch and work on that promotion”, they will give him the benefit of the doubt. 

People love the idea of accountability for others, but not for themselves or people they can related to or care about.

Just met someone and causally chatting in a ""get to know you"" kind of way? Probably fine. That's a pretty simple way to learn about someone, similar to ""did you grow up here?"" ”do you have any pets?"" ""where'd you go to school?""

But the framing here is clearly about him expressing romantic interest. A text message out of the blue, the importance bestowed by the ""can I ask you something"", and I'm sure the vibes being given off in person.

Like if you’re making small talk, those get-to-know-you questions are fine, for the most part. If I’m hanging out with people and I get asked I don’t mind. 

The context of those questions shifts though if I get a PM asking those questions, or if its a guy asking me one on one/privately, or if it comes out of nowhere. In those circumstances I’m not thinking ‘this is someone who wants to get to know me better as a person’, I’m thinking this dude is looking for some level of romantic or sexual involvement. 

Add to that being at work and the age difference... yeah that guy wasn’t asking because he was casually curious. 

In a work situation, especially one like what OP describes, if you work with someone long enough and get friendly enough with them they will *volunteer* this info on their own as part of getting to know one another. So there’s no reason to ask... the only people who do do so because they want something 9 times out of 10.

The answer is, you can't. Asking ""Are you in a position where it would be acceptable for me to make a sexual/romantic advance?"" is just making an advance with extra steps. This is especially true in this context, where her coworker initiated a conversation leading with that question. 

In a situation where you're meeting someone and asking questions about their lives, and it's abundantly clear you're not asking as a means of sexualizing them, it's not a weird topic to bring up.

OP does not mention any flirty behavior from them or their coworker. OP describes a nice/friendly relationship with this coworker.

Not only do some of these assholes think it's fine to insist the woman they now just encounter for the first time in their lives owes them dates and/or sexual favors, she also can't say no! She has no voice in the matter. The fact that the guy asked is a default understanding that she has no choice but to comply. I don't even understand how that kind of idea starts.

I am just saying that is what HR departments and in-house counsel do to silence women who bring it up. They are taught immediately, either by education or training, to treat these situations as if the complainant is ready to sue and to try to find out what they are saying and to protect the company from liability. That’s just reality. Even if this person is held accountable, almost always the supervisor finds some way to punish the complainant because people, especially men, do not want to be held accountable by women. 

Idk how that makes me “the problem” when my job as an attorney is representing people who have been discriminated at work, including many women who have faced similar experiences to yours. In fact, that’s what I tell my clients about the system.

She invited a friend over and maintained appropriate boundaries with him physically. Ross, on the other hand, chose to put himself in a scenario with alcohol and a woman he knew was into him.

Who gives a fuck what she does now?? Shes single and can do whatever the hell she wants. She didn't do a single thing wrong when they were together. She wanted space at work, she wanted him to accept she had a male friend that shared a professional interest (don't forget he MADE her invite him to the fashion show because he was jealous of the male friend and he rudely fell asleep and snored, *embarrassing her at a professional event.*) Now that they've broken up, she isn't wrong to go on a date, regardless of who it's with.

And if she did, it’s also way worse for a long-term relationship.

If you keep someone around that has admitted feelings for you, then sleep with them the first chance you get. Your partner will always distrust every single “friend” you have.

After the the full breakup she even tries to get with his best friend.

Getting drunk and having a one night stand after a long term relationship is also not a healthy response, but it’s not exactly damning behavior.

Long-term it wouldn’t be a problem unless alcohol or cheating were long-term issues. Ross never cheats. I think Rachel does, kissing a guy on her balcony - or it was semi-cheating since they weren’t really back together. 

But a lot of people hate the show because of this disaster of a relationship. But while they are messy and imperfect they’re mostly supporters of each other.

Once he reaches a certain violations score, the customer gets throttled down -- like made to wait a certain time, asked to state his problem to a robot, have the lowest priority from all waiting customers, only be able to speak to male agents and so on.  

You can also make the customer state his name before any agent answers and id him based on his voice, in case he has multiple phone numbers.

The problem arises when the attempt to gauge the situation is itself not distinguishable from an advance. If someone was to ask a third party, like one of my friends, about my relationship status, that couldn't be an advance because I'm not being involved. That's different than when the question is posed to me directly, in a situation like OP's, where it's obviously a lead-up to an advance and essentially becomes one all at once. Really, I would actually say it's part of the advance rather than being a precursor, because of the context.

Asking about relationship status IS an advance, it's just easier to pretend it's not. Trust me, every woman knows *exactly* what you really mean when you say ""you single?"" It just draws out the rejection process because it lets them think ""oh damn she's available so I get a shot"" and then she has to say no more forcefully or repetitively.

You can just go straight to ""can I take you out sometime?"" I always respected someone assertive enough to ask outright and risk the rejection, while I definitely noticed the passive aggression of ""is there a primary penis in your life today?"" which then leads them to think they can become that primary penis.

To be fair Mark invited himself over but Rachel did nothing to stop it. Imagine you’ve just had an argument with your girlfriend about numerous issues, one of which is a work colleague who you think is overstepping, she suggests you take a break and you leave. Then, you phone to try and talk and you hear that same work colleague in the background. Nobody is ever going to take that well. Sure Ross could have handled it better but Rachel is as much at fault for having him round in the first place. She did plenty wrong. 

He didn’t know she was into him. Chandler and Joey were the ones who constantly went to the copy place. There’s no suggestion that Ross ever went there or really knew her that well. Plus, he was drunk, we could easily be having a conversation around whether she raped him or not. Again, put yourself in his shoes, are you saying you wouldn’t hang up on rachel and go to meet your friends if you thought she was fucking someone else. Rachel even days the next day ‘can I be your girlfriend again’ which suggests they were broken up. 

My point is that she goes on a date with the man who Ross thinks broke up her relationship which would only further his pain and resentment. Not that she goes on a date at all. The fact she agreed shows it wasn’t all professional. Again, if you put yourself in his shoes it doesn’t look good. Chandler even knows how fucked up it is by his reaction. And if we’re talking fucked up stuff Rachel does towards ross then I could list off a few that I think are just as bad if not worse. 

Like I said, he’s not perfect and he’s not innocent in any of it but people are way too quick to give Rachel a pass in the whole we were on a break thing. She’s the most toxic character in the whole show.

You've also conflated what I said about age, with what I said about beauty. What is beautiful is different to everyone, and denying that is ignorant. The idea that a person can gauge their own attractiveness is an entirely nonsensical thought. That kind of statement works to feed our own personal fears about how we need to change ourselves to conform to the world around us so that others think we're ""beautiful"". People often fail to realize that those changes we make to look more attractive, will make us look unattractive to another. Some men like makeup, some men don't. Some women like beards, some women don't. The fact is, you, me, and everyone else in this world, are really bad at gauging self-attractiveness, because it's not up to us what someone else finds attractive.

The fact also remains that you've never been a man and experienced a significantly younger woman coming on to you in the workplace, or elsewhere.

I have to issues with this.
1) Ross has a problem with a male coworker because he correctly thinks the coworker is interested in her. WHO CARES what the coworker thinks? Ross lets his insecurity about it run overboard when Rachel never gave him ANY reason to think there was anything there. (Yes I remember the misunderstanding where the coworker us greeting his girlfriend and Ross thinks it was Rachel. That is not a point in your favor, if anything it shows that both Rachel and the coworker weren't doing anything and both had relationships.) *Ross punished her for working with a male coworker who found her attractive.* None of that is her fault.

So back to putting on my shoes to meet up friends because I refused to listen to my SO when they tried to make up after a fight - yeah, I'd go meet my friends. I wouldn't have slept with anyone but I also would have listened to my SO after a fight.

He started it and he made it worse at every turn. It should have ended when he said ""hey I think that guy likes you."" And she said ""what? Nah I don't think so."" He could have gone ""oh he's definitely into you! I trust you though.""

He didn't trust her and when she made choices after their relationship ended, he used it as justification that he was right to begin with. It became a self fulfilling prophecy. He thought there was a problem in the relationship so he became it.",,,11,0,reddit1

So yeah, his insecurities got the best of him. But having an insecurity about being cheated on (his first wife was his first girlfriend and they were together for 7 years) doesn’t make him a bad person. Even if Rachel said there was nothing there, that doesn’t magically make that insecurity go away. 

Him hanging up the phone on her is a natural reaction. Yeah it’s frustrating that it could have been avoided but again I don’t blame him for reacting that way. 

Like I said, we could be arguing that Chloe raped  Ross. Then the whole evening would take a different turn.

If they continue the relationship after they've been separated by units, they then have an allotted time to get legally married, which then prevents them from any UCMJ actions.
This part about marriage is only needed if the couple are in two different categories of rank, i.e. one is an officer and the other is enlisted or if one is a junior enlisted soldier, while the other is a senior enlisted soldier.

No I don't think it would have done any different. The problem with how he asked wasn't the order of the questions (relationship then making an advance). The problem with him asking is...it was work. It wasn't social. The order of the questions doesn't matter in the OP because the questions shouldn't have been there at all. Tbh him asking ""single or married"" is over the line and unprofessional because it takes the conversation from social and very likely romantic. It *could* just be a social question but I'm always floored when that question isn't followed up with an advance or a ""too bad""-type comment i.e. a show of romantic interest. Any romantic interest doesn't belong in a professional setting so that's very tricky to navigate correctly. In this case, he probably just shouldn't have asked at all.",,,3,0,reddit1

She's venting on an anonymous fucking forum about a situation that made her uncomfortable and her frustration with always feeling like *she* has to set aside her own feelings to make men feel better after *they* make her uncomfortable.

Second off, the masks suck to wear and no one likes them and they can get in the way when trying to get into position to assess the situation, but if I can crawl through over 1000 feet of dusty space that looks like the Upside down I'm sure they can manage it in your apartment.

I live in an apartment and had a contractor come in wearing a mask and discovered about 20 minutes after his arrival that he took it off.

I called the apartment office and told them the situation and that the man wasn’t allowed back in my home. The company had to send another guy (who wore a mask the entire time) to finish the job, I asked the head of maintenance from my apartment complex to stay with him (while also wearing a mask) to supervise and make sure the mask stayed on.

If a person’s actively breathing or sneezing or whatever near you, all the aerosolized particles in their breath are being released at human head height on a current of moving air that could easily carry them into your breathing area fairly quickly before they have time to disperse. On the other hand, the aerosolized particles the person breathed out five minutes ago before you entered the room have already had the chance to disperse and mix into the house’s entire volume of air, meaning that you’d be getting very few or none of them in each lungful of air you take. It’s certainly BETTER not to spend too much time in a house where someone’s been breathing without a mask, but it’s not even close to being near someone’s active flow of exhalations. 

Think of how much easier it is to smell alcohol on someone’s breath if they’re actually talking to you compared to just being in a room that they were previously in. Instead of tiny alcohol particles being aerosolized from the person’s body via their breath and contacting the inside of your nose (which is how smelling happens), it would be tiny COVID-colonized particles.",ilexheder,t2_t5yua,25,0,reddit3

They are re-usable and the filters should last a decent amount of time.  They are much easier to breathe in and more protective than n95s anyway since the filters have folds and therefore more surface area and P100 protection so they filter more particles and oil. N95s are not particularly good for paint, especially spray paint since they don't filter oil and other nasties.  Only particles. There are options for filtering even more stuff. They don't filter exhalations if that's a concern, but it's easy to put procedural mask material on the exhalation or cloth.  I recommend the cartridge filters over the disks though they are a bit pricer (around $23).  The masks start at around $14.  The cheaper disk filters are around $10, but don't last as long and don't have the folds for more surface area.  They are also harder to disinfect.

If there are asymptotic carriers (which we know there are) they would not realize that they are carrying and spreading the virus around. The way to work with that is to presume everyone could be an asymptotic carrier and take preventative measures accordingly. That’s presuming everyone - including me - is infected and may not be aware and taking precautions according to that mode of thinking. 

If you are wearing a mask when you go out, that’s presuming that you or someone you will come in contact with could potentially be infected, and taking appropriate precautions. If you’re positive people are not infected, no reason to wear a mask, right? But if you’re not sure and you don’t want to be sick or get anyone else sick, then you’re presuming someone does have it and wearing a mask as a precaution.",sparklestar17,t2_f8ivr,4,0,reddit3

h787r0x,t3_ov4wpi,2021-07-31 18:22:57,TwoXChromosomes,"I worked at a theme park specifically at boardwalk style games. An older man with a son about my age (19) comes over and said they’ll play, but if he (the older man) wins, I have to give him a kiss.
I was on a headset microphone and had on a performing persona to encourage people to play games and have fun, so I couldn’t even be dismissive. I said something a long the lines of, “ohhh I can’t do that; but I’m betting on this young man to take home one of these available prizes!” Trying to divert attention and try to remind him he’s with his (assuming) son who is clearly uncomfortable and looks apologetic.

He pays for a game, and unfortunately wins and points to a cheek. I ask which stuffed animal he wants. He goes “keep one for me” and winks then says “where’s my kiss?” At this point his son starts walking away looking like he wants to die and his dad follows after him asking where he’s going. 

I spotted a manager and waved her over to let her know right away and she let the other managers know to keep an eye out for him in case he keeps doing things like that. I have a dozen stories varying from creepy to outright aggressively angry people, as well as stories from coworkers so it’s just part of the job.

That was in the middle of the day in a crowded area of the park so there wasn’t an issue, but I sometimes worked at games that were far away from the main area and I only had a walkie talkie if I needed a manager. At night before close when it rained earlier so the park was mostly dead, it was really scary alone. I had a friend in security that would come by to check on me sometimes but he didn’t work nights often, so I’d go hours only spotting security once from a distance. 

Working close, we would just be radioed about when we could head over to the employee area. Sometimes I’d be asked to stay past closing to set up the game station (changing out prizes, waiting for a machine audit), so there were times I’d be one of the last out of the park. We had wooded areas in the park, and a large abandoned “backstage” area that people could easily hide in and no one would know. Hell, I’ve scared a manager that was waiting for me just by taking a short cut thru there. 

If someone wanted to go through with their threats of violence, or were pissed I rejected them, or just a random that was waiting for an opportunity… they always could have that chance. 

I have been assaulted at that park. However, it’s by cowards that wait until the Halloween season to claim they’re “scared”. That’s when they think they can get away with it. Park has a zero tolerance policy, but it doesn’t stop these psychos. One time a dude was caught with a gun in the park, luckily was apprehended and removed with police.

He then starts hitting on the woman sitting across from me, where she couldn't be any more disinterested. He was just asking innocent questions, and was on the other side of the railing so I just continued playing on my phone, while this went on for a few minutes.

Then he came around the railing, and sat next to her, close enough to where his leg was literally touching hers. She immediately stands up, and he stands up with her, and puts his arm out with his hand on the wall, basically blocking her into the corner, asking like ""what, you're not attracted to me,"" and shit like that.

At that point I went over and touched him on the shoulder and told him ""look, she's not interested in talking to you, you need to leave."" He tells me she's his girlfriend and I tell him she's not, I heard him the entire time he was hitting on her, and kept telling him he needed to leave.

Companies view women (or anyone complaining really) in these situations as high risk and even law enforcement require so much to take us seriously. Even when they want to take you seriously the laws are designed so that they can’t step in until something goes too far, which, it shouldn’t have to reach that point in the first place.

We had a customer stalking a female coworker who was also not overly feminine, she had a shaved head and her manager would literally hide her in the back of the store when this customer arrived because he would harass her at the deli counter. Before her manager stepped in she would always ask someone else to serve him because he was aggressively creepy, like way worse than the guy in this video. He didn’t get banned from the store until one day he followed her out to her car while violently raging at her. The whole fucking experience is so traumatic, she’s hiding at work while he’s yelling in the other room demanding she be presented to him like he’s some Roman emperor. 100% him following her outside of work had to be one of her biggest fears before it actually happened. Why does someone have to first go through an escalation of trauma in order for something to be done?

If you’re a manager and you’re hiding your employee from a customer something is very wrong, ban that customer like yesterday.

I’m in my mid twenties, wearing a mask and a longgg maxi skirt. Like, touching my shoes length, not that it should matter. These dudes were 40+ and leering. 

They followed me to the line and stood behind me, a little too close for comfort in a pandemic. They quickly asked me if i’m married. I said yes without looking at them. (I’m engaged so whatever) i thought this would be the quickest exit to the convo. I was wrong.

How about you stop treating women and girls as though they owe you something for existing. If a man does not smile often, he’s said to ‘keep to himself’ or just ‘the quiet type’ yet if a woman doesn’t smile, she is constantly and consistently asked what is wrong or what her problem is. We do not exist to give you smiles. Yet we were raised in a culture with those expectations. Expectations for women to always be bright and sunny and happy and loving all the time.

Just to put it out there, we probably don’t want to talk to you, and we’re just trying to be nice to not hurt your feelings. Go. Away.",Kkaysauce,t2_a8an6hws,12,0,reddit4

We get a lot of people from other states traveling through who, unfortunately, think this is something else. That part I knew about when I started. So I’m used to that. 

What I *wasn’t* used to was how many of these men just walk in, look at me, look again at the ‘sauna’ sign and say something like ‘so what do I get for a session with *you*?’ In the beginning I was kinda shocked/taken aback but being raised to be nice no matter what I’d reply to these men who were sometimes three times my age ‘well if you want to bring a friend, that’s something you have to do. We just provide the sauna!’  

That’s not what a lot of these guys want to hear. It’s like some kind of conquest to get the girl behind the front desk or the assumption is this is a massage place staffed by hookers giving 20 dollar handjobs or something. Meanwhile I’m sweating all day trying to keep this place clean and studying when I can working on my degree.

I told him we can’t accept tips so he put a couple dollars down my shirt. Another guy grabbed my hand and told my (female) manager that “this is the reason I come here” and she uncomfortably laughed it off with me. Another time, a guy gasped then acted like he couldn’t breathe and said “you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, you take my breath away” and held up my line acting like he was having some sort of attack. Pretty sure he was wasted (I’m not even that good looking) but I was so embarrassed I wanted to cry. Those are just the ones that really stand out and make me wish I would’ve said something. Even just sweeping the floors as a service specialist (bagger), you couldn’t go 10 minutes without someone saying “you sweep me off my feet” or some dumb shit like that. I just wanted to do my job and go home. 

So many of the women and teenaged girls who worked with me dealt with stuff like this so often that we weren’t even fazed most of the time.

I said ""no thank you"" and he got incredibly angry and weirdly enough he crossed the road to walk parallel to me the entire time, yelling about what a bitch I was because I thought I was too good to walk with him. 

That same night, I took the train home and my phone died on the way (like for good, not just battery - I was always prepared for the travel home), meaning I had to use a payphone to call a cab at the station. The number wasn't working so I had to ask the only other person there if I had the number correct, who was a 30-something year old guy. 

He took that as an invitation to hover around me the entire time. He said absolutely nothing to me (besides a ""yes"" to confirm the number) and I just kind of shrunk against the wall with my keys in my fingers, begging for the taxi to hurry up, avoiding eye contact.

His taxi got there before mine did and he looks at me and goes ""well??? Are you coming home with me or not?"" in an almost frustrated tone, as if we had spent that time coyly flirting with each other but I was being  aloof about whether I would sleep with him or not.

I gave him a bewildered ""n-no?"" and he shakes his head and called me a fucking frigid bitch, and thankfully left.

He would always come in on my shifts in the evening and hang in the lobby trying to talk to me, but I’d just leave the lobby and go clean in the back. I’d look at the timer and see when he was coming out so I’d go to hide in the back until I heard the door open and he left so I wouldnt have to see him. I always remembered my nice customers names, this guys too, but I’d ask him for his name every time he came in because I didnt want him to think I was interested and remembered him. He got mad one day and said to me “I come in here all the time you seriously dont remember my name by now??” I apologized and said I see 60 people a shift (not true lol). 

Then once I was saying goodbye to a sweet woman and he had finished his tan, and as I was letting the woman out (I’d lock the door at night and let people in/out) he came up behind me, grabbed my waist, kissed me on the cheek, and left. From then on I’d have family come and wait with me while I closed, and he wouldnt hang out anymore. He finally came in on my shift again and he was so frustrated at me not going along with his advances he cancelled his membership. Told my manager about that guy touching me, and about how some other man would sit in his truck in the back of the building nightly and try to talk to us girls, and my female manager said that “these things are a part of life” lmao!

I began to work/hide in the back when he was around and other coworkers told him I wasn't there when he *asked* about me.

Now I understand the appeal, I mean she's right there......and if you finally get up the nerve why not? Well 1st of all, if she's working she's kind of stuck there. She \*might\* have a means to escape your advances, but then again she may not.  She \*might\* not mind your attention, but then again she might not. Now I'm not sure what work others have had, but in my work past I couldn't just choose to flee the sales floor and/or customers whenever I liked.

To be fair, I am NOT some enlighted guy or some White Knight. I just remember my mother telling me as a pre-teen it was rude to impose on people and asking for something in a situation where they could feel pressured to respond a certain way was an imposition. 

When I was in retail management I had this one woman working for me. ""Cute girl"" that looked much younger than her 24 years would lead you to believe. Good employee too, but I recall more than one cringy moment when some 30 year old dude running errand with his kids in tow would pigeon-hole her somewhere (behind the paint desk was popular) and just relentlessly hit on her. I'm clueless enough that it took me a while to see what was going on (from a distance) and stepping in as needed (usually a call to her store phone asking if she wanted help and then responding accordingly).

Perspective: it's 1442, in a small village and you're an attractive girl (not woman because it's 1442 and pedophilia was the norm) just trying to feed the goats and a 57 year old bishop passes through on his way to pilgrimage and starts simpin on you, that'd be awful.

That was nice. I keep the chit chat to a minimum though. I'm not looking, but I stay polite. During the pandemic I have given more compliments - to both men and women. ""Hey - that's a great pair of glasses."" ""I like that pin.""  

And sometimes I get some comments or compliments myself. I don't ask where they live, don't ask for numbers. I just treat people like human beings.  If people don't respond, don't push it. It's not that hard. 

You can tell, though, in some people's eyes. They've had enough of the same conversation all day every day. I've been there. Be pleasant, move on. If the person wants to engage you, they will.

When I was working nights,, one group came frequently and I guess they owned a strip club or something. Guy would ask if he could put me in his pocket/say how he could, and asking me to come work for him.

When I was a host for a time around 21, a server asked me to drop off the check at a table of guys in their 79s/80s and the one guy grabbed my arm, held onto it, and started hitting on. He didn't do it for long, not sure if he sensed that I shut down/was considering ripping arm out of his hand violently, but it was scary.

Not that it was my only experience, but as a server, you don't have the ""privilege"" of having a counter between yourself and the person or a counter you can get them to follow you to. 

When I was 16/17 and worked as a cashier, these two guys in suits would come in and hit on me around 8/9 at night. They were probably in their 30s. I don't really remember what happened that caused me to do this, it might have just been that they wouldn't stop and I was getting more and more scared of them, but I remember one time seeing them and hiding in the bathroom. I was so scared of them, I was almost crying and crouched down in the bathroom.

When I was around 21 selling phones at a big box store, I had a guy ask me how much I charge for me time. I pretended I didn't know what he meant/that he meant it like an apology for taking so much time with me, but then he said ""You know what I mean,"" and nodded up at me. I walked away and told my supervisor. 

These are just the ones that stand out, besides one when I was selling phones, same age, where someone in their 30s hit on me, asking if I was in high school. People would think I was 16 up until I was about 23/24.

Though not work-related, I also remember this creepy guy who sat down and talked to me when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up at a bus stop that was hours from my house. He wasn't explicitly hitting on me, but what stood out was that he told me that he ""could get in trouble for being around me"" and then when my friend randomly called me, he acted like it was a fake call and was like ""I understand. I'll go away."" Pretty sure he got committed of doing something with underage kids considering...

I now had a target on my back. I was under contract so my boss couldn't outright get rid of me. He proceeded to harass me for 10 months and made my life a living hell. I had depression, panic attacks at work, and he constantly wrote up lies about me, forcing me to try to clarify and defend myself. Trapped me in his office and screamed at me that he wishes he could fire me right now. He would then call me defiant, difficult, etc and make administrative meetings about me. He had a binder with my name on it in his office. He didn't have a binder for any other employees that I ever saw. Eventually he pushed to have me resign from my own job. He retired that year, after taking a year of my life from me. Fuck him to his old ass grave.

I sort of had a situation like this at work, but not to the same extent. Just a creepy dude that worked on my office that made me feel uncomfortable one time so I avoided him. I would see him walking down a hallway, so I would take an immediate turn and go a different way. Anytime I would see him I would do this to avoid him. Yet one time he saw me do this (I walked into the kitchen area at work, saw him and immediately left) and decided to show up at my desk to chat. I didn’t make eye contact and barely responded to any of his questions all with the intention of giving off a vibe of “don’t”. Fortunately, I felt comfortable telling my manager about the initial interaction and the final interaction and my manager dealt with it (I think he talked to him and told him to leave me alone). He left me alone after that, but then started pestering a coworker of mine after I got transferred to a different group. Get a fucking clue, dude!

I also had another situation with a guy in college who was a creep and wouldn’t leave me alone. At one point after I politely rejected him he responded with “no doesn’t always mean no.” He eventually followed me when I moved back to my home state and contacted me with a creepy fucking email, I found his MySpace page and it had all these creepy fucking blog posts about me. My mom worked for the sheriff’s office at the time and talked to the sheriff who told me to email him and CC the sheriff and tell the guy if he didn’t leave me alone I was going to file harassment charges against him. That fortunately got him to stop. The craziest shit about all of this to me is I’m a lesbian who dresses and probably carries myself somewhat slightly masculine of center.

However, I do remember one guy who was 23 years old and came in to where I worked often as he worked at another store in the mall. He always lightly flirted with me but not over the top or creepy. One day I went to apply at the store he worked at. When he realized that I was actually 16, he became so ashamed that he had been hitting on me. He was surprised that I was only 16 because I looked older and he thought I was around the same age as him.  

He didn't come into my store as often anymore and discontinued flirting with me but he was still friendly. At the time I was a little put off but as a 16 year old I didn't fully understand it all. But now that I'm almost 50, I look back and think that the guy was a pretty good guy. He wasn't creepy, he didn't hang around longer than necessary and once he found out I was underage, he backed off, didn't get angry even though he was a little embarrassed (not that he would have had any right to get angry of course but we all know some guys still do) and just acted normal after that. 

I mean maybe he shouldn't have flirted with me while I was working but again, it was low-key just showing interest in me and I flirted back and he thought we were about the same age.

It may be considered prying by some, but to me it implies that they see you and want you to be happy because some level of genuine concern for another person (even a total stranger). It implies that they're willing to help if they can. To me that's a mark of a good person.

On the other hand, telling someone ""you'd be prettier if you smiled more"" shows that they see you as an object walking around in their world; that your happiness only matters insofar as it affects them; that they believe, no matter your personal circumstances, you should prioritize making yourself look attractive.

Ichihashi was seen fleeing his apartment, and police sought him for the murder of Hawker and the abandonment of her corpse. On 10 November 2009, Japanese news media and BBC News reported that the police had apprehended Ichihashi. On 5 July 2011, Ichihashi confessed to killing Hawker, stating that he smothered her to prevent her from screaming while he raped her.

So for background my open conceptish desk is near the lunch room so people just NEED to cut through behind my desk specifically even tho the whole area is easy to walk through and it can take longer to walk around me. As in, I can see them coming from down the hall on the left end of the open area, they loop behind me, then walk up the right end hallway to get into the lunch room. I work on a small laptop instead of my giant monitors just so they have less to snoop at (I do IT stuff for execs and have client personal information up on my computer) and yet they’re still looking over my shoulder, getting too close, or looking at something under my desk (surely they aren’t admiring my $12 shoes from Amazon). I keep nothing personal on my desk either since I occasionally work from home,  and I have nothing under my desk. Really, nothing interesting to look at, unless they really like my nail polish. 
My team is 23 men, 2 older women with children, and me the youngest. I should note the men in my team are wonderful. They’re not the ones having people(men) trip over their chairs tho.

Now to my man spreading, part of my job is receiving in computers and other physical components. I’m talking, I could have a massive trolly (? I forgot the word and I’m not British, but that’s the idea of what I’m referring to) stacked 6ft tall and 5ft wide of packages. Anything from a server (heavy MFers), monitors, laptops, desktops, etc., depending on what project is being worked on in the company. 

And I LOVE positioning that thing diagonally, putting boxes down on the floor all around, etc, so I don’t have to get up from my rolly chair and be lazy and have all MY space to myself to have my headphones in and work on whatever has come in. Oh the absolute JOY I feel when someone tries to go the long way around me and finds an impassable wall I’ve created of metal, cardboard, and plastic. It takes a good chunk of the day to get through it, too, so that’s a semi-permanent jungle gym of death. 

Oh, and if anyone thinks I’m over reacting about people going out of their way to pass by behind me?
TELL ME HOW some of these middle aged to boomer aged men will attempt to audition for America Ninja Warrior with my set up anyway? If I can see them coming a mile away, how is it that they can easily take many different paths once visualizing my junk heap yet still prefer to practice Team USA’s gymnastics floor routine? Not just once, no, some have chosen this path twice.

He did not harass me, he did not say weird creepy things, he did not linger, he did not trap me in a conversation I didn't want to be in. He didn't bother me in my place of work.

Then the worst of those begin to blame everything around them, completely avoiding any kind of introspection to determine if maybe the problem actually comes from within, and end up avoiding solid social growth to the point where eventually it becomes too late to change their now massively dysfunctional personality.

I went to the ER a few years ago for an irregular heartbeat and feeling faint, and my girlfriend was at my bedside once they got me checked in. The male nurse that was hooking heartrate monitor pads up to me was relentlessly hitting on her, even going so far as to use graphic sexual language. While I was laying there semiconscious and terrified.

It's like the biological male response to vulnerability is to take advantage and attempt to either gain control of the vulnerable person or hurt them.

h7av990,t1_h77rkc9,2021-08-01 11:01:40,TwoXChromosomes,"Ok, I’m sensing a trend here; same thing happened to me the day after my dad died. I should also mention, my trashy, drunk uncle (mom’s brother) also tried to stab me only 2 hours after my dad died because, despite my best effort to get there after receiving a call from the nurse at the hospital to say they were essentially sending him home to die and I should get home right away to say goodbye, I was unable to control the tractor trailer accident and subsequent traffic on the highway on my drive from out of state, and I missed my opportunity by an hour. So there I am, obviously upset because my dad died, I didn’t make it home in time to say goodbye, and my own uncle had just tried to kill me. I had spent hours at the police station, then on video calls with a judge or magistrate or whatever the fuck they’re called in rural bumfuck Pennsylvania, so I could get a temporary restraining order against my uncle in case he decided to show up at the funeral in a few days (if he was able to post bail and get out of jail by then), I had been up for 28 hours straight and driven 200+ miles, and I just wanted to buy a damn cup of shitty coffee so I could get through the morning and handle funeral preparations. 

There is NO WAY IN HELL I was looking remotely approachable, let alone cute, and some asshole decides it’s the perfect time to tell me if I give him a pretty smile, he’ll pay for my coffee. I just stared daggers at him, tears streaming down my face, gripping my cup of coffee tight enough that I squished the cup a bit and coffee started coming out the opening in the lid and burning the shit out of my hand, to which I didn’t even react. Truly, if looks could kill, dude would’ve been dead on the floor within 2.7 seconds. His eyes got huge, he turned away, eventually paid for his own shit, then hauled ass out of there. 

The cashier, bless her, just handed me some napkins to clean up the coffee on my hand, rang up my coffee, then said “Whatever it is, just remember, it won’t last forever; you’re gonna get through it, and when you come out the other side you’ll be even stronger.” She knew. She absolutely knew. She gave me the strength to power through everything I needed to get done that day, and I went back a week later, after the funeral, to thank her for that. 

Hopefully that guy learned something that day. It’s possible he had good intentions, and just didn’t want to see anyone sad, regardless of gender. I don’t know. But offering a trade like that, trying to buy my smile with a cup of coffee, just made me so furious at the time. Too many times in my life I’ve been told by creepy guys that I’d be much prettier if I smile, and he just rubbed me the wrong way.

h77wzit,t1_h77qm1e,2021-07-31 16:57:10,TwoXChromosomes,"I think it also has to do with toxic masculinity.  A lot of men, especially pre-millennial men, have absolutely no idea how to properly react to a clearly sad and upset woman.  They see someone in distress and they briefly empathize.  But due to their lifelong programming of, ""men are the rock upon which women stand"" they fall back upon the tired trope of telling a girl she's pretty or should ""turn that frown upside down"" falsely thinking that you all will dawn some mystical strength from their words of encouragement.  This feeds into male fantasies of rescuing the ""damsel in distress"" as well, which is another aspect of toxic masculinity.  So instead of just dealing with the feelings they have stirred up within themselves and thereby leaving women out of it, they make it your problem by interjecting their toxic male worldview to try and make you feel better which will in turn make *them* feel better.

h7812qu,t1_h77qm1e,2021-07-31 17:29:33,TwoXChromosomes,"Smiling is a social signal among humans indicating submissiveness, embarrassment, and is a method of begging a more powerful person for leniency in the case of a perceived slight. 

It can also be a beautiful thing when shared among equals who respect each other, but that darker side of the smile is legitimate and exists across pretty much all human cultures. It's an ancient language, likely sourced from a common primate ancestor.

So, when men tell women to smile, they're essentially telling them to get in line and display a signal of submission to show that they understand they are socially inferior and reliant on remaining in the good will of the men around them in order to survive. They are telling us to plead with them for their own tolerance of our existence. 

Maybe these men don't consciously realize it, maybe they do, but that demand for a smile is a direct social threat built off of a belief that they're worth more than we are and are therefore entitled to overt displays of respect, submission, and fear from us. 

Any man pushing for women to smile at him like that should be considered dangerous. There's something just not right about his world view.",slangwitch,t2_6q8un,184,0,reddit4

It's a welcome relief from incidents like one I experienced when I was 18 years old and went to a matinee movie one summer afternoon with my friend Mary. Typical for both of us, we arrived a bit late, so the lights had already been dimmed. This was the late 1970s, when theaters still had double features. After the first film ended Mary and I were discussing whether or not to get more popcorn when this probably 50-something year old man (who I can best describe facially as a younger Alfred Hitchcock) very deliberately sat down directly behind us and asked if we went to Wayne State University. We said no, and then he continued ""I *know* I recognize you from somewhere..."" and started naming other colleges in the area. (Mind you, we'd arrived when the theater was darkened and up 'til now he'd only seen the backs of our heads.) He finally concluded by asking ""Would either of you be interested in seeing me socially?"" And Mary and I both replied (and I cringe whenever I think of it) ""No, thank you.""

He left then, but I barely remembered the main feature I was so unsettled. And as I recalled the event - then and now - I get angry with myself for actually being **polite** when shutting him down.",Ouisch,t2_32iic,9,0,reddit4

You have to realise that most people don't see us as women, that we're often murdered under the idea and defense that we ""tricked"" men and were ""just crossdressers"" etc. There's the whole trans panic defense for murdering women that's still used. We're not the same but things like this perpetuate that image.

There's also the whole cultural idea (perpetuated in this thread over and over) that penis = male so if people find out we have one they can get violent. Things like this just keep that idea rolling and are generally really dangerous for us.

Basically, it's not about us being the same, it's about the idea that the people who perpetuate violence against us think we are. We aren't past that point and can't pretend these things are intrinsically separate. It's the same thing as men who act like women are just perfectly fine off and equal when we've barely been for a generation.

And just like with ADHD but for all kids, if you don't insist, it just gets worse. They learn that they don't have to be polite or clean up after themselves, because no one insists when they don't, and they turn into adults who refuse to and who get mad when someone insists.

That’s personal. I’m here on a strictly professional basis and not interested in meeting anyone. For the safety of this establishment’s employees, we aren’t allowed to share personal information, and I wouldnt anway, Maybe you can ask my boyfriend.  

As soon as he is crossing the line, tell him that he is making her feel uncomfortable.  There is little more damaging to the kind of guy who preys on girls like this than them getting firm feedback counter to their intentions.  And if he is inappropriate beyond drawing that line in the sand, he is closer to grounds of asking him to leave or escalating to another employee or manager.  If the girl is at the mall, they can call security.  A guy who is that feeble to pursue a situation like that is likely week and will back down.  

We’ve all been where she is, so I’m not judging, but her cooperation and her silence can look like shyness.  Shyness won’t stop a guy who is bold enough to express interest. Enabling sounds harsh, as no one should be made to feel small, but there is a point where standing up for yourself is beneficial and empowering.

Another thing to consider is that studies have shown that men aren’t as good at picking up facial cues when compared to women, so with some guys, you def have to make yourself clear.

The key element here is *woman*. Men have a clue how to behave empathetically towards other humans (aka men) who look sad. Either leave them alone or ask them if they're okay if your existing relationship allows it. Men know how to do that and would be as awkward or not as they're going to be about it as social beings interacting with another human. The idea that men believe they need to behave differently towards a woman is the issue. Because they don't see women as fellow human beings. They see women as objects to be acquired, or decorative objects who need to be reminded to be properly decorative. At best there's an element of ""let me help you be as decorative as you can be!"", which...yeah, not really providing support, is it.

We're on the same general page, but I think your presumption that men are thinking about how they are ""the rock upon with women stand"" and they need to provide a service to a sad woman is way too generous to toxic masculinity.

Also, it explains why my husband also experienced this behavior, from older men, as a teen. When he was a teenager, he was almost pretty, not necessarily feminine enough to look like a girl, but pretty is the only word I have to describe it. His features were just very fine like that, and he had, and still has, long hair.

My psychiatrist never diagnosed me with ASD, but he did tell me that my ADHD was a complement to ASD, in that women with ADHD tend to be hypersensitive to emotional micro messaging, and are empathic.  

As I worked with kids on the spectrum, I noticed some special education teachers just didn't get ASD as easily as I did, they often misinterpreted personal sensory or interpretive issues from a student as a disciplinary problem when it actually wasn't, it was a difference in inner perception and communication.

Sometimes the wisest reaction is standing up for yourself in the face of toxic masculinity, as long as it would not put you in danger or make you more vulnerable than if you had just walked away and gotten to safety.",emveetu,t2_17br6s,3,0,reddit4

h78ia3e,t1_h78gp9n,2021-07-31 19:50:16,TwoXChromosomes,"Cow, for a lot of women, that note can be a huge source of anxiety. No matter how well-written and seemingly kind it can be, you’re very likely to just make someone uncomfortable. Consider that, you’re a woman whose been hit on in inappropriate ways for your whole life, and a lot of them start in seemingly unthreatening ways, like a note, but escalate to stalking behaviors. It’s not some scenario I’m making up, this happens to SO MANY women. I understand where you’re coming from, but for women, any advance from any party that they don’t know other than in passing or through a customer-employee relationship, you might as well be a potential sexual abuser.

Trying to flirt with or get with people who you meet in passing and are just interested in by some immediacy of situation and attraction, rather than having built a relationship with them and trust, is slimy. Nobody knows your intentions, and women have to assume the worst because almost always, some random stranger trying to go on a date with you has already made assumptions about you. 

But a restaurant employee isn’t there to make friends, or find partners. They’re there to make money. You always have to assume that. You always have to assume that women have had bad experiences with men and a stranger from table 6 asking them out is more likely going to scare them than ANYTHING else. If you assume otherwise, you’re unempathetic. Meet people doing shit you like to do, not people being paid to interact with you.",Postervents,t2_jipub,22,0,reddit4

You think that you can just go about hitting on a woman at their work in this way and there is no deficit

Because you aren’t there being uncomfortable. You aren’t there nervous at the beginning of your shift wondering if Chris is going to come in again, wondering if what he says will be enough for your manager to do anything about it. You don’t have to go through the mental process in your head of what date and time that person came in so you can ask for the shift off.

It’s not a deficit because you don’t experience the deficit. Like a cop thinking there’s nothing wrong with them just randomly approaching a black person asking what they’re up to and where they’re going. 

Being that guy in the first place, and taking advantage of that situation where someone is forced to at the very least receive your advances while they make their living—that’s the issue in the first place. When you slip that piece of paper you make it clear your priority is dating. 

You may put a “please” in the note or a “no pressure” but at the end of the day it’s still the same bullshit. Because you know who else did that? The creep who comes in all the time.

Unsolicited advice from an HR nerd to follow, feel free to disregard:

Insist on evidence and definitions. “Fit” is one of those vague weasel-words used to couch discrimination in pleasant business-speak.

Things you can and should ask:

-What do you mean when you say “fit”?

-What personality traits should a person in this position cultivate to be “a good fit”?

-Can you point to specific examples where I exhibited behaviors inconsistent with your expectations of someone in this role?

-Is the job I am doing unsatisfactory in any way, or is my “fit” the only issue of concern?

Nine times out of ten, managers use “fit” because they don’t want to say *”I don’t like you.”* And the reason they don’t want to say *that* is because they probably dislike you due to their *own biases* and confronting that makes them deeply uncomfortable.

Demanding evidence of subjective assessments like “fit” can help pin down if this really is a “you” thing (unlikely) or if it is a “them” being biased thing (probable).",Raaxis,t2_zfwgy,44,0,reddit1

I gave it a lot of chances, especially during my anti-fem days in my very early 20s.

- I was consistently shoved into secretarial duties. After I left the last company I worked for, the girl I handed the job off to experienced the same, at even less pay than I was getting.

- I never made above $15/hr working for men, and I had to fight for that. Despite having extra duties due to my ""social skills"" and being told I was ""the best designer they ever hired.""

- sexism and homophobia was never punished. Ever. Men with horrific at-work behavior were only fired if their anger was directed at the boss. I've had men insult me, my husband, scream at me, threaten me, touch me, tell me women didn't deserve to vote, purposefully sabatoge duties if I was assigned to their station, the works. 

- when I started working independently, men consistently tried to whittle down my prices. My time, my efforts, and professionalism were tossed out the window.

I have worked for women for the last 3-4 years now, and I'm not going back. I make significantly more money, requests for raises are taken seriously, inappropriate behavior towards me simply doesn't happen anymore, and sexist clients have their contracts cut. If my boss takes issue with something, we hash it out face to face like professionals and work it out, it doesn't devolve to passive aggressive behavior.

Several leaders and other staff members complained to the CDO that the behavior was unacceptable and asked her to address the sexism.

Together, they fired a black woman who had recently revealed that she was in treatment for drug abuse. One of the reasons they fired her was because someone found some pills in the bathroom. Now, we are a grocery store, so there is really no telling where these pills came from. And they didn't just fire her up in the office, but on the floor where everyone could see. Around this time, they also hired a guy who would later go on to assault several female employees, but what do these managers do? They promote him and cut the hours of anyone who said anything bad about him to the point where they basically had to quit. 

This brings us to last week. Several months ago they hired a black transman. He's a nice enough guy, but it's clear he has a lot going on in his life. He's hired to be a lead, which means coming in quite early. He was often late and missed quite a bit of work, so the head manager demoted him and put him on probation, essentially to try and get him to quick. This week, we found out that he would be getting his old lead job back.

How did this happen? Well, when the two leads fired the first woman, they got in trouble because she was in drug treatment and thus her addiction was considered a medical condition. She later was offered her job back but understandably declined. 

One of the women who was assaulted is sueing the store. Because of all of this, the head manager and the deli/bakery manager are essentially on permanent investigation.

I've always worked (white collar roles) in male-dominated fields (manufacturing, architecture and now construction). While I have met a handful of champions, I've more been met with a reluctance to interact with me let alone to praise or otherwise promote me. I didn't play the role of  ""business woman"" ... I dressed and behaved professionally but I didn't get too polished up (basically as much as the typical guy would plus basic makeup because I preferred wearing it). But I feel like there was another burden to act a certain way, to still present as attractive-to-hetero-males. Or at least, I was expected to be whatever the guys expected me to be instead of allowing me to be myself. 

In the end, a woman in a male-dominated field has to jump over lots of hurdles. In my experience, the thing that's worked for me is to not get complacent, to regularly check in with myself if I'm growing or if it's time to move on.

Your former boss definitely wasn't treating you correctly or fairly at all.   Women in engineering positions absolutely have tough double standards to deal with, and he contributed to those by being abrasive and disrespectful.

I have had both male and female employees that ""required a lot of time"", but I always gave them the time requested when they asked..  If I needed more time for myself I'd block off my calendar or try to get the team to save more things for regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) scheduled 1:1s to balance out that time.  (Note I've always been a working leader - taking on other projects while leading teams, which has pros/cons for the teams,  but I also needed productive time even as a leader/Sr. manager).   There are definitely respectful ways to have those conversations or at least try to guide someone to whatever works better for both parties -- if there is an opportunity.

Part of my job was vetting resumes and code samples to establish who was worth getting an interview, and I was provided a group of three other programmers to help with the code review portion of this. The policy I came up with to do this fairly was to manually git pull the samples and install them locally, and force the team to do blind assessments without any context as to which resume, github username, or any other identifying details about the author and strictly vet for code quality, unless the author had embedded their actual name in the source somewhere. I actually caught a lot of flack from my immediate supervisor for this, because they wanted everyone to know who they were reviewing to make a “better judgment call”. I rebutted that reviewers are not interviewers, and their portion of the work should be free of personal bias. I had to get HR involved over it. It turned into such a fiasco that I eventually quit and just freelance now. This same supervisor was much like the douche you are describing.

I'm going to school for engineering and got out of aeronautics because with my specific background. That office was the only place I could work in the area. I most likely won't work for the DoD again. I'm hoping engineering isn't like that everywhere. I heard some of the bigger aerospace companies are better. 

So when I worked for the DoD I ran into the same problem. I documented EVERYTHING for over 6 months. I tried going to the union and nothing happened, I went to my boss and my bosses boss who didn't do anything (he was good friends with the induvidual) and I finally was able to talk to the Director of Operations. It was just a random conversation when he asked how I was doing. He had me type an email with everything documented, I had dates and witnesses. The new commander couldn't technically fire him because it passed a certain time frame. They did move him to different hours and waited for him to mess up again. He didn't at that point. The whole process was hell. I'm glad I did it though because the office was all white males 50 years old and up. Now there are young people, people that are several different races, and women. I'm pretty sure one of them is the first black person ever hired there. The base has been around for over 60 years. 

I'm sorry I put in such a rant. If you can document it and go as high as you can in the company with no resolution, I think you can go to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. If you have the motivation or the time I say do it.

""When we announced your hiring in the trade meeting with the buyers someone said ""but that's a girls name?! You are the first woman in the department who isn't an admin. Oh no there is no sexism here its a big modern company but still with the feel of a small company""   
Well my dear friends let me tell you just a few things that happened at this company.

Person who has a senior position but it not in my chain of command that I have to work closely with wanders over ""I reckon you have a sex dungeon its always the quiet ones, anyway that certificate issue"". This was a rather tame day for office ""banter""

Supervisor ""why have you not resolved X with a supplier yet"" ""the supplier refuses to listen to me, we have been arguing for weeks about it"",  "" Its a legal issue there is nothing to argue about, I used to look after that supplier they aren't like that"" I send the emails to supervisor, ""oh how odd, ok I can see why this is taking so long but this isn't like them"". I go on holiday it still unresolved, supervisor takes over, he simply copies and pastes my first email, doesn't even correct a simple typo, suddenly they see the light and do exactly what they needed to do. Suppliers almost never accepted my word for anything. 

Colleague in the same position as me, very busy, explains that they cant do something because they are too busy gets praised for managing expectations, six months later me in the exact same situation for the exact same reasons, I explain using the exact same words. I get reprimanded for ""not being cooperative"". 

The office employed a lot of women, I saw one women get a promotion in my three years. Never to senior, there were almost no women in senior roles.

This is before I even get onto things like the office ""banter"", the outright harassment, the using someone seniors known behaviour as a perv as the punch line to a charity event, years after that same senior is put on a course due to his hiring practices I could still walk down the office and know exactly who he hired just by looking at them (all pretty women of a certain age and look). The time one of the seniors in my department said to the head of my department in front of me during a meal (not social, work travel) that someone was ""she was so right but also so wrong"" regarding a woman who had reported to HR someone who had made a rape joke then tried to tickle her when she challenged him about it, then two minutes later made another inappropriate comment.

""there is no sexism here"" they said about that office, repeatedly.

I could go on, but well I don't find it very peculiar that now I do a very similar role in a different actually modern company outside of that very outdated sector I am suddenly much more inclined to do my job well and I get good reviews.",Triana89,t2_afxl0n3p,1,0,reddit1

I figure you just play mobile games. Most girls only play mobile games"".

She ended up venting to me when I had asked why she was talking to this person (Because I know this person as particularly socially inept) and that's how I found out about it. I personally don't have the same taste in games as her, but she isn't inept at video games, we have A LOT in common in most of our interests, and I enjoy having a woman and friend who I can talk about those kind of things with. I don't understand why some people want to make it harder for others or upset others. I just really don't.

Literally 4 days ago, in the park, doing a work out routine, an older lady complimented me on my performance, I thanked her, and told her with some work she could probably start doing it too (pull ups) She said she is too old for that (75), I told her it's never too late.

I was pretty amazed, and asked if she flew Hot air balloons (NEVER met a hot air balloonist), She said she is a Pilot. Pretty awesome In my opinion.

It's a software development company, and I had discovered a big issue with automatic date time conversions happening that we didn't want, and which were also really incorrect. It's a serious issue, especially since we make billing and payment software and I had demonstrated it could result in payments actually being lost. We had frantically spent a day trying to find out the cause but had yet to find out how (it later turned out to be a third party library getting updated caused the issue, but it was hard to locate). We notified management about it because we had an upcoming release and we absolutely did not want this bug out in the wild.

This one manager from a different office in charge of a totally different development team demanded a meeting to discuss it. Turned out it was a dressing down accusing us of incompetence and laziness that we had yet for find what was wrong ""just go to the part where the code is wrong and look at the history of changes it's not hard, I have worked as a developer, I know how this works, you need to stop dragging your feet and spend five minutes and look"". Also he didn't think the problem was that bad and that delaying the update over it was stupid  and we could always ""use a conditional to check if the datetime is wrong then fix it on the fly"". Try to explain that no, we can't do that because the conversion results in dataloss you can't get back when it happens, and then he goes ""all I'm hearing from you is problems and not solutions, are you going to be a problem maker or a solution maker?""

Then as this stupid meeting (which was delaying us further) was wrapping up, he gives himself a clap on the back being like ""I bet you didn't expect to have to deal with a manager who actually has development experience and knows what he's talking about."".

It is so weird that companies do not see these things as the same thing. You do not have a business without employees, and cultures of ignoring serious discrimination problems are absolutely *not* protecting the company. They are putting it at risk, not just from enforcement action by the government or regulatory bodies, but from actual competition. If you are constantly driving out a significant portion of your talent and homogenizing your workforce, you are making the company actively worse at whatever it needs to do.

I do not think HR is even really there to protect the company, rather they are just there to give plausible deniability to management when disaster strikes.

This is fairly common and the standard from what I've seen.   I get X percentage of my overall payroll for merit each year (usually about \~3%).  It's not directly tied to a performance rating (we split those out).  It always puts us in the position of either peanut butter spread (everyone gets a little bit, but aren't happy) or haves & have nots neither of which are ideal.   This is compounded when people are brought in at low salaries as you end up spending most of your budget to fix that problem (luckily, this is getting better as we've put in higher mins that folks are allowed to offer).. I've also fixed this for my teams by helping candidate and giving them tips on how to negotiate with HR,  I want to pay the most I can, I have zero incentive to bring someone in lower it just gives me a problem to fix later (and the higher the salary, the more raise money I get next year).

I've also seen the whole can't be perfect or can't be perfect in multiple years HR bullshit which I've never understood.

I say all of this for three reasons:

1. Never accept the 1st offer for any job, push back and counter or just push back and say that you don't see that as being market rates right now.
2. Don't expect raises to be anything special, and it's not  your managers fault (at a high level).  3% is good, 5-7% is great, anything more than that is probably a one time thing you would see again.
3. Jobs / roles are 3-4 year stints.  Once you've hit the third year mark, it's time to start looking for the next challenge.  You can get decent bumps inside of places, but you'll always get more going external (your choice on which works better for you).

When the offenders got pissed off, I would say - If you don't want it recorded perhaps it's not something you should say at work.

Offenders went to upper management to complain and were asked the same question - what were you saying that you didn't want recorded?

Upper management wasn't going to reprimand me because I out performed all others on my team. I did twice the work those lazy bastards did on a regular basis.

Yeah offenders thought I was a bitch - other men said thank you.  

I'm glad that younger men are now saying something about bad behavior, even if it is small in tech, we have to start somewhere.  That sucks, but we need to keep fighting.

I've fought my whole life (62F).  When I was younger, police departments and DAs couldn't arrest a man for battery against his wife.  I was on a bus once a week to my state capital until that law got changed.

When my mom was younger - she couldn't do any of the following:

1. Own her own bank account without a father, male family member or husband co-signing
2. Get a credit account without a father, male family member or husband co-signing
3. Own her own home without a father, male family member cosigning
4. Get business loans without a father, male family member of a husband cosigning
5. Get a business license was very difficult without male representation

One person that fought for the changes was Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  American women own her a great debt for her life's work.

I'm head of the analytics department at an awesome tech company and there is just one guy on my four-person team; the rest of us are women.

The guy on the team is very nice, but he is bottom of the analytics totem pole simply because he has the least analytics experience by far. That being said, at *least* half the time someone higher up in my company needs something technical done from my department, they go directly to him, assuming he is in charge by default.

The biggest tell though is whenever we release a technical publication (solely my responsibility, no one else on my team has anything to do with it), you wouldn't believe the number of ""atta boy!""s he gets, while the other women and I are ignored. 

I genuinely don't think these people at my company have any kind of malicious intent whatsoever toward women. After I correct them it's usually ""oh, sorry about that!

Sexism isn't every guy.  It is *that guy*.  And it is everyone else letting *that guy* behave in ways towards women that wouldn't be permitted toward other men.  You will, eventually, run into *that guy*.  When this happens reflect on your current situation, know that he is the exception, not the rule, and take steps to neutralize him.  This is most effectively done by being better at his job than he is and - when he complains about you - knowing that this makes him look like an idiot, not you like a bad person.  But the most important part is recognizing that his criticism is baseless and letting it roll off your back.

I did once receive an e-mail from a guy on my team apologizing for a crude joke in a meeting, to which I replied that I grew up with two older brothers and had heard far worse.

Also, in IT you almost never see photo copying type intern jobs. In fact what you are probably working on is a project that the team really wants to do but can't convince the bean counters is worthwhile.

Sure, that meant a lot of jabs and teasing, but it was the same jabs and teasing everyone else got and there wasn't a lot of malice behind it.  I learned that the coworkers I had had a bit of a currency of unmeant insults in their conversation, and I have to admit that I kind of approve because I'm snarky.

In that job, I found that the sexism I experienced was almost inevitably from (female) customers, who seemed to assume that since they knew nothing about computers, and they lacked a Y chromosome, and I lacked a Y chromosome, I couldn't possibly know anything about computers.  I patiently educated each and every one of those callers that I was, indeed, much better at computers than they were.

I've been lucky since then to move into a better position with a cooler boss and coworkers, which later turned into a full time position with tons of opportunities for advancement.  My bosses are even supporting me going to Grace Hopper this year!",demented_pants,t2_39gdm,1,0,reddit2

That's a significant problem with issues like this - not that they don't occur (far from it), but in a community like 2XC we have a smaller number of people who experience it and can come for support and a *much, much larger* group who therefore frequently read about and vicariously experience such events, even if it rarely or never happens to them.

This means that pretty much every member of the 2XC community is exposed to a constant stream of really overt, unforgivable examples of sexism and bigotry, which makes them [very ""available"" when forming opinions on the subject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), and easily turns into a self-reinforcing [availability cascade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_cascade) throughout the community.

To stick arbitrary but illustrative figures against it - if each person on 2XC experienced and posted about only one example of sexism a *year*, *everyone* on 2XC would be reading about 380 first-hand accounts of sexism *per day*... and it's almost impossible to not then [assume it's almost certain to happen to you every day you leave the house](http://philosophtly.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/fear-instincts-and-patented-lightning.html).

Obviously this isn't to say that sexism doesn't happen frequently, but nevertheless it still becomes *very* easy to hugely overestimate the likelihood of it happening to you or your loved ones personally (ditto sexual abuse, rape, domestic violence and a variety of other hot-button issues) because the vast majority of our experience of the subject these days is second-hand, and from a source which automatically and unavoidably hugely distorts the true frequency of it occurring.

One disgusting example of sexism from one poster on 2XC can be read by the entire community and inform their opinions and world-views, because nobody ever posts or upvotes ""138,502 *other* people on 2XC went to work and came home and didn't suffer a single example of sexism all day"".",Shaper_pmp,t2_1vzs,15,0,reddit2

I'm not saying that the men you're working with are personally responsible, but you have to be aware that you're in an unbalanced environment which is already intrinsically unfair. 

I am a woman who has worked in a technological field for 15 years. I have been the only female in several large departments. 15 years ago visitors to the office asked me to get their coffee for them, and fortunately that kind of thing doesn't happen anymore. BUT I have seen many men less competent than me promoted. I have been in many client meetings where something I said was completely ignored but received well when a male colleague repeated it. When I got a big new job 2 years ago and it was written about in an online trade publication, anonymous commenters called me an ugly whore - something which never happens in similar write-ups about men.

I'm really happy you're having a positive experience and I don't want to dampen that.

BUT 100% of our secretaries are still women. And even though about 20% of young engineer recruits are women, I'd say there is less than 5% of women among anyone with any managerial power. In my direct line of command, all the way to the top, there is not a single woman. It doesn't only mean that the majority of young female engineers will not get a single promotion within this company (that's the case for everyone, that's how pyramidal structures work), but that we are promoted 5 times less than men on average. This worries me. What happens to these women? I can't imagine spending the next 40 years of my life doing the same job I was hired for out of college. Do they drop out of the workforce? Do they need to transfer to more feminine fields to have a chance to keep their work challenging? 

Something I noticed during the first 5 years of my career, and that some friends have noticed too, is that it's actually not too bad as a woman as long as you are in junior positions. I had some very nice, fulfilling, almost fatherly relationships with male superiors as a junior. A lot of men with experience seem to love taking young women under their wing, to show them the ropes. But as soon as you want to work towards becoming their equal, you lose their support. They're happy to help young women, but they will champion young men to replace them.

ca6gmtx,t1_ca6av59,2013-05-26 20:50:48,TwoXChromosomes,"Are you asking about the YouTube ""spiral water"" video:

http://youtube.com/watch?v=2l7tq06Fk6M

>C playing in the water. 
iPhone with freqgen app is generating 30Hz tone and this is driving a subwoofer. Subwoofer has bass port covered with flap. 1/4"" hose is duct taped to flap. Filming at 30fps ""freezes"" the spiral the water stream makes in the air.

>I got a computer speaker set that included a subwoofer with a bass port. I connected the line-in to an iPhone. I ran an app called freqgen on the iPhone and set it to generate a pure 30 Hz sinusoidal tone - 30 beats per second with no harmonics. If you hold your hand over the bass port you feel air pulsing against it. I taped two pieces of foam over the bass port such that the outer one ""flapped"" with this beat. Then I taped a 1/4"" plastic water line connected to a hose to the flap. Turning on the water and the speaker means the water stream gets perturbed 30 times per second in such a way that the water stream forms, at any instant, a spiral. So in bright sunshine, with a fast shutter speed, and a tree behind the stream for contrast, a single photo would show a spiral. If you look with your eyes you just see a ""fan"" of water (in reality a cone). The water spiral, if you could look at it with a hummingbird eyes, is ""rotating"" 30 times per second. If you took two photos *exactly* 1/30th of a second apart you would see a spiral of water in exactly the same position as before. Now, here is the kicker, the iPhone 4s records movies at 30 frames per second. So it, in bright sunshine, uses a fast shutter speed to take 30 pictures every second, each exactly 1/30th of a second apart and strings them together to make a movie. What you are seeing is an illusion created by the 30Hz perturbation of the water hose being exactly in sync with the frame rate of the camera. What looks like water travelling in a spiral is in fact water heading away from the hose in a roughly cone shape stream. If it helps, if you were to compare two frames from this move, any one drop of water at a particular position in the spiral (say the left most portion of a particular turn) will have moved upwards by one ""turn"" of the spiral in the subsequent frame. So that drop of water in the left most portion of a particular turn of the spiral will have moved to the left most portion of the turn in the spiral above in the next frame. The water is travelling in ""straight"" lines (ignoring gravity), the hose mouth is moving in a circle. The spiral looks ""compressed"" as it travels upwards because gravity is slowing the water. If you include gravity (but not air resistance) each water drop describes a parabola.

Does that explain it?

ca6q6r4,t1_ca66gum,2013-05-27 06:29:49,TwoXChromosomes,"My first coding job was because the CEO in a start up didn't want to be totally dependent on the main dev.  What if he got hit by a truck?  Redundancy !

The head dev was a fundy bible thumper with a gazillion homeschooled kids and a wife who was ... Obedient.

He chose me out of all the candidates because he expected me to be unable to master simple tasks and no threat to his monopoly on knowledge of the code base.  His faith in female incompetence was total.  My first assignment had a three day deadline and he told me to take a look and then come to him when I needed help.

I had it completed without any help in less than one day.  This was my first look at the code base as well.  In my code review the only thing he could find to complain about was my ""style"".  It was inconsistent.  

My style was to blend in with whatever the rest of the file was doing.   Various people had worked on the code before me with different styles and rather than impose my preferred bracing and indentation styles I matched my edits to the styles of the file they were in.  I was utterly consistent in being a chameleon.  

Long story short his greatest fear became a self full filling prophecy.  I replaced him.  He continually asserted that I was like Inspector Gadget.  A clueless idiot wandering around and succeeding by luck and the efforts of others/him.  But my track record spoke for itself.  Eventually he missed a delivery date because of a problem he was having trouble with and I got called in to look at it.  I fixed it inside of 15 minutes.  In front of the CEO to whom he'd been maligning my competence for months.

I didn't make him look stupid.  *He made himself look stupid*.  By denigrating me he made needing my help a shameful thing.  After that he could either acknowledge me as a valuable team member and apologize for his behavior ... or run away.  He chose to resign.

I was kind of like inspector gadget ... I was oblivious to most of the politics till it was explained to me after.  I just was trying as hard as I could *to impress him* with each accomplishment making him angrier and more unhinged.",The_McAlister,t2_agnwd,4,0,reddit2

ca6rzsq,t1_ca670ws,2013-05-27 09:53:50,TwoXChromosomes,"One big thing is family life and how society has different expectations for men and women (and women can also make choices men don't, for better or worse).

Many women work part time after kids, sometimes simply maternity leave will get you overlooked for a promotion but working part time or having to leave on time can make you seem lazy. Men however don't have the same possibility/expectation. In most families it's the woman who works part time when there's a choice, even when both have similar jobs.

So I think that's part of where the women go. They get more involved in family life and the men don't. Some like it, some don't, on both sides.

Also there's something to say about women less likely to put themselves up for raises and promotions and being educated and socialized to be meeker. Ambition in women is not as encouraged and can be perceived as arrogance much more easily.

So there are lots of reasons but I think those two are the main ones. Many people use the fact that many women make these as ""choices"" personally to say that it's either a natural inclination (totally unwarrantde since men and women aren't educated th esame way) or we shouldn't do anything about it, or it's just womens' fault (easy to say when you have to discuss family planning with a driven husband and your whole family has expectations on you).",canteloupy,t2_4fi1m,1,0,reddit2

ca6aacs,t1_ca6a0wo,2013-05-26 14:09:08,TwoXChromosomes,"I'd wholeheartedly disagree. Sure, there isn't blatant sexism in the game industry the same way there is in many mechanic shops or in a construction yard(I know not all of these are like this either, but the ones I or my Father worked in certainly were)- but there is still an absolutely crazy amount of games coming out where women are objectified, bodies put on display unreasonably(as in, equivalent males are naturally much more conservative in clothing), and get rather skewed treatment in terms of dialogue or story role.

Furthermore, I'd even offer that /r/Games is *worse* than /r/Gaming for sexist issues. When something clearly sexist comes up in /r/Gaming, often someone brings it up, and most of the subreddit seems to concur. /r/Games vilifies nearly any discussion of sexism unless the sexism on display is horrifically blatant- even something as obviously sexist as [Dragon's Crown](https://www.google.com/search?q=dragon's%20crown&qscrl=1&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.47008514,d.aWM&biw=1920&bih=995&noj=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=HhSiUf24KJSa9QSg1YCIAg)(NSFW) was said to be not sexist at all, because ""The men all have exaggerated proportions too!"" Yeah, well, next time a game exaggerates a man's cock and the size of his hands, let me know, because the only exaggerated proportions on the men in that game is their shoulder breadth.

The entire industry, including its customers, has a *long* way to go. Women are barely beginning to be treated as equals(and it still isn't there in some companies, especially the closer you move to the casual space), but to bring up even the idea that the way women should be treated is not just as equals in terms of sexualized appearance, but in fact as equals on the story stage(seriously, look at how the new Tomb Raider handles women's roles, then look at women's roles in stories in the rest of the generation- it's so starkly different it'll send you spinning) by giving them intelligent, contributing story positions where they're used as more than mere damsels, and you'll be a fuckton better off, if you ask me.

If you want good examples of how to handle women that are already from games, here are a few:

* Tomb Raider: Main character is a smart, resourceful female who is constantly portrayed as capable and purposed. Her clothes, even when they become damaged, only tend to be damaged in somewhat realistic ways. Side character females are similarly put in positions of power, and their fallibility in line with what the males on display show.

* Metal Gear Solid 3: All you've gotta bring up is ""The Boss"". That pretty much seals the deal. Some might bring up Eva and her sexualization, but I would equally offer that it was clear that she was using that the entire time to help cloud your mind from thinking of her as what she turns out to be. At every point, she was in complete control. Never once was her or any other female's sexuality used for nothing but disempowerment or arousal, aside from the magazine item(which is fine, if only because a bunch of male guards out in the middle of the Russian forest probably would have some nudie mags around).

* Bioshock Infinite: Women are continuously put in positions of power, are shown to be intelligent and competent, and when their bodies are shown off, it isn't as mere male arousal, but instead as a symbol in coming-of-age. Remember the first scene with Elizabeth in the chesty outfit- it immediately follows her being covered in blood as a result of a major plot point. Furthermore, in the moments leading up to it, she goes from being fragile, to seeing something must be done, to doing it and realizing the danger of her own power- to immediately trying to come to grips with herself as this newly christened adult.

Female sexuality isn't automatically a bad thing, but there is *so* much more to the unfair treatment of women in games than merely showing off tits or kitchen jokes.",quaunaut,t2_1audr,10,0,reddit2

Dealing with a mere jerk is ... Well I've got one now I'm dealing with.  He treats me like the sexist jerks do ... But I'm not alone!  He's a puffed up windbag who disparages everyone!  Not just me!  When he pisses me off I can ruffle my feathers *and people commiserate because they hate him too*!  We can bond over not liking him!

You can't do that to a sexist jerk because he doesn't treat the guys like he treats you.  They literally don't see that side of him for the most part.  If they do see it they feel torn in two directions by two friends who don't get along.  It's just horribly awkward.  They don't condone what he's doing to you, but they also don't condemn him for it.  There's a baby in that bath water after all.  This is the guy who took an extra shift when they needed help.

If I look at the people in my department with managerial power, they all started climbing the corporate ladder several years before parenthood. It just so happens that in the first few years of their engineering careers, men get promoted and women not nearly as much. 

Also, I live in a European country where paternity leave is serious business. My n+2 (a man) is currently away for 4 straight months after the birth of his second child. Hours are also strictly regulated here (it's illegal to work more than 10 hours in a day, for instance) in a way that should make it entirely possible for people with child care duties not to be too disadvantaged in terms of dedication to their job.

Some women definitely fail to come back from their maternity leave. But it could just as well be that after 5, 10, 15 years busting your balls, so to speak, at a challenging job and not getting rewarded for it, you might feel like giving up when you get the chance. 

> Also there's something to say about women less likely to put themselves up for raises and promotions and being educated and socialized to be meeker. Ambition in women is not as encouraged and can be perceived as arrogance much more easily.

I really want to believe that's true, because at least it would make things actionable. The studies I've found on the topic tend to be inconsistent - some find that adjusted for field and education level, women are in fact as driven and tough negotiators as men, men are just disproportionately rewarded for their efforts.

If you are unable to keep to the _actual_ topic and my _actual_ arguments.. this debate will very soon be over. We were talking about how women experience female leaders, and if you are unable to keep to that topic, I'll just drop it.

2) Here is the Uri book on the topic: http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_beste_blant_oss ), it is a fiction book, but the author has clearly stated that her description of female leaders at the University of Oslo.) Borg has stated: ""Female control techniques (härskartekniker) are more implicit, more manipulative and more secret."" and has written swedish articles on the topic. 

3) Being relatively dismissive and having a negative tone though indicates it quite strongly.


4) The main point in the study I linked was this (not the Pew research report that was also discussed in the same article which you ""quoted""):

>women working for women reported up to 20 per cent more anger, anxiety, headaches and depression than women who worked for men, University of Toronto sociology professor Scott Schieman found, based on a survey of 1,800 U.S. working adults.

>“There is definitely something good for men working for a woman and something bad in the same scenario for women. We just don’t know what it is,” Prof. Schieman says.


tl;dr: women working for women has a higher prevalence of physical and mental problems.

Her requirements of a position that's between 5PM - 6 AM and pays $20/hr are not unreasonable, and as a mother able to raise child(ren) and run a household she is almost certainly not unskilled - the question is ho can she frame the work that she's been doing for the family into something an employer would pay $20/hour for?

Would she be able to organizing someone's  life (or business) by connecting them to services?  Is she reliable in general, does she show up on time?  

If she was doing something fun or learning something new while getting paid a low wage, would it be enough for her?  How much does she /really/ have to earn?

And what is your dad doing through all this?

You recognize that she's scared - so try to be gentle with her.  She may have to learn some new skills, which is probably very intimidating for her if that's not something she enjoys.  She will have to overcome a lot of biases about being an older woman trying to get a ""job"".  All of those things are normal when starting or switching careers.

She could answer emails for a local office, or work for a political campaign (maybe too late on this round), or do customer service.

So, with regard to your mom, if you live in the US, make an appointment with the Unemployment Office in your area and tell them that she's a former homemaker seeking to return to the workforce. They may have employers with jobs that she can be matched to, but will have a list of training programs that she can consider.

You need to extract yourself from the role of employment counselor, it's only going to damage your relationship with her (if you don't care, I understand, it was like I was reading my own thoughts as I read your post). 

She also needs to hear criticism from an employment professional - there are many women like her who need this reality check. The daughters of said women are sick of doing this heavy lift and we also are tired of being marginalized for our own career and education investments, I guess it's our fault for  'making it look easy'...?

Because you know, *everything is our fault...* /s

Good luck to you!",newwriter365,t2_x4fiz,30,0,reddit3

What?! This is like an 18-year-old college student that takes only night classes. WTF? And she thinks that she should be able to pick her own hours?! Sorry but she's not really living in reality. 

Maybe she needs to talk to people that are actually working, or have at least worked in the past 5 years. Let her talk to some fast food workers or janitors and see what they have to say.

I highly recommend her brushing up on the basic office programs such as Microsoft Office, and at the very least, Word and Excel. *She cannot rationally expect to work in an office without knowing those two programs, bare minimum.* Get her some books and she can watch videos online. Or send her to an adult education school, as they usually have classes. 

I tried this with my dad after he called me up wanting to copy some files to his computer,  but he complained that he had to drive too far to go to the class, and that the teacher didn't explain anything to him. He is much like your mother and lives on social security. I starved on occasion because he thought he was too good for most jobs.

This is a huge pet peeve of mine. I've seen it across gender, age, political affiliation though I have definitely seen it concentrated in some areas.

""I don't respect you, and I don't understand what you do: Therefore, it must be easy and you're being overpaid for it and/or if you're not 100% successful all the time and fast it's because you're lazy or stupid.""

And then you get people like OP's mom who probably hold to the 'nobody wants to work anymore' mindset who believe the world is full of easy jobs that let you set your own hours for high pay and then when they need one start going hey this isn't worth it. Where are all those super easy high pay jobs everyone's avoiding?

But I've seen it everywhere. Bosses who just pile extra work up on you because of course you have time to do this on top of normal full time work load, spouses who think a SAHS is lazy if dinner's not on the table when they get home the same day 2 of the kids were sick and the dog started throwing up randomly, boomers who are like I was able to graduate without student loans and buy a house by 25 (\*cough\* with a 25% down payment cash gift from their parents).

It didn't match her previous experience but I felt that her previous job offered her enough office experience where she would at least have some level of basic skill set. She's smart, and we offer training, so I figured it would be a slam dunk.

I put her name out there with recruiting and got the ball rolling.  A few weeks later, she lets me know she didn't get the position or an interview. I'm somewhat surprised, so she then explains that she didn't think she did too well on some assessments she received.

iuxn8kc,t1_iuwwr5k,2022-11-03 19:32:10,TwoXChromosomes,"Oof, your mom sounds like a piece of work. The opportunities for a steady job for unskilled labor in the home at night is certainly a tall order. I wish you luck, but it's pretty obvious your mom isn't being discerning, she's just making excuses. I think the best option for her is for you to stop financially supporting her (if you are) so she can feel the pinch of her own situation and decide for herself where she's willing to give a little. 

I still think a nighttime nanny might still work for her, though. Her job wouldn't require that much interaction with the kids since they'd be asleep. And because there are so few people willing to be nighttime nannies, she could charge more than average. Some parents might even be so desperate for nighttime care that they'd be willing to bring their kid over to her house. 3 hours a day of actual work x 5 days a week is only 15 hours, but she would get paid for 40.

The solution might not even a job, but a combination of other things. At 20 hours a week for $20 an hour, that comes out to roughly $1700 a month before tax.

Rather than looking for a job, if she has a fixed income she could live off of, she could make a hobby out of stretching her budget as much as possible. Like those super couponers, you know? Or if she has a hobby like knitting or sewing, she could make stuff on Etsy or sell her services to neighbors (my mom paid a local sewer to make my Halloween costume as a kid). Although that wouldn't be a reliable income stream, it could give her some cash infusions from time to time while she lived super frugally.

Another job might be as a ""home chef"". Back before there was a ton of gluten free stuff, my mom was diagnosed with Celiac and was working full time so she didn't have time to cook. She hired a woman to cook dinners and lunches for us. She'd cook them whenever fit her schedule (she had a special needs kid with a terminal condition) and then deliver them every few days.

This is also probably unlikely, but she could take on a roommate. Traveling nurses are always looking for decent short term leases and, like I said, your mom's night hours would mesh well with a nightshift nurse. And as the landlord, she could be pretty discerning with her tenant and set the terms of the lease. She doesn't have to work, but she still gets some money. She wouldn't be able to charge $1700 a month (unless she lived in some super high COL area like SF or NY), but in combination with frugal living, it would certainly help.

ETA: The more I think about it, the more I think something like couponing might be really worth mentioning to your mom. The couponing world is a bustling online community of mostly women who are also housewives and stay-at-home moms. These women might've started couponing because they found themselves in a similar financial situation as your parents.

She had been higher-corporate at an eyeglasses/eye care company for years, left the workforce for a bit, and came to our company as a store manager. She wanted to train at a different store than the one she would be managing so she wasn't in the awkward position of her employees telling her how to do her job, so she trained with my store for two weeks. For the record, we were also an eye care company.

Completely computer illiterate. Like, I genuinely do not understand how she made it as far as she did at her last company because she couldn't do anything, even after we worked with her nonstop for two weeks. Couldnt schedule,  couldn't order prescriptions, couldn't open charts. On top of that, she couldn't run any of the pretesting machines. She knew what they were from previous experience, she knew what they did and how to theoretically use them, but she couldn't actually work then properly.

For example, one machine she had to learn was the tonometer. It is the only machine our store has that can actually hurt the eye, because if you push it too far it can poke the patient. Every. Single. Time. I let her try it, she would ram that sucker forward and i would have to physically grab it to prevent it from hitting people. I would remind her to go slow, she would say sure, then ram it again. Then I would have her move aside and show her how to do it properly for the 100th time in a row.

The thing is, people who react like that usually have no idea how any of this works. So unless they ask detailed questions, they probably don't want to hear it.

So I say: don't lie or overly minimize, but allow people to be briefly impressed and move on. Something like ""the science is fun but the paperwork is annoying!"" Or ""I can tell you how atomic microscopes work but I still can't get excel to stop corrupting the data from it"". Something that acknowledges you do something uncommon for a living, but you still have common and relatable problems. 

I have lots of experience with women and sexism in the sciences and I won't pretend it's the same for men. But I can tell you lots and lots of male scientists get similarly baffled/impressed reactions to our work from 'normal' (ie non-academic/scholar/scientist) people and its usually seen as the gracious thing to demur a bit, accept a compliment and move on. 

Also, I don't know how old you are but in my experience this gets easier as you get older bc you'll be meeting people with a bit more experience, and perhaps more tact.

hqboenp,t3_rqk3hg,2021-12-28 20:56:44,TwoXChromosomes,"What I've learned about working as a woman in a male dominated field (construction)

1. Men always think they and their job is more important than it is.  Without exception - all of them.  If they don't, then I guess they pretend because this is a thing.  They all believe that the place would collapse if they don't show up.  It's never the reality.  And they routinely talk themselves up into higher positions, for instance if he's actually the lead warehouse worker he will not let one single opportunity pass to let people know he's actually a foreman.  He's not a foreman...  The scheduler who up until recently had the same scheduling job as I did tells people he's a commercial project manager.  He's not.  He worked on one commercial project and all he did was coordinate the deliveries.  Women NEVER do this.
2. Men ask for a raise at minimum every three months regardless of whether or not they deserve one.  It used to be pretty standard to get a raise once a year, but these days no one gives you anything without begging for it and men have all noticed whereas women seem to have not.  As a result they ask for raises CONSTANTLY.  They will inform you about how integral they are to the company, how much more important their job is than it actually is, and how they should've been made this and that years ago.  The kicker is that, I'm pretty sure, they actually believe they deserve the raise and may be they do.  May be we all deserve a raise every 3 months.  If I ran the world, sure why not?  On the flip side, women NEVER ask for raises, like ever.
3. Men will always overinflate their educational background.  Perhaps not lie but always overinflate.  If they tell you they have a Masters, they might have a Bachelors.  If they say they have a Bachelors, they probably have an AA.  Bonus points if they offer up what their GPA was...  They have zero qualms with telling you how freaking smart, talented, useful, brave, and masculine they are.  Zero.  Women NEVER do this either.

Point is: Be like a man in this instance.  Talk your up not down.  Let people know it was fucking hard AF to get through your schooling and you got where you are from busting your incredibly smart and capable behind.  Then ask them politely to get you a drink while you put your damn feet up because you're tired from all the slaying.  Ask for a raise every 3 months regardless of whether or not you think you deserve it.  Come at them with three talking points for why you should get a raise and just throw it at them.  They will probably give you the wtf face but they'll have no choice but to deal with it and either tell you yes or no.  Do NOT undersell your education.  You worked way too hard.  Put your framed degree up in your office, get a name plaque that displays your degree, put it on you freaking door AND your desk so that every single person that passes through sees that you are the absolute shit.

Men in your profession downplay it, too. I think that it is a really simple reason for it, everybody you work with is just as smart and accomplished as you, so it just seems normal. When I was still a student, my wife and I were having dinner with a post-doc in my group. It was a really busy and stressful time for me as I was finishing my PhD, and my wife complimented my colleague for his recently completing his program, and asked how felt to be a doctor. His response, ""Everybody is a doctor."" And it was largely true, most of his work colleges and social group were doctors or doctoral candidates.

I struggle how to respond as well. I think that is okay to recognize that your work and academic accomplishments aren't just a function of your intelligence. Perhaps the best response is something along the lines of ""Thanks. I really enjoy my work.""",LookAtMaxwell,t2_x587r,1,0,reddit4

Not only does he downplay it but he literally never talks about it with anyone. The most he will divulge is he studied the subject in college. Wont even acknowledge he has a Phd. The only reason i even know is because we got a bit tipsy one night and i prodded the information out of him. I also have a friend who is a practicing psychologist who will make sure you know just how intelligent she is and how proud of the work she does. She has written several papers on the effects trauma has on the developmemt of children into adults. Within minutes she will make sure you know what her profession is and just how passionate she is about it.

I know modesty is a trait put on women by society but it is not always the rule. Some people feel a need to discuss their passions with every person they come into contact with, while some people only want to discuss it with peers in their field if at all.

 Dont feel bad about downplaying your profession, dont feel a need to either. If it is your passion embrace that. If it is just a job to you treat it as such. It is only interesting because you dont meet one everyday, but it IS your every day. It can be hard to receive compliements, especially about things that seem so mundane like studying and working hard for a desired profession.

One reason excel gets used is that it's already on most university computers and every undergrad ""knows how to use it already"", so it's seen as a cheap and easy way to get low-level workers to record and enter data. 

It still causes a ton of problems and should be avoided, but part of this thread is that scientists are just normal people too and even when they are very clever about some things they can be dumb about other things.",Frantic_Mantid,t2_wx86z,2,0,reddit4

I deadpanned said ‘yes, but this team seems to believe only women can do secretarial work, it is frustrating.’ Everyone got quite and I wasn’t asked to do it again.

ihu7zu3,t3_w7yvls,2022-07-27 11:34:48,TwoXChromosomes,"I wish I could say this isn't a common thing I've seen managers do to female SEs or others in tech, but unfortunately it is. I mean, it was in the 90s when I still worked in an office, and it's disheartening but not surprising that it's the same now. Those guys need to act/say/do shitty things to try to establish their authority, especially over women, and especially the dudes who have marital problems and/or would rather stay in the office all night playing video games than go home because their wife and kids hate them.

That being said, there's no reason to get mad at these pathetic people. You need to realize - sorry, you do realize it - you need to *internalize* that you're far more valuable than they are. While they're making social moves, you're building software. While they're trying to put you in a box to show off their ""power,"" you're doing what their superior wants them to do. Ultimately it's true that middle managers in all shapes and forms are a species of dickhead that's just good at kissing ass upward and insulting everyone under them; and for whatever reason, this hasn't changed despite everyone else in the world growing a sense of self-awareness in the last 20 years.

I feel for you, if you were my coworker I'd buy you lunch and let you rail about it to me, and maybe help you file a complaint if I couldn't talk you out of filing a complaint (because it wouldn't really serve anyone's interest). In the long run it's good to just let off the steam and realize those idiots are ephemeral vampire/parasites who afflict all of us who are trying to do a solid, committed job, and that *the sexism is just one way they try to establish dominance.* They have countless other ways of doing it to their subordinates of their own sex. I remember one extremely sexist manager trying to hit on my coworker one morning at 9:30am and then telling me I looked like a bug and he'd ""squash me like a bug"" as I sat in the next cubicle. It's really pathetic; what's most pathetic is that that loser's probably lost his life to bad decisions and his kid is probably doing the same thing 25 years later, while I'm out here mostly resting on F.U. money in my mid-40s as a result of doing the actual work. Whether I still look like a bug or not isn't really relevant, but even my much-insulted, only-woman-dev-coworker at the time had to tell me I didn't deserve that one.

Those people don't succeed. They just struggle to claw out space at everyone else's expense, and it becomes obvious to everyone around them. People like you do succeed. Don't get hung up on their bullshit.",js_9348120,t2_ndufdjh7,2,0,reddit1

As soon as someone mentions a food run, always respond with “No thank you I brought mine” or start giving your order, then stress how busy you are.

Same goes with housekeeping & organizing duties. (Once I cleaned out old food from the fridge, my manager starts trying to add cleaning the break room onto my duties. Went out of his way to make my actual job more difficult because I wouldn’t relent. He kneecapped me for a promotion shortly thereafter so I resigned on a Friday afternoon with no notice.)

What you're referring to is the *un*controlled pay gap, an incredibly misleading statistic (if not intentionally so), which doesn't compare the same job, or even account for the amount of hours worked. Hell, that number would *still* be wrong even for the uncontrolled gap, as the last time I checked it was under $0.20 (0.18 - 0.19, IIRC). It depends on the study, but the controlled gap is usually in the single digits and the amount attributed to gender discrimination is minimal. The [latest data from PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/gender-pay-gap/) for the *controlled* gender pay gap, shows that women earn $0.99 for every $1 men make.

The numbers you mentioned might be for minority women, which isn't exactly surprising. Modern day (fourth-wave) feminism predominantly benefits white educated women, largely comprised of those born into middle to upper class families, an already privileged socioeconomic group in America.

Any woman who works in a male dominated field will get micro aggressions like this regularly.  Probably at least once a month.  If she reports every one to HR, it will hurt HER career. 

I had a woman report me to HR once for asking her to grab something from my desk when she was the only woman in the conference room.  I explained to HR that the speaker phone wasn’t working and I needed to crawl under the table to fix it.  She was wearing a shorter dress that day, and I didn’t feel comfortable getting under the table she was sitting at.  I thought it was a polite way to handle the situation and not embarrass her.  Guess I was wrong.

Several years later I took over the team she was on at another company.  I didn’t hold the previous instance against her, but I always felt a need to keep extra distance between us.  I never felt comfortable taking her to lunch one-on-one for instance.  I don’t think I was able to be as good of a manager to her as I was to my other direct reports.

Did boss offer to teach you how to make coffee, or did he just die mad about it? Because when it's not my job to make the coffee, and someone (sincerely or not) tells me they need me to make it because they don't know how, I'll drag them into the kitchen with me and teach them how to do it. Then, if you're sincere, then you get to learn how to make darn good coffee. And if you're playing weaponized incompetence, then you don't get to do that anymore without actively looking lazy or stupid.

Tbc, I don't really mind making the coffee. But if it's not my job, then I'll do what I can to make sure every coffee drinker whose job it also isn't has a fair share of the duty, and I won't put up with sexism about it.

Edit because I'm high and forgot to make my point: If your boss expects you to do *anything* well without making sure you're properly trained for it, then that's the boss' problem and they're stupid. (And if they expect you to automatically know how to do it because of your sex, then they're stupid and sexist.) Boss has no right to be frustrated at your inability to make coffee if he never made sure you learned how to fucking make coffee.",Navi1101,t2_71dq7,4,0,reddit1

But I want to say offhandedly in my experience guys do take longer to grow up and as a man I didn't feel like my my mind was truly in a good place until 25 to cross that bridge completely from boy to man. I'm in my late 20s now and now try to be a provider myself and my mind feels less chaotic, less unsure of my place in the world. I now enjoy being the one who takes on duties for the woman in my life (admittedly not cooking but not for gender role reasons but I do every other household chore to compensate these days).

When you ARE a 23 year old young man society treats you like still a college boy, and I didn't have a good male role model personally so I stumbled on my journey with my head full of madness.

.The big takeaway I'm hoping you'll see is I think young men today while absolutely ignorant man-children sometimes are not hatefully sexist in most cases. a lot of them are man-children with their mind filled with uncertainty and chaos just like I was then.  I anecdotally noticed young women emotionally mature faster and admired that about them. I think sometimes it's almost too easy for a young man to lean on a young woman as a support which I am not saying is right.

I guess I'm saying I'm sorry you dealt with that situation TilTheLastPetalFalls I was a 23 year old man child AND I stressed out my SO at the time by doing it too which I regret.  All I can say for myself is I got better soon after and that I felt like I wasn't 100% rational when I did it. I treat women much better now and try to support women's rights actively.  


I'm almost 29 now and basically I feel like 25 is when it really started to click in my mind how I was acting. I now provide a household for the woman in my life and I feel better about myself.  I'm not giving you advice I'm just hoping you can find it in your heart to believe most young men are misguided and and not malicious.  All my personal peers  in my age group will say ignorant stuff but underneath all that are 100% on board with women's rights and equality.

A while ago I worked at a big tech company whose name you would know.  One of the perks was free food.  I and the teammates I chose to socialize with ate most of our meals together. 

One of our teammates had a somewhat specialized role that meant he didn't interact with us much, and when we did interact, it was always a bit strained because he was more formal and reserved than the rest of us, not to mention always a bit stressed because of the demands of his position. 

One night I went to a company cafeteria for dinner with my work friends and we saw Mr. Strained sitting at a table eating by himself.  Out of a sense of duty we invited him to join us. It turned out that, outside of the office, he was actually pretty good company.  We had a pleasant dinner talking about fun topics and while his behavior during working hours didn't change, it was always just that little bit easier working with him afterwards.

I can accept a LOT of those points as very valid, but he wasn't being treated that way - he had a managerial position in a full time job that paid well, but refused to let me teach him how to use a washing machine?

and chased my first love out of my life doing it which now I can see that I basically deserved.  I thought maybe my viewpoint might be worth a small amount of insight to anyone here perhaps.  I don't think you did or said anything wrong.

If he's anything like me the reason he can't still be friends with you because at some level he still loves you and it would be too intertwined with his feelings of loss and guilt.

I'm glad you still see the humanity in him. But I don't want to handwaive the bullshit you go through with guys at the same time it's NOT fair to you.  Irresponsible is another keyword I would use to describe myself at 23. I think the idea of manchild and shunting responsibility are very related because being a developed man requires a lot of resolve to not be selfish and self-indulgent.

While my heart has healed since and I now see someone new in a much healthier relationship context I admittedly am still haunted to this day by what happened with my first love with whom I was with from 18-24 and she beared the brunt of my growing pains and relationship inexperience. I'll never forget her but I can see now why she grew tired of my bullshit. It wasn't a rejection of my personhood as much as a rejection of my immaturity.

ihpjlpe,t1_ihpfp0p,2022-07-26 12:56:54,TwoXChromosomes,"Well the one thing I can say with certainty is that MORE men need to be speaking up for us. We're losing our voice bit by bit - you seem to be very genuinely interested in this, and I'd love to recommend the novel VOX by Christina Dalcher as a terrifying illustration of what, to me, looks like the future men in power are imagining for us, and I also think it would be very educational for you and give you a more in depth feeling for how women are feeling in the here and now, because it's chillingly *present* to me. The whole premise is women being electrocuted by an unremovable bracelet if they go over 100 words spoken in a 24hr period. 

But beyond that, as I was saying, yes, speak up for us, because more people will listen when you speak than us. It's an unkind but not untrue fact that we're reaching a point of NEEDING men to help us get our points across, and as long as you're always open to learning and evolving your opinion - which you clearly are - I for one would be grateful for you to add your voice to ours. It's no different than white people standing up for black people's rights - we can help pull more attention to the cause, and often learn things ourselves in the process. 

I actually have a boyfriend who's wonderful on all the fronts my ex struggled with! He's 32, so a little older than my 28, but still, occasionally lacks the emotional depth of understanding I tend to have, but the big difference is more often than not, he's open to learning. In the interest of transparency, I've literally posted comments about us having a rough patch somewhere on here today, ironically  enough 🤦‍♀️

To describe him, I'd say he's open-minded, responsible, understanding, kind down to his core, and (usually) open to learning and evolving. I do feel like I'm not heard, at times, but then I wonder if my mental health issues/lack of voice as a woman influences how sensitive I am to those things, and it becomes a whole cycle.

Many of these men don't want to convince a woman to keep his child but rather force her to and disparage her character if she doesn't want to. That's awkwardly worded but I mean ""convince"" in a wholesome mutual family sense kind of saying those men feel entitled to the children. I will take a look at VOX.

I am also a white person who does stand for equal racial rights.  In that sense I was blessed with societal privilege in several ways but I dont' want to undermine the real efforts and character growth I have shown personally at the same time.  I acknowledge I had it easy on those fronts but I feel I still get to own my successes if that makes sense.

Ultimately I want to lift others up rather than tear white people or men down.

As for getting men to listen That's tricky and I too still struggle to hear my SO and understand her needs and meaning 100% of the time,  men often feel pressured to give advice because it can be more difficult to listen with empathy or understand the kind of language women tend to use.  If your man also has emotional issues especially related to abuse that can impact his ability to emote in the moment as well.  Even me now I am much more thoughtful in writing than I can be in the heat of the moment listening to these kinds of things.

If you'll let me ironically give advice I would say allow your SO to be off the hook for a great response in the moment you are venting.  Give him permission to just listen and come back later after reflection.  Use metaphors sometimes and try to start your vent with the core message especially if your man isn't especially brilliant.  He sounds like he means well though. If he faced abuse like I did especially if he faced the ""tough love"" brand of father give him a little bit of mercy in this regard.

As for me it sounds like I am growing in the right directions based on what you've written and I will read VOX.  I can promise you I will not let them enact some twisted pervert conspiracy without a fight though even having not read it yet.  Not without a fight.  A lot of these guys basically to put it bluntly want a ""bangmaid"".  I still do think younger guys today on average are much better about this though.  Our fathers seemingly had lead and misogyny for breakfast and just aren't gonna change I don't think but we can win the hearts and minds of young men and young men are the ones they would expect to enforce these dystopias anyhow so they should be the  focus imo.

We are pretty dang behind on our projects and so I’m constantly doing my best while also being the bearer of bad news. This shipment for four clients I have been coordinating for weeks was cancelled last minute because of things outside my control. I dreaded telling the clients because it had been delayed and delayed and I knew this was going to be the nail in the coffin for their patience. Well... I woke up to two not so nice emails and couldn’t stop crying. Thought I could stop by the time I got to work. Nope. I even took my makeup bag in case I needed to reapply mascara. 

I met with our lead woodworker and he gave me his time and ears, which almost made me cry more. I was borderline blubbering in moments. My tears were turned into a sign of passion and caring and not seen as weakness or being over-emotional. I’ll never forget that moment. I’ve never felt so empowered by tears before. I had never looked at tears as being emblems of strength and passion.

Everyone reacts differently to stressors, often for men its anger, turned inward or out (which has traditionally and ridiculously been more acceptable) ;  for women its often tears, sometimes of frustration, sometimes sadness or any other strong emotion.

There ARE good men out there who understand this and are empathetic, instinctively, and address the stressors, not the reaction.  Some simply need to be educated for them to have this understanding and react appropriately.  There will always be ignorant people out there, or ones that are dismissive of the facts, and disrespectful, in any respect.  Hopefully more and more will follow in your bosses footsteps.

Women who cry in meetings will be treated as though they are feeble, and not in control of their emotions.

Some men will get upset, most men will be paternal about it and want to be supportive - but that paternalism is a form of condescension in a manner of speaking.

The boss had to handle the situation carefully because he had a staffer break down. The boss may or may not have had a reason to actually listen to her, the reason they did, was simply to make her feel heard.

If you need your boss to go out of the way accommodate your petty emotions, then you're emotionally immature. 

My mother was a Director of Customer Service and oversaw 100's of mostly female employees and she absolutely hated managing women. It was constant, constant bickering, back-biting, crying in her office. Literally, she was a social worker, having to quell petty fights over nothing, listen to people whine and cry all day. 

The workplace is not a high school cafeteria - if you want someone to listen, you have to command their respect, or, communicate more directly the concern - if they don't otherwise want to listen, then that's too bad.

I worked with a man in a professional office environment for 5+ years. We had a great working relationship with mutual professional respect.  We spent time (in the office) in casual conversations and they always revolved around him and his family (married 20 years, 4 kids).

Fast forward 5 years and he works somewhere else in a VP role and reaches out to me under the guise of potentially accepting a position at his new company; again due to professional respect to me.

We wound up having dinner after the interview (I had to travel to a different city for it and was spending the night in a hotel) and over dinner we are catching up. Again, mostly about his family, where the kids are going to college etc. Then he moves on to telling me about his blog. I told him I followed it already (he posted it to LinkedIn a while ago) and he says ""oh not that blog"".  He then proceeds to tell me about his *pornographic* blog with a very specific and **VERY** demeaning female role and wondered if I was into it. You could have knocked me off of my chair with a feather. I declined his offer and took an Uber back to the hotel. He reached out a couple of times afterwards and I blocked him. 

If you had asked me before this day to name one person I knew professionally that was capable of such a thing his name would haven't even come to mind.  I was devastated. I not only felt dirty about the proposition I was also completely deflated professionally. Here I thought I had built up a strong professional reputation and it was paying off being recruited only to find out he thought my assets lay elsewhere.",PuggaWugga,t2_fa12x,60,0,reddit3

I worked in a male dominated company and some of the women would be scheduled fewer shifts because the manager or supervisor wasn't able to relate to them as easily. Currently I work in a very female dominated company and honest mistakes (like misreading a schedule when two shifts are identical with only a 15 minute difference) that get laughed off with my coworkers get writeups and office talks for me.

It seems like a lot of managers struggle to keep relationships from affecting how they reward and punish employees, and it really bothers me that women face so much sexual harassment from their superiors instead of the irritating level of scrutiny I receive; at least scrutiny is related to doing the job.",gHx4,t2_uod9z,19,0,reddit3

At the time I had support in high places available, but decided not to act because I was terrified of him blocking my defense or blacklisting me to employers. My support supported me in that decision, and also supported me when I chose to speak up after I defended. My supervisor told everyone I was unstable, a liar, and trying to manipulate and damage the department... no one believed him, and now his reputation is further damaged because they think he’s the ridiculous liar. Unfortunately since I was no longer an employee and he didn’t actually assault me or break any laws, nothing official could be done and it’s just his reputation that took a hit. I know there are quite a few people who will refuse to work with him now, though, so it has impacted him professionally. Kind of wish I’d had the strength at the time to act instead of just try to keep my head above water, but it was all I could do to keep enrolled in the program and finish, and I’m glad I was able to manage that.
