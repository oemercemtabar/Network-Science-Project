He asked the interviewer if they thought it was okay for women to wear high-heels, figure-hugging suits, red lipstick, blusher etc. and the interviewer was like, ""um, yeah?? Duh??""

So JBP said, ""well, all these things mimic female sexual arousal - lips blush during sexual arousal, as do cheeks, the high heels tip the pelvis up and forward mimicking sexual readiness, and the form-fitting suits display the 70% hip/waist ratio indicating fertility""

The interviewer absolutely didn't know what to think or do. He had clearly *never* thought about that, ever.

It's a good question.

Why the double standard? Why aren't men allowed to wear large jockstraps/cups to advertise their larger-than-normal junk, but women are allowed to display every single sign of sexual fertility, availability and readiness?

I disagree. Women don't like it when men use their power to get sexuality in the workplace. They don't mind it when men they are attracted to use their sexuality to get power in the workplace.  The thing is that Most men aren't able to make most women swoon.  

I've been flirty in the workplace many times to get benefits. Whether that was when I was 19 and selling laptops to college girls, or when I was nominated for an internal company award by a Female VP that I would talk to on my smoke breaks. Or the time I was put forward for promotion when my boss was leaving, a few weeks after we went on a ""ski-trip"" that she had organized, that I had thought she was bringing her boyfriend to, but was actually just the two of us in a room with a jacuzzi and a single king size bed.   


And more generally, When I was a teenager, I was flirty with all the teenage cashiers in the local fast food joints, and they would give me their employee discount. (I was a growing teenager, who moved heavy boxes 4 hours a day 4 days per week, I was hungry.)  

Women are just as vulnerable to these tactics as men, The only difference is that average men will get that way about average women. Average women only do it for men that drive them wild.  

Most of the time its a lot less overt than that. I'm charming, and I'm a born flirt, So when a female manager  flirts with me, I play ball, while treading the line of exactly what I say.  Its helped in situations where I've gone into a meeting with a bunch of higherups, And a few of the female ones, aren't listening to a word I say, but are watching me with rapt attention.

  Suddenly my idea has a whole bunch of traction, even though no-body understood a word I said.  (I work in IT.) When I worked at an MSP, when escalations were slow, they would send me to client meetings to meet the female controllers (basically the lead accountant).

There is a trick to avoid cleavage staring or glancing. 

I swear it works. 

When a woman with nice cleavage is looking at you , ONLY focus on one of her eyes. Only one eye. It must be done as the first thing you do when a woman speaks to you and gets your attention. 

Here is why it works.  The female face is like the letter (V), the face is like focal points in an art painting, drawing the eye around the painting. 

A womans face naturally draws the viewer down to the cleavage and all women are acutely aware of the power of their cleavage. 

Try it , I cannot resist looking down at cleavage, it is like a directional sign pointing down. 

But if at the onset I only look at one eye, pick one , does not matter and keep the focus. 

Pull up beautiful woman with cleavage on Google a see for yourself. 

It is not sure proof without practice. But it works .",dibberdott,t2_626jwcau,0,0,reddit2

I’m friendly to everyone at work, but usually carry an air of friendliness to the point where they might wonder if I’m flirting and it’s worked well for me. I think men and women have different strengths and weaknesses, so it makes sense in a way for a woman to use her sexuality (if she’s attractive) and for men to use their stereotypical masculine traits (if they have them) to make waves.

I think the key here is for everyone to realize that workplace dealings, especially the field you mention, are artificial for the most part. Had a boss who was a hard ass, a man, he was what I think society deems an “alpha male.” Made a few men cry, but they respected him and got the job done. Outside of work though, like during happy hours, sweetest man ever. I have had slightly flirty exchanges at work where both parties left with a bit more of a spring in their step, and the key there was recognizing that it was just fun banter…No expectations because it’s work. However, when it came time for reviews and deciding who got raises, my positive exchanges were enough to get my name mentioned in the discussion. 

With that said though, I keep hearing about a sizable group of men who don’t get much attention, so I can see how this sort of workplace politicking could be harmful for them. …I’m not sure there’s a solution to it though because humans will human.

When a woman flirts in that scenario, she’s not actually interested in pursuing the man and won’t harm him or his company if he doesn’t welcome it. Most men, also, welcome it. That’s why it works so well.

When a man (who is the client) flirts, he is actually pursuing the woman herself, not any benefits for himself or the company. There is a real drive there, and it instantly makes a woman uncomfortable because she doesn’t know how he would react if she didn’t return the interest or rejected him. Would he make her lose her job? Would rejecting him lose him as a customer? Hell, he could even stalk her. In worst cases, get violent.

That’s the difference right there. If a man rejects the woman’s advances, 9.9 times out of 10 nothing happens. He just didn’t take the bait. If a woman does.. you don’t know what can happen. That’s what make it feel so high-stake and uncomfortable.",Izzetinefis,t2_96ok23nq,1,0,reddit2

These /r/falserapeaccusations happen all the time, but nobody talks about it in the media so we think it's rare, but in reality happen EVERYDAY.",Funny_Wolverine_9,t2_8i9c1z06,30,0,reddit3

So basically they consider men as sexual slaves and toys and destroy them if they refuse to perform sexual services for them. They simply force men into sex whether the man wants it or not. That is, BTW, the definition of rape: forcing someone to have sex with somebody else they don't want to have sex with.

hd5ljmv,t3_ppkfjn,2021-09-17 01:40:52,MensRights,"Bro, lots went on here 4 sure & bet u got a few lessons too. Dude's have been straight up raped & ended up in jail for week while we ""investigate"". Shit u have to have seen the videos of a dude getting hit by a car & still he caught the charge. Anyway u know u fucked up reporting it as ""man up"" & ""handle it"" is always expected of men.

So here's the advice: hit up the coworker friend. You need a witness 4 sure. It might be to far gone to 'win', but a witness will at least soften the L.

I've been the witness. Work buddy fired & I knew the whole situation. HR never talked to me & just issued the axe. So when he called asking if I'd be a witness & his lawyer thought it would help. I said ""absolutely it's the right thing to do"". I then went to my own HR guy as I still worked for the company (same guy that fucked up the termination). I told him what was asked & if there was some policy I'd violate or something. He said no violation just say what happened. (He then did finally interview me on the situation. Month late but that's his problem.) Anyway a week later literally ""on the clock"" I'm on a call as a witness against my own company! Bosses I'd never met, a mess of HR people, lawyers & a judge. All I did was answer questions & state the facts. Purely a witness. I'm no judge; that parts not my job, so nothing to worry about. 
Long story not short because I'm telling it. Buddy ended up winning his wrongful termination & my company had to pay his salary (including back pay) until he found another job. I kept working for the company for 3 more years. The HR guy that fucked the whole thing was gone in less than 2 months. 

Morale of the story: use all the resources u have to not get fucked!! Then learn your lesson: that even if u get shot!! Keep your fuckin mouth shut!! Your a man; nobody gives a shit anyway.",stonedkc350,t2_1pcfk5yf,11,0,reddit3

Did they ask you to depose before a in house team? Did they give you an opportunity to be heard? No? Then those are retaliation. You have a case.

>The law protects you from [retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation) (punishment) for complaining about harassment. You have a right to report harassment, participate in a harassment investigation or lawsuit, or oppose harassment, without being retaliated against for doing so.

Since you have already been fired, you need to obtain a lawyer and file a complaint. 

>You always have an option of filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC to complain about the harassment. There are specific time limits for filing a charge (180 or 300 days, depending on where you work), so contact EEOC promptly. 

**Firing you AFTER you made an accusation of harassment is particularly damning.** If they do not demonstrate just cause - including documentation of steps taken to remediate unprofessional behavior - then they are very likely to be in deep shit.

Get started on this *now.* For a major hospital system, you are looking at quite a bit of money. At minimum, you might be able to get your job back, missed income, and interest.

hd5bud5,t1_hd4conf,2021-09-17 00:24:19,MensRights,"I worked in a female-dominated workplace that was toxic with bullying. The HR Manager, also a woman, was one of the bullies.

I watched a manager berate someone for a mistake until they were in tears. It maddens that they're all getting a pension now for being abusive assholes. 

[Women have an in-group bias.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8226295_Gender_Differences_in_Automatic_In-Group_Bias_Why_Do_Women_Like_Women_More_Than_Men_Like_Men). Men do not. Yet one more reason that patriarchy theory is not based on facts or science.

Men don't generally work together to help other men. If men are working together, it's usually to promote class interests - whether they be rich or working class. 

However, what I'm wondering is what why aren't we reacting to the scientific fact that women have an in-group bias?

The Woke will accept that the hiring managers at Google have an implicit bias against women they can't seem to purge - or find in the first place - but won't do anything about the **fact** that female hiring managers will automatically prefer other women over the men there?

What difference is there between rape and consenting sex?

Only what  was in her mind at the time.

She can claim she didnt consent. is there evidence she didnt?

The entire thing is a terrible issue because sex is so common and proving what was IN HER MIND is literally impossible, unless there are other factors. This is why judges used to ask ""what was she waering"" back when women didnt wear slutgear unless they were cruising for dick.

Because that is a secondary indicator of her state of mind. As good as it gets. Just like a text ""I want your dick"" is STILL only a secondary indicator, becuase she could text that, but then laugh at him and turn him down if he tries to make a move because she's ""joking"", either truthfully or because she changed her mind and is gaslighting him to save face for herself.

So even a text saying she wants sex doesn't prove that she consented AT THE TIME to the act of sex. It could be that she wanted to, cahnged her mind, so he raped her because he didnt want her to go without him getting laid.

In that case, the text would ""damn her to rape"" because ""she was asking for it"", just like in the history of feminism they complained judges asking ""what was she wearing"" was ""asking for it [to be raped]"", which was COMPLETE BULLSHIT, but which was a cornerstone of their malicious arguments.

I have a lot of life experiences which I believe would lend insight to a lot of people but so far am uncomfortable speaking about things in too much detail because I don't want to set myself up for any harassment. I'm subscribed here and not to the feminism sub or even twox because I think my opinions on some things would get me harassed over there, due to some of the things I read about them banning people who have even the slightest dissenting opinions. This subreddit seems less extreme than the female-centered subreddits.

The current atmosphere in the (unfortunately) opposing sides is too much. It would make much more sense if the two groups could put aside some initial differences to be able to work together to dissipate the animosity. The majority of the disagreements I've seen have devolved into childish belittling very quickly. Mostly from the women. 

Men's issues are just as important as women's. I'm a single mother of a son, ex wife to a man who I believe was falsely convicted of a rape and therefore I get to raise my son all by myself with no financial help at all. I currently work as a child support case worker. It sucks. People suck. Men and women can be equally bad and manipulative. I've seen it from both sides. 

I pay more attention to MRM right now because so far, they're the only side that I've seen be reasonable. I still identify as feminist because I agree with the basics of feminism.

>I am not owed anything for V day unless we make BJ&stake day a national recurrence.

Well first off v-day is supposed to be for couples to give gifts to each other so this doesn't even make sense. Secondly I don't particurarly care about Blow jobs and steak is nice, but i'd rather have sushi. Why does there have to be a holiday for men that falls into the tropes of masculinity and what a proper man would like. I know there are a number of people who would be more than glad to share their thoughts with me as to why they think that i cannot possibly be a real man if i don't like blow jobs and steak. Why can we not just try to make it more acceptable for couples to reciprocate gifts rather than make seperate holidays? 

>here are dress codes and everyone is supposed to respect them. Dressing as if you are flaunting your sexuality at school or work (unless it's required) is not a synonim of freedom. In some places if you dress showing your sexual attributes you will not be taken seriously just like a man dressed in a tight spandew suit wouldn't be, so don't blame men because they can't keep their hormones straight. It's not about sex, it's about image. Dress however you like when you vlog or go clubbing, but keep it classy when you are in otherplaces where you have to follow a dress etiquette.

I can't keep my hormones straight? Seriously? Do you think that men are some fucking animal? I can keep my hormones straight and i think most people with even a smidgen of self control should be able to too. I don't go around staring at women all day thinking about having sex with them and having to restrain myself at every moment from ripping off my clothes and raping someone. I am a human being and i possess the faculties to make rational decisions and the self control to not follow my most base instincts. This is not mens rights this is misandry


Edit: It also seems to me that you're doing a lot of talking for all women, isn't that a problem for feminists?

So I think one should strive to hold oneself to a higher standard than one's de-facto opposition, and articulate one's thoughts with reasonable qualifiers.

The issue should be whether or not you are dressed appropriately for the occasion. Saying that a reason for dressing in a particular way is because men have difficulty controlling their hormones or that if you dress in a particular way that men will be unable to control their hormones implies that perhaps it is never okay to dress in certain ways since men might not be able to control their hormones around you thus making it uncomfortable, awkward or even unsafe. I can control my hormones, I may become aroused but i have the self control to not look at someone if it is that big of a problem. I don't want women to feel like they can't dress a certain way if they want to do things outside of a setting requiring a dress code because they feel that i might be a problem. Seriously any implication that your average man cannot control his hormones in a way that might cause any sort of disruption is ridiculous and insulting. If you have issues with sexual arousal and controlling that arousal at the sight of someone's shoulders, cleavage, bare back, tight dress etc. (especially in a work or school environment) then you have some serious self control issues. 

My point about bj and steak day isn't that it isn't accurate to what i enjoy, but that there shouldn't be one in the first place. The idea that there is a holiday for your girlfriend and one for your boyfriend is incredibly exclusionary to non-heteronormative couples and doesn't make any sense. We as a society should try to foster the idea of reciprocation between couples. Last v-day I went out to dinner with my girlfriend, she gave me presents and i gave her presents (we both don't have much money, but i have more so i paid for dinner) and then we had sex.

Now if someone were to wear such a t-shirt then complain that people were doing exactly what the shirt says, everyone would think they were insane. Yet that seems to be what women are doing in many cases.

People can sit around and argue that skimpy clothing shouldn't ""say"" those things, but the fact is that it does because it's exactly the sort of clothing women wear when they are trying to send those signals.

These laws said, somewhat simplified, that men should be prioritized at any job-openings, and that women should only be considered if no man was interested.

That's discrimination. To much boob in a picture? That's sulking.

Feminism was one of the driving-forces behind creating a free and liberal society. The problem is that it does not know where to stop. It doesn't bother me that the label feminism exist, as there are multiple issues that concern women more than men, which is the same reason MRM should also exist. But modern feminism is corrupted beyond belief. But all feminism hasn't historically been good anyway.

In the 1880's in Norway, there were two feminist ideologies; the liberal middle-class feminism, and working-class feminism. When laws were proposed which suggested differential treatment, for instance that women could work no more than 10 hours each day, the middle-class feminists would oppose and call it differential treatment, while the working-class feminists would fight for the law to pass.

The world has always been that way. The middle-class women were here not corrupted in that they weren't affected, so they could stay pure to their ideology. The working-class feminists, on the other hand, fought for their own interests. 

Many feminists fight for their own rights to improve, (and many men, I suppose, although the political climate relegates MRA's to make more careful demands), not for equality.",Suttreee,t2_avp2d,10,0,reddit4

chzbwyl,t1_chz30gq,2014-06-04 22:47:31,MensRights,"Western societies are all about individualism. We cherish our freedom, the freedom to make our own decisions and find our own way without anyone else stopping us. We've set up governments, legal systems and social orders that maximize individual liberty. 

This sounds great, but put it another way: western society emphasizes and encourages selfishness. People are out for their own best interests. Accordingly, whatever power we are given to affect the world around us, we use to shape it to our benefit, according to our own beliefs and values (which every one of us believes is superior to everyone else's). 

As women have gained more power, they've used it to better themselves and their positions in society. As another commenter noted, there is no ""stop"" to feminism - the more power they get, the more ability they have to seek more power, and the more they will demand (unless something stops them). 

MRAs are the same. They're an interest group intended to better the position of men. The things that would be good for all men are what MRAs want.

The two 19th century Norwegian feminist ideologies reflect collective selfishness as well. The middle-class women opposed the 10-hour maximum because it would diminish their superior position compared to the working class (middle class women already didn't have to worry about working 10+ hour days), while the working class women supported it because it would benefit their position. It would lesson the gap between middle and working class - bad for the middle class, good for the working class, so the middle class opposed it while working class supported it.

You see the exact same phenomenon in attitudes towards welfare. Guess who thinks welfare is great? The poor and working class who would benefit from it. Guess who thinks it's terrible? The upper class whose position is worsened by it. The middle class is more divided and the tempering voice in the debate. 

At no point is anyone actually considering what's best for *everyone* or what's good for society as a whole. They make a show of justifying their positions with rhetoric, political or philosophical arguments, or any kind of ostensible rationale that allows them to push their selfish desires on others. But at its core its just selfishness. The reasoning and rationale are just tools to shroud the selfishness.

Here's a more local example. I live in Seattle. There's been a loud and vocal movement for increasing the minimum wage here to $15/hour (it passed recently). Low wage workers, especially fast food workers, went on strikes and marched in the streets. Their repeated argument was that $15/hour is a ""living wage"" and anything less relegates low-wage earners to lives of poverty. 

That was their *sole* argument: they deserve a living wage, and $15/hour is that living wage. But they never came out and protested for workers in, for example, New York City, where the cost of living is *far* greater and the minimum wage was *lower* than Seattle's. So if their belief is ""everyone deserves a living wage,"" they would be protesting on behalf of NYC or perhaps the many impoverished countries around the world. Instead, they were protesting for THEMSELVES. They didn't actually care about the moral principle of a living wage and they didn't care about anyone but themselves - they only used this philosophical and economic rhetoric of everyone being entitled to a ""living wage"" because it meant that they would get paid more, that their position would be improved, and it served as a legitimate cover, a vehicle to get what they wanted without simply saying ""we want more money because we want more money."" 

Meanwhile, guess who opposed this movement? Naturally, the people who it would affect negatively. Business owners, corporations, the wealthy and the elite. By improving the position of the lowest wage workers, the position of the upper class and power of businesses and corporations is diminished by a relatively comparable amount. They used their own obfuscating rhetoric though, mostly arguments about how it would raise their prices and force them to fire employees (arguments which had no factual basis in precedence or empirical support). 

Pretty much the same example on a larger scale: the Occupy movement gained so much traction because a huge portion of the US population shared a common selfish interest. That interest was born out of the vast disproportion of wealth and power, ie, that held by the ""1%."" Here's the overall message of the Occupy movement: ""those people have too much. We want some of it. Take it from them and give it to us."" They had the most direct public rhetoric too: they were opposed to ""income inequality"" and disproportionate ""wealth distribution."" Again, fancy ways of saying: they have too much money compared to us.

Selfishness applies to personal matters as well. Why does a child become angry, jealous, and unhappy when a younger sibling is born? Because now that child must compete with its sibling for the resources of its parent. Why does someone get angry or jealous at the idea of their partner cheating? Because they want their partner to themselves - they don't want to share. There are a million everyday examples of this, but they're harder to point out because in personal matters selfishness is more expected and normal. It's only when you enact your self interests in a way that affects the general population that you have to come up with some justification or rationale to explain why others should suffer for your benefit.

Now, this all sounds very cynical, but it's not really, it's just the natural order of things. Because the best thing about our selfishness is this: it's self-regulating. Everyone and everything tends to balance into equilibrium. That's because when one group gets too much, when things slip too far out of equilibrium, the perception of [relative deprivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_deprivation) by everyone else grows proportionately, and the reaction to this perceived inequality is equally proportionate to the extent of the inequality. It self-regulates.

This explains MRAs - one group (women) gains a sudden and snowballing increase in power. The reaction from the opposing group (men) is in direct response to this sudden disequilibrium. Without modern feminism, there would be no modern MRAs. But also consider that the rise of modern feminism was also a reaction to a perceived imbalance against women. Again, as the world goes on, there is a constant push and pull between groups of selfish individuals who share selfish goals. The stronger one group becomes, the stronger its opposition fights back, hence maintaining the equilibrium.

The welfare example demonstrations this. Imagine if only the lowest 5% of income were allowed to dictate welfare laws. Compare that with what the top 5% would do. In reality, we are nowhere near these two extremes. Instead we're somewhere in the middle - we have, more or less, an equilibrium between all interests. If one interest someday becomes too emphasizes, if one group becomes too powerful, the other interests will react accordingly to balance it out again.

It's actually a beautiful thing if you think about it this way. Things are as they should be, and if they're not, they soon will be. And ultimately we are all the same and we all want the same thing - we each want what's best for ourselves, whatever that may be.",brave_sir_fapsalot,t2_ag3d3,5,0,reddit4

 [**Relative deprivation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative%20deprivation): [](#sfw) 

---

>__Relative deprivation__, is the lack of resources to sustain the diet, lifestyle, activities and amenities that an individual or group are accustomed to or that are widely encouraged or approved in the society to which they belong.   This definition allows an objective comparison between the situation of the individual or group compared to the rest of society. Relative deprivation may also be defined as the experience of being deprived of something to which one believes oneself to be entitled.   This refers to the discontent people feel when they compare their positions to others and realize that they have less of what they believe themselves to be entitled than those around them.  Schaefer defines it as ""the conscious experience of a negative discrepancy between legitimate expectations and present actualities.  However, emphasizing the perspective of the individual makes objective measurement problematic.

chzdryd,t1_chzd0vu,2014-06-04 23:58:29,MensRights,">But I have no choice in the matter.

This is the foundational point here; everything else you've just said is a rationalisation to minimise the impact of having a choice taken away from you. In the same vein as the above, you're saying that having ownership of your body is not that great, since you get all these other nifty things in exchange from having your rights violated. 

But most of the things you quote are not something you've gained in return for this ""sacrifice"": 

>I am not upset that it was removed. I'm not missing out on anything that I never got use to in the first place . I find that I prefer the look of my penis to a uncut one.

These are all excuses, not benefits, and the only reason you feel this way is because that part of your penis was taken from you in a context where feeling anything but grateful will get you mocked as and your feelings disregarded, which is par for the course for men that complain about adversity. Circumcised women prefer the look of their vulva with all the meat ruffles; why don't ask your girlfriend if she'd consider getting cut in order to make her vagina prettier. 

Feeling as if you've not lost anything is not the same thing as actually having lost nothing. 

>In the end sure it might be fun to play with but I don't need to explain to girls why my penis looks different than all the other ones they have seen.

You wouldn't have to explain anything at all if your culture wasn't so fucked up as to take day old babies and tear apart then cut off parts of their genitals and then judge the men lucky enough to had been spared that torture. This, once again, is not a benefit you gain by being circumcised as much as it is a manufactured environment that your culture uses to perpetuate the abuse of boys. It is an attack, a threat: ""mutilate your child or we will make his life a living hell until he hates his body so much that he willingly carve pieces out of it in order to be accepted""

Luckily for you, our aim is not to make you feel bad about your penis, but to change your culture and protect children. I frankly don't care about how you feel about your genitals but when you justify the mutilation of innocent boys, we've got a problem. 

Also, you're seriously overestimating how much women care about how your penis looks as well as well the worth of women in the first place. I would hope you would not seriously considering cutting off any other parts of your body in order to please a woman. You're worth more than that now and you certainly deserved better than that as an infant.

Thing is, it isn't. A man wouldn't have to complete a nine month pregnancy followed by a birth. This includes hormonal changes, possible fears (parasite inside), extreme body changes, and at the end of these nine months of possible torture, medical examinations, work impairment, you have to give birth. Giving birth causes permanent change to the genitals, possibly permanently damaging them, causing things like poop pouches in the vagina, tearing, anal tearing, skin tearing, tail bone breaking, and is the most painful experience most humans go through in their lives.

Then you don't understand the conversation, because that wouldn't make any sense. I do agree with that, but it would be completely meaningless to say here.

Tufferugli's argument was that you should be able to force men into supporting a child they were conned into having, because *it's all for the sake of the child, not the woman*. That argument applies exactly the same to women. If it's all for the child's sake, then men should be able to force women to have children and pay for them. Okay, maybe the act of having the child itself is worse for the woman. Or - not maybe, it obviously is.

You seem to be using colloquial words in your comment.

>may not understand American slang.

You seem to refer American English itself as a 'slang' here. Which means it is Colloquial or Vernacular. You are contradicting yourself. You're a hypocrite.

>so we can all forward our understanding of one another rather than being divided by language.

What is the purpose of a language? To communicate. OP has communicated what he/she wanted to say. Those who can understand English has understood it. All languages have different dialects. OP's dialect is merely different from yours. Nobody is dividing anyone on the basis of language here.

Hope you can take this criticism to heart and be less discriminatory in the future.

scrolling through some of your replies on this post, you seem to be very against self-initiated acts of kindness toward women. you seem to also be just very strongly-opinionated against anything you don’t agree with, which is commonly a sign of someone who is engrossed in their own worldview, and this often coincides with selfish behavior and an inability to connect with others on any sort of intimate level.

don’t take Tik toks at face value. it’s a silly social media fad that will eventually burn out like the rest of them. the principles you’re seeing in these videos aren’t a negative thing (putting aside the fact that it’s almost always a staged video and these influencers and tik tok fanatics almost always only want more views and popularity). it is a positive and powerful thing to be aware of opportunities to be kind and to turn your own intuition/consideration/appreciation into something positive for someone else. 

I’ve been dating the love of my life for the last year and a half, and while it most certainly is not gonna be sunshine and rainbows every day, there is no greater joy in my life than when i am given an opportunity to be kind or generous to her or to show my love/appreciation for her and what she does and who she is. and the beautiful thing is that these opportunities/moments can be as simple as picking up a loved one’s favorite snack on your way home from work to surprise them, or waking up before a loved one and making them breakfast, or even just giving someone a call when you think of them. feelings are a powerful thing, and to use them as a catalyst for positively affecting the world around you is something we can and should all strive for. ❤️‍🔥",cudistan00000001,t2_bfx4t2z6,3,0,reddit3

&#x200B;

Men's gender roles are unachievable for most men, like the expectation that you must be at least 6 ft tall or other achievable but harmful expectations such as having to pay the dinner bill etc etc.

Women's gender roles are just as harmful and the expectation is way more rigorously payed attention to but it is at least biologically feasible(for most women) such as the expectation that ""women cannot be fat or they'll be undesirable""

&#x200B;

it is not to say that these Roles are good, i explicitly said they were harmful but lets be honest, gender roles are bullshit, i dont think anyone should be expected to act in a particular way just because of the sex theyre born with and i see a couple of women in the comments who seem to agree with me but are weirdly defensive about the idea that women \*ALSO\* have weird expectations of men that are harmful.

&#x200B;

Like bruh, I am not gonna have my hand on your thigh when I’m driving. I keep 2 hands on the wheel. She used to ask stupid questions that she saw on TikTok as well to test “loyalty”. “Would you rather date me or the prettiest girl in the world” and if the dude doesn’t say that you’re the prettiest girl in the world, he’s not the right one and has his eyes on other girls. Setting us up to fail and then get mad. I couldn’t be happier that she moved past all the bullshit. Unrealistic expectations have gotten even worse on a count of social media. Thank god I have a the girl I do because I know damn well I wouldn’t have a chance with anyone else nowadays.

But I also believe in kindness. You can give people the truth without spitting in their face and telling them how much of a horrible person they are. You fail to help anyone by doing so.

As for my own bounds of dramabomb. I have no friends and likely never will, my parents are very much disinterested with me and most of their attention is to my little sister. I love my little sister and do as much as I can to show her how much I do. Yet in retrospect she treats me like trash. When my parents found out I was cutting my shoulder they told me get a therapist, end of story. Presently now and I keep fantising about blowing my brains out. I know where the gun is, i know where i could go to do it, I even seriously consider it. But still, I wait for something. Perhaps to cowardly to go through with it.

Doesn't matter who you vote for if it's a choice between parties with the same position. Imagine getting a multiple choice test where A, B, C, and D were the same wrong answer.

Oh it's worse than what the video explains. This destructive aspect of pornography is well known by those who produce and disseminate it for free all over the west. Easy access to endless porn is being offered to you for free because they know that it will make people more docile, more prone to other addictions, lower birth rates and less capable of critical thinking.

Pornography is essentially a psychological weapon being wielded with malicious intent.

> And I was acting so self-righteous and entitled to live in Germany since, you know, I was born in Germany. 

It frankly does not matter. You are not German anymore than you would be Chinese had you been born in China instead. I can sympathize that you might feel like you are German having been raised there but you are talking about the 13 years of your life there vs the tens of thousands of years that the native Germanic people have lived on that land. 

It belongs to them and the only reason you and your family are allowed to live there is because Germany was conquered and occupied by foreign armies that, to this day, have never left. You are being forced upon them.",Naxxremel,t2_3yqm8,1,0,reddit4

Banning guns is stupid. You'll just see it switch to knife crime like in the UK.

The problem is actually a rather complex one, and carries several elements from social ostracitization to general mental illness. There is no magical law that will end gun violence, but the US can start by providing better and more available mental health services for those in need. Society can also help by driving a more open and inclusive political culture, instead of both sides driving this divisive and hateful _us_ vs _them_ mentality.

ewaexvt,t3_cned5f,2019-08-08 05:31:39,teenagers,"Blaming video games is as dumb as blaming guns  tbh. When people feel so strongly that they are willing to go and slaughter innocent civilians, inhibiting their ability to buy a gun is not going to stop them from finding another way to kill people. They may go to the black market, carry out an attack with a truck or bomb as has been seen in Europe, or find some other way to kill people. Regaurdless, limiting access to firearms is not going to stop the motivation of these people to carry out these attacks. If we want to actually address the issue of mass shootings, we need to be willing to take a comprehensive look at all the different factors that drive someone to the point of commiting mass murder instead of boiling the problem down to an issue of gun control. 

Additionally, the idea of severely limiting firearms or outright banning  them is completley unrealistic. There are over 400 million guns in the US and any law the severely limits the ability of people to legally buy firearms is going to immidiatley result in the world's largest blackmarket forming almost over night. Every time the government has arbitrarily stopped people from buying something they want, criminals have stepped in to supply that item and crime has skyrocketed. It happened with the mafia and alcohol during prohibition, it's happening with gangs and street drugs now, and it would happen with organized crime and firearms if they were ever restricted or outlawed. These bans and laws don't stop the sale of the product, they just allow the criminal underworld to flourish and for government oversight to be ignored.",PolaroidPeter,t2_200tvo7j,1,0,reddit2

ewatdms,t1_ewactlp,2019-08-08 08:03:42,teenagers,"In an ideal world, we can make sure that only the best people have access to guns. However, gun control only makes it a bigger process to obtain a gun that lots of normal people might find deterring when considering gun ownership. 

And even if would be shooters can’t find a way to bypass the regulatory system the government puts in place and if all guns in their possession magically disappear, how long is it until they get as good at engineering as meth heads got at chemistry? 

Third point, this takes away the right of generally harmless people with mental health issues to defend themselves from harmful people the system didn’t pick up. 

So I’d say it’s fairly impossible to properly regulate things so that psychos can’t get guns, and even if we could, it just takes away from so many people who are just getting their rights taken away. 

And still, through all that, guns aren’t even used by shooters as often as they are by normal people using them in self defense, which is between tens of thousands and two million times a year, if I remember correctly.

When the founding fathers created the constitution they were finalizing a revolution against a monarchy, and of course that would not have been possible of the citizens were not armed. Disarming the populace has long been the practice of dangerous government entities. After the Nazis came to power, they systemically disarmed the Jewish population, and these kinds of forms of oppression can be observed in America. Gun control was specifically targeted towards black populations, an example being when the Black Panthers stood with firearms outside the capital building of California. Swiftly, the Republicans and Democrats, with support of the NRA, repealed open carry in the state because they were afraid of black populations being armed during the civil rights movement. And it isn't unreasonable to think that our government is still oppressive in a similar manner when issues like police brutality and abuse throughout ICE Detention Centers are so prominent. Current events have shown that government figures aren't perfect and don't always have our best interest. Simply, For every atrocity a man with a gun has done, there are more atrocities done by the government.

A mass stabbing in China resulted in the death of 29 people and injuries to 130. The weapons are not the issue and restricting law abiding people from owning firearms is not going to magically fix the motivation behind why these mass shootings keep happening. People will keep killing whether it be by running people down in a vehicle, creating bombs, or hanging up to carry out mass stabings. Until we as a society are willing to just pause for a minute and try to figure out why people are feeling the need to kill countless innocent civilians instead of just saying bAn AlL dA gUnS we're going to keep witnessing these horrific events.

That's exactly why we revoke rights, rather, why we try to make the best decisions possible to insure both the freedoms and safety of our citizens.

Just to discuss: What's the difference between an a civilian AR-15 and an M16? Rate of fire. That's where our government has decided to draw the line. The reason being that a fully automatic assault rifle *might* cause more damage than a semi-automatic rifle. Just like a Rocket Launcher *might* cause more damage than a knife or a hand gun.

We look at something and consider the over all potential damage it could cause to the public if misused or abused and we ban those things to make everyone safer (in theory). This is why we ban certain substances like chemicals that could accidentally kill you while cleaning your bathtub, or vehicles that are unfit and unsafe to drive on our roads, or building materials that cause cancer.

That's not to say that our government hasn't been misguided. As others have pointed out we banned alcohol and that didn't do a whole lot nor did the ban last. Luckily the constitution is a living document and we can continually amend it to best serve the people of the country.

So look at Dayton, Ohio, the shooter was active for just 30 seconds before being killed. However in that amount of time he was still able to kill 9 people and injure 27 others.

36 victims in 30 seconds, how many lives were saved by him not having a fully automatic rifle? How many could have been saved if all he had were a pistol, hunting rifle, or knife? We don't know and we can't ever know. These are just hypothetical questions.

Then the question becomes, when do we move the line and where do we move it to? You can argue that more gun violence comes from hand guns than 'Assault Style Rifles' and it's also 100% true that absolutely more people die from general gun violence than mass shootings.

However this isn't what we are trying to compare when we look at banning something like the AR-15. We are looking at how much potential damage can an AR-15 do? Simply put, a hand gun isn't going to kill 9 people and injure 27 more in in 30 seconds.

So we have to consider, is something that has the potential to harm as many people as an AR-15 worth leaving un-banned?

How many people died in car accidents before seat belts were made mandatory in 1968?  How many people died from mesothelioma before we stopped using asbestos in buildings in 1989? How many people died gang related gun violence before we banned fully automatic weapons in 1934?

The grim reality is that we will have to hit a number as a society in which the majority of us say ""this number is too high"" and legislation gets passed to regulate it, regardless of special interest lobbies (which is the hard part).

TL;DR Banning a weapon because of it's potential danger to society isn't anything new or unusual and banning a single type weapon for being exponentially more dangerous than others isn't revoking any rights or violating the constitution.  We already do it, it's why you can't drive an Abrams to work or go hunting with Bazookas.",WizardPoop,t2_dp0q6,0,0,reddit2

In fact, for the record I strongly agree with you– I tried to make it clear in my response to like the 2nd top comment that I absolutely agree that guns aren’t the issue either, it’s the fact that those guns get into the wrong hands that’s causing these horrific outbreaks of violence, and we need to do something, whatever that thing may be, in order to keep those people from obtaining those weapons. No, that doesn’t mean banning firearms altogether, that’d just cause nation-wide outcry & would be futile anyways since the black market is a thing. I don’t even know what it means besides universal background checks (and I also think the notoriety almost always granted to shooters by news outlets covering the shootings doesn’t help whatsoever) but I totally agree that the person here is only half right: yes, video games aren’t the core issue, but neither are the firearms. Granted I personally don’t think any average US citizen has any reason to own an automatic or semi-automatic gun- a simple shotgun or something of the likes is all you should need for self-protection or even just for hunting and similar sports- but that’s just my personal opinion, and overall I’m on the same page as you in that throwing out guns altogether isn’t the answer to the outbreak of violence in the past decade.

Still, what’s the point of expressing an opposing viewpoint on a post that’s an entire quarter of a year old? No one’s gonna see this, the post isn’t on “hot” or trending anymore– how’d you even find this post?? Did you literally just search “guns” in the search bar out of desperation for politically-driven posts to comment on? Also, you’re beating a dead horse here– if you took the time to scroll through the comments you would have seen that everyone and their dying, anemic, 80 year-old grandma already came here to express pretty much the same thing as you- that thing being that guns aren’t the issue either- so I wouldn’t really saw that you’ve “introduced” anything notable here. It doesn’t matter what you said the real issue is- society, mental health, whatever- you’re basically saying the same thing that 400+ people have already amalgamated into a comment on this bloody post.

So, you’ve basically come here to this outdated post that I made over the summer, 3 months later, in the last month of fall, during a time when the leaves are dying and snow is already starting to fall in the bitter cold depths of the Midwest where I live, *just* to comment essentially the same damn thing that hundreds of other people have already stated? Find something better to do, man (or woman)- go to r/politics, go to some other Internet forum about guns, go literally anywhere else besides here. Heck, maybe even have a *real life* discussion with somebody about gun violence prevention. Or, idk, just appreciate the plain fact that a middle-aged woman is seen here openly acknowledging that video games *aren’t the issue*, even if her views as a whole in this situation aren’t exactly 100% agreeable.

As for atrocities done by the US government you have domestic issues like MK-Ultra and McCarthysim to name a few. And for international stuff, America has supported Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen which specifically has targeted cholera hospitals and ports to cause disease and famine.

ewa8g32,t1_ewa2cvm,2019-08-08 04:28:51,teenagers,"Sorry to butt in, I just want to share my thoughts. It IS true that countries such as Germany, Australia and countries with 'gun bans' have low rates of gun violence. The problem though, is that correlation does not equal causation. Take Australia for example. Even when the mandatory buyback was enacted, not very many people turned in their guns. Same with New Zealand. Even after their recent tragedy, people are still standing up to the buyback programs. Punishing a population based on the actions of one person is not right. 

&#x200B;

Second, let's say that the government becomes tyrannical. The people have had to put up with enough that they are willing to fight back. Let's also say that every military personnel is 100% loyal to the government. That means about 1.3 million versus a population of 350 million. We know for certain that not everyone will fight. Let's say that every 1 in 50 people decides to fight back. That still means about 7 million versus 1.3 million. You might think ""well, people with no training can't fight back against the military!"" Just ask the insurgents in the Middle East. There is also the added fact that fighting on your own soil, spilling the blood of your own people, isn't going to be the same as fighting terrorists in another country. For all they know, they could be bombing their friends, neighbors, even their family. And then there comes with the problems with nukes. A country can't nuke an entire city just to get rid of a small population, and the entirety of the UN would be on the US's ass the second that happened. The government might be powerful, but they sure as hell can't control the uprisings in the Middle East. How do you expect them to fight against their own people? 

&#x200B;

Last, I see this argument a lot. Yes, the Second Amendment was written during a time where modern technology did not exist. That doesn't mean that the Founding Fathers hadn't anticipated changes in technology. Civilians were allowed to own ships with cannons on them and the machine gun was invented a few years before the 2A was written. While we can't ask the writers of it, we can safely say that they anticipated changes in technology. This applies to the 1st Amendment as well. Free speech can harm people, (even more so now that the internet exists) but nobody uses the argument that mobile phones, computers, etc. were around during the time that the Bill of Rights was written. 

&#x200B;

tldr; 

Gun bans do not cause lower gun death rates (Take Mexico and Venezuela for example)

The military is unlikely to fight against their own people and will still be outnumbered nonetheless

The founding fathers anticipated changes in technology.

ewadffi,t1_ewa2cvm,2019-08-08 05:16:30,teenagers,"There is a lot to cover so im hoping i can divide this up into 3 parts.
1. I totally get where you are coming from but there are some common misconceptions about other countries policies. So Australia suffered a mass shooting in the early 2000s, and in responsed held 2 federal gun buyback programs. A buyback is where the government pays citizens to sell their guns to the government. Only about 30% of the firearms in the country were turned in so not much had changed. As for legislation, they didn't outright ban guns, but they added a few policies. To own a gun in Australia, you need a reason like hunting or sport, but defense isn't recognized as a legitimate reason. Australia's gun problem wasn't solved by any of that because there wasn't any actual improvement since there have been 6 max shootings, which doesn't seem like much but remember that that is they have never had mass shooting problems and that it all started with only 1 mass shooting. Next is the UK which has not done any good. Its near impossible to actually acquire a firearm which has made a difference. While their gun crime did go down, in response their other classifications for violent crime went way up. Criminals starting using knives as weapons instead and now they have a huge knife problem, so now they are wanting to pass legislation barring the use of knives. As for Germany, while they do have some of the strictest regulations, they also have some of the highest gun ownership rates in the world. I understand why you may think that more guns lead to more violence, but Germany has been one of the safest countries for a long time, even though the have lots of guns. Lastly for Scotland, they have near identical restrictions to the UK with very few gun owners, but since the absence of guns their homicide rates have gone up. Their restrictions were enacted in the 60s and 80s. In the 60s their rates of homicide per 100,000 people was about 0.7, but since then their average rate is about 2 homicides per 100,000 people.

2. So for the government becoming tyrannical, I don't think it is going to be a stretch that citizens could seriously compete with them. As for nukes, America won't nuke its own land, and modern rebellions don't really organize themselves to be sufficiently targeted. And yes they will get tanks but the nature of a rebellion has evolved to a point where it could work. The reason we won the Revolutionary war was because of guerrilla warfare (A type of warfare that revolves around ambushes and surprising tactics) and it still upholds today. The American military lost the war in Vietnam to Vietcong rebels, who were really just armed civilians who knew the terrain. If guerrilla tactics were used in modern America it would be near impossible to beat because of the scale. America is massive and the military is literally not big enough to fully control it. America is 3.8 million square miles, and about 1.3 million us soldiers. you couldn't secure America if you tried because there ins't an army large enough. It would be an expensive, self-destructive, and unwinnable war.

3. lastly for the 2nd amendment being invented before new technology. The thing is that it was written based on a principle, not technology. Just because guns have gotten more advanced doesn't make a tyrannical force any less of a threat. The founding fathers weren't basing it off of the danger of a gun because at the time you could literally own a warship with 3,400 ton cannons.",,,5,0,reddit2

ewac5hw,t1_ewaahv1,2019-08-08 05:03:54,teenagers,"I described ""ganging up to carry out a mass stabing"" when talking about different violent outlets. That was specifically meant to imply the fact about their being a gang of people who carried out the stabbing referred to previously. 

Regaurdless, that dosen't negate my point. That event still resulted in the death of 29 people without using guns. Any of these mass shooters could have found others of the same mindset to carry out their attacks with them, such as with Colombine. Additionally, they could use trucks (London Bridge Attack-11 dead) or bombs (Manchester Bombing- 22 dead). Both methods of have been used in countries with restrictive firearm laws and both have resulted in more deaths than the Dayton shooting. 

Trying to boil the conversation about mass shootings down to gun control fails to actually solve the issues fueling the people who carry out these attacks. Restricting law abiding gun owners' access to firearms just forces these homicidal maniacs to look for new violent outlets or illigal means of accessing weapons, both of which these people have repeatedly done.",PolaroidPeter,t2_200tvo7j,1,0,reddit2

The Sutherland Springs shooting was stopped by a bystander with a gun, after the shooter was shot twice by a retired cop with a gun. The great part? The shooter was prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing firearms and ammunition due to a domestic violence conviction in a court-martial while in the United States Air Force. But he still got a gun, proving just how easy it is from criminals to get guns outside the law.

Yeah, no American goes to school with the fear of getting shot constantly in the back of their mind. Maybe you should be though, considering the current work leaders in the amount of mass shootings.

1. Honduras (60.00 deaths per 100,000 people)

2. Venezuela (49.22 deaths per 100,000 people)

3. El Salvador (45.6 deaths per 100,000 people)

4. Swaziland (37.16 deaths per 100,000 people)

5. Guatemala (34.10 deaths per 100,000 people)

6. Jamaica (30.72 deaths per 100,000 people)

7. Brazil (21.9 deaths per 100,000 people)

Take into account 2/3s of all Americans have owned, not held or fired, but owned, a gun at one point or another. That’s about 220 million. And there are also 400 million guns in America, 2/5s of all guns in the world. We don’t want to be like Rambo. It is actually pretty fun just to go out and shoot at a range, and we bring our guns home for self defense. The problem is that we don’t see the warning signs before something terrible happens. It is too easy to obtain guns in America. But if you try to take our guns, people will get killed. That is because the government, which is already heavily anti firearms, wants to basically act as though firearms are worse that drugs, and will try to enact a forced government buy back. They will start using the police to enforce it. Cops will get killed because there are people who are extremely protective of their property and cops that will handle the situation badly. Cops can’t handle it, government calls in military. Gun owners across America will fight back, triggering a second civil war. Which would wrap me, you, and most everyone in this sub up into it to fight, because we are approaching the age to have to serve.


And all one would accomplish is removing firearms from law abiding citizens. The criminals, the mass shooters, will gain access to firearms no matter what. And then the public would have no way to defend themselves. Because most mass shootings are stopped by someone good with a gun, the death rate from those shootings would increase. 

All in all, violent people will obtain guns. We can’t stop that. But that’s not a good reason to try to take all guns from the public as a whole.",AICEofSpades,t2_3hbrdcxl,5,0,reddit2

But nonetheless, it seems that you misunderstood what I meant by “outrage.” No, nobody would care about a bunch of gun owners complaining about losing their gun rights, that’s not a big issue. What *would* be a big issue would be the number of gun-related incidents that would start happening as a result of a total ban on firearms. Yes, I know the point is to get rid of those firearms in the first place, thus completely nullifying the issue, but there’s no way in hell that we could possibly get rid of all of the guns in this country. People already own them, and they would hoard them, hide them away and continue to use them. And like I said, a certain portion of people would undeniably get angry enough that they would go out and trigger shootings– thus, I think banning guns outright would only *worsen* the issue of gun violence while failing to even actually get rid of any guns.

I mean, if we’re talking a John Lennon “Imagine” sort of hypothetical where we can magically get rid of guns, yes, I agree that would be a good solution to stopping gun violence if it were possible. Unfortunately, this is real life, and realistically speaking it’d probably be impossible to just get rid of all guns in the US.

This is an interesting little article that I quite like to sum up the issue, but you’ll have to do a lot more digging for a more comprehensive look.

I don’t want to get into a discussion about it (I’ve had many in the past few years, and they all just leave me feeling drained), but my personal take is that guns are so dangerous because of their efficiency. It’s not easy to kill dozens of people with a knife (and that article that you linked to me earlier specifically only had 4 killed and 2 wounded). It’s difficult to maneuver a van into a crowd in most circumstances. It’s not difficult to use an assault weapon and spray ‘n pray.

I think that a long list of policy decisions are needed to slowly reduce the abundance of guns in the US, specifically rapid-firing ones. No civilian needs an AR-15. It’s that simple. The cost-benefit of having such weapons in the hands of the public simply isn’t worth it.

Good luck with your research :)",PedanticPlatypodes,t2_13zpk6,3,0,reddit2

On the other hand, of course, there's still the fact that many ND conditions are debilitating, and both friends/lovers may be prone to struggle against the need for basic functioning.

i357jnl,t3_tugwgu,2022-04-02 19:56:53,teenagers,"* Deceptively smart. People who brag are obnoxious, but I love people who like math and computer science for what it is, not because being smart is their personality.
* Secure. I like the kind of people that wear practical clothing or comfortable clothing rather than the one that shows off their... features. They don't want or need to be liked by people, all they care about is having a few people who they want to be around, and they're ok if it takes a while to get to that point.
* Tough. Someone who's emotionally stable and deceptively optimistic, even when things suck. That isn't to say they can't have off-days or even off-weeks, or that they can't have deep conversations or like depressing movies (even better if they do), but they aren't going to be phased by bad situations, like when someone's rude to them or when we go camping and it starts pouring rain. The people I love find ways to lighten the mood and laugh through it. She takes responsibility for her mistakes and moves forwards, even when it's not entirely her fault. I know this point definitely makes me sound like I'm looking for someone who I can abuse without them fighting back, but I know a lot of people whose existence just stews in self-pity and attention-seeking behavior. I really don't want to end up with someone like that, they drag down the people around them.
* Christian. This one's a must for me, I need someone who will always lead me back to God and would pray for me even if I lost my faith. Not one of those religious people who are obsessed with rules and the opinion of people in the church, but someone who's genuinely seeking a relationship with God in the same way I am.
* They're ok with silence. They won't go just because there's nothing to be said. Sometimes, when her soul aches, she'll just come up to me and cuddle up next to me, and I can do the same with her. We just gotta appreciate each other's company and physically communicate love and support when words just won't do a thing.
* Funny. This one is something that everyone says, but it means something different to everyone, so all I'm gonna say is that they have a dark and stupid sense of humor.
* Pretty. We all like having something pretty to look at, right?
* Likes nature and hiking. Someone who would absolutely be down to go on week-long backpacking trips. They gotta be able to appreciate time away from electronics.
* Adventurous. 20-hour long road trips? Hell yeah. Walking somewhere with no plan in mind? Sign me up. Skydiving? Sure, why the hell not. You get the picture, they can't be overly cautious. Gotta have some youthful spirit.
* Values her relationships. Isn't going to be the kind of person who seeks petty revenge on people she's loved in the past, realizing it's best just to let go of resentment in those kind of situations and move on to other things. She would never lash out at the people she loves, even when she's under a lot of stress.
* Likes depressing media. Kind of a dumb criteria, but a lot of people don't understand why anyone would want to feel *more* depressed, and I can't explain it, but practically all my favorite shows and games are depressing as hell, and I'd like to be able to share that with her.
* Can sit down and watch an entire show or play an entire game in one sitting. I'd love someone who would be down to spend an entire weekend indoors playing a video game in a blanket and pillow empire.
* Can kick my ass in a fight.

Rant if you want to read it:

>!but something I just want from anyone is just to actually have a conversation rather than just talk to talk and even then if I get into a conversation the other person just gets up and leaves mid way through after I stop making jokes and start just talking about stuff or asking a question that isn't out of place comedic in some way which makes me feel like I'm just faking it till I make it, but a lot of people are thrown off because they don't understand my humor. but I cant help but do it because if I'm doing that, I actually exist, and if I don't do it I don't exist and its hard to find a middle ground in that kind of situation because a lot of people are already invested into talking to other people rather than me, which puts me in two places of feeling worthless or feeling like I'm the center of the room because I made a joke about how a farmer hid a turtle up his ass or something. another thing I wish for is just that people ask me questions because anytime I have a conversation I'm usually carrying the whole thing on my back because the other person is either bored or they just want me to say something else funny which puts me in a where I feel like no one cares about what I have to say, and after going several days without talking to another person or having an electronic to rant or shitpost on just feels suffocating, which doesn't help because silence and waiting are two of my biggest pet peeves because I don't know how to break silence without putting myself in the center of attention and I hate waiting because there is literally nothing I can do to make it go faster. another thing I hate dealing with is when I have one thing I have to do but I don't want to do it and I wont let myself do anything else until I do it so I just end up wasting the day away doing unproductive nonsense, its like looking at your unfolded laundry but worse, and I feel like it takes time away from working on myself as well because I don't really have a hobby or anything productive to do in my spare time.!<

2. Sentient.

3. A good, caring person who wants to make the world a better place.

4. Shares my interests. 

5. Pleasant to talk to and hang out with. 

6. Deeply in love with me.

7. Able to physically interact with me (sorry, no ghosts and no permanently long-distance relationships).

8. Wants to (and can) have my babies.

9. Knows me better than I know myself.

10. Rich enough that we don't have to work.

11. Pleasant to look at.

So the worker, my friend Diane, put it at the end of the guest service desk until she had a chance to put it back in reshop. This bitch then pretends to talk on her phone and not leave, all while trying to inconspicuously inch toward the camera. It was obvious she was going to steal it, so Diane went over to another worker, and said she's going to put it away in reshop, and they both knew why. Then the bitch just made a huge scene and called Diane a racist and claimed that she said stuff about her, when she only ever said that she was putting it away.

Like 20 minutes after they got there and we were playing games she started trying to make moves on me, I told them to get out of my house and since my parents got me a knife to protect myself, I threatened to use it if they didn't get off the property. (I believe I was in the right to do that because they did try to rape me) This was 2 years ago when I used to go to a different school, and I was around 14. We don't live in that state anymore and I am ok because I prevented myself from getting raped.

huse5vh,t1_hus4epb,2022-01-30 00:30:34,teenagers,"Certain psychologists indicate that, on average, women are more sensitive than men and are also more cordial and more apprehensive or anxious. They discuss that men tend to be more dominant and have more emotional stability. This causes society to unconsciously assume that for a woman, rape is an irreparable trauma, while thinking that a man won’t suffer in the long term because of it. Also, a man's punch can be more than 162% stronger than a woman's. This makes it more socially acceptable for a woman to hit a man than for a man to hit a woman. Also, when a woman and a man insult each other, her offense can seem minor for the simple fact of having a much higher pitched voice. All this harms men and women; but it's sexism. 

If a woman objectified a man while thinking that she has the right to mentally, physically or sexually abuse him, it’s misandry.",danaaaban_,t2_bbio6ldt,1,0,reddit1

husng7n,t1_huse5vh,2022-01-30 01:39:52,teenagers,"I can agree that those statistics can effect the way someone thinks about female on male rape and sa, but whenever I have asked women and sometimes even men why they think it isn't nearly as bad when it happens to a male, or why it is ok, the answer generally bottles down to one of three things, either, ""Because they are women,"" ""Women have been oppressed for years and therefore can do no wrong"" or ""Because men deserve it."" I have never once heard the answer that women are weaker so therefore they can't do it to men. That's just personal experience but I find it unlikely that that is the reason people think it can't happen to men. And even then, I wouldn't say it's misogyny so much as stupidity, if someone sees these statistics, they probably won't think it is because women are just super weak and can't do anything or whatever, it's probably because it is more likely the man will over power the women, and while that is reasonable, it is stupid because there a million other ways a women can rape or sa a man then overpowering him. Plus if he hurts her there will probably be a lot of lash back. I think that when it comes to rape or sa, it doesn't happen to men. When I was growing up I wasn't taught that when I say no, it means no, I wasn't taught that if someone is touching me inappropriately it isn't ok. I wasn't taught how to protect myself or what to do in those situations. It wasn't even mentioned to me.

Part of the survey asked inmates who had a gun during their crime where they originally got it.
Dr. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, was part of a team that used the data to estimate how many illegally possessed guns. 
In the 13 states with the fewest restrictions on gun ownership, 40 percent of inmates illegally obtained the gun they used, Webster said. Only about 13 percent purchased the gun from a store or pawn shop.
In the other 37 states, including New York state, 60 percent of inmates illegally procured the gun they used, Webster said.  
The data is hard to track because gun ownership laws vary from state to state. New York state has universal background checks, for example. All gun sales have to go through a federally licensed dealer. A state like Mississippi, meanwhile, does not require background checks outside of gun shops"" TL:DR the last study by the U.S bureau of Justice Statistics was done in 2004 and it was about 60% but its very very hard to tell since gun laws and such are varying from place to place, which is why they stopped trying to record to statistics in the first place.",WeebOsu,t2_29w4hma6,0,0,reddit1

I knew a lot of 'tough' guys that were all bark but didn't do anything. All I can say is, keep going strong and if it helps the situation report them. If you have friends to fall back that helps as well and if not I can be your friend. Highschool bullies don't last forever, sometimes they end before the school year ends. I've had my fair share of bullying so I know. They aren't mean because they're girls, they're mean because they're assholes and their will always be assholes.

No, obviously. Hypergamy has really done a number on people hasn't it?  The implication, the insinuation, is that a female is automatically never low on the 1-10 scale just on account of being female? You say over average and yet someone is offended? Come on now. Being female should not make you an auto-ten. It doesn't make you an auto-ten. It's never made you an auto-ten. It's never going to make you an auto-ten. Even if 80 percent of men become permavirgins due to standards plus the effects of hypergamy they'll still objectively not be auto-tens even if 80 percent of women still get laid. Why? Because the number would only be properly judged by the ten 20 percent of males still going with the 80 and they would/will have a preference. If not biased the sexless males would have that same taste. Bias in regards to lowering standards reeks of low self esteem on the male's part but when truly being impartial while still having good taste you end up with the same exact preferences and standards of judgement as some high tier male would have. In other words, you're not a 10 but if you as a male were a 10 and called her an 8 she'd have downright swooned. I'm not even properly articulating the whole issue here, the effects of hypergamy sum up to spoiled women. That's it in a jiff. Uppity spoiled women with double standards and such. You can't say it any nicer than that without leaving out something important. Women have life on easy mode, being 10 percent of the jailed and 25 percent of the homeless, only about 30 or so percent of the suicides, don't make me start on the statistics because I can go beyond it an cherry pick instances where 10 of 10 women get away with literally sexing with per-pubescant boys and get like a day in jail for it. Double stards. No guy would be insulted being told he's over average. I mean, what is the thought process emotionally? ""How DARE you imply your GODDESS/GOD isn't perfect! YOU HAVE SHAMED ME""

So uppity I can't stop imagining some sg1 goa'uld bullshit where they act like immortals that can just choose the best of the best bodies to live in. Parasitic implication meant to be implied also. Fuck em then leave em then listen to 'don't hate the player but the game' and such, that reeks of some 'nothing of the host survives' shit too. I swear there's a fucken gleam in the eye too when they get too uppity. ""That guy hit on me and he's how old? I'm only 17, how dare he! Such insolence!""  *proceeds to date adults and gets fired because no one actually likes her except for whatever guys out there are pretending to like her*

my crush is my best friend and i asked him to rate if i look between 1-10 and he said 6

i got kinda sad because ya know...he's my crush! but the next day he said that he thought i was a 7 but got really nervous saying it-

if he wasn't my crush i probably would've taken it as an insult the first and second time XD 

but it also depends if she is overly confident about her looks, if she is, a mere 9 may seem like an insult

for girls like me who are insecure, even a 5 will be an over complement and we may now believe it

7 is pretty  
8 is beautiful.   
9 is gorgeous (where most of what people call 10's would fall)  
10 is perfect/flawless, No flaws. Nearly everyone would say this person is perfectly attractive and not many people should fall into this category since it is the top of the scale. It's supposed to be reserved for the best of the best.

Firstly, you can't be over a ten. Ten is perfect. So 100 and 11 are not valid answers.

Secondly, the average girl is going to a 5 or a 6, because that's what the average of 1 and 10 is. So if you are above a 6, you are above average hot. 

Thirdly, just because your hot doesn't mean your instantly an 8 or 9 or 10. You have to be hotter than most women. Most women are hot, so if you are also hot, you are most women, so about a 7. A ten is top 1% celebrity model.",jobless_bozo,t2_qzm354nj,1,0,reddit4

The only way to guarantee that 5 is average is to simply declare that it is, which has a chance to mean that not everyone fits on the scale or that going up or down one point means a different amount of change depending on where you are. I think it’s a far better idea to define 1 as the minimum in the set, and 10 as the maximum. From there the average can be guessed at. I’d but the mean at about 6.5.

Even 10/10 may be found by some to be offensive because we are not ‘objects’ to be ‘rated’ by males in any way or form. There is no objective ‘beauty-meter’ so really you are telling her that, in your very personal opinion, you don’t think she’s that hot and that you find other girls more attractive if you say anything less than 10. 
Basically it’s rude and immature to ‘rate’ a girl in any way. Just be respectful and genuine and if she’s looking for a compliment just tell her something that you like about her",Mamba_CvV,t2_2axgdplt,1,0,reddit4
