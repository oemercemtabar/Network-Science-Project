I work in an office that is connected to a big factory - 3000+ workers. I constantly, and I do mean constantly, deal with supervisors, superintendents, production managers, etc., who love to come in and have pissing contests over the most mundane and pointless topics. 

This morning I had a higher up manager threaten my job because I had my office door locked while I was inside. Keep in mind, it is policy to lock my office because we have hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of switches and other tech in here, but I had forgotten to unlock it last time I came in. Big deal.

Now, as much as it pissed me off, I don't care because I'm a subcontractor and that guy has no authority over me to begin with. But just the way they go about trying to flex their authority completely infuriates me, almost to the point you were at with your job.

cd0oghc,t1_cd0lxq8,2013-10-27 16:37:52,science,"I had a similar situation at a former employer.

A deadline was looming, a necessary procurement was needed. I was directly involved, but there had never been any clear line of responsibility or even authority declared there. In fact my first day I asked who I report to, the EVP who hired me (call him S) looked me in the eyes and said, ""we don't really do that here. We all just work together to get the work done."" So to 'get things done' I went to the EVP who gave me his CC info last time (call him M) to find out if we were going to do things the same way. A little while later I get a short email from S saying I need to read my email and pay attention better. I ask what he's referring to. He forwards the email to me, which I had read, and all it said was we'll do what the developers want. Well, I had already asked them and they were unsure and since it involved a multi-thousand purchase I figured it was prudent to get some guidance from the bosses. Rather than a nebulous ""we'll do what the devs want."" Nope not good enough. S calls me, but my VOIP phone there had always had issues and for some reason S couldn't hear me, but I could hear him when he calls. You can hear him growing more irate telling me ""unmute the damn phone!"" nice, if only I had thought of that... ...  Anyway the he kept trying to call me and was getting more belligerent so I thought it was ridiculous when he was right down the hall. So I hop over to his office and that's when the yelling began. 

I asked, as calmly as I could, ""what is the problem here?"" He blows up, ""you told M you don't know what you're doing and he comes in here asking me why my people don't have direction!"" I'm floored and say, ""I've never worked anywhere where just asking a question is bad!"" Yelling from both parties ensured until M appeared at the door and said nothing. S suddenly become more reasonable and told me to do what we had done with the procurement last time. 

It was dropped without another word, let alone an apology. S barely spoke to me after that. The whole year working there was full of crappy like that. I was ready to quit many times, but comfort and just enough time between the crazy kept my butt planted. 

It all came to a boil when S had given me some work to do that I finished and it sat for months without launch. Suddenly one day, they want to launch by COB, but of course not without major changes to the site. Well fuck, no risk there. I do my best to report issues, but soon my feedback is ignored. I go home for the night and monitor email and the site for issues. Would you imagine it, there were. Shit blowed up and M sends me, and two others a short email saying to be at the office an hour early. 

I show up 10 minutes earlier than the time requested and start setting up for a long day. I get my computer up, and get some coffee. Nobody is around. Well, then I decided to check email. I see an email that was sent 15 minutes before the agreed upon time, the time when I was parking my fucking car, saying to meet on a different floor. It's now 15 minutes AFTER the agreed upon time. Fuck. I bolt down to the meeting room and as soon as I open the door, M starts yelling at me, ""brnitschke, get OUT. GET OUT! NOW!"" 

So I go back to my desk, heart pounding with adrenaline. One of the other guys strolls in closer to the normal start time. He says he only just now in. He thought M said be there sharp at the normal time. M was always a hall monitor about butt-in-chair time though. He'd even leave 9am sticky notes on people's monitors when they were not there at 9am. Mind you our jobs had no reason to be there sharp on the hour at that time and nobody was ever later than 15 minutes once in awhile. 

The next day M and his wife (she was his boss and the vice president of the whole company) called me into a meeting to give me my pink slip. Yay, you just did me a favor and lit a fire under my ass to leave your crappy company.

We have many instances where the lower classification worker is more qualified and a harder worker than the higher classification worker.  The lower classification has to wait around for the higher paid, less qualified guy to get the equipment running.  It takes about 10 years to get through the clock numbers in order to get a higher classification.  Many union members have complained to me about this system but my hands are tied.

I had a boss in the theatrical industry (I did technical work for a while) who harassed me almost constantly, implying I couldn't do my job properly and that I was a waste of space in ""his"" venue because of laziness - the reality of the matter was that I'd been thrust into the largest venue that the company had with very little relevant experience.

   My boss expected me to do 2 persons worth of work in a 5-6 hour 3am-9am baker's shift. She wanted me to do the bake AND open. There separate jobs for a reason. Well she got transferred and the next boss ended up expecting the same thing. We had 1 other baker who was a maniac and would literally run around the shop doing 3 things at once. She was just one of those crazy workhorse people, she wanted to do as much as humanly possible no matter what. It was killing her in the worst of ways though. Although we never saw eye to eye on some things we ended up being very close friends, I do miss you Wendy.

I was not slouching, I was concentrating on getting the bake perfect. It showed, my bake was consistently better than our other bakers and customers noticed this. The shop wasn't always ""as ready"" when I baked because I let the opener do their job instead of having done it for them. 

My boss about a month before I quit (was moving out of state had no choice) brought me upstairs and told me I was pathetic and was doing a terrible job, and I can do so much more and blah blah blah. I put my two weeks in about 3 weeks later, and never came back.

Well I've called that shop a few times, sometimes to catch up with my co-workers and other times  to get info so a prospective employer can have the info they need for reference stuff. Lo and behold, the boss that said all those nasty things? Has had failure after failure of a baker join the team. Not showing up, not being able to do the bake, etc. She more or less begs me anytime I call asking if I am back in town and want my job back.

Think your boss is a prick who can't handle criticism and you are a honestly hard worker? Leave the company and call back in 3-4 months. If they haven't found a equal replacement they'll realize what they lost and beg for you to  come back. It's amazing how hard it is to find honest, diligent workers.

cd0of0k,t1_cd0mbli,2013-10-27 16:35:53,science,"No supporter of capitalism claims that it's a perfect meritocracy. It's course, there are lots of individual circumstances where it's not perfect. It's like a ramp made of stones, in general it goes up but if you look close enough there are individual edges of stones that are facing the wrong way. Lots of them in fact.

Sometimes people don't get the promotions they deserve, sometimes people get promotions that they don't deserve (including people who are good workers and good people, who have a boss that is too generous).

At the end of the day, good workers are more likely to get promoted than lazy people.

It's not really possible to look into most companies to see how they work. A lot of the time your only knowledge comes from people bitching on the internet, meanwhile all of the people with normal experiences don't chime in.

But a good example would be the NFL which is basically a workplace that you can see all of the workings of. Sometimes bad assistant coaches get promoted to head coach, and bomb out. Sometimes good backup players have to sit on the bench for a while. During all of this, the people in charge think that they're making good decisions. And ultimately, things usually work out. Good head coaches have long tenures. Bad ones get fired (which opens a spot for someone else to have a chance). Good players get noticed on the practice field or break out when they have a chance to play, and get promoted or traded for picks, going somewhere where they have a chance to start.

And the best part about capitalism is that if the system at your current workplace isn't rewarding you the way you think you deserve, there are lots of alternatives. In many formulations of communist systems this would not be the case. Your kommissar decides which job you do.

The roiling, chaotic nature of capitalism is actually part of the strength. Because perfect outcomes are unrealistic, what you want is a mechanism for dealing with imperfect outcomes. To fire people who get promoted and do a bad job. To accidentally promote the right person, and then have them grow into the role and prosper. The robustness is the strength.

Looking at anecdotes and deciding whether a system is good or bad is really stupid. Thinking that pointing out that something isn't perfect is a valid criticism is also really stupid. In general I think the overwhelmingly vast majority of people do not understand what is so great about capitalism.",luftwaffle0,t2_67qcj,-9,0,reddit2

**""Right to Work""** is an Orwellian, cynical attempt to undermine unions. Normally, when workers vote for a union, all the workers covered under the contract have to join the union and pay the union dues. That's called a ""closed shop,"" because the shop is closed to non-union workers. ""Right to work"" outlaws the closed shop, allowing workers to benefit from the contract without having to contribute to funding the union, weakening it.

**""At-will employment""** is when either party to an employment contract may terminate the contract at any time for any reason or no reason at all, essentially eliminating any kind of job security for non-union work. There are restrictions, however. You're not allowed to fire someone for race, creed, sex, maternity status, or engaging in concerted activities to improve wages and working conditions, including joining a union. Enforcement of those protections, however, is kind of a joke.

People love the idea that you have all sorts of protection from losing your job, but they typically fail to realize that these also serve as barriers to entry in terms of getting a job in the first place.  Employers have to be a lot more careful about who they hire when it might cost them and be difficult to get rid of them.  And jobs become these things that are so hard to get, that people rarely leave them.  Job mobility shrinks in such an environment.

But if they can drop you at any time, they're a lot more inclined to give you a shot in the first place since they know it's easy to let you go if you aren't working out.

Got some problems in your past?  The last thing you want is laws that give you all kinds of theoretical protections against losing your job, all these things you can sue your employer for if he fires you for the wrong reason.

It's over, you move on apply for another job some where else. If this happened at any other state than Texas every fired employee would turn right around and sue sue sue. Even if their claims were unfounded. So what does that owner do? NEVER FIRE ANYONE EVER no matter how much they suck, even if they have negative attitudes talking trash to other employee's bringing down morale and such.

The more time you spend kissing up and self-promoting during working hours, the more attention you may get from your boss, but the less you'll actually get done and the less experienced you'll be when you get your promotion. Employees with great ability acquire it by being focused on their work, not on workplace politics.

I think the best way to get around this is to have bosses actually *working* with their employees, so they can observe their employees' strengths and weaknesses for themselves. If a boss can't do that for whatever reason, he or she should perhaps promote primarily based on seniority, since experienced employees are generally more skilled and fit in better with their colleagues than inexperienced employees, and employees who have too large an ambition-to-ability ratio tend to drop out of the workplace because there is little they can do to climb the ladder faster than their competitors (ahem, colleagues).",Nausved,t2_37nkb,2,0,reddit2

""Hey sales guy, how come sales are so low?""
""Well, whenever customers come in and look, they usually comment that our product is exactly like our competitor's product, but more expensive.""
""Hmm, no, that's not it, they're probably just stupid and you're not working hard enough.""

I used to work in a music store, instruments, amps, gear, music books, accessories etc. Other than a few specialized items like accordions and wacky old instruments that made up like 1% of our sales, we sold the same shit as everyone else. The vast majority of customers came in looking for cheap Chinese made drum sets, guitars or violins or similar stuff for their kids to start learning on. A large portion of customers came in for mid-range guitars, amps and related gear. Every music store sells those too, your Fenders, Gibsons, Ibanez, etc. The problem was that our prices were usually like 20-50% higher on most of them, so most customers would come in and look, see the first few prices, and leave. The boss was an oldschool sales guy who would try and get every looky-lou's name and phone number, and was pretty aggressive and would scare them off. 

He was a nice enough guy to listen to his family and employees tell him that our pricing was way off, and that in modern retail customers get annoyed from aggressive sales-people approaching them as soon as they walk in the door, but he wasn't interested in change. A lot of people would just walk out the door, head down the street, there were two other similar shops within four blocks, and another one maybe 10 blocks away. 

They had a really good music school running upstairs that kept the place afloat, but man, that store didn't do well.

It goes straight to the boss, who has to pay the workers. The less they pay the workers, the more they keep for themselves. The more productivity per hour they can get out of the workers, the more money in their pocket. The less they invest in good working conditions, the more left over for their own profit. An employer always has an economic incentive to maximize profit.

Workers, on the other hand, have an interest in maximizing their own profit, in the form of wages, but also other things. They have an interest in healthy working conditions, paid sick days and vacations, short enough hours to spend time with family, health insurance, a less strenuous pace of production, and many other things that have an adverse affect on profit.

This conflict of interests might be suppressed but it's still there. It's in the nature of hierarchies to create conflicts between the interests of the people at different places along it. This might not be obvious in some places but it's usually pretty obvious in unskilled labor, especially in countries without laws protecting workers' interests.

What makes you think this is wrong? If their labor is worth that much then that is how much they should be paid.

It should also be noted that they're getting paid a lot more than if the capitalist system did not exist. If it didn't exist, they'd be getting ""paid"" whatever food and shelter they can find and create from the forest.

> Hardworking people getting trapped in poverty is not a bug that gets corrected for,

Oh, I see. You don't understand the absolute basics of capitalism.

""Hard work"" - what's this mean? Joules expended? Should a person who digs holes and then fills them back in all day get paid more than an engineer? No, obviously not.

Time spent? Should a person who plays video games all day get paid more than an architect? No, obviously not.

I know what it is! It's supply and demand! If your labor consists of performing a menial task over and over without any thought required, you're easily replaceable and thus your labor is not worth much. That is why you would not get paid much.

Where the meritocracy comes into play is when you compare two people performing the same task. A person who works harder at sweeping floors will get paid more than a person who is lazy at sweeping floors. It's the same for any other task.

And this actually fits into supply and demand as well, since hard workers are in low supply, and there's a higher demand for them than lazy workers.

For what you're saying to be true, you would have to think that it's better or equally beneficial for a person to be lazy than it is to be hard working. That is clearly not the case.

One thing I might suggest to you is googling ""economics for children"" and checking out some of the books and websites that are available.

cd0waeg,t1_cd0vy55,2013-10-27 22:16:20,science,"Yeah that is shitty.

I am not defending the idea of not letting your employees have lunch breaks. The franchise owner is a dick for not giving his employees reasonable time to manage themselves (eat, go to the bathroom, take a break). That is why we have laws from the government -- because (some) capitalistic organizations will abuse people to reach the bottom line.

The idea I was trying to get across is that we are in a free market. Meaning if a company (or individual franchise owner in this case) is abusive, their employees will not be as productive. There are countless studies that show low employee morale results in poor productivity and performance. 

However, in certain industries such as fast food service, it is the nature of the beast to not be treated too great. Certainly you should be afforded basic amenities, such as lunch breaks for instance. Though when you are doing a job that so many people can do, you do not provide value to your employer. When you do not provide unique value to your employer and your spot can be filled within the week, you will have a bad go at it.

I think this is one of the reasons our parents always told us to go to school. They knew that learning unique skills adds value to yourself. If you are productive for a company, they will need to treat you better, because just as they can fire you and replace you, you can leave and work for their competitor. 

When I was in college I had to work as a waiter. I even worked in Panera Bread washing dishes before that. I had no experience or skills outside of my high school diploma. Fast forward 6 years and I have a degree and experience and have a salaried job and benefits. I have a decent amount of leverage with my employer, because they invested a lot of money and time training me. I am not so easily replaceable. I knew this was how it was gonna be, way back when I was 18 washing dishes for $5.25/hr. I knew my life would be horrible if all I ever did was wash dishes and clock in/out. 

If you're wondering what the hell my personal story has to do with employee rights and capitalism, the message is that if you don't want to be treated like shit, you have to make yourself better than the position and find somewhere else to work. As long as there are jobs where all you do is wash dishes, employers will not care much about you. That is until robots automate things and no one will have the job.

Say I decide to start a business because *I* want to be rich and succeed. We'll say I started a company that saves people money on electricity by installing a device on their house.

Now I know how this product will be made, how it will be sold and marketed. I may be able to do this myself for a little while. Eventually, I will need to hire someone to help me. Maybe someone who can focus on sales while I continue to refine the product. Now, am I hiring this person because I want to provide a good living for them?

No, I started this enterprise because *I* wanted to make money for myself and I found a good way to do it. I hired someone because *I had to to keep growing*. If I could continue to operate and grow just by myself, I would never hire anyone else, because it would be throwing money away. I'm in this business to make money, not to provide for others.

Now we fast forward 10 years and I have 50 employees. Does the same mindset apply? Well, in the real world no, I should care about his employees and the people who help my business succeed. However, the employees are being compensated by being paid. It *is their job* to make money for the company and by extension, the owner (or stockholders in a large public company).

I think the important thing to note is that expanding your company makes very qualitative changes to your lifestyle by changing your daily duties and by working with other human beings whose lifestyle are in turn dependent on the decisions you make.

The problem is that people have a very top-down view of how business should work, that since they were the first branch on the tree, they should remain on top while everything else exists as a foundation to support that branch. While this is a rational outlook, it isn't necessarily utilitarian, people unfortunately have a hard time grasping that what's good for everyone is inevitably good for you as well, but people tend to treat success as a zero-sum game, and thus the traditional hierarchy seems mandatory.

The funny thing is that the actual structure of your business remains largely unchanged in a more socialized outlook. If you're the engineer and you hire a sales guy, your duties are more-or-less the same and the wages more-or-less remain within the window of what the workers would expect them to be, but now you happen to be more conscientious of the workplace culture you've created and your sense of agency comes with how you contribute to that culture so that everyone inside it ultimately benefits in a way that's not just related to money.

Though if you ask me I think more business would be way better off if the expenditure of profits was determined by the culture itself, perhaps democratically or by charter in order to retain the integrity of the culture and its method of expansion.

There's also an overrepresented sector of programmers and admins on this site, but that's beside the point.

The point is that many companies, retail, white collar, blue collar non-union, etc, are plagued by middle management that gives promotions and raises on favoritism.  Sometimes they hire someone with the intent on giving them special treatment and fast-tracking them up the ladder.  I've trained my boss or someone to become my boss at least 4 times in my last 3 jobs over 10 years.  Seniority and knowledge don't mean squat in today's workplace.  

I understand both sides of the argument, and if you're not a good fit in the hiring person's eyes, you're not gonna get the position.
