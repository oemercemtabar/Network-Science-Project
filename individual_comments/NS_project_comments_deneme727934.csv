Some girls can sure but thats the exception not the rule. Plus most girls wil pick cusion airconditioned  job typs if the get the choice cause means working with people. What makes girls more happy doing. Guys like more to work with things. Are acepting of more dirty jobs. Why all girls complain about is being ceos being leaders being boss babes. Almost none are looking to go do dirty jobs. Would be funny to see. But as long as there free job choice it wont happen. But get why you want that do cause all girls complain about is the best paying jobs that are the most competitive that the should get those jobs handed to them what is bullshit. Work for the position like everyone els not get shit handed for free cause you dont have a dick. Why a lot of people just dont respect girls to many free rides.

Why is it ok for there to not be an equal number of sewer workers or street sweepers?  There’s way more of those jobs around than CEOs or partners in law firms!  

The real point here is that feminists only want equal (or superior) numbers of women in plum jobs: that pay well and have status in our society.  If a job is not well paid or not valued by society (ie people doing it aren’t given respect), they don’t care if it’s only men who do it.  As an example, firefighters have a degree of status even if they’re not all that well paid, so feminists demand that women have lower physical requirements so more women can enter the jobs.  They don’t care if it endangers people’s lives to have someone in such a position who lacks the necessary physical strength.  The fire service is respected by people because they save lives, and they want to be damn sure that as many women as possible are getting that respect.  Garbage collectors and sewer workers (not to mention builders labourers) are essential, but are less respected as they don’t so clearly save lives as firemen do.  So feminists don’t care, and don’t demand the roles be made more women friendly.  Even separatist feminists who give out lists of female mechanics, electricians, plumbers etc so that women won’t have to have any contact with a man don’t care if it’s men who collect the garbage or keep the sewer flowing.",Angryasfk,t2_4h5eu4lg,24,0,reddit2

I can see why on this one.  Just ran the jrpat for pre-employment screening, that shit is brutal.  Have to complete it in under 8 minutes, wearing a 50 lb vest to simulate gear.  Drag a charged hose, then sling a high rise pack (70 lbs) over your shoulder (now caring 120 lbs on your frame), and climb the stairs twice (about three-four total flights of a residential home).  Untrained guys are gassed at that point, untrained women may not even be able to shoulder the pack.  Then ceiling push/pull simulator (moving a 70 lb weight on a lever with a pike pole), ladder raise, Kaiser sled (driving a 70 lb steel beam with a sledge hammer two feet, that's a lot of heavy, hard swinging), pull and lower under control a high rise pack 40 feet (once again, that 70 lb weight), AND FINALLY drag a 175 lb dummy like 50 feet.

My training background is powerlifting and running, albeit riding the pine for a year before starting back up a month ago, and it took me 7:30 and was gassed at the end, no wonder women are so underrepresented.

Well, children stop being cute when they constantly throw tantrums, throw food, color on your floors, and chase the cat around.

Here is the thing though.....most of that happens because mothers who stay at home ""mother"" their children...they do not RAISE them...i.e. they pander to them, try and be their best friend, etc.  

Being a stay-at-home mom is much easier today (in terms of work done) than it was 50 years ago, as stay at home moms no longer ""keep house.""

My wife does not stay at home, but the general lack of housekeeping still holds true. I watch my wife spend an hour playing games trying to fed my son, watching all his cartoons with him, turning bath-time into a 45 minute ordeal.

The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat- you never know what each day will bring and I get to meet the best people, business owners, IT directors, CFOs, etc. 

I have no idea what I would do all day if I didn't work- it's especially hard to go do something when you _have no money because you're not working._ Women don't seem to need a real purpose in life though- they're perfectly content to live completely meaningless lives with no actual goals and happy to never achieve anything at all. 

In fact, work for them is something they're constantly trying to get _out_ of not do more of.. and then they wonder why they never accomplish anything in life. So bizarre, stupid and insane. What makes women miserable though is jealousy and entitlement- when some other female gets the guy who makes all the money and she gets to live like a queen and never has to work. 

Feminism was a complete and utter failure and the fact that 84% of women polled say they want to be housewives is the ultimate proof Feminism failed. And it was stupid from the very beginning. Except for the occasional terminator cunt who just has to prove she's a real man, the vast majority of women want nothing to do with actual work. Oh, they certainly want a _title_ though, a pedigree, which is why so many of them go to college, so they can hold that over everyone's head all day and never shut the fuck up about it. But actual work? Fuck no. Actual achievement after college? Forget it. They only go to college to get the degree to feel superior and to meet a guy in college going places.

You're not going to believe this, but women have an extremely difficult time just simply adhering to a set schedule, showing up on time, working all day and coming in everyday and being reliable. Women are insanely flaky and squirrely- exactly the same way they are in relationships- fickle, moody, unaccountable and great deal of that attitude comes from their spiteful nature like some kind of insolent teenager, ""You can't MAKE me do anything, I don't have to do what you say, na na na na na,"" extremely, extremely childish behavior. This notion that TV and movies try to push that it is men who are irresponsible and flaky is complete bullshit and it's the opposite. If men were are unreliable and spiteful and immature as women, the entire infrastructure would collapse.

Women just want STATUS- that is what they really, really want; to be able to say they are some title with some degree, thus making themselves 'better' than others. And of course to just prove that they can finish school and get a degree. But the actual day to day work they despise and see that as below them. That's why the few women who DO go to college and become something serious like doctors or engineers quit after just a few years. 

And it's also why in 50 years since they gained equal rights, 95% of  women have never just rolled up their sleeves and gotten to work competing with men in the workplace. 

They simply don't want to be at work and really 99% of them simply CAN'T work a full time job day after day for years. That's why the turnover is so dramatic with women and they leave the workforce at 3 times the rate as men. Women are just not suited for the workplace; too emotional, always sick, too moody, too volatile, too jealous, spiteful, petty and vindictive.

And women's values are radically different from men and they have drastically different goals. Plus being able to sit at home all day and not have to work is yet another status level they want to achieve to present themselves as 'better' than the rest. ",Ovendice,t2_bb6yt,4,0,reddit3

Therefore you should become the new toilet monitor and loudly deride all who not close the lid, for health and safety reasons.

I had exactly the same experience as her - made redundant from my job and stayed at home with young kids for a couple of months while my wife found shifts as a casual teacher.

Aside from the depression one feels after losing a bread winning job, and the financial stress (we ended up selling our house, pulling the kids put of school and moving in with family before I found work again), I can honestly say it was the happiest time for me as a father.

I really enjoyed the tasks of making the lunches, and once my wife got over the fact that I was in charge of cooking and cleaning but still learning, I think I handled things pretty well. Even hanging out the endless washing was nice, we had a beautiful sunny back yard, and my pre school daughter would potter about in the grass while I sung a song and got the job done. I realised that while I'd been working all that time to pay for it - I'd never actually just been outside on a stress free Tuesday morning in the sunshine doing a kind of pleasant task. when I was working I only ever went out there to more the lawn or fix the fence. But now I was taking time with my daughter to have a nap in the hammock between tasks, or one time we made people goop with corn flour and water.

And yes, the picking kids up from school was kind of tedious - but my daughter loved riding in the bike seat, and my son loved being the only kid at school who rode there on his little bike with training wheels.

Like I said, aside from the crippling guilt and depression from the redundancy and subsequent unemployment those are really very precious memories for me. of course I eventually got a job and all those times stopped and now I have to endure watching my wife revile the only job that ever gave me deep satisfaction.

I had to stop reading when the author started talking about that being a female issue - as if fathers aren't cut to the bone by the experiences they miss out on, as if fathers universally prefer the burden of being the one who gives up on family life for the sake of necessary dollars.

I fucking WISH I was in that woman's shoes, of being able to just choose to not work for years at a time and have my partner just continue to meet all our financial commitments by herself. I'm not exactly complaining - I'm an engineer and my wife is a teacher who can't teach for medical reading: obviously I'm the one with the primary income potential. And my wife is not bad natured about her tasks, I can just tell she is completely sick of it now. If she could find work now we'd be in less danger of losing our house, but if we could find a way of paying or reducing our bills I'd be personally happy with her never working because the truth is I prefer having her around at home and being able to see her friends and family.

I'm digressing. The author of that article can go fuck herself if she thinks that life is unfair if she can't be a full time parent as well as a full time worker. That's something I cope with on a daily basis, but no one asks how I feel about out as a father.

(actually, as it turns out, I work a pretty flexible 40 hours and only work 5 minutes from home, so I've missed out on a hell of a lot less than most, but the fact remains that I'm at work all day and my wife is at home/Dr/shops/post office/whatever)

Second, and, I think, more importantly, it implies that women are mothers by default. Women need to realize that having children is a choice (provided they have access to contraception and abortion), and a fucking huge one, that will dominate the course of the rest of their lives. 

The issue of work-family balance is an issue for parents of either gender. It is NOT a women's issue.

I wish this article were inclusive of everyone. It should be ""people can't have it all!"" It shouldn't be about women, it should be about families and if not about families then about the individual. The US has a ridiculous demand of its workers and little respect for the family. I'm a nanny and I see the imbalance of parenting styles and choices which occur when one spouse works all the time and the other is home raising the children/doing projects while running the house. 

I've watched kids with families where the mom works and the dad is home and where there are same sex parents - it doesn't matter - if one is working all. the. time or both are working 40+ hour weeks it's the family, and the individuals within the family who suffer. 

I understand the point of the article, which is that women who work (and/or the one with the less 'serious' job) and who have a spouse who also works are often expected to take on the 'main' parenting role. In my experience, this is true, and it causes stress and strain among the parents and an uneven structure with the kid. It isn't really the fault of the parents, it's just how things tend to happen. It's the job of the parents to maintain communication about expectations in their relationship. Yes, the business needs to make exceptions for parents but to place blame entirely on business when the issue is structuring of responsibilities in the home isn't really fair or honest. 

If my husband and I both work white collar jobs which require a lot of our effort and time, and we have children, then it is our job to ensure that we take equal time and attention from our jobs to give to parental responsibilities. 

TL;DR:  We need companies to give longer maternity leave and include paternity leave, and to respect  family units and workers as people. In the home we need to have a better outline of expectations on parenting responsibilities.

This is sexist and gross. Men typically don't write 'whiny articles' about things like that not because they're some virtuous worker who is able to rise above their role but because it has been their expected role for so very long that they often don't feel they have a choice. They're also dissuaded from expressing their personal emotions in front of a large audience and they're treated as an anomaly (seriously, the articles I've read treat them like fucking magical unicorns) if they want to be the one to stay home with their kids.  

Men must put themselves into the role of 'breadwinner', and because they don't get to spend much time with their family, making money for their family is how they contribute. If more men were 'burdened' with childcare in our traditional family structure then they might feel they have more room for complaining about missing their kids' lives or spending time with their SO's. Currently, they aren't expected to even think about those things (or like them that much), only providing for their family. Women experience the exact opposite demeaning role. 

This ties into what men face in child custody decisions and child support payments vs time spent with children - they're not the heart of their family, they're only the money maker, so their cash and not their presence is important.

I actually think that is what the submitter is trying to say here. As many people have pointed out, guys sacrifice a lot to get those high status jobs. The problem that this article illustrates is that a woman in the same position resents the sacrifices and wants advancement without the work. 

I am right there with her. I want the advancements without the work too. Hell, I deserve them. So do you too, probably. The reality is that it is a competition, the one that wins is the one that is willing to do more to reach the goal. 

From the article: 
*I cringe when I hear well educated, successful women refer to their ""choice"" to spend more time with kids rather than stay on a high-powered career track. They should never have to make that choice in the first place.*

Umm, why? You want that success, you have to beat out all the others that want it too. That means sacrifice. Guys have understood that and been doing it all along. It would appear that someone didn't understand the sacrifices that half the population has been making and instead viewed it as privilege. 

However, let's drop the ""bashing"" part of this and deal with a couple of gems in this article: 

From the article: 
*Certainly, it is controversial to suggest that women are disproportionately compelled to want more flexibility and more time at home than men.*

Nope not controversial at all. Often it is an earnings issue depending on the family situation. Maternity leave, etc. This needs to change. 

The change that feminists want is to bring women's pay up to the level of guys that don't take long stretches off from the payroll, but that is unrealistic. What needs to happen is that guys need to reduce their work time and work more flexible jobs, and accept the lower pay that comes with that, in order to not make the sacrifices that this society (Patriarchy even, although in this case, heavily supported by feminists, since it serves their interests) wants of them. (As a beneficial aside, we will have pay equity, even if not the way that feminists want). 

From the article: 
*It will require men to support this effort, since they are the ones who now hold the levers of power.*

Yes, and no. Yes, it will require men to support this effort, since they are the ones that are going to have to draw back on the competing for top status jobs and push society to accept that men want personal time with their families too, and that there should be respect for that instead of looking down on them for not 'pushing to get ahead'. 

No, it has very little to do with 'men holding the power', since the men at the very top aren't really the personality we are talking about. Those personalities aren't capable of stopping being competitive. 

See, the issue is, not everyone gets to be 'leaders'. If you want to realize your capabilities as leader, then you have to make the sacrifices to get there. The reward is pay and status, the sacrifice is time and work-life balance. If women want to compete with guys who won't take time out of their career for maternity leave, then they need to not have children or make their leave as short as possible and push harder to make up for the lost time. It's a competition, and as long as the reward is significant, there will be those, men and women, that go after it with everything they have. 

However, if the 'middle class' guy balances out his life more, we will actually have a much better society, in my opinion. As both genders will have the ability to have reasonable, flexible employment and far better work life balance and their will be more respect for men in the parenting role. (I already believe there is respect for women in the earning role). 

Unfortunately, on the road from here to there, you have to see families accepting to do with less. Since most already need two incomes to survive, it is hard to see how to get there from here. ",Arby01,t2_935e0,3,0,reddit1

ca7bbht,t1_ca76i6i,2013-05-28 06:05:34,MensRights,"Urges mean fuck all. For example, when I see an attractive woman, I have an urge to sleep with her. Does that mean I can force myself on her sexually and eschew consequences by citing my biological urges? Of course not, because civilized society hinges in part on the recognition that individuals cannot freely act on their baser urges at any time without penalty. So the biological drive to motherhood does not suddenly entitle a woman to reproduce and then face no adverse consequences from society. Society needn't modify itself to accommodate a woman because she CHOOSES to reproduce while simultaneously attempting to participate in the workforce. And make no mistake about it...in the era of safe and effective contraception and abortion, it is a choice, and one that rests ultimately with the women.

And your attempt to draw a cross-gender correlation is absurd at best. The concern is not with a woman's sexual activity, but with the real-world consequences of it. If a woman has copious amounts of sex without reproducing, we would not expect it to impair her work, and consequently, it would not enter into any discussion of her career trajectory. When there is a baby, it enters the picture only insofar as it interferes with her capacity to continue working the same quantity of hours. Were she to give the baby up for adoption, and therefore return to normal work shortly after delivery, there would again be no issue. So it isn't about treating the sexuality of men and women differently, but about holding individuals accountable based on their capacity to contribute labor. That it is women who are most apt to change their hours to be more involved parents is not the fault of industry, and is not something which should entitle them to special consideration.

>All the men of course will take all cake.

>Then the feminist hoaxers come along and they decide to compalin that women are soooo oppresed by the fact that they have the priviledge to all those choices men don't have. That's tough, how are they going to hoax people like that when its so obvious women are better off?

>Simple: they only count cake. Nothing else counts. They actually pretend there isn't anything else going on at all --- sort of ignore that and hope no one catches on. They scream loudly ""it so unfair that the men have more cake! the women must be given more cake!"".

>They prove men have more cake --- not by comparing men with the few women (eg single women to pierce the analogy!) who chose to only have cake --- those women got just as much cake as the men did. No, they compare the total amount of cake men get with the women, but they don't count in any of the other stuff the women choce to get instead of cake.

Think of it this way.  Before trade unions there were no laws  providing for a 40 hour work week.  It took men banding together to demand fair pay and time off from greedy employers eho otherwise have no incentive to work employees less tan 20 hours a day 7 days a week, as slave labor.  The workers needed time off, they needed to provide for their families monetarily. According to your statement, it should be ok for industry to demand 80 hours a week for the salary you are getting paid at your job.  Is it a worker's fault for having less capacity to work if he refuses to work 80 hours a week?  Millions of trade union workers that fought for your 40 hour work week didnt think so, and you now legally reap the reward of their effort.

Women likewise are now demanding that industry adjust to their needs as mothers.  Lots of employers recognize this need and provide on campus daycare, nursing time, permit bring the child to work, or flex hours.  An employer who does not recognize this need loses the benefit of her skill.  

It is up to the employer to comply with reasonable expectations of workers and if thy wont do it voluntarily, the workers will strive to change the law to force them to do it.

This last point is most important (but seems a lot of MRAs seem to resist it) because though sometimes MRAs levy real criticisms at *areas of thought* within feminism as a greater discourse, those criticisms rarely hold because the use of ""Feminism"" or ""Feminist"" (which is so often in all caps). The use of the generic Feminism fails to account for the internal criticism in which the (for example) the ideas of Marxists feminism and feminists of color have taken to liberal feminism. Often MRA criticisms are supported by the works of these other *kinds* of feminists. For example, bell hooks has regularly discussed that the need of black men and women are not addressed at all within liberal feminism.

So, it's not a disavowal, but rather that it seems like ""feminist"" and ""feminism"" is being applied with disregard to the content of either term, both here and in other places throughout the MRM.",spermjack_attack,t2_asaqt,-2,0,reddit1

Initially, I was responding to your criticism that this isn't ""men's rights"" but is instead something to ""dog on women"". 

I think you're wrong. I, personally, absolutely hate the ""this isn't men's rights"" bullshit comments, since it's purpose isn't to explore a topic but simply to stifle other's speech. 

Regardless, this is relevant because it is pointing out a serious difference in employment outlook between genders that has direct implications on a number of relevant topics, such as the ideas of the ""glass ceiling"", and ""equal pay"". 

The rest of the comment addresses both the general idea of your comment; 

>TL;DR: We need companies to give longer maternity leave and include paternity leave, and to respect family units and workers as people. In the home we need to have a better outline of expectations on parenting responsibilities.

and the article in general, as well as pointing out specifically, that this article being posted here is not simply woman bashing as there are specific elements that people should be thinking about. I then provided some of my thoughts on the issues. 

> If the family and individual were taken seriously you wouldn't have to have people doing with less because they're into their families. There are plenty of countries (and companies) that value their workers' lives and family roles and still pay them well - they don't necessarily force them to make those decisions.

I believe that you have confused the rank and file with the apex. Yes, there are plenty of companies that value their workers and their families and still pay them well. Absolutely. They aren't the top paying jobs and no company rewards an employee for being 'balanced'. An employee is rewarded for productivity. An employee that works more is more productive. When I talked about the major changes needed that I think would make a better society, it is this level I was talking about.   

However, the author of the article isn't talking about that level. She is talking about the apex jobs. The executive level. You don't get there without sacrifice, and no company is going to advance someone who doesn't compete hard to get there. 

>It's as simple as companies with sabbatical policies for their employees - they require or leave room for these things without punishing the worker.

Sure, but when advancement time comes around, those who have not taken those breaks and worked hard to put the employer ahead will get the advancement. It isn't ""punishing the worker"", it's ""rewarding the worker who put more time in"". 

> weird sexist undertones (two-way street of sexism).

I am assuming you are referring to my couple of comments on feminism. 
Sexism is a two way street. However, I feel that feminist organizations prop up sexism when it is their best interest (divorce, child custody, etc) and decry it when it works against them (unequal opportunity) and use it as an excuse when they don't have equal outcome (I don't get to be president of my company and take time off and work less hours. This is the thrust of the article). 

As a note, when I refer to ""feminists"", I am actually referring to feminist organizations and activism. Feminist organizations have successfully bastardized the definition of the word ""feminist"" to have such a flexible meaning as to be meaningless. Therefore, I define ""feminists"" by the actions of feminist advocacy and activism groups. Otherwise, you get those chiming in with ""you believe in equality, congrats, you are a feminist"" or ""NAFALT"". So, in my opinion, feminism is defined by it's political actions. Individual ""feminists"" and how they identify with feminism are irrelevant.  

Ultimately, and this is more a response to the article than to you, I feel that the solution is for society to change their criteria for evaluating successful men to not look down on those that balance their priorities instead of chasing employment advancement. That means that the mid-level manager and below will be more balanced. It also means that men's incomes will drop since they compete less. That will have a side effect of providing the ""pay equity"" that is sought. This is the area where sabbaticals, etc will make a difference.  

>You also seem to be washing over the roles and standards that both men and women fight against in society

Nope, I was specifically talking about the expectations that guys face in society and how they have to fight against them to change this issue and how that will improve society, in my opinion, as a whole. I didn't really touch on the societal expectations on women and how that affects the issue at all. Although, I certainly understand your confusion as I buried those statements within my topic.

ca7gdoq,t1_ca7g3vq,2013-05-28 14:34:07,MensRights,"> Think of it this way. Before trade unions there were no laws providing for a 40 hour work week. It took men banding together to demand fair pay and time off from greedy employers eho otherwise have no incentive to work employees less tan 20 hours a day 7 days a week, as slave labor. The workers needed time off, they needed to provide for their families monetarily. According to your statement, it should be ok for industry to demand 80 hours a week for the salary you are getting paid at your job. Is it a worker's fault for having less capacity to work if he refuses to work 80 hours a week? Millions of trade union workers that fought for your 40 hour work week didnt think so, and you now legally reap the reward of their effort.

I don't have a 40 hour work week. In my industry, 80 hour weeks are not in the least bit uncommon. And you know what? I understood that going in, and am not especially bothered by it. Would I rather work 40 hours a week? Sure. Would I be willing to halve my salary? Not really. So, given the choice, am I willing to work 80 hours a week? Clearly.

I have no issue whatsoever with industry self-regulation and the freedom of contract. And I have zero regard for the past efforts of unions. That they fought for a particular set of working conditions, virtually all of which are professionally irrelevant to me, are unconvincing of their need. 

That employees have obligations outside of work is their concern, not that of their employers'. Now, presumably if they have sufficient skill, there will be some latitude shown to them, because of competitive pressure within industry. But to insist that the law enshire said protections is fundamentally objectionable.

> Women likewise are now demanding that industry adjust to their needs as mothers. Lots of employers recognize this need and provide on campus daycare, nursing time, permit bring the child to work, or flex hours. An employer who does not recognize this need loses the benefit of her skill.

And I am fine with that. Corporations are by nature self-interested. And if advantaging themselves requires making certain accommodations, including those you listed, I would never take issue with it. Where I object, and it has nothing to do with gender, is where the proposed reform is mandated by government. 

> It is up to the employer to comply with reasonable expectations of workers and if thy wont do it voluntarily, the workers will strive to change the law to force them to do it. That is why maternity leave laws exist, so your claim that women are not entitled to special consideration has no basis in reality as the law already exists.

This is a silly non-point. Your argument is ""in the past, industry has been bullied by a government that was lobbied by a special interest group, and therefore because it has been done, it should be done more."" Sorry, but that isn't how it works. Governments' past actions were illegitimate, and categorically so will their future actions if/when they overstep their bounds by attempting to regulate the labor market.

A major reason for the low annual hours worked in Europe is a relatively high amount of paid annual leave.[30] Fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard.""

And: ""Over the 20th century, work hours declined by almost half, mostly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth, with a supporting role from trade unions, collective bargaining, and progressive legislation. The workweek, in most of the industrialized world, dropped steadily, to about forty hours after World War II. The decline continued at a faster pace in Europe: for example, France adopted a 35-hour workweek in 2000. In 1995, China adopted a 40-hour week, eliminating half-day work on Saturdays. Working hours in industrializing economies like South Korea, though still much higher than the leading industrial countries, are also declining steadily.""

2. All feminists believe in two things that are relevant to any discussion of men's rights. **A.** Patriarchy **B.** Male Privilege. Their belief in these two things predicate a fundamental reliance on **C.** Male Disposability (for instance who is going to finance this irate feminist's demand that womyn be allowed to work 37.5 hours but reap the rewards of a 90 hour workweek? **Answer:** Men.) With these universal feminist beliefs and their universal reliance on Male Disposability as a means to an end, all feminists CAN be lumped together because their disparate beliefs all contain the same central thread, ""that women deserve the fruits of male labor at no cost."" And when you recognize this, feminism is no different from traditionalism (which you childishly call patriarchy), except in how it refuses to provide males any benefit for their labor. Ironically, Traditionalism kept the carrot in front of men and so men stayed on the hamster wheel, ever running and carrying civilization on our backs. Feminism has removed that paltry carrot and in doing so has awakened a generation of men to the reality that **we are being goaded to work ourselves to death so that others may benefit.** You feminists bemoan the fact that you don't receive the same benefits that men who slave every day gain through their devotion to work while you kick back and refuse to work the same backbreaking hours. You refused to feed the golden goose, the workhorse of civilization and in doing so convinced it that it is better served leaving the farm.

Feminism = Traditionalism - Male Privilege. That's the formula, pal. You espouse traditionalist beliefs minus any notion of benefit for men. That's how we recognize you as feminist. Your entire view of the world is one that necessarily relies on the fruits of male labor but rejects recompense. We don't care about disagreement among those who follow your basic behavioral pattern.

Why do we tax people, if this ""collective good"" doesn't exist/does not matter? Why do we have all kinds of regulations for companies, regarding work security and waste disposal? Heck, we even got something as minimum wages in many countries! 

As long as we live in a democracy, the people are (at least in theory..) in power and can set rules, as they see fit. We live in a world with tons of arbitrary rules anyway, but any new arbitrary rules are unreasonable? How so? All of these rules are in place to protect society and it's members. 

Of course companies profit from long working hours and cheap labor. As we can see! The rich are getting even richer and the poor...stay poor or become even poorer. Why would anyone be in favor of that? Labor contracts are arbitrary contracts, since in modern societies you often can't say who produced what kind of worth, especially in service or research. All you get there is some kind of ""going rate"", which is fine per se. But in times of stagnant wages, this results in the said problem, unqual distribution of wealth. People work harder and are more productive, but don't receive equal amounts of money for that increase in productivity.

Why all of this matters? In the end, the people should rule in a democracy. A society that only benefits 10% or even less of society, will get into problems sooner or later. I'm from Germany and our economy is praised all over the news. But the truth is, only companies and their shareholders profit. The bottom lower 50% lost up to 20% in real income over a decade. We have millions of people with full-time jobs, who still receive government benefits, because they can't live off their wages. Our middle class is breaking apart, mostly dropping into poverty. And now you think that doesn't matter at all? Only individuals should decide how much they sacrifice? Well, ask the people at the lower end about sacrifices. Working longer hours, being more productive, still losing 20% income. All of this happened in a certain political climate, which still is in place and will only result in further problems for us Germans and the whole of Europe.

All of this is kinda off-topic for men's rights. But do you think under these circumstances anyone in the bottom 50% would dare to ask for any rights? I've read news articles, where people with 30 year work experience went to work for 5€ (6.50$) per hour here. That is plainly illegal, but still common because people are that desperate to feed their families.

Everyone needs some kind of economic basis for their existance. Especially kids, who can't provide for themselves. I' rather see a society where people can earn enough money through their work to live off that money. Instead of a society, where people work hard and long hours and the shareholders reap the benefits, creating some kind of freakish super-elite in the top 1%, owning some 35% of the wealth of the nation (like in the us). (top 10% 50% of the wealth. Bottom 60% -> 4% of wealth)

As for the idea that internal conflicts between kinds of feminism doesn't allow for a unified ""idea"" of feminism - what you have there is groups of politically minded individuals taking the word ""feminism"" and slapping onto any political viewpoint they have regarding women.

Regardless, your entire argument is semantic. The fact that there may be groups calling themselves feminist whose entire activism revolves around some single, unrelated concept does not change either the connection the writer's assertions have with feminist activism, nor do they change the fact that feminist *activism* defines what feminism is in and to society.

I'm sorry, this seems like a misapplication of statistics (and cargo cult science as well). How are you defining ""success rate""? Because it seems like you are not doing anything scientific or statistical, but rather you've defined ""feminist"" as ""every woman who seeks special treatment,"" and thus tautological. As you've pointed out here, you've made a definition (and adopted mathematical symbols to draw on the authority mathematics as a discipline) as:

>All feminists believe in two things that are relevant to any discussion of men's rights. A. Patriarchy B. Male Privilege.

I am not sure if this is always true, but for the sake of the argument, lets assume that all feminists believe something called *patriarchy* and something called *male privilege.* However:

>Their belief in these two things predicate a fundamental reliance on C. Male Disposability (for instance who is going to finance this irate feminist's demand that womyn be allowed to work 37.5 hours but reap the rewards of a 90 hour workweek? Answer: Men.)

Ah! Here's the problem. *Not all feminists rely on male disposability.* For instance, I don't demand that ""womyn be allowed to work 37.5 hours but reap the rewards of a 90 hour workweek,"" and I don't think this is a universal feminist demand. Rather, it may be a demand within this article (which, as noted before, is being attributed feminism). I mean, all that follow from this in your point #2 just doesn't seem to hold for all feminists or all feminisms. I certainly don't believe that

>""that women deserve the fruits of male labor at no cost,""

and I'm almost 100% positive  neither does Christina Delphy, Judith Butler, J. Halberstam, R.W. Connell or bell hooks (to name a few).

>You refused to feed the golden goose, *the workhorse of civilization* and in doing so convinced it that it is better served leaving the farm.

I think their is two things to say about this:

1. An important feminist critique of history and economics (as disciplines), is how the contributions of women are regularly erased. As if to say the claim ""men built civilization,"" means that women *have done nothing to contribute to society.*

2. What do you mean, ""feed the golden goose""? What is it feminists (or women) have *not been doing, that would normally justify the differential in labor between men and women?

I don't know where you live, but I'm from the US. We're not meant to be a democracy. We are meant to be a constitutional republic.

You are mistaken. It isn't that I or anybody favors stagnating wages. Rather, it is simply that we do not countenance government intercession in the market, ever. The response from people like you is always ""but they do interfere, so let them interfere more to achieve this better end."" And my response is always, ""that they have interfered to date does not justify past or future interferences.

So, if your argument is that my argument depends on the meaning of words, then your argument doesn't allow you to conclude that my argument is invalid or untrue. I have observed that when people use this tactic, what they are really saying is this:

Many people, both men and women, still believe a woman's place is at home with her children. Those gender roles have not disappeared completely for men or women. 

So to imply that women are totally free to go in either line where men are forced by society to simply have cake is dishonest. Because those things are changing and a man CAN make his choice. He will face ridicule from some, but he absolutely does have the choice to go in any line he wants. It is not ""Cake or death?"", if you will. 

And the analogy also has problems when it begins blaming feminists for keeping men in their line. The fact that men are more free to be stay at home dads is in part thanks to the feminist narrative that women are not the only qualified caretakers of the children and home. If you have any evidence that it's a common feminist belief that men shouldn't have the right to ""the whole buffet"" I'd like to see it.

Moving on - yes people have a choice at family planning. Life doesn't always work like that. When my wife went off contraception after our first, the Dr said ""Well. Wait for about 6 months for your cycle to go back to normal, then about 6 months after that you can start trying for your second."" I swear, she was pregnant within a fortnight.

Family planning is an imprecise business.

And, once planned, it doesn't mean you're not going to be made redundant in your job once or, like me, twice (in two years). Maybe your partner takes longer to finish her degree than planned and discovers a medical issue which prevents her from practicing her chosen profession so your plan for how to fund the children goes out the window. If it's too late to change your mind at 6 months pregnant, it's absolutely too late to change your mind at 6 years old.

The point is that people who choose to not abort are basically making a guess at what their life is going to be like in 10 year's time when the crunch of child rearing is at its hardest. Did you know at 20 (realistically) what your life would look like at 30? I'm 34, and I honestly have never considered what I'll be like at 44.

Almost, but I can't give you any points this time because you missed the most important parts.

My arguement was that *you* don't know what these things mean. I gave the example of *hegemonic masculinity:*

>When feminists like myself use these terms (though I don't believe I use ""toxic masculinity"") we are talking about things that can't be just gleaned from etymology. Selecting just ""hegemonic masculinity,"" I will show how feminists are actually working against common sense ideas of gender and masculinity that the author seems to believe feminists are working to maintain. This term was introduced by R.W. Connell, and in her work The Social Organization of Masculinity, she introduces how to conceptualize masculinity as an object of study like this:

>>... 'Masculinity' is not a coherent object about which a generalizing science can be produced. Yet we can have coherent knowledge about the issues raised in these attempts. If we broaden the angle of vision, we can see masculinity, not as an isolated object, but as an aspect of a larger structure.

>This demands an account of the larger structure and how masculinities are located in it. The task of this chapter is to set out a framework based on contemporary analysis of gender relations. This framework will provide a way of distinguishing types of masculinity, and of understanding the dynamics of change.

>You see, the key here is that the concept of ""hegemonic masculinity"" depends first on gender theorists to conceptualize masculinity as masculinities, a plurality of types of masculinity. Second, these masculinities (and subsequently hegemonic masculinity) are located in and constituting social structures.

>Which brings me to my last point, the concept of masculinities (and by extension, hegemonic masculinity) goes beyond the commons sense notion that their is simply masculinity which is collapsed into common sense ideas of being a man and being male. Rather gender theorists like Connell, go far beyond this. Just to give you a taste:

>>I define[d] gender practice as onto-formative, as constituting reality, and it is a crucial point of this idea that social reality is dynamic in time...

>>We are all engaged in constructing a world of gender relations. How it is made, what strategies different groups pursue, and with what effects, are political questions. Men no more than women are chained to the gender patterns they have inherited. Men too can make political choices for a new world of gender relations. Yet those choice are always made in concrete social circumstances, which limit what can be attempted; and the outcomes are not easily controlled.

>**What I mean by presenting this last piece of Connell's work is to show how by going beyond common sense notions of masculinity, not only has Connell made apparent the multiplicity of masculinity, but also that men are constituted and constitute the dynamic gender order. In this way, men are not villains. This is counter to the assertions made by this author, and in this regard, I think I have made a case against their thesis.**

You see, you don't understand that there are multiple *kinds of masculinity* of which we use the term ""masculinit**ies**"" to describe. A part of this ""multiplicity of masculinity"" is that meaning has become fractured and multiplied, and thus when the author (you) make claims that feminists think *all masculinity* is harmful and bad, you are dead wrong.

----

And now you care why *I don't think her argument is very feminist.* I will be using a Marxist feminist critique. This author's problems are highly contextualized by her racial and class privilege. You see, there are women (and men) who don't get a choice to turn down a 60-hour a week job in favor of spending more time with their children. Rather, there are disadvantaged men and women who *must* work a 60-hour a week job (or jobs), with no benefits, and with no security. These people *don't get a choice* to spend time with their children, and as a consequence miss out on life-opportunities that are normally afforded to white, upper-class, bourgeois women like the women in this article. The concern that this woman has are concern *you can only have* when soaked in as much privilege as she is.

This author, Sheryl Sandberg, and Christina Hoff Sommers are the worst types (the later two being liberal and libertarian feminists) because they are only concerned with equality up until the point they have achieved themselves. Then it's up to everyone else to ""pull themselves up by their own bra/boot straps."" It's such a petty and elitist concern, one which I don't share.",spermjack_attack,t2_asaqt,0,0,reddit1

How is that not unfair? Same thing for working time: If no one starts complaining about it, nothing will change. It's really simple as that. I want more options, not less.

For the bottom part:

It's pretty easy to explain why society should care about kids and their education: That kid #3 has horrible parents and a fucked up childhood. Now society doesn't give two fucks about that kid. Kid grows up to be a neglected, angry, horrible teen/adult. No one continue to give fucks about that person, but because (probably male) he is antisocial/fucked up, he won't be a useful member of society. He might have all kinds of deficits, might be inclined to drug abuse, to criminal behaviour. Now this fucked up kid#3 robs you in the streets and shoots you in the face, because he doesn't give a single fuck about a society, that doesn't give a fuck about him. Well. Not your responsibility, but certainly your problem. People might be responsible for things, but don't neccessarily live up to that responsibility, thus creating problems for others. 

You pay for his failed socialisation one way or the other. Pay money to educate that person into a good, useful member of society or pay for the damages he/she might inflict on others and prison afterwards. Or do you have a solution for fixing that problem, without paying money for it? I'd say giving good people more room to be good parents might help to fix at least some of these problems. And it's free for you! 

You are free to think what you want to think. I prefer a society that *does* give a fuck about it's members. We should have moved on from survival of the fittest! I'd rather pay taxes for good schools than for prisons.

Just because you don't care about people around you doesn't mean the (potential) connections between them and you disappear.

ca7g8a6,t1_ca7dumn,2013-05-28 14:25:28,MensRights,"> I'm not exactly in favor of limiting work hours. If you want to work more, your should be free to do that. It's only a problem if you are expected to work 60 hours+ and have no say in that besides...staying unemployed. Right now you only got the option of saying yes or no. I'd like to see a working enviroment where I could say ""Yes, but only 45hours and free weekends!"" and not be treated like a total idiot for that statement.

I absolutely understand why you would want that. The question is, why are you entitled to it? If you are working 45 hours a week, and I am working 75 hours a week, surely I should be paid more (assuming we work in the same position, for the same employer, in the same market). I assume even you would concede that. So, when it comes time to fill a senior opening, why should I not be promoted over you, assuming we are otherwise roughly equally qualified? I have put in considerably more work. Why does that not deserve consideration?

> You talk about your rights? If I had a kid, taking time off after childbirth would be seen as being super weird, since I'm a guy. If I were a women that would be totally fine and normal here. How is that not unfair? Same thing for working time: If no one starts complaining about it, nothing will change. It's really simple as that. I want more options, not less.

None of what you are discussing is a rights issue per se. The only way in which it might arguably be one is if you live in a country that ensures maternity leave without doing the same for paternity leave. Even then, I would argue that government has fabricated a right for the woman at the expense of the rights of her employer, and the fact that this fabricated right has not been extended to you is no great atrocity. Government should never insure maternity or paternity leave for any duration of time. Companies, of their own volition, should assure some limited form of both for their skilled employees, so that they can compete in the market. It seems as though your employer did that, but you are bitter about the seeming stigma of exercising an option they made available to you. To which I say, too damn bad. They already made an effort to accommodate you, and asking for any more is unreasonable.

> Now this fucked up kid#3 robs you in the streets and shoots you in the face, because he doesn't give a single fuck about a society, that doesn't give a fuck about him. Well.

Not my issue because I carry at all times, and would not hesitate to use a firearm in my defense. As to your point more generally, while it has some merit, I would argue that the better one is to encourage more abortion. Most people who become parents have no business doing so, or if they do, not until several years after they've already reproduced.

Hum... maybe that's true, but I thought you said that *all* feminism

>mostly boils down to the idea of treating women's experiences, desires, and feelings as of paramount importance, and that men's rights, freedoms, and lives, and very often also children's welfare should all be modified or even sacrificed for the benefit of women. The advocacy of feminist groups demonstrates that on a regular basis.

It looks to me like you chose to reply to the individual who was easier for you to talk to, not because the reply was more ""worthy of your response"" (a rather egotistical statement) but because my response demonstrated that you either didn't understand the blog post you were criticizing, or you were being deliberately obtuse, and following your usual pattern of attempting to focus the discussion on minute points (a few out of context quotes and a single term) rather than deal with the subject matter. You're queen of the semantic argument, but not much for dealing in honesty or forthrightness.    
   
> Hum... maybe that's true, but I thought you said that all feminism   
    
That's funny, because even in your own comment, *you* quoted me as using the word ""mostly."" Of course, I realize that as a post-structuralist, you might not understand the difference between the term ""mostly"" and the term ""all.""    
    
On a side note - name the branches of feminism which reject feminist theory - especially Patriarchy theory. Then tell me how many legs a dog has if you call a tail a leg. Yes, the two concepts are related. Yes, you've tried this argument before, and yes, I've pointed your error out in this way before. You are starting to sound like a broken record.     
    
> Except now you're saying that this is only the case if the feminism we are talking about is liberal and libertarian feminism    
    
No, I haven't said that. *You* said that, by presuming that advocacy, the goal of which is to garner privilege for women at the expense or to the detriment of men and children, is only found among those groups. The reality is that mainstream, active, having-an-effect-on-the-world feminism does exactly what I've stated. As far as your personal brand of feminism goes, it doesn't matter if you shit rainbows and fart butterflies - if you're not of the segment of feminism that influences government and other organizational policy, you're not representative of the movement. It would be different if you argued this when feminism was a new thing, and there was no feminist establishment. Because there is an entrenched, well-funded and *powerful* feminist establishment, and because it's been around for over a century, the act of defining anything you want to associate with women as ""feminism"" simply because you like the name is meaningless. In doing that, these fringe groups are to feminism what ""posers"" are to every trend that has ever followed an innovation in music, extreme sports, or alternative religion.

even more so, because it shows that you do not get what the argument is; that being that feminists who argue that X-behavior of mainstream feminists, or Y-aspect of mainstream or historic feminist advocacy isn't feminism ""because NAFALT"" are being intellectually dishonest by attempting to use ""Red isn't red because pink has white in it, and some white doesn't have any red in it *at all*"" as an argument, just as you have done here.

I agree with this TBH. My gf gets bad periods and always has to take leave for it. That said, not all women have it so bad they need the day off, and they'll now get an additional 12 days leave compared to their male co-workers, which is quite a lot (most places dont even have that much sick leave or annual leave). 

Also my problem with the thinking ""accept the biological differences"" is that it is not applied consistently. For example - feminists demand equal pay and other outcomes like 50% of executives or the board be women, after they cut their career short to be mothers (or now take period leave). So ignoring the fact men are biologically wired to work more and pursue higher job titles.

  Or demanding 50% of engineers/tech workers be women, completely ignoring the fact men are more likely to enter these jobs from a biological standpoint (men are more likely to be builders, creators, tinkerers). 

Basically it seems feminists only ""accept the biological differences"" when and only when it benefits women.

Exactly. I had maybe one day last year where I experienced deliberating pain at work to the point I had to ask my employer to go to the pharmacy across the street and get some some painkillers. I took the painkillers, sat down in the office for 20 minutes and I was good to work again. 

If the day off a month was paid I'd probably take leave regardless of having my period or not, cause who doesn't want to get paid for not doing work? However, if the day off a month is an unpaid day, I probably wouldn't take it more than needed.

Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; however this would also mean if she did end up having a painful period she would've used her time (depending on how this policy works ).


By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

One thing I do agree with is that this policy unfoundedly assumes that all women have painful periods; that's not true, and it may become stigmatised to take leave on that basis.

With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive.

No they aren't. The day off is explicitly only for women and transgender persons, regardless if they experience period. There are no special day offs for other conditions as far as I'm aware. 

>And 'transgender' probably refers to female to male transgenders 

The policy expressively stated all women and transgender employees. 

>Additionally, like any other policy, the assumption would be that you take it when necessary. I'm guessing that a major concern would be that a woman takes this leave when it is unnecessary or she is not on her period; 

As far as I know, female employees are not required to prove that they're on their period in order to apply for this leave. This is in line with some organisations that provide similar schemes. 

>By the way, since when are we in the habit of taking companies for face value? How much do we really know about this policy? Is it ""you have 3 days leave for a painful cycle!"" or ""you have three days leave -- with a doctor's note every time of course?'.

It's one day per month. I do not think a doctor's note is required as it is not categorised as a variant of sick leave. 

>With all that said, why are we criticizing this policy on the basis of ""unfairness"", instead of advocating for more conditions to be included in this policy? 

Because it's objectively unfair and recognising its unfairness and advocating for more conditions to be included aren't mutually exclusive. There has been some progress for Flipkart where they increase paid paternity leave from 10 to 15 days. That's a good sign but it's trivial when compared to their paid maternity leave scheme, which stands at 6 months with full pay. Mothers also have the option to choose 4 months of flexible work arrangement with full pay (3 months for fathers with no guarantee of full pay) and 1 year (only 3 months for fathers) of unpaid leave. The most blatant discrimination (other than the one in OP's topic) is that adoptive mothers (who do not experience postpartum recovery) get 6 months of paid leave whilst adoptive fathers only get 6 weeks, regardless of extent of caregiving. 

>And why are we assuming that no sick leave existed, at all, until they introduced this policy? If they're going this far, they obviously either have a majority female employee base, or are particularly progressive. I just find this all this outrage ridiculous and out of place, when there's more to be concerned with. 

All employees of Flipkart get 20 days of annual leave, 12 days of sick leave, 2 days of optional holidays and 1 day of special leave. They also get 5 days of marriage leave and unlimited bereavement (compassionate) leave. The introduction of this scheme effectively means female and transgender employees get 13 days of special leave, compared to the 1 day male employees get. 

Flipkart employs around 42145 employees. According to my knowledge, most technicians and delivery personnel are men, so no, I do not believe they have a substantially larger female employee base, not that it should matter anyway.",Solid-Perspective98,t2_8i5ikeia,1,0,reddit2

All humans start with having a monthly hormone cycle function (I believe it’s hypothalamus that does it). in the uterus for those that get the androgen production signal (from SRY gene, commonly on Y chromosome), that cycle function turns off since testosterone production in males follows a daily cycle rather than monthly. 

The hypothesis around why taking estrogen as hrt for transgender women brings back a sort of monthly cyclical pattern is because that hypothalamus function like reactivates. 

cramps, sore breasts, mood swings (what we typically attribute as PMS). Some can like tell when they period week is supposed to be. It’s not for everyone but it has been documented by some.

Actually, No. Equity is best defined as this- 

[https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509](https://medium.com/@eec/this-equity-picture-is-actually-white-supremacy-at-work-59f4ea700509)

And I never saw this as a part of the ""feminist propaganda"".

There are things that I agree with on both sides and there are things on which I disagree with both sides. That does not say that I am tilted/with one side completely. 

In fact, my take on the whole gender issue is this-

If you look at the picture that I have linked above, you will see that one person has advantage and still is being given the same opportunity as the other, when they don't even need it.

I think that is the case on both sides. There are things and laws that women don't need but still they are being given more and also, there are things that men desperately require to achieve equal status in the society but they are STILL being denied those things. But, please understand when I say this, that this does NOT mean that there aren't things that women are disadvantaged at too, just like MEN are Disadvantaged in certain aspects of life!!! Both sides have certain disadvantages where they require some support to maintain equity!!! And while the feminists (the more public ones in my opinion) are only interested in gaining the required support for women, the MRAs (some of them, NOT the majority of them) are interested in gaining the required support for men. Notice that the ratio of people on both sides working ""only"" for the specific gender is different (for feminists, there is a majority like that: and for MRAs, there is minority for that- the rest of the members in both groups are striving for true equity, but sadly the disparity and disagreement between the two groups has not been able to help them achieve the said purpose).

As we know that a lot of ""feminazis"" have always fought for even more and more rights for women even though it may require them to Step on Men's rights to achieve it. They think- ""Hey!! How come Men get to do that!!!! We also want to do that!!!"" - even though the task at hand is something that they don't have a need to do. And that is exactly where we criticize them and distance ourselves from them. But doing the same thing that they are doing just makes us as petty as them!!

I never faced any criticism for my views on this subreddit before and I have always provided with gender-neutral views on anything. This is the first time that my gender neutral view has been soo criticized even though I am not completely disagreeing with you. I have my own opinion which I have formed after having seen both sides' point of view and I think I am happy with my opinion, even if other people may find it to be ""feminist propaganda""- which it isn't. 

I don't think that we should criticize giving them a day off, because periods can be a lot painful for some women. I always thought that a thing like this would always be appreciated in this subreddit because I have seen people in this subreddit being supportive to both genders, not just one, and that is what made me like this subreddit more, But alas, there will always be some people who will always see things from only one side of things and not both sides.

In procreation contexts it means what gametes one produces. female/male is a designation for plants too for example. if we are talking about procreation contexts for humans if can be done but we need to remember that is a very narrow section of human sexuality so isn’t absolute truth. it looks at a human from the perspective of just intercourse for procreation, assuming heterosexual and only having sex for procreation. 

In more society based contexts “female” is a phenotypic sex designation usually, so genitalia shape. That is how the F or M gender marker is assigned. When there is an intersex infant that has a penis that is considered too small for the doctor’s liking, they can perform surgery to turn the infant “female”. Even if it could have XY chromosomes and gonads were supposed to be producing sperm. (yes this is very common for intersex infants who have a penis too small for our society’s definition of male so they mutilate it for the sole reason of fitting into the sex dyad) 

woman is a gender identity and is not synonymous with female.

that average is not indicative of an individual man. grouping by gender isn’t useful in this case when the premise is you want larger and more stronger people to be accounted. There can be women and non-binary and intersex and female and whatever designation of human you want to be put there since it’s not all men or male humans. The premise is to consider humans that are in the larger and stronger end of the spectrum, which isn’t gendered. 

When you gender things it creates a lot of problems. Such as gendering sexual assault. Right now it’s marketed as a woman problem so men have to fight to get it acknowledged for them too. or we could have just not gendered it and it would have eliminated a lot of issues and people would have actually started to understand how sexual assault works. 

not all human female menstruate. women is a gender identity. if you don’t want to be transphobic and want to understand the full complexity around how people work you need to separate female and woman. because really those are different things. woman as human female is a very simplistic definition for those that don’t study human sexuality as a science.

Man and woman is not genetics. Notice how neither are the stereotypes you used are genetics. 

Man and woman are now words to describe gender identities that are on a spectrum. Just like non-binary. Eventually those labels will drop since they keep growing. You have bigender, agender, genderfluid, genderqueer too. Usually when terms keep growing it’s because we are working on a spectrum but people don’t see it this way yet. Sexuality is a spectrum so labels will keep growing until people realize you can’t label every variation and there is no point. So people will just be allowed to date/have sex with whoever they feel like without labeling it. it is difficult to label human experiences into neat boxes. 

Like right now the terms “trans masculine” or “presenting femme” are getting used. Instead of gender identity like man or woman. 

A more higher approach to think of it is forget everything you know about gender. Stop gendering everything like bathrooms, pronouns, clothes, sleeping areas. Stop assuming things about people based off their body parts. You now are left with just humans with various genitals shape, various hormones, expressing themselves as they wish, dressing how they wish, no laws restricting anything by gender or genitals or bodily function. If someone wishes to adjust their gender expression with hormones or surgery then that is easily given to them. 

A world where the concept of gender becomes irrelevant is called gender inclusive which is what we are moving to. It is in essence the point of real feminism. Gender equity. Such that the concept of gender becomes as irrelevant as eye colour. It is possible to design systems such that body parts, hormones, gender expression, gender identity etc. doesn’t impact any part of a person’s life. 

Tip: you won’t see what I mean if you keep thinking in binary gender and that sex = gender. you won’t get it trying to rearrange two blocks. You need to throw out the 2 blocks and think higher.

I actually can imagine it a little better now: I had 2 herniated discs in my early 20s which were misdiagnosed for over half a year.

So I know that kind of pain where fetal position is the only thing you want to be. I mean, I had luck - it got so worse I lost feelings in my legs, called an ambulance and then it was discovered that it wasn't just some muscle-pain but... 2 herniated discs and got treated accordingly.

Sometimes one side is completely right and one is isn’t and sometimes there’s good points on both sides.

I personally think that equity is a bad policy on principle, if you’re constantly adjusting the taps on the quantity of benefits that are given to a group of people in order to make their experiences of hardship equal, you have to either use identity to discriminately apply the benefits or get really invasive about an employees personal business, both of which already have legal restrictions on them for good reason.

Even when talking about equity, there are some women who experience a low to moderate amount of pain and some who experience massive pain. It wasn’t equal to begin with. I’m sure women with pcos might need more than a day some months. It’s going to feel unfair to the woman that has to lay in bed for two days, taking an extra day off, compared to a woman who gets basically an extra vacation day.

Either every disease, condition, and issue is treated with the highest priority, or none of them are. You don’t get to decide what affects someone, to some women their mental health might be way more painful than periods. Why is that not being prioritized? This creates a system that’s chooses what ailments are worthy of sympathy.

I’m not saying pure equality is fair, it’s clearly not. Life isn’t fair to begin with. But it doesn’t create an artificial unfairness like equity does. If the least privilege person is given enough resources to succeed, it shouldn’t matter that the most privileged person is also given the same.

If you have some sexual orientation it has nothing to do with whether you are man or woman.

It's biology not psychology or social studies.

Definition of women is human female and definition of men is human male.

If you want to change definitions to fit your views then you are destroying the language. It's like this is the only true God.

Plus gender at first was to categorize things in genders.

There is a reason why in different languages they don't use translation for gender but go with the English word.

A lot of languages they have three genders masculine, feminine and neutral. For example Germany has Der die das.

English was gendered once too and you have up on that.

Now if you want to go by gender stereotypes. Like okay this woman doesn't fit the stereotype of a woman so it is a man is really weird.

And then once again how would you make sure the person is menstruating.

And even in sexual assault it is good to specify the gender. For example woman is more likely to be SA by a man and vice versa.

And even if it wouldn't be gendered it will be men perpetrator women victim.

Like in all the articles about women being raped in military. Yes tragedy but why it never stated who raped them. In cases of men it states that it is done by other men. In women cases where they are victims nothing. Nothing about the perpetrator. So people will go to default it is men.

That is the point you need the gendered language because there are differences.

The other way to approach this - and this is what society currently wants - is to go full equality. The catch is that this only applies to women.

You won’t understand the full picture. 

Definition of woman being human female and definition of man being human male is your definition in context of I guess refusing to acknowledge that not everyone is cisgender? “Female” can mean “produces ova gametes” which apples to plants too. It can also mean a certain genitalia shape like for humans it’s vulva, “female” for humans is more about genital shape because that is how F or M is given on birth certificates. 

It’s not destroying language. It is adding more definitions to account for more complex concepts. we can call heterosexual normal and everyone else disorder, because we used to think that. We thought sodomy was just bad. Meaning “sex” actually just meant intercourse. But today there are more words to describe complexity around sex. Sex no longer just means intercourse. we have words like anal sex, instead of sodomy. And intercourse/coitus, oral sex etc. To explain things better.

what’s the reason for making women have periods when they don’t want them?

Transgender men can ask to not have periods because they cause gender dysphoria. Anyone else regardless of gender identity can ask to not have periods, they aren’t necessary. Because there are currently methods to stop them by taking birth control non-stop. The placebo week is not mandatory. It was there to give periods so people verify they are not pregnant. If skipped then it can have the period not come ever while taking regularly. 

Taking Depo Provera, a shot every 3 months, and having IUD which is in the uterus for 5 years before changed also has the effect of stopping periods. There is no placebo week with Depo Provera or IUD. 

There is also the Naxplenon implant that is birth control but can stop periods. There is no placebo week either. 

I don’t see what’s the point of forcing people to have periods.

Majority vs minority is actually what leads to these “oppressions” you guys hate talking about here. If we go off that majority is right handed and build the world around that, left handed will be oppressed. They get less “privilege” sort to speak. Like having to buy different scissors, being forced to use a right handed weapon or experience the shell casing go in their face, having to adapt to computers like switching the mouse location, hoping that in a setting with those chairs with a table attached there is one for left handed people, learning to write in a direction that may be less intuitive than for right handed and having writing smudge.

If you stop breathing, you die. If you stop periods with birth control or surgery, nothing changes. 

Yes transgender men can take hormone blockers. Not all need them, some just add more hormones. And they can transition yes. If transgender men can opt out of periods, anyone else can. There is no point of gatekeeping gender identities. If a cisgender woman doesn’t want periods, they don’t need to have it. 

It takes the right amount of hormones to stop a body function, yes. Just like taking insuline for diabetes. Or taking anti-allergy medication to not have a reaction. It involves taking external substance to achieve the goal. Which in this case is stopping periods. It’s not too much or too little, it’s the right amount required to achieve the goal.  

Nothing wrong with skipping placebo week. I already told you, Depo Provera, IUD, Naxplenon as a birth control method does not have a placebo week. So it’s a constant release of same hormones. It keep the body in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 
Having less menstrual cycles leads to a lower risk of reproductive organs cancer. Because the fluctuating hormones cause wearing out. There has been studies done that those that were on birth control more of their life or were pregnant for more parts of their life so had less cycles and less of those hormone fluctuations (since birth control keeps same hormone level and being pregnant stops period) has lower risk of cancer in those reproductive organs. 

Then your mom was using a method that didn’t work for her. She should have went and asked for a different method or had the dosage adjusted. The Mirena IUD has the highest dose so is best for stopping periods. 

Naxplenon works for some and not for others. good to ask a gynaecologist and have them try all the options and dosages.

lol what. In Canada yes people can ask to have a hysterectomy. It is under the transgender health care which at this point is based on informed consent so you get explained what the surgery is and say you consent to it and that is all, you get the letter for approval and wait to get it for free.

It is necessary to assure a healthy uterus. Do you know what a period is to begin with? Beyond the basic ""blood comes out of the vagina"". And you know how it affects the body to say its unnecessary?

Its annoying but necessary for the female body to work properly, if birth control is so good then take it every day for a year and show me how healthy is to over ingest hormones that mess with your body.

>If you stop breathing, you die. If you stop periods with birth control or surgery, nothing changes. 

If you stop breathing you die, if you stop periods women just because women can die. You don't understand how important it actually is.

>Yes transgender men can take hormone blockers. Not all need them, some just add more hormones. And they can transition yes. If transgender men can opt out of periods, anyone else can. There is no point of gatekeeping gender identities. If a cisgender woman doesn’t want periods, they don’t need to have it. 

Any trans man will have to take hormone blockers or he won't be able to gain male attributes as deeper voice and thicker hair. Hormones are what regulate those things. At this point you are denying biology.

>It takes the right amount of hormones to stop a body function, yes. Just like taking insuline for diabetes.

You know that taking insulin when you have diabetes is to add what the body doesn't produce normaly, with birth control you are adding extra hormones not replacing them?

>Which in this case is stopping periods. It’s not too much or too little, it’s the right amount required to achieve the goal. 

Birth control is not to stop periods, is to avoid the creation of a fetus. That is the goal with birth control .

>Nothing wrong with skipping placebo week. I already told you, Depo Provera, IUD, Naxplenon as a birth control method does not have a placebo week.

You cannot skip placebo week without consequences. Those methods you name have a different way of ""placebo"" week because the ingest of the hormone is different. There hasn't been any actual studies that show that is safe to do.

>Then your mom was using a method that didn’t work for her. She should have went and asked for a different method or had the dosage adjusted. The Mirena IUD has the highest dose so is best for stopping periods.

It is under the transgender health care which at this point is based on informed consent so you get explained what the surgery is and say you consent to it and that is all, you get the letter for approval and wait to get it for free. Women should absolutely have the right over their bodies and if they don’t wish to menstruate then they can choose to since there is no harm in opting out of menstruation. Talk to women, not many like having periods and would rather not have this bodily function.

You realize you said transgender health care and [this study](https://www.jogc.com/article/S1701-2163(19)30818-7/fulltext) shows that the number of hysterectomies has been going down in Canada.

hzo3j5q,t1_hzntea1,2022-03-07 05:09:02,MensRights,"Menstruation is not necessary to assure a healthy uterus. Not sure what you even mean by this. People before puberty don’t menstruate, people after menopause don’t menstruate, people who are pregnant don’t menstruate. Nothing terrible happens to the uterus. 
The uterus builds and sheds the endometrial lining in response to hormones. like infants with a uterus can experience a mini periods after the hormone drop from being in the womb and getting mother’s hormones. 

I know very well in-depth every part of the menstrual cycle. Gynaecologists know it is unnecessary if someone doesn’t want it. 

The hormones don’t mess with the body. They do what they are supposed to. Seems by your definition taking pain killers for a headache is also “messing with the body”

Birth control non-stop keeps the body from ovulating and along with this effect the endometrial lining doesn’t end up building up or shedding with a hormone drop. A small amount of the endometrial lining must stay to keep the capillaries closed (it bleeds because it’s like a wound, endometrial layer flakes off due to hormone drop so until a new layer builds on top the exposed capillaries have blood come out). If there is no cycling of hormones due to the constant birth control then the endometrial lining stays thin and intact. that’s all. 

Lot’s of people go on birth control to stop periods. 

lmao did you just claim that stopping periods will have a woman die???
Tell me again why that is, I missed this explanation. 

Trans men need hormone blockers only if they start transitioning pre-puberty. That stops the development of puberty we associate with women. They then need to take testosterone hrt to develop the puberty we associate with men. If the trans man went through the woman-associated puberty they just need to take testosterone to get the masculinizing effects. There isn’t like “cancelling out” for trans men that ovaries still produce estrogen. Trans women on the other hand do need hormone blockers at any stage (pre-puberty or post-puberty). Since testosterone effects can overpower feminizing hrt. [notice how since testosterone overpowers feminizing effects in transgender women taking estrogen, it is unnecessary to block estrogen in trans men. They just need the testosterone added on top]

Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal. 

That’s the original way birth control was invented but today we use it for other things. Originally Viagara was for regulating blood pressure. Today it’s used for something else because we found more use for this invention. 

There are no consequences to skipping placebo well. There have been many studies done to show this is okay. where are you getting your information from? 

No lol. Tell me how an IUD has a “placebo week”. Tell me how Naxplenon has “placebo week”

Then your mom should go to a doctor that will give proper methods for her goal. If she was getting pain then that’s not the right method. 

How is stopping periods unsafe?

What’s the problem with the number of hysterectomy going down? Our birth control is free up to age 25 so maybe people are choosing that method to stop periods. Anyone can access transgender health care. Don’t want breasts? Say they are annoying and lowering your quality of life, and free mastectomy. Say periods are annoying and lower quality of life, and free hysterectomy. 

People can have control over their bodies. We don’t gatekeep abortion just like don’t gatekeep not having a period.

Before puberty the body is getting ready to menstruate. After menopause we stop because the body got rid of the ""eggs"". And during pregnancy the ""period blood"" is what helps the baby grow. There is a reason women have periods naturally. 

>Gynaecologists know it is unnecessary if someone doesn’t want it.

The hormones do mess with the body and pain killers can do that too if you over take them. What you think happens with addicts to pain killers?

By flowing the body with too many hormones without knowing the consequences.

""Medications used in hormone therapy for transgender men include androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone (by injection and other routes) to produce masculinization, suppress estrogen and progesterone levels, and prevent/reverse feminization; GnRH agonists and antagonists to suppress estrogen and progesterone levels; progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate to suppress menses; and 5α-reductase inhibitors to prevent/reverse scalp hair loss.""

>Taking allergy medication or anything really is adding things to your body to get a desired effect. Birth control is no different. If a person wants the effect of not getting pregnant or stopping periods then this is what they need to take to achieve that goal. 

You are comparing occasional medicine to hormones that should be taken everyday and we don't have studies about the effects in the long term.

>Tell me how an IUD has a “placebo week”. Tell me how Naxplenon has “placebo week”

The way the hormones get to the body is different and those also don't stop periods. Many women that use them can tell you that.

You are using a law for transgender people as if is valid for cisgender women. That is not how it works. Also long-term effects of hysterectomies: it can increase the risk of stroke, bone loss, heart attacks and urinary issues. Most hysterectomies are done to women above 35.

I was on depoprovera, the side effects were extreme for me. Depression, extreme anxiety to the point where I couldn't eat, painful acne that I couldn't get rid of no matter what and am still battling after being off of birth control, mood swings, irritability, constant headaches, constant bleeding, weight gain, extreme pain during sex, tearing and bleeding in my vagina, and complete lack sex drive which kind of defeats the point of being on birth control in the first place. I would bleed every two weeks for two weeks straight. I never had an irregularities in my period before. I switched for my physical and mental health.

I tried a different brand of bc pills, less side effects than Depo, but I still didn't feel like myself and it still made my life more difficult than necessary. 

I have been off birth control for a whole year now and I am finally in a good place, I can feel emotions again, I have a sex drive, my periods are regular and manageable, I'm not crying all the time, I'm back to my normal size, I feel good and life is really good for me. I'm not gonna go back on birth control just because some guy on the internet said I should to stop my periods (which bc doesn't even do for me in the first place actually just makes them worse). 

The point is, every person is different. SOME people are able to stop their period with bc and like it that way, but that IS NOT the case for every woman and it may be a good decision for some, but for others it's not what's in their best medical interest. And you cannot just ignore the adverse effects the medication does have in the body, it is a major hormone alteration and it's not as simple as you think it is.

Testosterone can act as a hormone blocker since it is deemed to shut down ovaries though not necessarily since some transgender men still menstruate on testosterone. Dosage and how the body accepts it matters. 
Transgender men can choose to take extra hormone blockers which is Lupron but it is not necessary since most of the time just testosterone is enough to get the masculinization effect. like a transgender woman must remove testicles or take hormone blockers while also taking estrogen hrt to get the desired effects but a transgender man can keep the ovaries and just take testosterone to give the masculinization effects and keep the body from reversing (stuff like body fat and body hair growth would change if a transgender man with ovaries stops taking testosterone)

The recent statistic from a gynaecologist I know for IUD success rate at stopping periods is 2/3. With Depo Provera it’s less than 5% have periods.

It’s not too many hormones. It’s a certain amount that is needed to get the desired effect. It would be the same amount as what your body produces itself during the luteal phase. Anything more would not be useful so doctors can regulate that to be the amount.

Any human can access transgender labeled care. But also in my country I already explained that just going through a gynaecologist can allow someone to get a hysterectomy. They just keep the ovaries in. While the transgender route can remove ovaries too. All those bad side effects you listed for hysterectomy is if ovaries are removed without hrt.

The vast majority of truck drivers are men the food in the stores have to come from somewhere after the stock is gone and the rest is expired they would be screwed they might make it longer than a week if they work together and rationed canned goods and other non perishables but lets be real they are going to eat what ever they want with no organiziation and the second they realize theres no more food coming in they would freak out and start stealing form others and buying anything possible for themselves. And that is just food that were talking about. Gas stations dont have unlimited fuel they got a big tank that gets filled up. Better hope those tabks are full when that month starts or youll be walking. 

These are problems just from logistics that would happen. Start talking about trade workers also being gone for a month. What about upper management for a lot of companies. What about farmers if their crops die we will be screwed for a lot longer than a month if that happens. Our meat comes from animals whos taking care of the animals in that time milk comes from cows whos taking care of all the cows.

A lady was found in a forest burned alive the morning before class so the police had no idea what happened yet they couldn't even identify the body.

at class the girls were literally say ""this is why all me must die"" and other misandrist statements 

I silently looked at ever other boy in the class and it was clear all of them were thinking the same e thing but it was like their was a voce grip I'm the class preventing the males from talking.

I finally open my mouth to say first off we have no clue who killed her and secound even if it was a man that is no justification to say the kind of things you are saying that's highly sexist.

the response was more men are evil and women can't be sexist.

until of course my female teacher came along said literally the exact sane thing I just got done saying for all of the girls to shut up and think.

of course when I said it it didn't matter but when she said it all of a sudden she's enlightened.

it reminds me of how when ""red pill guys"" says tge hook up culture is bad for women their misogynistic.

but when a woman says ""hook up culture is bad for women"" she's ""speaking the truth no one wants to hear"" and ironically it's ""Women need to stop devaluing themselves for the venifit of men""",Low_Cranberry_4024,t2_79lpkhtj,19,0,reddit3

If im not attracted to women now so that wouldnt change if men were gone. You do understand that sex isn't a primary need for us right? There's a reason why women don't need to finish to get pregnant....the human population would be much much much much lower. Probably extinct....Sex toys didn't disappear with men. How many serial rapist are women? Are you afraid of a woman breaking into your house and raping you when you sleep? Whens the last time you were in a elevator with a female and were nervous that she would grope you or worse? Walking home alone at night and seeing a group of women walking towards you, does the thought that they might gang rape you ever cross your mind? 

Now for crimes, especially violent, you can go read up on prison statistics and tell me which gender is more likely to make the crime rate spike up if the other disappeared. Maybe read rape statistics while you're at it. 

To keep the human population going is the only reason we need you and it seems like we don't even want to be doing that anymore since you took our health care away from us. 

You want to be treated like women but bitch when we treat you the way that we have been treated since the dawn of time.

You complain that we don't fight the wars that you started and when we do then we are the reason things are slowed down.

You don't want women to be equal to men because that means you either get treated like shit like a woman. And you couldn't possibly treat women like men because then you think we are shit.

That is is just logical. You would not have enough worker to enforce the law. On top of that, you would have no valuable money nor supplies to pay and motivate them. 

Yes, right now you cannot imagine being with a woman since you are not naturally attracted to them, but there is a difference between sexuality and sexual behaviour. A good example is how suddenly there is an increase of homosexual couple in prisons. No other gender, only one option. Another example is how sexual assault in prisons are just common especially cause it is barely to never punished, like if there was no law enforcement like in my example in my first comment. Except my example covers a whole country/world and not just a secluded place. Sex is not a primary need or desire? Then you would deny every major industry which profits out of the natural desire and all the prison relationships and or rapes (including women prison). What is a natural desire and without discussion is the desire for dominance. Which rape is primarly all-about. And in a country where there is no more laws and enforcement of those, people's brutality to satisfy their aforementioned desires will express itself. If it is so hard to believe that women will assault other women, look up the abuse rates of lesbian couples. This should prove my point. And this is what happens in peaceful countries with stability.

I really won't get much into the ""pointing fingers at the other gender"" arguments. But to just give you some counter-arguments: I am afraid I will be accuse of assault because a woman is with me in the elevator. I am afraid I will accused a pervert because I accidentally looked into the direction of a female colleague. I am afraid people will think I am a pedo because I go out with my niece or because I carry her home.  I am afraid people will accuse me of being a ""toxic man"" just because I give them a stern look for once. All of those fears and more are there because people judge me and my entire gender due a minority which is not even close to the majority of ""us"" doing those said crimes. All of that because ""we"" were forced to carry the sins of those that did shit 200 years ago. 0 of all men I and my wife know did any of these things you are afraid of. And I do not say it by any hyberbolic sense, I mean the coldhard fact that literally zero men we know ever did any assault on women especially. Your sexist stereotypes prove that I should be still afraid of being accused of nothing.

You wanna do any of the many many essential jobs. Then go for it. Every Western country is happy to do so. You are legally allowed to do any job and by all accords, any man would be glad if more workers, regardless of gender, would relief them of the daily back pain of their cracking bones. The truth is, most women do not want to even think to dirty their hands and not do an office job. Which is fine, as long as you don't hide it. Besides, you think that any of your current rights and I mean any, would not have been achieved when fathers, husbands, brothers, cousins etc. did never ever wanted their female acquintances that they care and love to have a good and fair life? Do you think ""we"" liked it that a bunch of fat and rich elites denied that? Keep believing that equal rights have not been achieved by equal amount of help. And keep believing that women are innocent of an crime. Even in a sytsem lf anarchy. You accuse us of ""blind rage"" yet here you are exploding on me in a theorotical scenario and give me a whole sexist paragraph when I was talking calm and rationally.

my point was that even if half the population disappeared production would actually not decrease by much especially in the short term.

to give you a short electricity lesson the further power has to be transmitted the more energy is lost along the way. and the majority of electricity isn't even used by the private sector.

isyjiuv,t1_isy6sdm,2022-10-19 17:12:50,MensRights,"Can you become an electrician within 3 weeks with no training and just the internet? More than 90% of electricians are men. Same with sanitation workers, garbage men, and truck drivers. Even with actual teachers, it takes years to become a capable electrician. Without teachers, it would take much longer. Given that electricity and will go down  within the month, it will take much longer to become an electrician. That means Society would go without electricity for years even if they could learn to become an electrician somehow without accidentally shorting the entire power grid. Another thing is transportation. Without most of the people working on oil/gasoline refinement, and without truckers, after a month, just filling a car much less ships and planes would be basically impossible. Each continent would be completely isolated from each other. Even if the trucking part gets filled, it would also take years for anybody to learn how to work on oil rigs and refine gasoline. That skips the whole part of getting to the oil rigs. Even if they don't accidentally break the oil rig, it would take years to learn what to do and how to do it. Also, food. Around 70% of the farmers are men. so, most of the food you are dependent on is now gone. It takes years to learn to farm. Most mechanized farming equipment will not work anymore too, so the female farmers would be able to farm much lower areas and as such, food production would go down more than 70% again. More than 90% of construction workers are men too, so nobody will be able to fix the facilities that get destroyed. No sanitation workers means no clean water too. That job again, takes years to learn.

Summary: without men, even if women do learn to take up the jobs men have, the world will be without electricity, clean water, food, and gas for years. It would be a miracle if humanity could relearn everything without accidentally breaking stuff(shorting the power grid & breaking oil rigs). Before you argue ""those jobs would be easily filled"", You're right, they would easily be filled but that would be after 5 or more years of constant study and practice but would society still be standing at that point?

Last fall I led a HS engineering class field trip out at one of our builds. About 45% of the students were young women. The school's District Superintendent came along for fun and I made it a point to talk to him and the teachers about how much I appreciate their support for young women in these fields. These young women will be light years ahead of me out of the gate just from being supported and included - and no complaints from me on that! 

I feel extremely fortunate that I found a career that I love, even though I had a roundabout way of getting here. I got very lucky with supportive males along the way.

* including them

People exist within society, it’s disingenuous to ‘take them out’ of it for the sake of a point. Society influences people’s actions and behaviours, a reality your comment doesn’t necessarily give fair consideration to 

A lot of the problems you mentioned aren’t problems because women themselves aren’t making certain decisions, this would be an unfair oversimplification. rather, society itself deters men and women from making certain decisions, whilst encouraging others. It boils down to gender roles

to use some of your examples, women’s fashion has typically been steered towards aesthetics, and away from function. this isn’t the fault of women themselves, but rather a sexist society that places certain expectations / beauty standards on people. If people defer from this norm they risk ridicule or ‘othering’, and as such the majority will conform 

It’s all very easy ‘saying’ what men and women should be doing, but the reality is people will be drawn to norms and stereotypes because those norms and stereotypes are the least risky, more comforting / consistent ways to carry out your lives, as clearly demonstrated by say, the significant lack of men in primary education",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-14,0,reddit4

jf3sj28,t1_jetn1xw,2023-04-05 21:19:25,MensRights,"i say historically because women haven’t always had an equal chance at education

Looking at the UK, it took up to the 1950’s for women to be universally awarded degrees, (early as 1878 if we look at the earliest example) 

and this isn’t touching on the social side if we look at gender stereotypes. Even up until relatively recently higher education was dominated by men, only now are we seeing women outperform men regarding university attendance / achieving degrees (and also in primary education)

these traditional gender norms encouraged women to prioritise things like childcare etc rather than a career. Alternatively, men were socialised into into this breadwinner role, and these gender stereotypes still influence how people choose to live today (evident in how still, women on average take on a majority of domestic / childcare related roles within the family 

so yes, historical education absolutely favoured men. And now, more recently, there’s been a ‘feminisation’ of education, with the pendulum swinging, but people are still influenced by these norms.

So to sort of simplify what i mean, the educational mechanisms now likely favour women in many areas. BUT, socially, women are still dissuaded from pursuing sectors such as STEM and Engineering because they are socialised away from them.

i’m explaining how society influences how people act and behave. It’s not ‘men pushing women out of roles’ as the comment I’m replying to says, rather it’s society dissuading women from pursuing certain paths in order to conform

and how blaming women for conforming to gender norms is inappropriate, because they are not at fault

the problem is not women themselves, it’s society, and as such the solution is not to blame individuals like women, but rather blame the wider structures, society. 

With this more appropriate understanding of what the problem is, it means as a whole we can actually tackle the real problem, the thing that perpetuates these harmful gender stereotypes, the outdated social norms

i think the problem is your own unrealistic expectations. People are products of their environments, they are heavily influenced by societal conditioning. This is what generates these averages and trends that we can see

it might help to do more research into conformity as a general theory? because i fear your being much too simplistic with how you’re viewing human behaviour, we are much more complex than you’re giving credit

Yes. I agree. It was a generalised statement. However, in this current climate, there are many single men & women who must independently work to pay their bills. The percentage of men is likely higher yes, due to women being more likely to be primary caregivers.

The issue is fairness in opportunity. I imagine many women agree they ~could~ get paid more in xyz sector. But the issue seems to be access to promotions and such in their chosen fields.

i don’t really know much but i’ve heard this idea of ‘productivity’ being thrown around. and how this tradition of working 9-5 isn’t best suited for the average person. people aren’t productive for the entire duration and some sort of work day reform definitely warrants discussion. 

although on the general point you’ve made, i would say you might be overestimating slightly how much impact this has? Or at least, being a bit too distracted by this facet of what work based implications ‘being a woman’ can bring. I view the primary influences on the gender wage-gap as being based around gender norms, relating to the type of profession / likelihood of working at all

I.e. women are more likely to work part time or not be a breadwinner due to the traditional gender norms of taking care of / raising the kids. Or in the same way, traditional gender norms incentivise often lower-paying professional sectors such as childcare, with the opposite being the case for men

although this is one of those things that’s changing, e.g. women are currently graduating university at higher rates, social trends demonstrate more women are working than they did in the past, dual-earner households are rising, as well as many choosing to prioritise work over family

but like, all i’m doing is explaining the gender-wage gap, im not comfortable with making some sort of statement to the solution, because right now i can’t quite see a ‘solution’ to the physiological differences men and women experience, all i can do is try and place it in its wider context to suggest maybe there are more significant dilemmas with simpler solutions to tackle first",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,1,0,reddit4

this is just an issue of being uninformed 

If we are raised in a culture that says for example, ‘boys don’t cry’, boys are likely to shy away from expressing their emotions. 

For me, i am not going to blame men for not showing their emotions, because i understand the reason why this behaviour is being exhibited, and how it’s a result of the society they were socialised in. if your whole life the world around you teaches you one thing is normal, the other is undesirable, people will conform to what is comfortable and safe, in turn avoiding ridicule or othering. I made this point before but idk if you didn’t understand it, this example should make more sense though.

I get you want to make it simple, but human behaviour is not simple, your way of understanding it is wholly unscientific and inappropriate. I recommend you look into some material concerning say, conformity. It’s a good psychological topic that would help address some of the inappropriate conclusions you’re drawing 

> No, the problem is you don't consider women people. Society is created by people. Their choices form the social norms you are complaining about. Women absolutely contribute to those norms by making individual choices. They are responsible for the results of those choices and the society that comes from them.

we are products of society, we maintain the norms and traditions passed down from previous generations 

and evidently, attitudes are improving, we are making positive progress. Just look at the steps made in virginity for example. Compared with previous generations, society is much more accepting and tolerant of a woman having sex before marriage. or of more acceptance around people having more active sex lives. This is progress, evidently there are still lingering influences from a more traditional time but these outdated ideas ARE being changed 

Totally reconstructing how we view certain topics within society does not have an individual solution, rather it is a collective and gradual change. The values surrounding sex *are* changing, it’s just slow, and made even slower by these embarrassing sexist analogies that act in opposition to progressive change 

> People having a tendency to conform does not remove their responsibility for their own actions. Especially in a liberal society where they aren't arrested or punished for it.

I agree there is some responsibility but i also can comprehend that that responsibility is not something to be used as a weapon in order to victim shame

we do not attack men for killing themselves because they don’t open up about their mental health. We know that men are discouraged from seeking emotional support due to sexist stereotypes of being ‘stoic leaders’ who ‘show no weakness’. Because of this knowledge, we are collectively and gradually, as a society, pushing for these outdated traditional views around ‘masculinity’ to change, in order to provide better support for men with mental health issues 

i think the main issue is you’re getting hung up on a single area of how gender stereotypes affect people. And this is creating a double standard. 

Ultimately, i think you’re arguing from a position of ignorance regarding conformity, and how that interacts with wider social structures / gender stereotypes. This is why you are blaming individuals for a wider structural problem, and failing to understand that changing these ingrained values takes time, and is not up to the individual, but rather down to slow collective change",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,1,0,reddit4

You're bringing your point up as a MITIGATING circumstance because you don't enjoy the conclusion.  Fine.  Go prove that circumstance is true.  But it's immaterial to the conclusion.

In the same way, say, the reasons why men aren't in the home taking care of children (say, due to expectations to work) are immaterial to family courts when they decide who gets the primary residence, children, child support receipts, and alimony (usually women).

The suffragettes were from **extreme** wealth married to senators, and CEOs of plantation/slave trade and mining companies that exploited men at the bottom. They (suffragettes) wanted to inherit that wealth from their dead husbands and inherit the companies like mining, gold, construction, shipping etc.... When they inherit this wealth the call it 'feminism' but don't share the money back to working class families in mining or share with Africa as it was accumulated from slavery/oppression.  They essentially knew exactly what they were doing.

Women at the bottom have not felt that benefit either as they inherit debt from their dead poor husbands or don't start off at the same level as privileged women. 

**To highlight this as an example:** We see the massive changes in education when girls go to university more and do better in education, but working-class women and racial minority women in no way whatsoever have gone through those same changes of flooding into universities. It is exclusively privileged, privately educated white girls who have gone through this change. Then we look at who feminists are; privileged, privately educated, white women. So their DAUGHTERS are the primary beneficiaries of their MOTHERS'/GRANDMOTHERS' activism while minority girls are not really involved. Minority mother can't correct this either because they don't hold the reigns in women's organizations, white women hold the control of how a programme is set up in school. You don't need to be a genius to see through it. Feminism is for women and girls at the top. **Another example** is women's employment networks. Rich white corporate women (feminists) drain hundreds of millions of men's taxes and set up a women's network which pulls in other rich well-connected white women (their girlfriends), while again minority women are very much uninvolved in any of this.

We could then ask why there's so many white, privileged females in feminism, women's studies, sociology etc..? and so little Asian/Black women or working class women in feminism? It becomes obvious why white females love it so much and minority women seem less likely to go into professional feminism. Most likely because they've less to gain from it. White females in their 20s/30s are in absolute adoration of feminism and are the most hostile to critiques of feminism, moreso than minority women. Because it's run and designed by themselves, benefits themselves, and caters to themselves. Why wouldn't white, privately educated females be most interested in feminist studies more than minority women; they absolutely love all of this.

jsrnl4o,t1_jsr0gr2,2023-07-20 19:10:16,MensRights,"Sorry for the wall of text below, but its kind of a complex topic. Basically /u/Current_Finding_4066 is saying that for most of history, most men weren't allowed to be financially independent either.

Most men were bound to the land that they had to farm for their lord. Who used the food produced to pay taxes to the king,  and to provide a certain number of equipped military troops and afford their own lifestyles.  Serfs were allowed to build a home on the land, and grow a small garden to ensure that they didn't starve but it wasn't allowed to interfere with the production quotas. Their personal grain was normally limited to a single acre, as that was just enough to avoid starvation of a small household while being small enough to only take a single day to plant and single day to harvest per year.

If you wished to leave your land for more than a couple days, you needed permission from the lord, Who would likely give your house to someone who was willing to farm it. Over time a few regulations to the practice were added that prevented the very worst abuses by the worst of the lords, but only because mismanagement that caused serfs to starve, ultimately hit the king's bottom line. there was an improvement after the black death, because there weren't enough men  left alive to farm all the land.

 Serfdom was a way to keep a slave class, while giving them responsibility for managing their own production. (similar to wage slavery in a company town)  Prior to Feudalism, Farm owners might have slaves, or hire day labor. but the farm owners were a sort of middle management class.  They would have had to pay the taxes and the like, but they were directly involved in the day to day running of the farm. it gave many of the laborers a slightly better life in comparison to slavery, or day labor, They would be allowed homes, wives and children, but completely gutted the local level economies by concentrating the wealth at the lord level because the land usage restrictions placed upon the serfs meant that they never had any spare money.  Skip a few meals a week for a year to save up for a new farm animal, and then you hit a rock with your plow and need to pay the blacksmith to fix it.  It was a level of poverty where things like metal sewing needles were a luxury, even though the technology had already existed for thousands of years.

Keep in mind that  between 1 in 7 and 1 in 14 men reproduced historically. Many women died in childbirth, so wealthy men who didn't work risky jobs would regularly have multiple wives throughout their life time. but in the medieval period  97% of men were kept low without education, and literally bound to their land by law and religion. Their lord was their lord, not only because it was his job, but also because God put him there to order his serfs around, and therefore only he could determine what rights you needed.

In classical times, slavery was extremely popular, and between 30-60% of the population of most states were slaves.  But that meant that a significant portion of the population had rights, and the potential to get grievances aired in court. Feudalism was a ""step forward"" for slaves while also eliminating the middle class. And that middle class generally wanted their slaves to at least be provisioned to work effectively. As with most businesses efficiency is key to profit. Slaves had an actual resale value, so  masters generally cared if their slaves were wasting away. Which meant that although their food wasn't generally high quality, it also was generally guaranteed to be sufficient for the work completed by the slave.

on the other hand if your serf couldn't produce anymore, and he didn't have a son old enough to take over,  a lord would simply kick them off the land and replace him with the second or third son of another serf who had managed to get lucky enough to keep his farm in good repair and feed his family better.

Feudalism is where we get the idea of peasantry from. before feudalism, most of the poorest weren't expected to be responsible to figure out where the next meal was coming from, or what needed to be done next.  By ceding that responsibility to the lowest classes without educating them, and designing a system that keeps the lower class competing with itself to tread water, Grift was maximized while keeping social mobility low, preserving the social order for the next generation of Nobles.

I shouldn't have to say this, but given that it is reddit:People should not be possessed by other people. Slavery is wrong, and evil. But the move from slavery to serfdom, is very similar to what we've seen over the last 50 years  in America with Small businesses having difficulty competing with mega-corporations, and how these corporations are hiring fewer Full time employees, and more contractors. Technically a contractor has more personal rights than a Full Time Employee,  (technically they can set their own start times, and choose their own health insurance, etc.) But in reality it works that it simply removes the responsibility of the corporation to ensure that you can live off your wages, and ensure that you have the health coverage you need to live well.

This is also similar to how Pensions were replaced with 401k.  previously, your employer was responsible to ensure that those who worked for them for decades could survive once they could no longer work. Now its the employee's responsibility, but without an increase in pay, and the rich are allowed to use the same tax dodge that makes a 401k based retirement remotely possible.",RemCogito,t2_4jukf,11,0,reddit2

Presumably because she now has to take care of the home AND take care of work - like everyone in the fucking world... and her frustrations are dead on. The current 5 day work week was fought for **IN BLOOD** by labor unions at the turn of the century. 

It was a trail blazing policy at the time but it is outmoded and suitable for a different time and different needs.

We live in a time when production has sky rocketed, but salaries and labor free days have remained relatively unchanged in comparison to the production people bring to companies and employers. Mainly due to technology, education and all sorts of other things. 

So what's my point? My point isn't that this is necessarily a labor rights issue - more specifically it isn't a women's rights issue. The reason I advocate that it could be a labor rights issue is that something like a 4 day work week could help alleviate the kind of exhaustion she's describing. Regarding the labor rights argument - my point is that this problem can be resolved through that lens... not removing women from the work place or lambasting the fight women made to have the right to work.",Hazzman,t2_dc7rj,3,0,reddit2

You're wrong. You have the definitions of capitalism and socialism wrong, which is not a coincidence. Oligarch peddlers have for decades obscured the meaning of these words.

Capitalism: CAPITAL owner takes profits due to being owner of the capital, not working. It's called CAPITAL-ism.

Socialism: the value created belongs to those that created it. In Coop Socialism, or Free Market Socialism, or many other flavors, this means the workers in each company.

When they say ""private property"" what they mean is ""private property of the means of production that give rights to profits without working"".",utopista114,t2_5g34425,1,0,reddit2

That won't cause any problems, none at all; not causing men who are better qualified to resent women getting the job instead, or women being insecure about the fact that they aren't confident they got the job on merit or capability, or sending the message to the broader spectrum of men that if you have a vagina you get special VIP entry into top jobs that *most men don't even have*, or poor company performance because half of the board is just there to fill seats and collect cheques.

Nope. Not a one.

(Before anybody complains, I don't dispute that some women are very good at their jobs, high-ranking or otherwise, and that some women do aspire to be in those positions based on merit. But if you have 10 seats on the board, at most 6 of them can be male, let's say there's 2 really good female candidates. Who are you going to put in the remaining two seats?

What is also unfair is the one sided way proportionality is viewed.   It’s a title ix violation if slightly more men choose to go out for athletics, but no problem when aerobics, yoga, palates, etc are 95% female.   

It was a crisis that more men went into science, but not a problem that more women went into psychology, sociology, education, the arts, etc.  

If we are going to put quotas on male dominated areas, then the reverse should also apply.  By the same logic female dominated fields should have female quotas.    Hospitals should require 40% male nurses, schools 40% male teachers.   What about men vs women being able to stay at home and be supported by their partner?   Shouldn’t we put quotas on that?

Men and women make different choices, we shouldn’t be limiting peoples ability to choose because of their sex which is precisely what quotas do.

> research shows that less than 5% of young women desire relationships with men who are unemployed or work part-time (Dernberger & Pepin, 2020)

So... of course, men could be homemakers or stay at home parents, thereby opening jobs for women (naturally, without the need for forced quotas to cram women into roles that are otherwise full), offering choice for men that women have but men often don't, and it could help rebalance the dating market too.

But apparently women don't care for that sort of thing, they don't like ""deadbeats"" who aren't ""bringing home the money"" (even if they too are making bank in their own jobs). We don't think that way about most women, do we? Especially if they choose to have children. No, we praise them as housewives and dedicated mothers.

This! Their blatant hypocrisy is so fucking annoying as is the constant insult to our intelligence. How much longer are they gonna lie and say it's about equality when every move they make is to ensure female superiority?

Feminists wish to build a society where merit and personal ability don't matter. Where one sex gets given scholarships, financial aid, is hired and is promoted based off their gender alone while the other is repressed. They keep crowing on about their bullshit equality all while creating a society that is incredibly patronizing to women and favours them in every area. They want the power structure of a matriarchy while keeping the protections and benefits they obtain in a patriarchy by constantly portraying themselves as the victims that they no longer are.

>actually discriminated against until there weren't. Now that women vastly outnumber men? Well, it's just because women are better students. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with how we've stacked the system against men.

Lmaoooo exactly this! When it's more men than women it's never because of merit or ability but because of systematic discrimination but when it's more women than men, oh that's just merit based hiring. Give me a fucking break.

It is complicated and recently changed to pressure men into taking more leave. It used to be less for men and upto 3 for women. Now there's a system were both women and men get X amount of time and a party can give a portion of their time to the other party (can't remember if it was half or a third)

(Okay checked, so both get 160, days of full parental leave, and max 63 days can be given to the other partner, then after this period of time one can go to hoitovapaa ""caring leave"" which is different were one can be until the child turns 3 during these roughly two years the parent receives a government benefit, but no salary, this can be divided anyway the parents want, I didn't find the information on how it goes if the parens can't agree on it.)

So in theory yes, but I wouldn't necessarily call it equal since women are the ones who make the decision on reproduction, and men generally outearn their wives.

Women still do take way more parental leave than men for more or less obvious reasons

+ Women get 40 days of pregnancy leave which men do not get

If you wilfully choose to be ignorant about history then don't argue about it and certainly don't call someone a uneducated.

Same thing applies to conscription, nothing is stopping the legislators from creating a conscription law in the time of war.

And BTW a Supreme Court ruling is the next best thing to a constitutional amendment. Congress changes every 4 years, Supreme Court judges are for the lifetime. So it not ""so easy"" to abrogate RvW.

No I didn't. If you read it properly you'll see that I said you shouldn't argue about things you are uneducated about. Nobody is educated on everything, people who try to argue about things they are not educated about often make fools of themselves. That's in no way the same as calling you uneducated. 


I'm not going to respond to the rest of your comment because it's just more gibberish about something you don't fully understand. Maybe stick to arguing about US issues, because you seem to know about the US political system. You know next to nothing about Ireland. 


I'm just going to leave you with this thought, which is coming from a good place:  You are the definition of a pick me girl. I mean, not everyone on this sub is a misogynist, but there are many of them here, and you are aggressively defending them by attacking people like me who say anything other than ""women bad, men good"". Do you think they respect you for that? They respect you as much as they respect any woman, that would be zero. In fact, they are probably laughing at you, they don't have to respect you but you still do their dirty work for them. 


Now, please resist the urge you are probably feeling right now to attack me further, I won't be responding to you anymore,  this conversation is over. I'm just saying I think you should take a step back from this sub and consider why you feel the need to attack others online in defense of misogynists. What's in it for you? That's a rhetorical question, there's really no need to reply, as you won't get a response, just something for you to think about.

Gentlemen, do not place your jobs on the line just to make a point. If you feel the need to take extra precautions around female coworkers, do just that—but do *not* announce it, at least not in such a brazen manner. That's just going to make it easy for feminists to target these strategies and cry sexism. 

No, this needs to be subtle and covert. It needs to come across as something men have to do in secret, because the deck is stacked so heavily against us. It needs to be something hard to nail down, so that awareness of it ebbs into the societal consciousness slowly. We don't want to appear aggressive here, this needs to be viewed as what it is: a defensive posture we're being forced to take. 

Personally, I don't feel the need to do this, and I don't encourage men to do it if they don't legitimately feel threatened. Maybe that's a mistake on my part, but if so, I'm sure I'll learn the hard way. I just think doing this as a form of protest is likely to backfire on us.

dr4hcto,t3_7j7fzt,2017-12-12 05:48:11,MensRights,"You're not supposed to announce your practice of the Billy Graham rule because, let's be real, it is indeed sexist. Just like women fearing all men as a potential rapist. But the reason the rule exists is for practical, safety-based reasons. The word of a woman is far heavier to the ears of people than the word of a man. Especially these days. Weighed against each other, people will sympathize with a woman over a man. A woman claims a man did something wrong to her, then he must have.

I experienced a false accusation and practice the rule to some extent. It is just smart after what I'd been through in a previous workplace. Everyone knew better than to believe her, but the company had to cover itself. She was fired for losing her temper constantly and damaging company property as well as arguing with customers. She was rehired when she claimed I groped her and two other coworkers berated her, causing her constant stress. HR moved my shift and gave hers back. I moved to a different company location instead, she got fired again and bizarrely claimed I was still harassing her at work but HR was fed up, I hadn't been on that particular location's security cameras since I moved employment. She stayed fired and will likely have a hard time working anywhere again. My boss from the other location gave me an apology afterwards, she was distraught that this kind of thing could threaten someone so much and how close I apparently was to being permanently black-balled or worse all for a lie even HR knew about. She was directly told by an HR representative that they knew this was all BS and they just wanted this all to blow over neatly and quickly.

Bottom line; sexual harassment is an easy way to get an entity that values its image to do things for you and against a man, whether you actually hate him or he is just an unfortunate pawn. Even a lame accusation like the one leveled against me is enough to make things happen. I keep to myself less, as it makes me a better target to have no social backing. Just a tip. I like people a little less for my experience, but I appreciate their occasional sense for judgement.

Practice the rule privately. Understand that if you have a false accusation against you, you still probably shouldn't talk about it. People don't care what you have to say, a woman said you did something wrong to her. Just be safe and be quiet, you don't have the privilege of being a victim whether something happened to you or not. Women? Women are victims by default.",GreyTortoise,t2_12kbki,65,0,reddit4

Could already be happening for all we know (and indeed is, in the case of eg feminist opposition to shared parenting, fair domestic violence policies etc.)   I mean it's not like any of these alleged acts of ""sexual misconduct"" have been proven in a court of law, and in some cases at least they seem to amount to ""this guy I find unattractive flirted with me at work.""  

A labor politician in the UK has already committed suicide over an unproven allegation.   The Orwellian term ""sexual misconduct"" is so broad it can mean practically anything.   

I'm starting to think the end result of this (ever escalating) feminist hysteria (whistling at a girl is now a ""hate crime"" in the UK) is going to be the return of sex segregation.   Already some men in the workplace are refusing to be alone with women; Japanese men are demanding their own train cars so they won't be falsely accused of groping; and the whole ""MGTOW"" thing seems to be growing like wildfire.   

I'm also starting to wonder whether female complaints about unwanted male attention are the whole reason ""patriarchy"" was established in the first place -- or at least certain elements of it.   What feminists are demanding -- eg that ""unwanted speech"" be classified as a crime in France -- is really an expansion of traditional gender roles, not a repudiation of them.   It's just that feminists want the entire state to act as a gigantic chaperone (and enforcer, and provider) rather than individual men.   Jordan Peterson has even argued that we are entering a new era of female totalitarianism.   

One of the problems with a potential matriarchy (are we already [living](http://www.realsexism.com/) in one?) is that women have in group bias, whereas men do not.   There appears to be a very large empathy gap that may be instinctual in nature.   This is dangerous stuff, because whereas females have all sorts of privileges under patriarchy (women and children first etc.) there is no reason to suspect that males will be granted a counter-balancing set of privileges under matriarchy.   

Indeed Karen Straughan has argued that under patriarchy it is ""women and children first"" off the lifeboats; under a matriarchy it will be ""women, children and the women's luggage first.""  ",audiotraxx,t2_nwu262y,34,0,reddit4

And yes, I do think this man is being an idiot. He's deliberately provoking women on a very serious issue for them in a way that suggests he's not taking it seriously at all. 

That the response to the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment of women by men is a gross overreaction does not negate the fact that many women have suffered this crap for a long time. Our response needs to be commensurate with that overreaction, not an overreaction itself. To the extent that men do feel unsafe around female employees, they absolutely should take precautions, and if that affects women's career prospects...well, that's their problem. But boisterously shunning women like this just makes men look like fragile snowflakes, more concerned with their ego than their actual safety. 

I'm saying let this be what it is: a reasonably defensive response to a misandrist political climate.

The casting couch isn't a new idea, but the willingness to stay quiet about it used to be embedded in and enforced by the community.  Speak up, get black balled.  This is still an issue (ex.

 I have been around some crazy feminists but my close friends and lovers were mainstream if they were feminist.    

Most of my friends are women and I like individuals more than groups so I am always breaking the Pence rule.  

I like drinking but don't mix it with sex much, especially with a new partner.  For the first time I like us to both be sober or close to it.  

All my lovers come from real life. I have never used any kind of dating service.  I am not particularly attractive to most women.  I have no game.  I can do very basic flirting but only started learning in my 30s.
I offer my phone number, not ask for one.  I seldom approach strangers.  

I have never been in a situation where I was aware of a woman expecting me to pay for her.  That type and I just repel each other.
Same goes for women who require the man to initiate or lead, I don't want to know.  I do my share and wait for a response.  

Yeah, I don't  get laid as much as I could. But I have never regretted anything.  There is not a single woman I have been with  that I would not be pleased to run into again.  

I have read a lot about false accusation including case histories.  But it seems like a different world, I don't really mix with that sort of person and situation. If something goes wrong we deal with it.  

My lifestyle won't suit many men but I don't think I would be at all worried about dating strangers or even having sex with people I hadn't known long so long as alcohol is not a factor. ",JebberJabber,t2_o9m32,0,0,reddit4

It's a toxic and dangerous movement, it conditions people to hate and identity certain individuals as ""the enemy"". This is something called **milieu control**:

[milieu control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_control)

>Milieu control involves the control of communication within a group environment, that also may (or may not) result in a significant degree of isolation from surrounding society. When non-group members, or outsiders, are considered or potentially labeled as less valuable without basis for stated group-supported and group-reinforced prejudice, group members may have a tendency to then consider themselves as intellectually superior, which can limit alternate points of view, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy in which group members automatically begin to devalue others and the intellect of others that are separate from their group, without logical rationale for doing so. Additionally, Milieu control ""includes other techniques to restrict members' contact with the outside world and to be able to make critical, rational, judgments about information.

White men are conditioned to be seen as the ""enemy."" However in your co-workers case, I think she is a psychopath and I absolutely think she did it on purpose.

Just a week before I was to start I wanted to go there and sign the papers and everything, but the guy told me there is some trouble I'll have to call next day.

He calls me next day apologizing profoundly, because apparently a colleague of mine had applied shortly before and she was female (I actually know her) 

He said she definitely has less qualifications than me, but she is a woman and he was overruled by HR and they _had_ to chose her.

That actually happened twice, but in this one instance I _know_ from the manager himself that I was taken away that job because there was another applicant that was female.

In looking over your list of ""infractions,"" this is exactly the kind of complete bullshit that I have observed women in female-dominated environments blowing completely out of proportion. There is a tendency in these environments for gossip to spread and one minor uncomfortable interaction to take the form of ""harassment"" after enough rumor and embellishment have taken hold. Once they think you're the ""sexist"" one, they'll just keep looking for more ""evidence"" until they've cooked up some crazy narrative that has little connection to reality. Which, clearly, was the case here.

Female-dominated environments are going to be a pain in the butt for almost any guy and if you have even the slightest interest in speaking your mind without literally being the company president/owner, you're not going to be perceived well.

eie456w,t3_b04wtm,2019-03-12 23:41:49,MensRights,"Something similar (except not nearly as bad as your case) happened to me. I worked as an aide in college, helping  students with disabilities. I wasn't supposed to participate in class, but this particular instructor insisted on making the class one big family and so involved me in activities as well. I probably should have had a talk with my supervisor at this point.

One class, we were talking about discrimination. For sex-based societal discrimination, the instructor asked me what I thought, and I said ""legal discrimination, for divorces and custody battles"" and she nodded and smiled and started writing it down and I continued ""it's much harder for men to get custody and they're more likely to have to pay alimony"" and the instructor looked outraged and said ""No! That's not true!"" and then explained that maybe it had been the case at some point but it was now the opposite.

This shut me down for a while, but then she asked about discrimination in prison, starting by saying that PoC get charged more for the same crime (which is true) and asking what other population was more likely to be imprisoned. None of the students were answering, so she turned to me again and I said ""Men?"" and the instructor, again, looked extremely disappointed (and possibly even disgusted). She said something like ""yes, but I mean, unfairly"", shrugging it off as men obviously being in prison more because they commit the crimes and women don't.

After that I shut up for good and figured next time she asked me to participate I'd remind her I'm not supposed to.

The next day, I was informed that I wasn't a good fit anymore and I was let go.

I'm a woman, too, so just pointing out these things gets you into trouble, even when you aren't a white cishet man (although if you are, you don't need to say anything, you're apparently guilty already).",Avistew,t2_7u7hb,1,0,reddit1

I have copped so much BS over the last 10 years and it's getting worse. I just don't say any opinions anymore and just do my job. But clients have said all sorts of shit to me over the years. I once lost a major client because the entire office except their boss (in her 50s)  went nuts. It's hard to explain without sounding sexist, but they were out of character for a few days, and I suspect they were all in sync with that time of the month. They'd snap at me, change their mind about decisions they'd made, they even sent an email with me CC'd, saying how bad I was at my job. I wasn't. I moved mountains for them and was always responsive, undercharging to keep them happy etc. Because they had an emotional moment, they cost me a large slab of my income and I nearly went out of business. 

As I'm into my 30s, still struggling with keeping my head above water, I've noticed a trend behind the instability and stress... women. The best clients I have had were men, but they made up only about 5 or 10% of them. I can't verbalize this without sounding like a misogynist but I crave a diverse client base for my sanity. I've lost many clients over the years due to maternity leave; my main contact will go on leave or quit to pursue family life, but they won't hand me over to their replacements because they don't reveal they're not coming back until their leave is up etc. Or they quit (and can afford to because they're married to someone making good money), only to be replaced by another person who also moves on soon after. But it is always my time and energy in getting them up to speed. 

I always thought so highly of women, I thought the best of people and gave them a shot. I'm not suicidal, but I do wonder whether the injustice towards men these days, will spark a movement which turns everything on its head.

Add in the fact that it is seen as perfectly OK to discriminate against white males and it’s an uphill battle. Think about a jury. Even if it’s only 50% women you’ll be hard pressed to find 100% agreement unless you can discover iron proof evidence. 

If your in an “At Will” state and not covered by a collective bargaining agreement (Union shop), you can be let go for any reason, or no reason.  As long as they cover their tracks and you are under 40, you can’t claim discrimination. 

The environment sounds toxic. So while it sucks to be getting the boot, it may turn into a big favor to you.  It’s only a matter of time until this woman starts turning on the others now that the obvious (male) target has been removed.  $20.00 says the manager will be the victim of a list soon enough. 

Is this place the only one in your area that can use your skills?  Maybe look into a niche area of the same field.  If you’ve been there a while your experience will speak for itself. Just try to minimize the conflict part of the separation. Perhaps frame your leaving due to a change in management that made you uncomfortable. Or if you felt something could be improved maybe point to that as the catalyst. 

Don’t volunteer that you were retaliated against. Or that there was a personality conflict in the office.  Hiring managers ears will perk up, and your prospects will be down the toilet. Nobody wants to hire a troublemaker. ",creepyfart4u,t2_t44fr3m,1,0,reddit1

My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter;

Life pro tip: In literally any context, this juvenile response will get you ignored by your manager and any reasonable person will immediately take the side of the other person.

A reasonable response is a defense of yourself-- you didn't say those things, those things were said in a context that affects their meaning, and to a lesser degree she never came to me with this and I would have been more careful if I'd realized how she was taking them. You briefly mentioned you said this, but very quickly moved past it to the rest of your ""defense.""

But as soon as you say ""well she said this and that and I could have been offended and wasn't"" or ""well you've commented on my appearance and I think that could have been sexual harassment to"" you sound exactly like a 6 year old saying ""BUT HE STARTED IT!!!"" 

The above is true without further explanation.

But in case you want additional context/information, here's just one of the many reasons the above will never work:

Context, as you noted yourself, does matter, and your manager currently does not know the context of the comments or the specific wording. She wasn't there when these things happened, and she is in the position of you said- vs your coworker said. She has to decide who to believe and how to respond. From her point of view, 3 things are possible: 1, you are guilty of sexist or insensitive statements and your young co-worker is not, because the context and phrasing of your statements were sexist, and the context and phrasing of hers were not. 2, you are both guilty. 3, she is guilty and you are not.

Given that you never complained about your co-worker and were never offended, there's no reason for her to assume 2 or 3. Why would she think your co-worker is guilty of sexual assault/insensitive comments if you only brought it up as a defense when you were accused of the same? Why wouldn't she just assume that you are a dick and don't realize when you're creating a problem, or that you willfully misunderstand context?

Additional note: you accused your direct supervisor of sexual harassment, but again, you never spoke with her before. How do you expect that to go down? We can basically consider 2 possibilities: one, she breaks down, realizes the error of her ways, and radically changes the way she speaks to you and looks at you. Two, she has had plenty of training and from her perspective does not feel she's ever said anything inappropriate, and she will then assume that you're either ignorant of context and phrasing (and therefore in dire need of sensitivity training) or that you're just making up shit to get out of trouble, in which case she will immediately assume that the same is true of all your other complaints. 

You said ""commenting on your appearance is sexual harassment"" which is nonsense. If that's what you think sexual harassment is, you need sensitivity training. It's unfortunate but true that many men really don't understand the difference between ""that's a really nice pair of earrings, I like them!"" or ""is that a new haircut? It look sgood!"""" which is fine and not sexual harassment, and the many creepy things you could say that would be sexual harassment, like ""You look really hot in that shirt,"" ""wow you look really attractive today,"" or ""you're the most beautiful person in the office."" 

So your approach here, regardless of any of your views on the terrible societal harm that men face and your desire to correct those wrongs, is juvenile and would never be attempted by a competent person in a professional workspace.

I'll go ahead and read the rest of your comment now, but I feel like it's important that you know this going forward with your life.

Edit: By the way, I dont' really care when you expand on the context. I get that you have a defense of everything you said, and honestly believe you never said anything wrong. That's irrelevant to what I said above, which is about how your response is likely to impact her perception. 

And edit 2: The fact that you came to a misogynistic echo-chamber to complain pretty much confirms that you were in the wrong here. Don't get me wrong, I see a very small place for a Men's Rights movement that is also respectful of feminism and its goals and works within the various movements towards greater social equality and fairness. But to me the fact that you were aware of this subreddit and your response was to come here and vent tells me you are very likely not the fair and balanced non-sexist person you claim to be. There are other subreddits for workplace-related complaints, venting, etc. But you have already assumed that any site that isn't dedicated to correcting injustic towards men will be unsympathetic to your views. You have a sort of vibe of ""the world is out to get me with their feminist liberal nonsense and the only way I can get a fair hearing is to come to the home of the good ol' boys and complain to them, because they too see the injustice of the world.""""",realvmouse,t2_104k08,-5,0,reddit1

Despite that it's hard to believe there isnt more to this story. I find that when people use the ""black friend"" argument they tend to also minimize their own behavior. That being said, you genuinely appear to be a therapist who knows what they're talking about. My question to you is what models do you use? CBT? Anything else you draw from a lot? 

My expectation (which could very well be wrong) is that you aren't a big fan of postmodern constructivist approaches like Narrative. If it is not, I wouldn't be surprised by your flippant use of such an argument. If you are, I'd point out the power of your decision in such a situation - having female friends who validate your list as not being problematic takes the onus off of you to actually understand if anything you said could genuinely be offensive and places it on your accuser who, judging by the context you've provided, could be expected to respond the way she has. I dont know your situation. What I do know is things do not seem to be adding up here.

I mean this genuinely - if you have an understanding of why much of your behavior could be interpreted as problematic and also believe that the problematic actions have not warranted this level of action, then I am sorry for patronizing you and I wish you all the luck I can. When people take what we say and manipulate it in a cruel, uncaring way that is truly despicable. If you cannot genuinely say that you understand why and how what you said **could** be interpreted as problematic, then i suggest you really question how it could be taken that way (especially if you fight back when its pointed out).

I really believe this young lady made up her mind about me the moment she met me, and everything I said and did went through a filter she had. And my manager as well had very strong opinions about men so when this list was presented to her, I don't think she handled it fairly.

I want to make a few things clear, though. I am not suggesting someone *shouldn't* be offended by the things I've said. So when I say other female friends didn't find these things offensive, I don't mean to imply ""see! They're not offensive!"" different people are going to find different things offensive. That's not my point or my concern. This is my point and my concern: I think there is a difference between someone finding something offensive and problematic behaviour. What I mean by that is what people are offended by is very subjective. I think there are things most of us would agree are offensive (eg racial slurs, etc) and so most of us would probably agree someone saying those things is problematic. But then there are things that most people would agree aren't offensive to most people, but some people will still find them offensive. And these are things you don't necessarily know will offend someone until after you've already said it. Furthermore, if this is just a difference of opinion, at what point are you not allowed to express your opinion on the off chance it might offend someone? Another concern I have is that *intention* is completely disregarded when you offend someone. NONE of my comments were intended to be offensive, malicious, mean-spirited, or anything like that. Most people would agree they weren't, some will agree they were. But my intentions don't matter; all that matter is how they are perceived. And this is frightening. I brought an extreme example up at our team anti-oppression training. I said what happens if we're talking in a team meeting and I make a comment about how I want to lose weight. Could that not be interpreted as me suggesting there is a correct body weight and therefore I am now body shaming? Intention needs to hold weight. Because anyone can be offended by anything and we can't just go running around trying to destroy anyone who offends us.

My other concern is how it was handled. Think about it from my perspective; me and this young woman disagreed on things from time to time, as humans do. But she took some of these disagreements and added them to a list, either taking me out of context or completely misquoting me. And before I even had a chance to tell my side, my manager had made up her mind to send me to this training. THAT concerns me as well. There wasn't even a conversation. ",Jzurb,t2_vip53,2,0,reddit1

In short there, the family was being subjected to a MASSIVE and COSTLY investigation by CPS and the OCFS because the OTHER household had the mother OD on heroin and speedballs or something almost died, AND the KIDS were THERE!!

My suggestion was to the family (that wasn't OD'ing on speedballs innfront of the kids) was to decide whether or NOT they wanted to cooperate with the CPS and OCFS. Something that is in their right to do. Then someone piped up about WHY they (OCFS-CPS) would want to RUN such a HUGE investigation on both families when one family was clearly NOT fit. 

My comment was an offend (but sometimes accurate) postulation that the ""could"" want to inflate the budget.

BAM. Lifetime BAN.

>it's a thing in Canada. 

If by ""It"" you're referring to non-continuation of contract employment, then *no fucking shit it's a thing in Canada*. It's a thing literally everywhere. That's the entire fucking *purpose* of contract employment, there's no commitment from any party aside from the terms of the contract. 

And additionally, non-continuation of contract employment *is not discrimination*. It's not discrimination when it happens to men or women, black or white, gay or straight. It just exists. And implying otherwise is fucking pants on head retarded ""my man"".

>It definitely applies to the conversation and the whole idea of people hating on white men.

No, ""it"" doesn't. Because the ""it"" you're referring to is a completely different area of employment law that is, by definition, not discriminatory. You would not call non-continuation of a contract held by a gay person to be sexual orientation discrimination. It's just non-continuation of a contract.

It's absolutely cheering someone to get paid less so you feel better. I actually laugh a bit because this EXACT thing happened where I'm working. Someone found out another guy got paid more than he did, then got a raise, then everyone bickered, and then the two guys both got pay cuts.

The article and his complaint is intentionally trying to stir shit when he admits he grabbed the job with no negotiation because he was worried about his job prospects. The additional fact that he isn't arguing he's more qualified leads me to think there's stuff left out.

I disagree. Women don't like it when men use their power to get sexuality in the workplace. They don't mind it when men they are attracted to use their sexuality to get power in the workplace.  The thing is that Most men aren't able to make most women swoon.  

I've been flirty in the workplace many times to get benefits. Whether that was when I was 19 and selling laptops to college girls, or when I was nominated for an internal company award by a Female VP that I would talk to on my smoke breaks. Or the time I was put forward for promotion when my boss was leaving, a few weeks after we went on a ""ski-trip"" that she had organized, that I had thought she was bringing her boyfriend to, but was actually just the two of us in a room with a jacuzzi and a single king size bed.   


And more generally, When I was a teenager, I was flirty with all the teenage cashiers in the local fast food joints, and they would give me their employee discount. (I was a growing teenager, who moved heavy boxes 4 hours a day 4 days per week, I was hungry.)  

Women are just as vulnerable to these tactics as men, The only difference is that average men will get that way about average women. Average women only do it for men that drive them wild.  

Most of the time its a lot less overt than that. I'm charming, and I'm a born flirt, So when a female manager  flirts with me, I play ball, while treading the line of exactly what I say.  Its helped in situations where I've gone into a meeting with a bunch of higherups, And a few of the female ones, aren't listening to a word I say, but are watching me with rapt attention.

  Suddenly my idea has a whole bunch of traction, even though no-body understood a word I said.  (I work in IT.) When I worked at an MSP, when escalations were slow, they would send me to client meetings to meet the female controllers (basically the lead accountant).

There is a trick to avoid cleavage staring or glancing. 

I swear it works. 

When a woman with nice cleavage is looking at you , ONLY focus on one of her eyes. Only one eye. It must be done as the first thing you do when a woman speaks to you and gets your attention. 

Here is why it works.  The female face is like the letter (V), the face is like focal points in an art painting, drawing the eye around the painting. 

A womans face naturally draws the viewer down to the cleavage and all women are acutely aware of the power of their cleavage. 

Try it , I cannot resist looking down at cleavage, it is like a directional sign pointing down. 

But if at the onset I only look at one eye, pick one , does not matter and keep the focus. 

Pull up beautiful woman with cleavage on Google a see for yourself.

I think men and women have different strengths and weaknesses, so it makes sense in a way for a woman to use her sexuality (if she’s attractive) and for men to use their stereotypical masculine traits (if they have them) to make waves.

I think the key here is for everyone to realize that workplace dealings, especially the field you mention, are artificial for the most part. Had a boss who was a hard ass, a man, he was what I think society deems an “alpha male.” Made a few men cry, but they respected him and got the job done. Outside of work though, like during happy hours, sweetest man ever. I have had slightly flirty exchanges at work where both parties left with a bit more of a spring in their step, and the key there was recognizing that it was just fun banter…No expectations because it’s work. However, when it came time for reviews and deciding who got raises, my positive exchanges were enough to get my name mentioned in the discussion. 

With that said though, I keep hearing about a sizable group of men who don’t get much attention, so I can see how this sort of workplace politicking could be harmful for them. …I’m not sure there’s a solution to it though because humans will human.

When a woman flirts in that scenario, she’s not actually interested in pursuing the man and won’t harm him or his company if he doesn’t welcome it. Most men, also, welcome it. That’s why it works so well.

When a man (who is the client) flirts, he is actually pursuing the woman herself, not any benefits for himself or the company. There is a real drive there, and it instantly makes a woman uncomfortable because she doesn’t know how he would react if she didn’t return the interest or rejected him. Would he make her lose her job? Would rejecting him lose him as a customer? Hell, he could even stalk her. In worst cases, get violent.

That’s the difference right there. If a man rejects the woman’s advances, 9.9 times out of 10 nothing happens. He just didn’t take the bait. If a woman does.. you don’t know what can happen. That’s what make it feel so high-stake and uncomfortable.",Izzetinefis,t2_96ok23nq,1,0,reddit4

It's the way society has a bias where a guy is kind of assumed to be a threat even if he is doing something harmless that a woman can do with no worries. Even I think a guy flirting at work is creepy even though I have no other information beyond knowing he flirted. I also at the same time think a girl flirting at work is at worst a little weird while again not having any extra info to base my judgement on. We shouldn't have these kinds of double standards.",Background_Duck2932,t2_vacx38bi,14,0,reddit4

And far too much of it falls into the ""watch my show because you *should* enjoy it just because I'm so persecuted and I'm under-represented in media and life is so much harder for me than for most people, but also fuck you for daring to think you can sympathize with me because you're the problem and you can't possibly understand my suffering, but still watch my show and call it brave and inspiring and genius"" milieu, which is, quite disappointingly, a thing.

Sex Education on Netflix is insulting. The female characters are toxic, constantly putting down the straight, male characters, which is somehow supposed to be endearing. Even when they blatantly show their toxicity, they blame *their own behavior* on the mythical ""Patriarchy.""

Gillian Anderson's character is disgusting. She invades her son's privacy incessantly yet guards all information about herself like her life depends on it, and instead of calling her on this hypocrisy, it blames male characters and makes them look bad to divert focus and just forgets all the horrible stuff she does. How about when she actually starts a serious romantic relationship and goes out of her way to hide it and lie about it to her son, who lives in the same house and sees her every day? No, no, nevermind that, back to what the men are doing wrong. She even tries to publish a book about her son's deepest secrets, then says she was writing it to get closer to him. Then why did she try to have it published!?!? What did *that* have to do with getting closer to him? Really, it was just so she could prove what power she had over his private information, but the show completely forgets about that and lets her off the hook. When her gathering of the students'  secrets through her *confidential counseling sessions* with them leads to all the kids' private stuff becoming public, it also gets blamed on a man. No, no, pay no attention to the fact that she collected it at all in the first place so she could write a book about it. Quick, look what that bad man is doing!

And the Maeve character is ridiculous. The show continually tells you how super, incredibly smart she is. Why she's practically the greatest genius of all time! Well, it's a good thing they constantly tell you that because you would have no idea from anything she ever says or does. Her choices are endlessly stupid, but, no, really, she's just so underappreciated. And, also, she's totally oppressed by the ""Patriarchy."" That's why none of her behavior makes sense.

I don't even want to get into the ""struggle"" of the nonbinary characters. Gay men in real life have been violently attacked and even murdered for being gay. But the nonbinary people in this show are oh-so tragically persecuted because they're politely asked to adhere to the dress code of the school they chose to attend and because they're shown a sex education video that doesn't include them, though exactly what that means is unclear since they still have the same reproductive organs as the other students.

And that show is just one example. I can't stand Disney's Marvel shows. The superhero shows on the CW got real old real fast. They've become about representation and whining and not quality entertainment. I want good TV, regardless of the color or gender or sexuality of the characters. The new Queer as Folk is overly pluralist garbage with selfish, irresponsible characters who want recognition just because they're not heteronormative. But what do they do that's actually worth recognizing? And, really, as if real people's groups of friends are so incredibly diverse, making sure to include as many types of people as possible.

igfi9u9,t3_w0jwdi,2022-07-16 19:28:00,MensRights,"> Nevermind that Top Gun - an arguably patriotic, male, testosterone, action movie has done billions of dollars in GLOBAL revenue for these same companies.

Top Gun: Maverick is telling a story that is not available to audiences right now, and therefore the movie is able to capitalize – with record-setting numbers – on that huge, unmet need in the marketplace. Considering how ""Maverick"" stands out among its contemporaries, isn't it strange how all these supposedly ""diverse"" shows are exactly the same? If you stop and consider the last few years, it's clear that this ""diversity"" push only gives us predictable and repetitive content (note: I feel it would be wrong to refer to such boring and lazy products as ""art""). Well, the reason for this is that Tinseltown is applying ""diversity"" at the wrong level, by trying to fit the concept into individual stories. Simply put, companies could employ the same racial mix of acting talent if they filmed Black Panther (all-black) and Peter Jackson's LOTR (all-white) as separate films, but instead they are idiots and choose to make two movies that have identical racially-mixed casts to try and achieve the same end result. There's actually a term – level confusion – for this common type of mistake in mathematics and statistics, because of how easy it is to do when dealing with groups of objects. Our brains and language naturally don't deal with multiple levels of things, so we get confused and believe things that are impossible. And speaking of impossibilities: ""diverse show"" is actually an impossible construct for the type of diversity they want to achieve (mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an average, or variation from a median/mean, when the sample size is ""1""). I mean, if you could have a ""diverse show"" – a contradiction in terms, but let's say for argument that such an impossible object could actually exist in reality – then all you would need to do is clone and repeat that show, and you would successfully create a ""diverse"" industry. It's madness. If your presuppositions lead to the conclusion that all shows must be identical to each other in order to achieve ""diversity"", then you're doing something terribly wrong.

Unfortunately, I doubt this problem will be fixed anytime soon. People in Hollyweird lack the intelligence and long-term thinking required to apply diversity properly at the **industry** level, like they should be doing. And even if they could see their mistake, the problem is that they aren't strategically applying these quotas – and monitoring/measuring to find out when they are no longer needed – to combat actual attitudes of prejudice and injustice across the vast realm of arts and culture. No, they are doing it out of blind cowardice and a selfish, personal fear of being labeled an ""istaphobe"" of some kind. Just look at the recent way the GoT and Friends creators are bending over backwards to apologize for the ethnic ""homogeneity"" in those shows.

The dilemma is that apologizing and showing weakness like that only leads to more attacks and shakedowns of their business. Mature, strong leadership at the industry level would result in a much different response to any such attempts to slander these existing properties (and by proxy to try and stain the entertainment business as a whole). Imagine this statement instead from some overarching body or group: ""The entertainment industry remains committed to telling a diverse range of individual stories, whether primarily white or black, male or female, straight or gay, and more, including mixed casts of those groups as well, whenever the particular narrative being represented means it is appropriate to do so. Telling good, genuine stories means confining the setting to a specific time, location, and group of people, and we know this will – in time – give us a wonderful, diverse range of individual shows that will be very different from each other. As an industry, we are dedicated to telling a story for *everyone*, whether that is based on identity, socioeconomic, politicial, religious, or other group traits. We support the individual stories told by *Friends* and *Game of Thrones*, in the same way we celebrate all the distinct and personal creations in our industry.""

If these ""adult pretenders"" fail to stand up to the bullying, and don't fix their ""diversity incentives"" to stop discriminating against white males like yourself (though I hear that black males do get largely similar treatment...unfortunately, having a black female allows a company to check *two* ""protected class"" boxes on the budget refund calculator), then the industry will eventually die and be replaced (see the recent rise of Japanese anime/manga, South Korean TV dramas, independent content creations from YouTube, etc, Bollywood films, and more, as the beginning of this long-term trend).",RoryTate,t2_ghli7,5,0,reddit1

If you’d like to go further down the rabbit hole, look into *who* invests into companies like Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet (YouTube/Google), and other publishing companies. 

One principal culprit would be BlackRock (which, ironically, I bet you haven’t heard leftists criticise), the single largest and most valuable entity in history, who owns Vanguard among other things. They use something called an ESG score to decide which companies to invest into - this score ranks companies based on their environmental consciousness, social issue awareness (read: diversity quotas) and governance. In other words, companies are literally being paid to discriminate against white men.

It says ""you *have* to support me because you owe me, but, no, you're not supporting me *enough* and also it has to be in exactly the way I tell you to, and you have to flog yourself while doing it, and I'm not going to support you back because you suck, and don't you dare notice the people I hurt when I feel like it because I'm allowed to do that, and, by the way, you're welcome for my allowing you to do my bidding.""

It's the kind of thing that actually drives supporters away, and I can't stand how pleased it is with itself while being a terribly-written show. But my roommate watches a lot of stuff without noticing how awful it is. Some of it has been stuff we watch together, though.

Woke-ness ruined American Gods. And another adaptation of beloved Neil Gaiman material is clearly continuing the trend. I'm a huge fan of The Sandman comic, but I saw the trailer for the new Netflix series and said, nope, I'm out, before it even starts I'm out.

And it's not just American shows. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, from Australia, has a feminist bent, but the main character is mature and fairly well-balanced about it, and the rest of the show is fun enough without making woke tendencies too much of a thing. But the spin-off, Ms. Fisher's Modern Mysteries, set decades later with the niece of the previous show's mc, goes completely into ""men are dumb brutes and women need to do everything for them and are the only ones who know anything yet men have all the power while women are deprived and oppressed because Patriarchy"" territory.

And, again, I could go on. Once again, the current Doctor Who. More woke-ness, less quality. I just watch the old stuff, along with videos about history and science on YouTube. I'm done with current popular entertainment.",RedcloudGeorge,t2_39dnkh90,3,0,reddit1

I'm not married, so maybe I just can't understand, but it never makes sense to me how you can spend your life with the person you love the most, and then do shit like expecting him to read your mind, or hide your failures from her because you're afraid of being berated.

Usually you put her into the fight/flight/freeze response. Very interesting what happens next, you get a whole range of different reactions.

Doing the above will show very quickly what sort of relationship you're in, in this situation if she can't win, she'll try to hit you if she's trying to win, or she'll start to scream and yell uncontrollably. - Abusive relationship.

i can only say( with respect) the lack of awareness of what they do is not entirely true

I believe many know what they do is wrong, but they justify it for many reasons( usually enabled by various groups in society).

The article shows a person committing emotional abuse and then calling it emotional labour, along with controlling behaviour.

It doesn't matter if you acknowledge it because you are not going to doing anything about it, or if you do, you would only change your behaviour for a very short period before  slipping back into bad behaviour.

&#x200B;

I'm more concerned about the slippery slope this has led to, especially that 2nd link you provided.

That kind of abuse( and yes it is abuse) leads to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse when they realise that they can't get the kind of fear response they want from you and then psychological abuse. I consider psychological abuse to be far worst because its the one that is hardest to pinpoint and the longest lasting( sometimes leading to indirect death through mental health, depression and suicide).

maybe the worst part of all of this is the double standards that are applied to people based on their gender by letting women off the hook for their behaviour, but somehow men are monsters if they do this( I don't believe it is acceptable for anyone regardless of gender).

This has a very detrimental effect on society, and we only have to look at the legal system to see how my damage it does to men,women and their children.

fathers very often have little choice but to accept all the abuse in its various forms or to risk never seeing their children again( even when they become adults you will lose them)

There are women complaining that their spouses are lazy, and thinking that applies to all men. There are men complaining that their spouses are abusive, and thinking that applies to all women. Can we just acknowledge that a certain percentage of people in general suck, and that this isn't a male or female thing?

The emotional labor argument can be a real thing. Sometimes there are couples where the man expects the woman to do all of the cooking, cleaning, planning, etc. when they're both working full time jobs. Those are reasonable expectations for a stay at home mom, but not for someone who works the same number of hours. Those women are rightfully upset at the men who refuse to do their share.

And sometimes it's the opposite, a man doing his part but a woman who doesn't do her share or endlessly nags her spouse because nothing is ever good enough... and occasionally those women claim to be the ones being wronged because they're doing ""emotional labor"" of being a never satisfied control freak. But that doesn't mean the first scenario never happens.

Anyway, I'm sure the reverse of this will show up on TwoX any day now, how ""nagging"" is the term man use when they want to be lazy but still insult the person doing all of the work, or something like that...",chocoboat,t2_4ure3,9,0,reddit2

h41kvai,t3_odi2ma,2021-07-04 17:35:37,MensRights,"I think there’s a disconnect here between what women are saying regarding emotional labor, and how it’s being interpreted here. Emotional labor in general is a pretty broad term, but it encompasses a variety of different soft skills which are easy to overlook.

While it can seem as though nothing is enough, that’s not really true. Think of it this way, a relationship is a house, and each person involved helps to build the house, working together on the foundation, individual rooms, and so on. The things that go into building this house can be just about anything you do as a couple, whether it’s dates, lunch, chores, meeting with friends, watching Netflix, making decisions together, etc. So when the term emotional labor is used, it usually means some kind of imbalance which either wasn’t agreed upon or hasn’t been addressed is going on while constructing this house. For example, a woman planning a Mother’s Day outing for her mother might find the number of tasks between deciding where to go, what to get, what to make for dinner, etc. overwhelming, especially if there isn’t much time do so. This is where her partner could make her life significantly easier, whether it’s in the physical tasks of preparing the day or the emotional/mental labor of planning parts of the day. While it may not necessarily be “your job”, it clearly demonstrates interest and engagement with both your partner, their family, and the relationships that your partner has with their mother.

We can extend this into everyday living with your partner, whether you’re building your house with a date, a dinner, lunch, meeting with friends, all of it requires some amount of planning, most of which can be fairly open ended(“What should I make”, “What should I wear”, “Where should we go”, “What should we watch”, etc.). If you’re in a relationship where your partner is making most of those decisions, then over time it’s going to come off as though your partner is doing most of the labor to build the house, while you’re just enjoying the scenery.

I don’t want to discount the fact that, inevitably, emotionally abusive women exist, in the same vein that emotionally abusive men exist. But by jumping to categorize all women, or most women, as one thing or the other, we lose their perspective and don’t get to appreciate the nuances between people that make each of us who we are. A little empathy can go a long way in understanding where exactly many women are coming from whether they’re frustrated about emotional labor, or another uncomfortable experience they’ve had. 

Hopefully all that makes sense, feel free to message me with any other questions though.",allyeet,t2_42osunau,-3,0,reddit2

Edit: You should probably use those cRiTiCaL tHiNkInG skills everyone always preaches about in these manosphere subreddits to consider The Federalist is a right-wing rag, and that your post is making several fallacious assumptions to paint women with a broadstrokes mentality that will do you more harm than good. You made some very tenous hypothetical scenarios to portray a ""bitchy"" and abusive woman and sloppily applied terms like ""emotional labour"" to this strawman argument that I do not quite understand, other than it sounds very similar to a very hyperbolic and toxic mentality of ""NiceGuy"" or ""NotLikeTheOtherGirl"" types. Perhaps a controlling woman is controlling, but that doesn't make things like ""emotional labour"" an oppressive tool that *every woman uses* in some conspiratorial end to what, erode your sense of self worth and masculinity? This term can also be referred to as emotional intelligence and it isn't necessarily an exact science or measurable trait so much as a practiced quality of individuals' personalities and an area of psychology. To have a high degree of self-awareness or be a high self-monitor might mean lower neuroticism or higher conscientiousness and other big five O.C.E.A.N traits that might describe emotionally competent people.

One bone I have to pick with your post is your framing of that bazaar post in a very dubious light. The sentiment of the article of ""Women Aren't Nags - We're Just Fed Up"" is that an incredulous partner ought to pick up the slack in what today is a more equitable world anyway. It's a very childish mentality to think women in domestic partnerships today asking for a thoughtful gift like a house cleaning service for a day is somehow an indication of being an abusive woman. How about the schlubby husband who's too cheap to want to do that but instead do it himself (maybe poorly) or buy something else to appease a very simple need? How about the front facing roles women are often relegated to in the workforce still today (bUt wHy dOn'T tHeY jUsT gO iNtO STEM?) have to deal with disproprtionately more emotionally draining people in their services, all while being ""nice"" or a ""bitch"" if she shows any dip in emotional job intelligence of her own? And then when she returns home from work and her husband is too incredulous to have that understanding, it sounds like yeah, maybe he *is* a bit of a dud. All of your post oozes some angry frustration that women don't know their place, and if not, I'm all ears given my unfair generalizations must be the only ones in this thread.

If not, you're undeniably participating in a toxic part of reddit and general online culture of the so called manosphere that bleeds over into the MGTOW movement, TheRedPill, WalkAway, Incels and other nefarious or sketchy parts of the internet that lend themselves to fostering hatred and bigotry in men in particular.

.1. ""Emotional labor"" is just a shit test BS term. Ignore it or agree and amplify it into ridiculous levels. 

.2. Why are you doing chores trying to please her? No seriously, why? I can think of 3 reasons.

a. You want her to be happy because then she'll give sex. **Answer**: Doing chores will never impress her in a fashion that makes her want to have sex, full stop, if that is your only reason just stop now.

b. You feel guilty because she is berating you about things you haven't done. **Answer**: Clean up your shit before she has a chance to talk to you about it, own your mess and be an adult. If you are already doing this but she doesn't give you even 5 minutes to clean up after yourself before then she doesn't respect you and this is just a symptom of other relationship problems.

Why are you ""helping"" around YOUR house? This is your house, whatever you do isn't helping her, it's your God damn house. Even if she is on the deed/lease too, that just means it's half hers as well. Change your mindset immediately. You aren't helping her, you're helping yourself.

c. You've been slacking and you feel the need to announce it when you actually do something. **Answer**: See the above. be an adult. Hold her to the same standards you set yourself.

.3. If any of the above is true, fix yo shit. You don't have to listen to her complain, but her complaining is just a symptom of relationship problems that she doesn't know how to fix, and really only you can fix them. 

Men and women aren't equal when it comes to, well nearly everything besides civil rights (really not there either, women currently have more civil rights).


.4. (SITUATIONAL) If she is a stay at home type while you work, why are you doing anything again? Unless she is working from home or raising multiple children of YOURS, you need to be clear with her on her expectations and delegate that to her. Be a leader and tell her what to do if she isn't doing it.


99% of this is fixed just by you being a proactive leader in the relationship instead waiting around for her to complain. Being a proactive leader will have the side benefit of making her panties moist too, so it's a win win for both of you.

She hates me using sauces because she doesn't like using sauces, but she likes the food I cook. If I cook in front of her she can't handle the way I cook, but she loves the end product. If I don't cook, she constantly whines that I don't help with housework. There is no winning. 

If I change the place of something she goes berserk and won't rest until that something sits at a spot she likes. It doesn't matter that something impedes me or she, or it's more logical. If I protest that's a fight. If I don't do work, she complaints to her friends that I am lazy. 

So to avoid fights I have to change how I act, move, do things, say things and still it's impossible to avoid fighting unless I just leave and avoid her.

My own experience has been around planning holidays for example. Some things we need together (researching and decision making) but he just didn’t anticipate what was involved in getting out the door (e.g who is going to feed your cats, taking the bins down) and this would be happening in the hours before a flight and it was very stressful. So I started taking over the management of all these tasks. Until I just ran out of steam for all the remembering. For me, the one time that the emotional load broke me was when I have to travel interstate and quarantine for two weeks. My mum was dying and she died four days after I arrived. I was getting phone calls every hour - where is this? How do I do that? I am frustrated at the pets or children, what day is the dentist etc etc. I just needed him to sort it out. I literally did not have the bandwidth to made end of life decisions for my mum snd help him solve the problem by calling the dentist and asking. When he travels for work - which is frequent and for long periods I just have to sort it out and manage life. I go away for four weeks and I still have to help him mange - at his request. 

We ended up having counselling over it and our communication improved greatly. I learnt to better ask for what I need. He leant most questions in life can be answered by fucking googling it.

But I've seen stories of boyfriends or husbands who do nothing but play video games when they're at home and expect the woman to take care of a lot of things for them, just like their moms used to.

She has to remember all the birthdays and upcoming events, she has to plan anything they're doing that requires planning, if they have a kid she does most of the child care. She will ask him to help sometimes, but she has to bother asking him and then explaining it all to him like he's an employee. If she didn't put in this effort, none of the things would get done because he just expects them to be done by someone other than him.

(and as I said, there are bad apples on both sides, there are also women who expect the man to do everything)

h41i2tw,t1_h41dx6q,2021-07-04 17:13:03,MensRights,"Let's put it like this.

I understand it's a problem to have a nagging controlling partner. I know it can make you feel like some domain of everyday life just isn't your own because they're acting like they own it.

But the man in the story sounds like he doesn't consider household chores his obligation. When he does them, he feels like he's ""helping out."" He feels like he should be told what to do. Should grown adults be told to wash the dishes or do the laundry or are those basic things just expected of everyone? And then he complains he can't read her mind because he wasn't told to do a normal everyday chore that everyone should just do.

Of course, the situation is different if she's not working and he is. Or if they have some agreement on who does what and he does his own fair share, but then she expects more.

But the way it was written makes it sound like the men feel virtuous or helpful for doing basic things they'd be doing anyway if they lived alone.

Again, if they were made to feel that way by a controlling woman who always considers herself a manager of the household, but then gets mad when others start expecting her to be, I get that. But I'm not sure from OP whether that's the case or whether the man didn't do his fair share to begin with.

EDIT: Or even if he did his fair share, did he consider that as a favor to the woman because he thinks of it as her responsibility somehow.

As far as why men are more often told to empathize, while I’m no expert and havent educated myself in women and gender studies, as I understand it boils down to a very large set of historical and cultural trends between 1-3rd wave feminism and the long standing historical status of women who’ve generally had less economic, social, and political power than their male peers. So what’s expressed today is generally a reaction both to those historical developments, and to those individuals in someone’s life who demonstrate a lack of empathy or interest in engaging their partner, with the affirmation of others who’ve experienced similar circumstances of disengagement.

Regarding the “oppression olympics”, that has to do more directly with what I mentioned above with men historically holding the majority of economic, social, and political power, and oppression typically operates from those who have more power against those who have less, but that is not to say anything of someone’s individual circumstances. Individually and interpersonally we’d need to get back into the nuances of someone’s personal life, not necessarily to “out-oppress” someone else, but to understand who they are as a person, because obviously broad generalizations inevitably hit walls when reaching individuals, and that nuance can easily be lost when talking about historical and systemic trends.

The house if fine being it whatever condition it finds itself in, it is the people in the house who have the problem.

If there is such a thing as ""emotional labor"" to begin with, in a partnership the degree to which it is shared must be agreed upon...just like every other shared resource or liability in the relationship.

People have different standards and tolerances for the conditions in a household. I have no problem letting the pre-rinsed dishes stack up in the drying rack until there is enough to run a load, but my wife insists the ""correct"" place for them is in the dishwasher.  Am I an immature partner because I don't do it her way?

My wife likes to let (clean) laundry pile up around her part of the bedroom rather than put it in away. I like to put my stuff directly into the closet and dresser. Is my wife immature because she refuses to put her laundry ""away"" like I do?

Problems like this occur when people have different expectations about a shared experience, and do not effectively communicate it with one another.

>Really look at what your doing, your making up a hyper specific situation, one where not only is there no children, and the women doesn't work

I will not agree or disagree about the situation being hyper specific, but this is a common enough occurrence to talk about. OP is talking about when a lot of relationships fail between men and women, the woman will only highlight her good doings and not do a proper self reflection while only focusing on what the man couldn't be to her. The term emotional labor comes into use by these woman. Now how can you quantify and measure emotion, it is not something very tangible and fluctuates making it harder to pinpoint an issue.

I'm missing the point of this paragraph please elaborate on how this ties in?

>Most women arnt nagging their husbands for no reason, their nagging them because it's they have asked them to things a dozen time before

I'm not pretending like men are saints here. They have got to get their shit together. Nagging isn't something you do to a partner, it is something for close family or a marriage that has lasted a long time deserves that privilege. You communicate and you break things down, and if thing don't improve you leave. But in many relationships it is not one sided. Maybe the husband/bf does construction and is too tired to help with basic chores during most of the week.

The point I'm trying to make is that there I massive differences between ""emotional labor "" and poor communication. And I think you get that, but I think it's important the the misuse of a concept by people does not invalidate the concept as a whole. 

>You act as if there is a natural balance in the workload in any given household. That by God given grace, we achieve balance with out any societal changes. And that women pointing this out is abuse. Our societal standard were build when women didn't work. When women didn't have a right to vote. When domestic abuse was all but legal. 

What I'm trying to get at here is the focusing on why the term exist, when feminist we talking about the idea of the ""second shift"" and emotional labor, it come from a place where we as a society view the work that men and women do as inherently equal. Feminist were try to vocalize a feeling that alot of women have that there was a level of inequality, one that as you say was not easily quantifiable. And further more one which they were forbidden to talk about In the past.

> I'm not pretending like men are saints here. They have got to get their shit together. Nagging isn't something you do to a partner, it is something for close family or a marriage that has lasted a long time deserves that privilege. 

This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side. I think it is a sign of a healthy relationship where you know what your partner wants, and I think it's natural to want a partner who understands you. It almost seems like your saying ""women are expecting a level of intimacy on to a relationship that is just not present"" which is fair but is def a case by case issue.

>This confusing me, on one hand you dismiss nagging as poor communication, but on the other you seem to understand that once a relationship has gotten to a certain point is understandable

Yes, in a relationship you do not talk AT your partner, you talk to them and with them to problem solve together. Nagging is after decades of being together and still being able to focus in what's important to maintaining the relationship. Women should not be nagging men because in a general sense men are working a lot of hours and so may not be 100% when getting home or even on a day off. And this comes to the next pint of your quote,

>. I think there is something thats important here which is the whole ""mind reading"" side.

This should never be a full on expectation. I expect my partner to do basic tasks and handle responsibilities, the ""mind reading"" aspect is something that only happens after long-term commitment and truly being able to work through issues.

Some of the issues we're seeing here in regards to emotional labor is its invisible and outright dismissal. Take for example OP post, the idea that ""planning stuff"" is framed as not really work. When it most certainly is, we literally have whole occupations for this, secretaries. So when these issues are brought up and discussed it is important to realize, it's not just about the work being unequal, it that the work is unequal, and we don't even realize how unequal it is.

That is not to say men don't ever do anything that women don't recognize, but I think it is important not to dismiss trying to be more open about the rolls people play. Often times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

Like imagine we we at a job together, and I was venting to you about how hard I work, and how I get no help from other staff members, and your response was, well I work hard too, sometimes harder! It just comes off as tone deaf and not really solving the problem. 

I do think we should be more open about the work and effort men put into a relationship, talking about things that are taken for granted. like men being forced into leadership roles in the relationship. If mens rights issues are to be taken seriously>!!< that's what should be done. But, it can't come at the cost of attacking women's issues, issues that historically and even currently in some areas, have been silenced.

> times I hear in response to how much women do, is this kinda pissing contest of how much men do, which I think is the wrong approach. 

I understand but part of the reason is that a lot of women today hold high standards and expectations of men to do a lot for a job. Then on top of that they need help with house work. Men have to do a lot because of womens standards of men today.

I do believe we need to be more open about these issues but there won't be true equality because we will always have to pull weight more in some areas vs others. Does this mean men should be slobs and careless no. I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age.

Let me put it another way, I don't care to get a laundry list of what each person does and compare the two. I think it's honestly reductive and ultimately unhelpful in the grand scheme of things. What I do care about is talking about the things that one or the other don't know is happening, or how much work it actually is. 

I already know the wife does the cleaning, and the husband mows the lawn. Why should we talk about things we already know? Why not focus on the thinks that are not very apparent, like how stressful it can be constantly have to keep track of everything in the house, how hard it can be to maintain a calendar, or the checkbook. Most people take for granted the idea that these things happen and are easy, but they're not and can be a burden. Where as mowing the lawn, I know hard and time consuming that is.

> I even notice women complaining about their man not doing enough but they don't say they help with car jobs, they don't go and grab a lawnmower to cut grass etc, and that is with little to no kids or if the kids are in helping age. I would like to hear your thoughts on this.

You talk alot about cars and mowing the lawn, but you realize these are things that happen once a week at best. Realistically Most care stuff is once every 3 months at best. And that's assuming that a man is doing that. Depending on your income bracket it's not all that strange to take your car in for an oil chang instead of doing it yourself ect. Where as dishes and cooking are done every day, cleaning is an ongoing process, and keeping track of appointments and what you have is constant.

Like again I really don't want to compare and contrast here, but when we are talking about emotional labor, saying men do thing once every so often vs the constant burden of maintaining a household it will come off as shallow. To use an analogy women are put in to role of manager and work, while men just get to be worker. When talking emotional labor, women want men to take some of that Manger role.

Shit u have to have seen the videos of a dude getting hit by a car & still he caught the charge. Anyway u know u fucked up reporting it as ""man up"" & ""handle it"" is always expected of men.

So here's the advice: hit up the coworker friend. You need a witness 4 sure. It might be to far gone to 'win', but a witness will at least soften the L.

I've been the witness. Work buddy fired & I knew the whole situation. HR never talked to me & just issued the axe. So when he called asking if I'd be a witness & his lawyer thought it would help. I said ""absolutely it's the right thing to do"". I then went to my own HR guy as I still worked for the company (same guy that fucked up the termination). I told him what was asked & if there was some policy I'd violate or something. He said no violation just say what happened. (He then did finally interview me on the situation. Month late but that's his problem.) Anyway a week later literally ""on the clock"" I'm on a call as a witness against my own company! Bosses I'd never met, a mess of HR people, lawyers & a judge. All I did was answer questions & state the facts. Purely a witness. I'm no judge; that parts not my job, so nothing to worry about. 
Long story not short because I'm telling it. Buddy ended up winning his wrongful termination & my company had to pay his salary (including back pay) until he found another job. I kept working for the company for 3 more years. The HR guy that fucked the whole thing was gone in less than 2 months. 

Morale of the story: use all the resources u have to not get fucked!! Then learn your lesson: that even if u get shot!! Keep your fuckin mouth shut!! Your a man; nobody gives a shit anyway.",stonedkc350,t2_1pcfk5yf,9,0,reddit3

>The law protects you from [retaliation](https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation) (punishment) for complaining about harassment. You have a right to report harassment, participate in a harassment investigation or lawsuit, or oppose harassment, without being retaliated against for doing so.

Since you have already been fired, you need to obtain a lawyer and file a complaint. 

>You always have an option of filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC to complain about the harassment. There are specific time limits for filing a charge (180 or 300 days, depending on where you work), so contact EEOC promptly. 

**Firing you AFTER you made an accusation of harassment is particularly damning.** If they do not demonstrate just cause - including documentation of steps taken to remediate unprofessional behavior - then they are very likely to be in deep shit.

Get started on this *now.* For a major hospital system, you are looking at quite a bit of money. At minimum, you might be able to get your job back, missed income, and interest.

I watched a manager berate someone for a mistake until they were in tears. It maddens that they're all getting a pension now for being abusive assholes. 

[Women have an in-group bias.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8226295_Gender_Differences_in_Automatic_In-Group_Bias_Why_Do_Women_Like_Women_More_Than_Men_Like_Men). Men do not. Yet one more reason that patriarchy theory is not based on facts or science.

Men don't generally work together to help other men. If men are working together, it's usually to promote class interests - whether they be rich or working class. 

However, what I'm wondering is what why aren't we reacting to the scientific fact that women have an in-group bias?

The Woke will accept that the hiring managers at Google have an implicit bias against women they can't seem to purge - or find in the first place - but won't do anything about the **fact** that female hiring managers will automatically prefer other women over the men there?

What difference is there between rape and consenting sex?

Only what  was in her mind at the time.

She can claim she didnt consent. is there evidence she didnt?

The entire thing is a terrible issue because sex is so common and proving what was IN HER MIND is literally impossible, unless there are other factors. This is why judges used to ask ""what was she waering"" back when women didnt wear slutgear unless they were cruising for dick.

Because that is a secondary indicator of her state of mind. As good as it gets. Just like a text ""I want your dick"" is STILL only a secondary indicator, becuase she could text that, but then laugh at him and turn him down if he tries to make a move because she's ""joking"", either truthfully or because she changed her mind and is gaslighting him to save face for herself.

So even a text saying she wants sex doesn't prove that she consented AT THE TIME to the act of sex. It could be that she wanted to, cahnged her mind, so he raped her because he didnt want her to go without him getting laid.

In that case, the text would ""damn her to rape"" because ""she was asking for it"", just like in the history of feminism they complained judges asking ""what was she wearing"" was ""asking for it [to be raped]"", which was COMPLETE BULLSHIT, but which was a cornerstone of their malicious arguments.

This is the office that sets the agenda for which issues of sexism get addressed, and controls the dynamic our government sets as standard in terms of gender power relations.
In terms of who is responsible for what, it's far more reasonable to suggest we're a matriarchy than a patriarchy.
It's also worth noting that this office, 2/3rds women (who are paid more than their male counterparts, and that this trend is escalating), is the same office that refuses to countenance mens issues being on the agenda, and routinely pushes a doctrine that erases mens issues.

Notably, they also tend to push for more women in areas in order to achieve equality, but not more men in several professions, including their own office. Their pay gap also suggests that the culture of this particular office is slanted in womens favor, and I remind you, this is ultimately the office that sets the stage for how gender power dynamics are addressed and refined. Crucially, they also tend to push the idea misandry doesn't exist. No shit they think that, barely any of them experience it.

My suggestion would be to balance the numbers by explicitly hiring enough mens advocates to bring the ratio to 50/50, which would still leave then underrepresented, but more represented.

To call us a matriarchy seems more apt than calling us a patriarchy using the kind of feminist logic that would bee similar to calling a government environmentalist, when every single position in the environment agency was given to and held by climate change deniers who set policy according to that belief.

Mens issues not getting a fair hearing is almost certainly due in part to this institutions bias and lack of diversity, causing them to set an agenda that ignores mens experiences and issues.

Since this institution is the one that sets the agenda for gender relations, I'd call it matriarchal.",azazelcrowley,t2_eu1ns,7,0,reddit4

But at the gym it is a different story. I don't look. I don't touch and I only talk to if I need to use the machine/bench they are using. It's always a ""good morning/day/evening how many sets do you have left in that machine/banch"" ""thank you"". If I notice headphones I put my hand in front of their eyes (at a distance) so they notice I want to ask something. With dudes I'm way friendlier and even ask for spots or offer to spot. A girl I don't care if the bar falls on her back, I'm not reaching out to help unless I can do so without any physical contact and I don't even look at them.

I used to be neutral and behave with them the same way I do with dudes, but once I approached to use the squat rack, toucher her shoulder after she finished her set and asked how many she had left. She took the headphones out and loudly said ""get off me you creep, I have a boyfriend"". I quickly replied that I wouldn't touch her even with her bf's dick, turns out the boyfriend was in the gym and wanted to get physical. No fight happened but all eyes were on us and I got a warning from the gym manager (her boyfriend too, but not her). So I concluded it just isn't worth and I can avoid any comments if I reduce interactions to the bare minimum. This had never happened to me, probably it happens more often with unattractive guys. I'm far from a Brad Pitt but I do take care of myself. The thing is, no matter how attractive you think you are, there will always be a dumb cunt who'll use the opportunity to lash at you due to her bad day or her period or wtv.

The interesting part is opening your eyes to how much damage women are doing to themselves in the dating/family market.  

There is in increased rise in women in their 30's, not being in relationships/married, and seeing that family dream erode from them.  Seeking alternative means of a family (read baby of/on their own), and still running up against biology.  

Yet its all men's fault.  

Ok, we can play the time game.  Who, at 40, is more likely able to have a child?  Men or Women?  If you're an established male, half way attractive, take care of yourself physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, you can pick any woman from 18-what ever.",valspare,t2_8d6vlu1t,3,0,reddit1

Parental alienation - legal.
