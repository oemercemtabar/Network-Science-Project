Meaning, if you allow immigrants to settle in like minded groups then they may never assimilate causing animocity between moral cultural differences like athiest vs religious on birth control.
The biggotry as well is caused by not having common interaction due to the ability to gravitate toward the like minded bubble if you will. Leading to misunderstandings and incorrect judgements/bigotry.

It's ideal that all cultures get along but most western nations can't stand their own on the other side of the isle. I can't imagine how much better it can be with even more moral disagreements. As a moral disagreement is very difficult to resolve.

h4z1r0t,t1_h4y6tff,2021-07-12 22:37:40,science,"This focus around cultural assimilation has always seemed short-sighted and misplaced to me. The cultural differences between immigrants and their first-generation children are huge enough to ensure that the resulting children are culturally “distinct” within one generation, to say nothing of subsequent ones. Those kids are hyper-aware of which inherited cultural traits or behaviors have negative value in their birth country, so those are often the first to go. An easy example are morals around relationships and sexuality. Go to any high school in New Jersey and you can find first-gen kids born of traditional marriages - they’ll have partners of a different ethnicity and have pre-marital sexual experiences behind their parents back.

The key to **integration** has always been maintaining a social contract with those subsequent-gen kids that offers them the possibility of being valued in society at large. Individuals then pick and choose what elements of their parents culture to retain in order to fit in. If instead they encounter a wider society that consistently treats them as “other”, then they’ll self-select themselves by keeping within their immigrant communities.

As an example, it took generations for Italian-Americans to be accepted by white American society, but now that they are, you see the decline of historically exclusive Italian neighborhoods. What purpose does that kind of cultural haven serve for a sixth-gen Italian-American? For that matter, how many Americans today can say they have exclusively Italian-American ancestry? You know assimilation can take place in American society when someone can confidently declare they “are” Polish, Greek, Italian, and Irish all at once.

Meanwhile, African Americans were historically not allowed to have a valued place in America (by excluding them from the dominant “White” society, but also by violently suppressing the parallel Black society). Black community and culture is still strong today because Black people still experience the sort of racism that reveals they are valued differently in “normal” society.

Similarly, many Americans of Asian descent have created and maintain a Pan Asian-American (AAPI) identity to address the unique challenges they face in American society. You see individuals who identify first and foremost as American and absolutely resent the seemingly innocuous questions about their ancestry (“where are you *really* from?”). Despite the fact that many would say that they (as the “model” minority) have been successfully integrated in economic, educational, and cultural aspects of wider American society, they are not immune from being *othered*.",telamascope,t2_3m0k3,60,0,reddit2

h50di66,t1_h4zdr2b,2021-07-13 06:24:32,science,"To be more clear, the problem I have is with the term. Assimilation implies loss of existing identity but also a misplaced sense of the principal agent of change.

The focus on the term assimilation is raised from the perspective of the cultural majority concerned with preserving their unique character when facing new kinds of immigrants for the first time. That can be a completely valid concern that can be expressed and addressed in good faith ways, but it’s commonly seen as a desire to have minorities molded to fit into the existing society where that the majority culture has a duty to be involved in the process to keep out incompatible values. I’m thinking specifically of the attitude behind policies like the French ban on burqas and hijabs.

What experienced immigrant-friendly societies have repeatedly seen is that cultural minorities (especially children) will **integrate** themselves on their own terms if the destination at the end of said process is seen to be achievable. It happens both due to positive and negative experiences these individuals will inevitably have by being in contact with the majority (in this I absolutely agree that groups need to interact). Positive reinforcements may be realizing that playing a certain sport is valued, so an individual may be motivated to participate. Equally as important (though less acknowledged) are negative examples, such as when bilingual children realize that speaking their parents’ language is not valued among their monolingual peers. Other classic examples are accents, foods, and incompatible values inherited from their parents. The key is that these are things that the individuals have some sort of agency over - people will go through a lot of pain and effort to succeed in their environment. And it gets easier with each subsequent generation as the distance between an individual’s cultural poles shrinks (or, ideally, as one can learn to accept or reconcile parts of both identities). However, the key is that the goal of shrinking that conflict needs to be seen as achievable and worth the effort - that is to say that any barriers are not seen as insurmountable.

With that, I come back to the French covering ban. It was entirely misguided because secularism, women’s rights, and sexual liberty are clearly valued in French society - every first-generation kid in secondary school is going to be exposed to those ideas and how normative they are in French society. But instead of having faith that this next generation (one that inevitably would have more social and political impact on France than their immigrant parents) would overall choose to engage with and espouse these same values in order to more easily secure their   composite French identity, we instead saw French leaders choose to enact laws that explicitly targeted their parents’ customs. More importantly, this state overreaction can raise doubts in their minds of whether or not they as individuals can ever be accepted as French or if they would be perceived as inevitably “other” due to their background. Absent those doubts, most individuals would choose to be more secular than their parents generation because it’s simply easier to conform to the majority than to be an extremely devout Muslim *and* still be perceived French.

That recognition that the bulk of the work  in integration (which is separate from assimilation) falls on the part of immigrants and (particularly) their descendants is the key. This is why I reiterate that the term assimilation is both short-sighted and misguided, because it focuses on the wrong perspective. If we assert that our societies are based on shared ideals instead of necessarily a shared ethnicity, and if the goal is to mold newcomers to fit the identity presented by the cultural majority, then the majority is setting themselves up for failure by supposing that they have a prescriptive level of control over the results of the process. Such a perspective can erode egalitarianism if the majority group sees its influence wane and instead turns to ethnicity to justify their continued position in society. This is apparent today in America with the rise of white identity politics in an increasingly non-white but also increasingly multi-cultural society united by shared ideals.

To accept immigration is to accept that a successful result changes both the immigrants and the wider society. When the expressed goal is assimilation, societies are setting themselves up to fail to reach people who want to retain parts of their identity or (worse) come to believe that they can never successfully be accepted due to bigotry. For that reason, it’s better to use a framework of [social integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration) that focuses on how best to empower minorities to self-actualize a place in wider society.",telamascope,t2_3m0k3,13,0,reddit2

However, if you have to force the majority to agree with your view that accepting the customs of the immigrants is necassary than I fear your ignoring a problem being created. If french society allowed vlaues that they disagree with to exist on the condition that they would eventually change, than that is very dependant on not allowing those same immigrants to settle where they wont need to mix with the majority population. As I understand it, again correct me if im wrong. The issue in france is that now you have a nation within a nation and the 2 don't mix nor do they agree with one anothers values.
As for the term assimilation, if some people think I'm refrencing a robot then I think you missed the reason I used that word. I used it specifically to mean that people in general arent very accepting of a moral value thay they do not like. To assimilate to me would mean conforming to that societies moral hardlines. I don't feel people have demonstrated the long term capacity to tolerate these moral  hardlines, again pointing to the abortion debate which only seems to get worse with strict religious doctrine, which I find many people accross the western world constantly fighting over.  
We, I find, respected the moral hardline differences between regions within our own countries before the internet it seems but due to globalization i find more and more people becoming aggressive with what they value being the best or only way to be. This is just with our own  current populations differences between regions. Now bring in even more disagreements and look at what each western nation is going through. We are becoming more and more destabilized in the attempt to force conformity.
Then you compare that to a monocultured industrialized nation and I do not see the same societal breakdown.
This all being said, I could be missing something obvious, and I will deeply consider all that was said in reply as I do beleive we all allow blindspots in our efforts to be correct.

gems5h9,t3_k6q4or,2020-12-04 20:36:08,science,"If this index holds up under scrutiny I’d like to see it adopted by regulatory agencies.

The department I worked in at my former employer is going to 9 day weeks with just a 40¢/hr increase on weekends, that’s in addition to increasing the workload of their current workforce by arguably more than 2X while tying their evaluations (and therefor pay) to impossible metrics. I put on about 100lbs working there and didn’t start to lose it until I emotionally divorced myself from the position and devised an exit strategy. I’m currently unemployed and burning through my savings and I still feel less stress on a daily basis now that I’m gone even though my future has never been less certain in nearly 40 years. If the amount of damage to people that the working environment I came from can be objectively measured and companies be penalized for fostering those kinds of environments, this would be excellent news indeed. Even if such an index could be published as a warning to potential employees we’d be doing something.

I don’t think it would happen in the US in a million years, but it’d be cooler if it did.

EDIT man does this amount of attention make me nervous. a few things; not naming the company because I still have friends and family there. I’ll just say that if a place has upwards of 500 locations there’s a serious chance they’re doing *some*thing heinous enough to make you queasy if you heard about it.

gen6u4k,t3_k6q4or,2020-12-04 22:43:00,science,"As a clinical social worker trying to help my clients manage their mental health symptoms right now, its becoming increasingly frustrating. It's depressing how often the goal becomes ""let's help you put band-aids on all of the stab wounds your job has inflicted upon your sense of self."" Nevermind the fact that you're working 50-60 hours at a salary job that is physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing. None of us are designed to do that and yet many of us are expected to.

Employers: That's just like... your responsibility. If you can't compartmentalize your exhaustion and perform like the rest of us, then maybe there's something wrong with you. 

As social workers, we are encouraged to look at our individual experiences through systems lenses. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors don't just exist in a vacuum- they're all impacted by a multitude of systems we operate within, some of which we aren't fully aware of. Family systems, medical systems, occupational systems, and we are so alienated from them that we really have no control. One thing I consistently find is the bigger the system, the further we are alienated and the easier it is for those in charge to disregard our humanity. 

A good portion of people are realistically trapped in dehumanizing positions that don't recognize or accommodate any kind of divergent minds. You stick to the protocol, no matter how inefficient it is for you, and if you're too slow at doing it our way, you lose your job. Capitalism has made us increasingly dependent on our jobs which is fantastic for employers as they have all the leverage.  Big-business employers lose hardly anything by firing people and in most cases can do it at-will. 

Yet if we lose our job we lose everything else we need to survive- and the ""safety nets"" like disability and unemployment assistance (*cough* right to work *cough*) have been so reworked by corporate interests that it becomes its own trap. The poorer you are, the more time and money it takes to do anything. And under capitalism our value is intrinsically tied to how much money we make. The systems appear designed to suck people down at every step of the way. It takes one thing outside of our control to get caught in a spiral of debt, and decades of near mistake-free effort on our part to get out of it. The more desperate we are for a paycheck, and the less we value ourselves, the easier we are to exploit as workers. Oh, joy!

Edit: I've never been given one reward, let alone 4. I feel  validated knowing that people are noticing similar things and grateful when we can take action to tend to our mental health as much as our physical health.

Ironically, it was actually an EAP through work that helped me realize I was in this kind of position and take action to protect myself. I really thought I would never be able to function as a social worker again and I was doomed to feel like a cog in a wheel- because my workplace was and they wanted me to believe that was the norm. Now that I am in a much smaller organization where my supervisor actually cares about my wellbeing and advocates on my behalf I can be reminded that I am not a broken person because I cannot meet the demands of work. I am a person doing my best to work in a broken system. 

Frankly, I don't think we should be expected to even maintain 40 hours a week at this rate. The data already suggests all sorts of detriment to societies who work more hours. At least, I don't think I can sustain that. My heart has been so heavy watching everything unfold through so many different perspectives of pain. I am honored to sit with clients through that and work toward ways to manage it more effectively. And yet I know the roots are in predatory legislation and how easily these things could be better fixed with a few policy changes.",Manwich4u,t2_cfs92,872,0,reddit3

The past three months have been non stop stress, anxiety, and frenetic efforts at simply staying above water on my duties. My relationship suffered, my mental well-being suffered, and my physical health suffered. I was diagnosed COVID positive the day after i put in my notice and i’ve still had to put in ungodly amounts of work, albeit from home, doing virtual therapy, setting up meetings, and finishing the absolutely ridiculous amount of documentation required for the job. My to do list is still 30 items long, and it’s friday. 

The few weeks before putting in my notice, I cried in bed at night and felt absolutely miserable when I woke up, knowing what was ahead of me that day. My work with clients suffered. My quality of work suffered. 

And at every turn, when i brought the concerns to my supervisor, he would talk out of both sides of his mouth: one day he’d tell the team to take time, set boundaries with our time, and practice self care. the next day, he’d be asking me why i wasn’t scheduling 2.5+ hour sessions with my clients on friday afternoons. 

it’s too much. it’s too much. as a mental health worker, this job nearly sent me off a cliff in three months. i lost interest in the things i used to love. i got irritated so the time. 

so, i’m done. i’m moving to a private practice where the money isn’t guaranteed, but it’s on my time and at my speed. i’m so fortunate to have the chance to do it and my heart breaks for people caught in situations feeling the way i felt for these past three months.

genrwlo,t3_k6q4or,2020-12-05 02:05:51,science,"Unfortunately half these problems are down to financial decisions. Even for non profit organisations, over working and understaffing often lead to this sort of problem, I’ve also heard of a phenomenon that I forget the name of. But the better an employee is, the more likely they are to be given extra tasks or take on extra work with the result being long term burnout and eventual leaving of the job. (If anyone knows the name of this phenomenon I’d appreciate reminding)

Even within the NHS of England, and ironically psychiatric nursing and crisis care. Burnout and overworking is common due to funding limitations and shortage of staff. Stress from simply not having enough staff to fulfil the roles needed and continuous pressure from above to complete the work safely and quickly without error when there isn’t enough staff to work safely or quickly is extreme.

There is a common joke amongst medical groups where bosses ask employees how they can help improve their mental well-being.

Of course the employees say stuff like, time off work, more staff to amend shortages, shorter hours and better pay.

The punchline is always the bosses responding with something like a YouTube video on yoga and breathing techniques. Which obviously ignores the core problem.",aallen1993,t2_42osx2ip,6,0,reddit3

genkm8i,t3_k6q4or,2020-12-05 00:53:53,science,"This is highly monetizable research for any company that wants to decrease employee turnover, optimize healthcare spending, and increase job satisfaction for all employees. 

Constantly hiring new employees because they keep on burning out or leaving abruptly can result in employees costing the company more than they make them, especially for positions that require ongoing training. 

Increased healthcare spending and providing employees with more PTO will give them more time and resources to address mental & physical health concerns. Employees that get regular, in-depth checkups are more likely to avoid sudden-onset illnesses that would otherwise cost the company months of time off to recover and address chronic illnesses that could threaten the employee's long-term productivity. Of course, this kind of healthcare policy must go hand-in-hand with decreasing employee turnover as long-term employees will exhibit the most significant increases in profitability/consistency.

If employees are not invested in the company's purpose, they will always have low job satisfaction. [Social support is found to be negatively associated with satisfaction and productivity] (https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2001-05924-006) and it's really the only way to improve worker satisfaction besides paying workers salaries that exceed the cost of living standards. Performance reviews, incentives, competitions, lotteries, and other low-effort management tactics rarely have a significant impact on worker productivity because they do not address the inherent flaws of the system as a whole.

Any company that wishes to improve profitability by means of improving the careers and lives of all its employees, not just management/executives, should absolutely be using these kinds of mental health metrics to drive transparent policy changes. Unfortunately, large corporations with high turnover and basically zero employee benefits have no interest in radically changing management strategies and worker culture. Why invest so much money in workers when they can put their money towards political lobbying for deregulation, stock buybacks, bailouts, and tax cuts and return incredible short-term profits without having to do the hard work of using managers and executives effectively? The answer is usually greed and apathy from the top executives, the same motives that got them there in the first place.",poop_toilet,t2_oe2s7,3,0,reddit3

If you start cutting people slack due to severity in work-related depressive symptoms - people will just overreport their stress. If you (like is mostly currently the case) develop a system where seeming not to suffer such symptoms is seen as good for business  - people will underreport them.   


Simply having a new categorization does nothing.

Changing the label you put on a person itself does nothing to help them overcome the issue.

geni15o,t1_gendh50,2020-12-05 00:28:18,science,"That’s an excellent logistical question. The aforementioned company partnered with Gallup for some kind of survey, I think they called it a pulse survey? idr. At any rate we filled it out for several years without incident and then suddenly one year my whole “team” was called into a room to “discuss” the results of the supposedly anonymous survey. The higher ups decided our answers reflected poorly on them in particular but played it as though there must have been some sort of breakdown in communication. Us lowly blue collar types must not have understood some of the questions, you see. It felt like a warning. The next year it happened again only this time they were clearly furious. I think they may have even used the word “ungrateful” at some point (because every day we drift closer and closer to a Dickensian hellscape). I actually sabotaged my entire future at that company just because my hyperlexic autistic ass couldn’t keep my mouth shut when parsing out the issues with the individual questions. I didn’t realize until halfway through the meeting that things had basically devolved into a dialogue between myself and the second in command at my department making it look like I was the trouble maker. This was especially ironic because I had been incredibly placating when filling out the survey for the express purpose of avoiding a repeat of the previous year. Needless to say on his journey back to HQ he stopped at every other store in my massive service area and created work orders with 24 hour response codes. I checked with my teammates and this didn’t happen to anyone else whose area he passed through. He’s also the architect of the changes I mentioned in my first comment so a real piece of work, that guy.

Now there are a few problems with the way Gallup conducted their survey. First of all although the survey was *technically* anonymous, it was recorded in a way the company could use the data “to make targeted improvements”, so it was divided by direct managerial reporting. This meant that although the stores we serviced were given their own subdivisions (a much larger group and therefor harder to target individuals) *we* were divided by teams. This meant that our subdivision was only 11 dudes, making it real easy to make guesses about who said what. So that sort of structuring really screwed my department’s ability to engage effectively with it. My company, like far too many, also had a horrendously retaliatory atmosphere which was never addressed in a meaningful way so tying a supervisor’s bonus to their underlings’ survey results was a real good way to make some poor wrench-turners’ lives hell.

I’m not completely sure how to avoid the same sorts of issues. Obviously giving the company less access to specific data could go a long way to keep things honest. Also, and maybe I’m being ridiculous here, it’s been my experience that companies who offer to throw pizza parties if a survey goes their way are probably already *kind of* decent, as ours would just give a coded “or else” and dangle no carrot of any kind. Another issue is that we had to use company terminals and our employee ID number (sorry, PERSON ID number) to access the survey. It might make more sense to allow individuals to use their social security numbers to access the system and fill out individual surveys for every company they’ve worked for (within the last fiscal year? idk) so that the company is taken out of the loop entirely. And before you jump to a company having a right to have input in the process, well I’m not so sure. If your concern is a bunch of employees basically being trolls to make them look bad, isn’t that an environment they’ve fostered? Shouldn’t they suffer the consequences for somehow turning themselves into a breeding ground for bitter dickheads? Again, I don’t know.

How do they determine a country’s happiness index? Could we upscale that? One thing that I know for sure is it’s not an issue that an unemployed plumber is going to solve in the comments on Reddit. I think it can be done by better minds than mine, but I’ve actually given up hope of seeing any major pro-labor (if even pro-human) moves in the US in my lifetime so I’m not holding my breath either way.",FadeToPuce,t2_69uwpttx,341,0,reddit3

I have accepted the reality that as a millennial, I need to just work for myself. The two biggest things I advocate to my peers to help their career is become code and data literate, and incorporate. The gig economy can actually be quite lucrative if you accept your 1099 through your own LLC. I can accept the ruling of Citizens V United that Corporations are ""People"". The implications of this are that you have more rights as an individual when you incorporate. Working for myself has allowed me to check out of the harmful corporate lies we are forced to ""believe"" to survive in that system. If you operate as an incorporated individual, there is so much opportunity. So many people need help with so much, and if you can code and understand data, you can model and solve problems 1000% more efficiently than those who cannot. My generation is going to be responsible for cleaning up all of this mess, and our ancestors have left all of the tools and cultural institutions to do it.

Just like the Great Generation made huge sacrifices to survive, we must do the same thing, and as a result, have the power to set up the rest of this century for peace and prosperity to flourish, just as they did for last century.",eitauisunity,t2_5jgfb,4,0,reddit3

gennhak,t1_geni15o,2020-12-05 01:21:52,science,"> I’m not completely sure how to avoid the same sorts of issues.

The US military does many surveys like this, for various occasions such as periodic reviews of unit cohesion/morale, evaluation of how well a new Commander or 1SG/CSM is doing, attention and adherence to anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment/assault policies, if the unit strongly employs safety measures and risk identification/mitigation processes, etc.

The way they do them, generally is that, say it's your Battalion being evaluated - this element consists of 2 or more Company sized elements (Usually 60-200 people). Each Company in that Battalion is given a web address for the survey, and an access code - that access code is, to my knowledge, different for every Company in that Battalion - although it may just be an identifier for that particular survey for that Battalion, and every one of the 500-1200+ Soldiers in that Battalion may use the same access code. This web address and access code is blasted out to every Soldier via e-mail, text message, print-out, sending a picture of it, etc.

Most of them, the only identifying information you provide is your rank, sex (Not gender, but we'll get there eventually), race/ethnicity, age range, and time in service. The last three may have a 'Decline to answer' option on some of these surveys.

Then it goes through a shitton of 'Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, Not Applicable' type of questions, and ends with several questions that allow you to type a response in your own words, and the answers are presented to the command team exactly as written. In some of these surveys, the command team can insert custom questions in this area if they choose to, to gain more information about pre-identified problem areas (I.e. maybe there's a clique of junior leaders that are particularly harsh in enforcing standards with or disciplining a unit's two or three openly homosexual Soldiers; or the commander suspects that hazing rituals take place when a new Soldier is assigned to X squad or Y platoon).

Obviously, even that minimal information can still be used to identify some people - we had one of these surveys about a year ago, and one of my friends and coworkers, the only female Sergeant First Class in our unit at the time, would have very easily been identified should someone who wished to do so have access to the answers among specific demographics (I.e. I want to see how all female E-7's in our unit - all one of them - answered). I am unsure if unit leadership has the capability of doing this when the survey period is over, and the results are released to the command team, however.",Droidball,t2_ha9a4,50,0,reddit3

Frankly, we need to start building a parallel government—like a union but much larger—to play ball with the rich, heartless fucks.  Eventually, we need to end tolerance for capitalist fuckery.  We need to become independent, just like a child of a narcissist does.

Having clients murdered, die by suicide, sexually harass you, and threaten physical harm very much beat the feeling of helping clients.

However I worked for a great team leader, very empathic, tailored his way of leading to each team member. When he got the comments back I walked in on him talking to the manager about it and he could tell by the way the comments were written who had said what in the majority of cases, he was saying.

The manager continued that she wished there were more comments as she was genuinely confused about some of the responses. It seemed to her that 2 questions were practically the same but on one hand the group had said the group was doing well and on the other question they said things needed to change.

She also struggled with how to improve things. She asked if holding a group meeting to ask for ideas from staff was a good thing or if it undid the anonymity folks had in the survey form. She put this to us in a meeting and asked for a blind ballot and said if anyone was uncomfortable she would not ask for ideas in a group meeting but try think of another way.

I am of the strong belief that you can create a perfect system, **but** as soon as you add people it starts showing cracks.

Like incentivising doctors to get their patient stats up in heart rate. blood pressure lack of smoking etc = doctors only taking on healthy patients.

Unfortunately part of the reason I write the way I do is because of my relationship with the autism spectrum. I was reading at a very early age as a result of what is sometimes called “hyperlexia”. Put in popular autism language, reading/writing are my “special interest”.

That said, as strange as it sounds, I actually credit comic books with a lot of my early vocabulary. I can’t speak much for today’s comics, but in the 1990s a lot of complex science fiction concepts were getting into comics and I would read them with a dictionary nearby. It seemed like every other day someone was being put into a genetic recombination device, or being assimilated into a symbiotic organism against their will, and *so much* electromagnetism; you couldn’t walk 10 feet in the Marvel Universe in the 1990s without stepping into an EM field or getting hit by an EM pulse. It was madness! But I also don’t think the value of an art form which uses a combination of words *and* pictures can be understated for a person trying to expand their vocabulary or learn a language.

gep5if7,t1_geooye7,2020-12-05 13:54:41,science,"That's definitely a good point. As an example, I recently started working as a contractor for a pharma company and ostensibly, my work would be less stressful than the people I work with who are full time employees of the company. I am hourly and not supposed to work more than 40 hours a week, whereas they are salary and sometimes will work a fair amount more than that. 

But an employee at the same level I would be would get 3 to 4 weeks of vacation, sick time that isn't tracked (just don't abuse it basically), personal days, good benefits with stock, retirement etc. But as a contractor I don't get any of that, 0 paid time off, no benefits, little job security, although the base pay is good since the company saves a lot not having to pay those ancillary costs.  

And I'm not actually complaining about it for myself. I'm lucky enough with my spouse's salary that we can afford for me to take unpaid time off without much hardship, I can be on her health insurance and so forth, so it's not causing too much stress. 

But for someone not in that position, who may have to pay really high rates for insurance or just not have it, who has to decide if they should work while extremely sick or take zero holidays because they can't afford to not be paid, who can expect to be fired at any time despite having no performance issues, it probably could be extremely stressful. 

I'm definitely happy to not be in that position, but it strikes as somewhat disingenuous that the company I work for stresses that their employees are treated very well, it's a big family and all that corporate lingo. And from what I've seen so far, that is true to some degree for their full time employees.

geo7rpq,t1_genzkwc,2020-12-05 04:55:52,science,"Hey, I apologize in advance if this is not something you’re interested in or if this feels like I’m trying to push something on you as that is not my intention, but I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life and I’m actually off of work on leave right now due to burnout/secondary traumatic stress in order to work on myself. I thought I might put out into the world what I’ve been up to in case it may help anyone else. Please disregard all of this if you are not interested or if you need or want to for any reason. 

I’m not sure what forms of therapy you’re familiar with, but the two I’m working on right now are dialectical behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. I have a workbook for DBT and a CBT for depression workbook. I went into this leave thinking I wanted to focus on DBT in order to build up coping skills to fortify my resilience and ability to cope when I return to work, but when I finally started it I realized I actually had other work to do in the CBT department that sort of needs to be priority. DBT is more skills training based and CBT is more focused on retraining/rewiring your brain to change the thought processes like negative feedback loops and rumination, and reframing them to be something more positive that you’re then able to work with. I’ve had my CBT workbook for years and never really got into it because I just wasn’t ready, but now I actually am and feel like I’m making progress. My therapist helps me out a lot because I have a hard time coming up with the alternate framings but it’ll get better with practice I know. 

There are tons of workbooks out there on DBT and CBT and for all sorts of conditions depending on what you may need, for instance I got a CBT for anxiety workbook for one of my friends a while back and I scanned through it before I gave it to them, and i found it wasn’t really for me because depression is more primary for me than anxiety is. Your therapist may also be able to get some worksheets for you for some of the stuff. 

If you aren’t interested in workbooks, there are tons of videos on YouTube on all sorts of different topics related to mental health conditions and different types of therapy like DBT and CBT. There’s a subreddit for DBT help that I peeked at the other day and it seemed a bit daunting and overwhelming for me, but you might not have that same experience. I’m sure there are tons of other specific subreddits out there for whatever you may be looking for anyway.

One major thing for me underlying all my issues is that I lived with undiagnosed ADHD for the first almost 3 decades of my life and I do not have a handle on it whatsoever. I’m a just barely functioning human on a good day. Just yesterday I came across a podcast called Translating ADHD and it is basically a verbal reading of my autobiography. You may be interested in it even if you don’t have ADHD because I feel like the lessons they talk about would be helpful for anyone, but that could just be because I relate to them so much. But if not that one, there’s tons of different podcasts to choose from that might be helpful. 

I know this is long-winded, I apologize. I’m not very good at simplifying things very well. I probably was going to even write more but I’m falling asleep right now and can’t remember. If you ever want to reach out to talk about anything, about how you’re doing, about these or other resources, or whatever, feel free. Everyone’s journey to wellness is their own and everyone must go at their own pace and there’s nothing wrong with that. I’ve made quite a bit of progress over the years from where I began, slowly and little by little, and I still have a long way to go. I wish you all the best in your journey and I’m rooting for you.

gerabke,t1_geokco8,2020-12-06 00:43:19,science,"I definitely agree about the different things for different people thing. Even different things for the same person at different times. I’ve remembered some of what I forgot to mention last night. A big part of my journey has been research. Accessing and learning as much about my conditions, treatment, and the human condition in general as much as I could, however I could. Books, websites, documentaries/movies, other people (older and wiser), and I even ended up getting my degree because of it. Processing the knowledge and applying it to my own life has been a much slower go of it though, partly because I’d never made myself or my mental health the priority.

Self care is so important. Even just learning a bunch of different things about self care is important. And having a whole list of self care things to reference and utilize that are personal for yourself, because everyone is different. It’s awesome you incorporate mediation into your routine, meditation is great. I’m not great at it, but want to get better. I’ve learned (and still am learning) that self care isn’t always necessarily what you most want to be doing, but what you need. For example, I may want to veg out on the couch and watch Netflix for days, but what I actually need is to get up, shower, and clean up my living space. And sometimes when I don’t have it in me to get up, knowing that it’s okay to sit with my feelings and take some time to just be. Self care can be as small as showering, brushing your teeth, and putting on clean clothes, to exercising, doing hobbies, or socializing with others. Another thing that’s helpful is being able to recognize when you’re not doing okay, and reaching out to your support people and communicating that to them. It’s okay to ask for help. It isn’t weakness, it’s actually a strength. 

More self care is cutting out toxic and negative people from your life. Remembering to be kind to yourself and knowing that on any given day you did your best is important too. And I don’t mean doing your best as in you tried your hardest, I mean that whatever happened that day, was your best that you could do that day. Maybe you wanted to get more done, maybe you’d done better at something before than you did that day, or maybe you have gotten more done in a day before than you did, but understanding that your best that day was different and was what it was and that it’s okay. Forgiving yourself and again, being kind to yourself helps. 

Another thing about research I find to be important is I research anything before I get it or do it. Like the workbooks, to get good quality/helpful ones. Also, I’ve been to quite a few therapists over the years but it wasn’t until I researched to find someone that specialized in my needs that I found one that actually helped. I researched the psychiatrists in the area before choosing and I ended up with a really great psychiatrist that literally saved my life. I’ve been on a ton of different medications and combinations over the years and everyone is different when it comes to meds but having a really competent, intelligent, and perceptive psychiatrist has been priceless. 

I’m not sure if you’ve had a psychological evaluation before, but sometimes they can be helpful to give you and your care providers insight into your specific conditions and psychology and the summary often includes recommendations on what sort of treatment plan might be helpful specifically for you. I think those are all the biggest things that have played roles in my journey and recovery. Hopefully some of these might stand out for others in need and might help guide someone else in their journey. 

Again, if you ever want to or are in need, reach out anytime. Best of luck!",okeyemscarednow,t2_2xayjs10,2,0,reddit3

> This paper quantifies employer market power in US manufacturing and how it has changed over time. Using administrative data, we estimate plant-level markdowns—the ratio between a plant's marginal revenue product of labor and its wage. We find most manufacturing plants operate in a monopsonistic environment, with an average markdown of 1.53, implying a worker earning only 65 cents on the marginal dollar generated. To investigate long-term trends for the entire sector, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded measure for the aggregate markdown. We find that it decreased between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, but has been sharply increasing since.

So a business man friend once bemoaned to me that his business was losing money because ""I can't bill my customers enough to pay for the cost of my employees to do their jobs"". The essence of capitalism is, a capitalist buys the facility/resources needed to make some product, pays workers to manufacture that product, and sells the product for more than the cost of the facilities/resources and the cost of the labor to produce it.  The claim here is that in a competitive labor market, cost of the labor would be equal to the revenue generated from the manufactured product. Nevermind the cost of the facility/resources/intellectural property, etc. Nevermind too that the organizer/capitalist who put up his capital for the facility/resources should be able to make a profit on the use of his capital assets and the input labor cost. The assertion here is that in a competitive labor market, labor must be compensated for 100% of the revenue generated. The input assertion is flawed, reflecting a view that only labor matters, everyone else simply owes labor their resources",shiningPate,t2_6cqg2,12,0,reddit4

The logic here is that if a company is making $1.00 from an hour of an employee's labor and paying them $0.50, another company will come along and offer them $0.51 so their company profits $0.49 for each hour of labor.

This 'competitive labor market' is a theoretical construct of what things would look like if we assumed away most of the things that make the realities of life and running a business complicated. This is necessary to get a solution at all and is the reference point for economists not because they honestly believe it is possible, but because it is what they have to do to get an equilibrium that has a solution. While it may never actually be attainable, I would argue it is fairly reasonable to assume that firms are legitimately trying to get as close as they can to this theoretical optimum of profits being maximized so thinking about economies this way is still reasonable. It has also proven vary valuable. 

So, yeas in a perfectly competitive labor market in this sense it would be 1:1, but we will never actually be there.

I get that it's all revenue minus overhead and buyout costs (material, third party off shelve pieces, etc)... but how accurate is that overhead figure from manufacturer to manufacturer, and indeed sector to sector?

Obviously something like accounting is overhead and not labor. But what about say a salesman? What if salesman is a design engineer that makes custom design with every quote? Is a project manager labour or overhead? Does that change if part of your contract to manufacture a custom thing is to manage the installation of said thing? What about say Quality Control? Does that change if part of contract is providing certain certificates of testing? Or production foremen? Does that change if it's a small outfit that has production foreman doing half the actual work? Are engineers and draftsman labor or overhead? Does that change if half of your contract is the design as well as the manufacture of said piece of equipment? What about the guy that maintains the robot that builds the product?

I think it's worth noting too that the industries that have the highest markdown rate per this study are the ones that have the most quality control / red-tape due to high safety requirements or incredibly tight precision; food, Chemical/oil & gas (literally have giant plants filled with what are more or less bombs), medical equipment,  computer parts...

Ease of moving house is arguably an easier problem.   Today a house move can be a massive burden.  There are costs to move, many months of solicitors if you buy a house, long locked-in leases if you rent.  You might also need to move your family, disrupting their life, etc.

All those things could be made easier.   For example, lease lock-in's could be banned.   Schemes could be put in place to reduce the paperwork involved in a house purchase - for example, requiring a mortgage can be transferred to another property fee-free and delay-free.

The typical concept of profit people have is that you sell something for more than it cost you to make, and pocket the difference because of the buyer's inability or lack of desire to go make it themselves. Here, the companies are making stuff that's worth more than it costs, and using strength in the labor market to keep those costs below what they ""should"" be in a competitive labor market.

If you really want to go to extremes, you can set the maximum labour price as the maximum wage compatible with sustainably running a company while budgeting for depreciation of assets and insurance; ie. a company that survives sustainably, even if it is unable to invest, and at the minimum side, the wage required to just meet the bills for a sustainable and dignified living standard (so that both conditions squeeze together and meet in a company that pays an equal minimum to all workers, and makes just enough money to just about stay in business).

You can exceed the limit in either direction temporarily, with workers getting malnourished and unable to survive or companies slowly collapsing as they unable to replace equipment or deal with disasters, and more often than not, for small businesses, this will occur until the initial capital investment has been paid off, with people causing themselves minor health problems, damaging their relationships etc. in order to get their business afloat, or not properly accounting for risks and using borrowed equipment they didn't pay for, or both.

But neither of these sustainability conditions (realised in practice by the rare case of a desperate business owner trying to retain workers to keep their business afloat, and the far more common case of a desperate worker trying to keep a roof over his head) are what this marginal rate is talking about.

Instead it's supposed to be some middle ground, where there are so many workers and so many employers that any job that is in some abstract sense worth paying someone to do gets done, there is zero unemployment, work is shared out, and we just assume/hope everyone gets enough to make their life sustainable, because this market has ideally arranged everyone's behaviour so that the optimal utilisation of human effort has occurred.

In this kind of standard approach to economics, my understanding is that there are technically no markets any more within the framework of the problem, (having been constructed out of the problem by the assumptions) just the optimisation of an overall production function, that *looks* like supply and demand, but is actually the result of a global optimisation process based on the comparison of marginal advantages of different options and following the gradient upwards to maximum utility.

You assume that the market conditions are such that such a global function optimiser is achieved, and then try and guess what it would say by looking at local gradients of money gained by adding workers, or working more hours, so that if someone working an hour more makes your company $10 or $40 extra, you offer them those extra $10 of $40, and if they don't want it they choose not to take it, and if it makes them better off than the value of the time they loose, they take it, and there are always enough jobs and people available that every position that could reasonably be filled gets filled by someone for whom that extra money is worth more than the value to them of their leisure time.

Conditions of survival and choices made on that basis are irrelevant in this model, but it seems like the calculated wages from this end up higher than survival wages and also higher than the wages people are paid in practice, so that kind of weirdness is dodged.",eliminating_coasts,t2_4a2fkfot,1,0,reddit4

What product did he make? It was that capitalists hoarding of capital that prevented others from having access to the same opportunity. Given adequate capital, a co-op can create an enterprise. Without labor, a capitalist cannot.


>Nobody working in the factory is about to produce anything without them doing that

The only reason those working in the factory don't have access to the means of production is because those means are owned exclusively by capitalists, who either sell them on for profit and/or charging economic rent to the laborers. *Co-ops already exist*

You've actually proven my point with this one. If your friend's means of production were held in common, rather than owned exclusively by him, anyone could mow lawns solely for the cost of the resources used. If your friend decides to charge you rent for those tools, or employs you at his lawn are company, he isn't adding any value to the operation, he's merely preventing you from using the tools to mow lawns otherwise.

That's incorrect. Answering ""yes"" presupposes a reality where the workers cannot control the product they create and provide or the means of production used to such ends, which is antithetical to an institution of socialism. Just as a property owner does not earn a wage, workers who democratically control the means of production do not earn a wage. The very basis of your question is being rejected.

hda9l8z,t1_hda731j,2021-09-18 02:21:51,science,"This can be where people’s attention can be focused, usually not by choice. 

You’ll see these adhd’ers play a video game for hours straight without so much as looking up. (Often people assume the game is one task and the person can clearly focus on that task - when in reality the person is being presented with numerous new tasks/challenges in the game that keeps that dopamine loop running in their brain constantly). They’re the ones where they’ll start a project and get immersed and hyper focused on it, or pick up new hobbies and dedicate massive effort in. Often with a struggle to maintain that effort or interest long-term in any single task/hobby. 

This can be leveraged for benefit, if they know what triggers that hyper focus. For example, if the idea of writing notecards is something they can hyper focus on, that might be a study tool they can utilize rather than trying to read textbooks/watch lectures, each card being a new task to focus on. Or perhaps highlighting books gets ‘em roped in, and they can devour textbooks all day that way, but ask them to rustle up the motivation to read a flash card and it’s a struggle bus. 

Plenty of neurotypical people can exhibit elements of hyperfocus, as well as numerous varieties of neurodivergent individuals. Autism spectrum is often very associated with hyperfocus, as is ADHD. 

Neurodivergents tend to be the ones who hyperfocus so hard on something, they won’t go to bed while doing that thing. Especially if you remove some inhibitions, such as with alcohol - they’ll stay up until daylight scrolling TikTok or in a game, fighting that tiredness to keep going a bit longer. 

This is why I recommend to patients to work with timers. When they’re doing a task they don’t necessarily want to do and will get distracted from, 5 minute repeating timer on their phone that gets them reminded back to their task. With things that they’ll get sucked into black holes on, screen limit timers in iOS work wonders - like capping themselves to an hour or two of social media a day. Setting up routines and schedules for them, tends to be helpful as well - such as keys/wallets/purses all get placed in the same spot in their home, bedtime/wake-up reminders and times, etc. A non-punitive routine really helps keep things pieced together. 

If you’re concerned about ADHD, talk with your doctor about it. Things that are helpful are friends and family questionnaires, childhood memories/school difficulties, etc. 

And keep in mind, medication can help, but it isn’t a complete solution. Reading and understanding behaviors of neurodivergency help in a lot of subtle, but impactful ways.",DaltonZeta,t2_8vdqh,59,0,reddit1

Also I assume that it has not yet been replicated although they did try to cross check their results. It will be interesting to see what others find. 

Also it doesn’t appear to take into account places where being happy is definitely part of the job. Also their conclusion seems to be that the effort to be positive is not worth it but the study does nothing to account for the good that actually comes from being positive, both to other employees and to customers.  I just found the conclusion baffling and not explained very well (maybe that’s my issue; I didn’t read through the study itself, just the recap).

[https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000908](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000908)

The study is not about how happy employees are drained out of their energy, it's about changes in happiness levels during the day drain employees.

For those who don't want to read the entire article:

To have the employees feel the least depleted of energy at the end of the day, their mood should:

\- follow a linear path > not going from unhappy to happy several times a day but slowly progress from one level to the other

\- follow a slow progression > not going from super happy the morning to borderline suicidal at the end of the day (or vice versa)

\- decline during the day > happiest point in the beginning and progressing toward less happiness at the end of the day

\- last but not least, happiness should be overall high. As they state in the study: \[Quote\] ""we do not deny that end-states which achieve hedonic goals are advantageous- this general consensus formed extends to our work on resource depletion as well. However, our work also suggests that the is more to the story"" \[/Quote\]

Not only did the managers get paid more to deal with difficult customers they were in a much better position to solve the problem if at all possible. Made my job really easy because I only dealt with regular/happy customers who appreciated my “service with a smile” which made my day feel better. 

Now that I’m in somewhat of a management position, I take all the blame and deflect all the credit. It’s relatively easy for me to make my teams life easier (making sure we have adequate budget, negotiating for realistic deadlines, being lax with schedules when we’re slow, getting buy in from the team before I commit on deliverables), this means the team can do their best work which makes my life easier. If everyone on my team does what their supposed, we’re all good. Don’t need them to go above and beyond.

Companies and managers cause ""quiet quitting"" not the employees themselves.

I just had my 1 year anniversary and I was told last month I was getting promoted.

I have no interest in management positions. I’m more of the type who prefers to master the job and teach others to do the same.

A lot of people grew up poor or had poor family back in the day (think Boomers generation). So getting a job so you don't have to labour in the field or go hungry was a blessing. It meant a huge step up in terms of the quality of life you could lead.

Their kids (Gen X) were at the tail end of this fortune and parroted what they were told because dad and grandpa could afford a home, a car, 4 kids and a vacation on one salary. Things were changing even before the millennials came along but the philosophy of hard work and loyalty stuck with the older generation. They influenced the youth and didn't adequately prepare them.

And how could they? They haven't had to experience growing up again, student debt, low paying entry level jobs they require experience and a master's degree...they are looking forward to retirement after 40 years at the same company.

Teachers also want their students to succeed by working hard. But at school you work hard for you. At work it's for the company. At school you got an A and maybe dad bought you a toy. At work you get more work. You needed to be born in the right family with the right connections to not have to worry about money or success.

A better analogy would be if every A you got, the teacher would get a raise. You would just get more work to maintain that A grade, and maybe some praise.

So we all have different ideas of what ""quiet quitting"" actually means, based on our own personal perception of what our respective jobs entail.

iugeauq,t3_yhy7fw,2022-10-31 02:56:44,science,"There are a couple of issues with how this is being presented IMO.

They start out with the assertion that women are more likely to be perceived as ""warm"" & men are more likely to be perceived as having ""agency"", which I can go along with sure but then it goes on to say: ""True to former studies, the participants rated both individuals higher on characteristics of agency as they got older. However, even with identical descriptions and such little information by which to judge, the participants rated Sue lower on characteristics related to warmth as she aged, while Steve’s ratings didn’t change""

So, if women are perceived as ""warmer"" than men when younger, but this decreases with age & perceived ""agency"" wouldn't that simply put older women at the same level of ""warmth/agency"" as men who have a lower perceived ""warmth"" to begin with but that doesn't decline with age or agency?

Then there's the fact the individual presenting the study claims to be a victim of this phenomenon herself but went on to be extremely successful, which suggests that however much truth there may be to it, it certainly didn't hold ***her*** back: ""Chatman went on to win Haas’ top award for teaching excellence and now leads the Berkeley Haas faculty as Associate Dean of Academic Affairs,""

iugysvx,t1_iugiiir,2022-10-31 06:55:44,science,"There is significantly more nuance in the actual study than what you are presenting. Some key areas are as follows: 

1. And, as predicted, a significant interaction between participant gender and participant age in predicting perceived warmth (β = -0.027, p =.034 – see Fig. 3) emerged, supporting H2. Contrary to H2, however, the simple slope effect for women was not significant (β = -0.010, p =.342), but it was for men (β = 0.016, p =.030), and in a positive direction, indicating that middle-aged men were perceived as warmer than young-adult men but that there was no difference in warmth perceptions for younger compared to middle-aged women. Fig. 3 shows the relationship and, interestingly, though perceptions of women’s warmth across the age span visibly declines, the relationship is not significant. Thus, H2 is only partially supported; men and women are viewed as differing in warmth as they age, but it is men, and not women who are perceived as changing more, and in a positive direction.8

2. Given the downward trend for women from younger-adult to middle-age shown in Figure 3, H2 might have been confirmed in a larger sample and particularly-one with more female targets, who made up only 36% of participants in this sample. It is also worth noting that targets selected their own evaluators and as such, may have received more favorable warmth evaluations. Thus, our results may be more conservative (e.g., less stark for women) than if cross-evaluators were not chosen by targets. These results still offer some support for our theory in that they show that age-based prescriptions operate distinctly for women and men, and an expectation that people will generally increase in warmth as they age, with women being seen as failing to conform to this expectation.

There are also the results from study 3 worth noting:

Random effects analysis. Table 7 displays the base equation (model 1) and the within-person longitudinal test of H3A and H3B (model 2). Among the control variables, teaching in the MBA for Professionals (β = -0.183, p <.05) and citation counts are positively related to teaching evaluations (β = 0.000, p <.01). Relevant to our hypothesis tests, women receive more negative teaching evaluations (β = -0.662, p <.001), and lower evaluations when they are middle-aged compared to when they were younger and when they are older, as indicated by the significant coefficient for squared age (β = -0.002, p =.036). Moreover, the interaction between squared age and gender is significant (β = 0.005, p <.001). The form of this interaction in Fig. 4 reveals a significant decline in women’s teaching evaluations from young adulthood to middle age (and a rebound from middle age to older adulthood) supporting H3B, that women, even when compared to their own earlier and later performance on a learned skill, are rated the lowest when they are middle-aged. This contrasts with the pattern for men professors, as demonstrated in Table 7 and Fig. 4, whose teaching evaluations increase from young adulthood to middle age, supporting H3A. Cross-sectional and fixed effects analyses revealed the same pattern of results, which we report in S3.E and S3.B and Table S3.B1, respectively. It is worth noting that our predicted results emerge even including child-leaves in the models. Specifically, the number of child leaves taken did not significantly predict teaching evaluations (β = -0.052, p =.570).",PennName47,t2_3f3kiw40,199,0,reddit4

Maybe that’s just anecdotal or just my own bias, but I do believe there’s a layer of sexism to be discussed here.

As in we can agree that capitalism is the problem, or a problem (we don’t fully but we’re probably not far from each other on that topic), but we can still recognize that there’s an instance of capitalism that’s exactly like the current iteration, except without that specific layer of sexism, and that it would be net positive to women in aggregate if not to society as a whole.

Also, I do believe those questions are important even *outside* of the capitalist framework. Unless you can envision an absolutely measurable and objective notion of merit, or a system that does not rely on some notion of merit to begin with, then the question of how merit is assessed and rewarded (be it through promotion, money or something else entirely) and whether arbitrary notions like gender ethnicity etc plays a part will remain.

All of that to say that I don’t fully disagree with you, but I do believe capitalism and sexism are pretty orthogonal (i.e. when you speak about sexism in the context of capitalism, you’re speaking about sexism in general, or, sure, solving sexism will not fix capitalism, but you won’t throw away sexism by throwing away capitalism either)",GeorgeS6969,t2_glnpc9c,1,0,reddit4

> In 1924, The Morton Salt Company began nationwide distribution of iodine-fortified salt. Ac-cess to iodine, a key determinant of cognitive ability, rose sharply. We compare outcomes for cohorts exposed in utero with those of slightly older, unexposed cohorts, across states with high versus low baseline iodine deficiency. Income increased by 11% labor force participation rose 0.68 percentage points; and full-time work went up 0.9 percentage points due to increased iodine availability. These impacts were largely driven by changes in the economic outcomes of young women. In later adulthood, both men and women had higher family incomes due to iodization.

>\[W\]e add evidence on the long-run effects of micronutrient fortification campaigns and in particular mass salt iodization as a means of eradicating iodine deficiency. **Nearly 2 billion people worldwide–a third of the world’s population–do not have adequate access to iodine** (De Benoist et al., 2004). Recent estimates from the economics literature suggest that the incidence of iodine deficiency, and thus **the returns to reducing IDD, may be very large** (Feyrer et al., 2017; Field et al., 2009; Politi, 2010). Policymakers in IDD-endemic countries, as well as the WHO, UNICEF, and other international organizations, have made increasing access to iodine a high priority. Mass salt iodization to prevent IDD is, far and away, the preferred policy: iodizing salt is much cheaper than continuous supplementation in populations with iodine-deficient diets, and, taken with other 5 micronutrients such as iron, is highly cost-effective in terms of fetal and infant deaths averted (Horton et al., 2008).

His older brother, born 4 years earlier, graduated from high school and began his working life with locally-based jobs before enlisting in the pre-war marines. He was happy to have an enlisted position as an aircraft instrument tech (before perishing in a burning aircraft). It was noted that women in particular enjoyed greater prosperity.

The milk will kill you before the vitamin D in it will. You can chug a gallon and your vitamin D level won't be high enough to be concerned. It's harmless. I am not a doctor though so if you are at all concerned get your blood tested and ask a doctor. For a reference though in a quart of milk there are about 10 IU of vitamin D and doctors recommend between 400-4000 IU a day. Its a wide gap because it was recommended at 400-800 IU but a lot of doctors are recommending more these days. between 1000-4000 IU.

This is a list of high iodine foods to avoid if you are on a [low iodine diet](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-low-iodine-diet-3231562)

- Iodized salt  
- Dairy products—cheese, cream, yogurt, butter, ice cream  
- Egg yolks, whole eggs, and foods containing whole eggs  
- Seafood fish, shellfish, seaweed, kelp  
- Foods that contain the additives: carrageen, agar-agar, algin, alginates  
- Cured and corned foods—ham, lox, corned beef, sauerkraut  
- Bread products that contain iodate dough conditioners  
- Milk chocolate  
- Soy products — sauce, soy milk, tofu  
- Any supplements that contain iodine, especially seaweed, kelp, and dulse  
- Blackstrap molasses (unsulfured molasses is fine)  
- Salt is the most common source of iodine, but low iodine has nothing to do with sodium, which is also found in salt. While you are on your low-iodine diet, sodium is fine, as long as it's from other sources.

Most commoner diets, which were low in iodine, at the time probably included

- Fresh, canned, and frozen vegetables in cooked or raw form

surgeons were women. Now, in 2018, that proportion is
over 60 percent.

So, the tables have really turned, and I can imagine a lot of these managers now are thinking something about discrimination against men in that field (regardless is it truth or not).

Could it be that people are under the impression that if someone works more hours they are seen as more capable? (Men tend to work more overhours than women, so it is not a stretch to think of them as more capable)

There is a lot to read and using the word bias in every second sentence, maybe some of the interpretations of the researchers themselves were biased. 

Did those who think there is no discrimination fill out one Paper determining the paycheck? 

So you would have man only or woman only, not really viable if you want to see if there is a difference between the two that lies within one manager.

fwkfwbo,t3_hhiwcj,2020-07-01 09:23:19,science,"> In the study, managers were given identical descriptions of a worker – the only difference being either a male or female name.

> Most managers rated the male worker as more competent, and recommended a higher salary – an average 8% pay gap.

There is an important factor being left out:

 * There are countless important performance metrics that a veterinarian must satisfy in order to be a ""perfect"" veterinarian.
 * The descriptions that the managers were given necessarily considered only a *subset* of these metrics.
 * So in addition to the *considered* metrics that the managers were being made aware of in the descriptions, there were also an arbitrary number of *unconsidered* metrics that the managers were left to make subconscious assumptions about.

In addition, this study didn't test the most important thing: The *actual* average performance of males vs female veterinarians. To establish a baseline, they need to survey the performance a large group of both female and male veterinarians.

If they find that both genders perform equally, then the results of this study are sound, as any subconscious assumption that an average male might perform better than an average female must definitely be the result of nothing but bias.

However, if they find that males perform, on average, 16% better than females, then it makes sense that a manager comparing two descriptions might subconsciously reason in the following way:

 * The manager knows that the performance metrics considered in the description are identical.
 * The manager is left to make assumptions about the *unconsidered* performance metrics that are *not* considered in the description.
 * Let's assume there are an equal number of considered and *unconsidered* performance metrics.
 * If males are performing at the hypothetical typical 16%-higher-level in the unconsidered areas, and performing identically in the considered areas, then it makes some sense to assume that they are performing 8% better overall.

Obviously, the fact that a given female is performing equally well in all of the considered areas implies that she is likely performing pretty well in the unconsidered areas too: so this should positively skew the assumption about the unconsidered metrics.

Then again, perhaps the average male performs 24% better than the average female, and the 8% bias is the result of a middle-ground assumption about the unconsidered metrics.",TizardPaperclip,t2_13xs8h1h,1,0,reddit3

Even if the company has no bias whatsoever, a form of discrimination still arises. The market rate for job seekers increases faster than the average pay increases inside a company. White males will seek now opportunities more often because they have more confidence in their ability to be hired. No matter how gender or race blind an organization is, forces outside of the company create discrimination in pay inside the company.

Before you fall into the trap of making that argument, consider the following: The ""just hire the most competent person"" argument only works when the quality of a team is nothing more than the sum of the quality of its members. However, team dynamics are not so linear. Having diversity in a workplace is important because people from different backgrounds tend to complement each other, so when hiring it is important to consider the team you are building rather than just the sum of its parts.

This goes much deeper than many people realize about contemporary society wherein even if not necessarily present in an actual physical male, we still value ""masculine"" traits more than ""feminine"" traits. It's why it is harder to be accepted as an effeminate man than a tomboyish woman. In the former case, a loss of masculinity represents a net loss to society, because we have simply ascribed everything to masculinity that is seen as virtuous, such as confidence, assertiveness, power, stubbornness, and rationalism. Likewise in media, many strong female archetypes are not in fact empathetic, caring or accommodating, but rather are portrayed as needing to reskin themselves with ""masculine"" traits to be seen as strong.

I think this fundamentally misunderstands what it means to be strong and conflates it with masculinity, which is what contemporary media and corporate culture is still struggling to understand. A strong leader is both assertive AND caring. You can be an amazing leader without being bold and aggressive simply by being adaptable and prudent.

fwbebgj,t1_fwaomes,2020-06-28 23:48:48,science,"Personally, I think this is an incredibly culturally rooted issue.

The thing is, we screw up by blending these categories of “genetic difference” and “culture difference”. While there are vast differences between individual females and individual males, there is still specific traits and ideologies and understandings that females and males grow up with that are different. 

People are largely shaped by three aspects of identity. One is how you see yourself. One is how you see yourself compared to others, through your own observations and others observations of you. And one is how other see you without communication with you. These are all aspects of identity.

You see, when we are building our picture of ourselves, it doesn’t come from within. It comes from our experiences, our role models, what people tell us to do and what they tell us not to do implicitly and explicitly. We build our own personal identity, goals, and expectations using this knowledge we have processed. And to claim that “we are all the same”, even though from day one women and men are treated vastly different, for everything from their emotional expectations to their competitiveness to their reliability, is incredibly shortsighted.

Females and Males are different culturally. And that’s the fundamental issue at play here imo - generally, to get to the top, females have to throw away aspects of their female cultural identity and turn them instead into basic white masculine ideals. Ones where you leave yourself at the door. Ones where thoughts don’t matter, the outcome is the only important aspect (behaviorism in a nutshell). This idea of “who you are doesn’t matter”. In theory, it makes sense. But in practice, who you are DOES matter. And ignoring it gives heavy biased to those who come from culture groups that are already in power... specifically, the white male population.

So for a TLDR, it’s less about looking down on females, and more about looking down on and judging ideals that exist in female culture that we refuse to acknowledge as a result of the existing power structure and ideals of the current dominant cultural groups understanding. That’s how I understand it, and it makes a lot of sense based off of all the structures in place, leading to a systemic problem rather than a “bigot” problem.",akoba15,t2_638rml5e,1,0,reddit3

It's not a sociological fault of perceivable masculinity that is required to perform certain tasks. A particular physiology inherently creates an advantage. Eg the lifting of heavy materials. On a biological or physical basis, individuals are legitimately able to back up their bias, or observations, with science. This can work both ways, for either gender, but obvious differences can be extrapolated in measureable facets like a necessary skill for a specific job...",Shorey40,t2_8njf4,1,0,reddit3

I know that this is something that I have struggled with and it is a shared experience for many of the women in my life. What I’ve found helpful in overcoming this is asking for the advice of trusted male friends or colleagues during the negotiation process. Admittedly, if I had a female friend who was confident in this regard, I could have asked her as well, so this is not necessarily a gender thing, but a skill. Asking them what they would ask for in my position has helped me increase my salary significantly and has helped give me confidence in turning down jobs below that threshold.

In my own hiring experience I can safely say the hiring has actually been biased in the *opposite* direction ironically. That is, the ratio of applicant:new hire would be much higher for women based on the sheer number of male applicants rejected vs. the very few women who apply, and the inevitable handful of successful hires that result.

Regarding pay inequity, there is only one imperative from an employer’s standpoint: how little can I pay this person while keeping her—or him—happy and effective on staff? Salary negotiation is a game of leverage and chicken, it’s really quite simple. You can demand a salary as high as you like but if you aren’t willing to walk away as a candidate then your ask is just a bluff.

man, I disagree with this so much. i really don't think most people think of masculinity in a virtuous or even positive light. we never talk about how ""femininity"" might be toxic (not that I think it is), but that's primarily how we talk about masculinity. ""is this thing bad?"" is the question that comes to mind when we talk about male behavior categorically. 

I've never thought of courage or confidence as a masculine trait, but sure maybe power, stubbornness and rationalism, if I had to put them in one of the two columns. those are...not good things? those are helpful traits to have to get what you want, even if it's at the expense of other people. if you had to pick a person to provide for you and your family, or to entrust part of your responsibilities to at work so you can manage other problems, you might look for a person with these qualities. someone who you feel like you can count on to deliver on what they say. but by themselves they're very anti-social qualities, and we don't think of the people that have them as ""good."" in fact, corporate management is probably one of the least liked groups of people on the planet.

if female characters have to don ""masculine traits"" to be seen as strong, it's only in recognition of the fact that you have to have these anti-social traits (and be disliked for them at times) to secure good things for people in a world that is cruel, not fair, and sometimes downright unjust. 

a lot of that has changed with technology and globalism, so yes, we do need a new narrative around what it means to be a man, but let's not pretend we see man = good = promotion while at discussing whether or not masculinity needs a wholesale revision.",half_coda,t2_jiq10,3,0,reddit3

Agreed.  I'm in the engineering field and my graduating class of 80 had 1 woman.  Attempting to force 50/50 outcomes in a field gated by an engineering degree means you'll have to pass over some qualified candidates to make that ratio, on average.  

My fortune 50 company seems to have ""solved"" that by asking fewer, easier, and more generic questions in the interview process.  The candidates answers to questions are recorded and become the primary source of what is allowed to be used to judge how qualified a candidate is, with heavy handed encouragement that a ""tie"" goes to the diverse candidate.  HR has a pool of, say, 20 questions that are all tailored to each job function and 3-4 are randomly chosen from the question pool that HR controls for the open position.  Of course if you force us to ask softball questions more candidates are going to nail it.

I get it, racism and sexism on a macro level have contributed to the over representation of white males in the engineering field, but you fix the imbalance by getting more diversity in engineering schools.  You can't fix the imbalance of the pool of people who already have the degrees.

I have personally experienced situations in the workplace where you can’t win as a woman. I worked at one firm where our managing partner didn’t like stereotypically “soft” or feminine traits. If you weren’t a domineering personality, he immediately considered you weak, and he wouldn’t give you good assignments. But if you attempted to take on stronger or “male” traits, he didn’t like those women, because he felt that they weren’t feminine enough. This wasn’t a case of mistaken perception either- he openly talked about it. Men at work were addressed by first names. Women were always “doll” or “sweetie”. It’s demeaning, and it undermines your position in the workplace. When he talked about new male associates who he felt came up short, they were always “green” or “had a lot of learning to do”. Women in that same boat were always called bimbos though. 

There’s this fine line women have to tiptoe. You can’t be ugly, because that makes you invisible. But you can’t be overtly attractive either, because if your coworkers/bosses are sexually interested in you, you run the risk of being judged as stupid/slutty and/or being objectified. We’re sort of expected to be blandly pleasant to be around. We’re critiqued in a certain that goes beyond our work product.

[One study here for example](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417753600) shows that denial is driven by motivations to protect self worth and hierarchy. And there are many other psychology and social science studies that directly associate ""status quo justifications"" (color blindness, believing current systems are meritocratic, etc) with perpetuating inequities and not being willing to change things. The long story short is that the more people recognize racism, inequities, and the concept of unearned advantages (privilege), the more likely people are to support compensatory policies to help solve the problems. Ignoring it only perpetuates the status quo, which has been shown to lead to consistent disparities.

Honestly the only one that asked good interview questions was the only other gal in the team. The other dudes asked none technical ones like ""how did you like working at X"" or ""what do you do for fun"".

I specifically made it clear to the team that I was fine with the go ahead of hiring her, but we need to realize that everyone on the team is going to need to be patient with her and train her. That she may not understand a lot of the basic stuff we do. Everyone was OK with this.

 Normally I wouldn't think this is anything biased related, but....funny thing is that we had the same exact situation, but with a guy, a couple of months ago for the same position. Exact opposite.

fwbx7bv,t1_fwbtgct,2020-06-29 03:00:38,science,"Thanks for sharing your perspective and experience. I’m a vet tech as well and likely my perspective has been limited by only having worked at two clinics (albeit over 15 years) and therefore limiting a broader exposure. At both clinics I have had female middle managers who have expressed to me that “boys are less drama” when lamenting about staff while they let sexual harassment by male staff members go unchecked (or minimized) and allow female doctors undermined by male technicians because they “know the clients will listen to them instead”. 

I am in no way trying to throw guys under the bus here, I’ve had great experiences working with a some awesome men that I truly  respect and I would have to say that for me the problem lies with bad management. I definitely agree that this field can attract some less than stable characters with questionable morals and work ethic simply because they love animals but cannot handle what the job actually entails. Poor management also plays a big role in the “culture” (as my corporate bosses love to say) that is tolerant or at best inconsistent in regulating drama that happens on the floor and weeding out the people that hinder more than they help the team. I’ve been in management myself and I definitely made my fair share of mistakes so I don’t want to vilify management. It’s a hard and often thankless job that has them between a rock and hard place more often than not.

>And since you apparently read the study can you tell me how many respondents said that sexism was no longer an issue?

That's not the question that was asked. Fig 2 breaks down the groups who think women face discrimination in the field.

>To more conservatively test whether managers’ biased competence evaluations were rooted in their belief
that women in the profession no longer face discrimination (effects described in main text) we also assessed their
endorsement of more overtly hostile sexist attitudes toward women in their profession (2 items, adapted from the
Hostile Sexism subscale:54 Female vets tend to exaggerate the problems they face in this profession, Female vets
tend to request too many accommodations or special favours at work; 1 Strongly disagree – 7 Strongly agree; α =
.72), and their general lack of support for focusing on issues of gender and equality within the profession (first
prompted with: Over the past several years there has been more attention on issues of gender and equality in the
veterinary profession. This includes differences in pay for male and female vets, and women’s preparedness for
leadership positions. Please indicate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements on this topic;
followed by four items: Overall, the increasing level of attention on issues of gender and equality within the
veterinary profession is: unnecessary, excessive / ‘too much,’ valuable [reverse scored], important [reverse scored];
1 Strongly disagree – 7 Strongly agree; α = .90). Items for each measure were averaged to form composites. Higher
scores indicated more negative/unsupportive attitudes toward women/gender equality. Notably, managers’ belief
that discrimination toward women in the profession is no longer an issue was associated with less support for
focusing on issues of gender and equality (r = -.47, p < .001), and greater endorsement of hostile sexism (r = .39,
p < .001). Given these associations, and to more critically assess whether managers’ biased competence evaluations 
were indeed rooted in their belief that women in their profession no longer face discrimination, supplementary
analyses tested whether these effects held true even when controlling for managers’ hostile sexist attitudes and
general lack of support for gender and equality issues (see SM: Study 2 Supplemental Analyses).
To assess managers’ perception that an ‘ideal vet,’ the vet prototype, should possess a variety of
stereotypically masculine traits, they were asked to indicate how important they believed it was for a vet to possess
certain attributes that are typically associated with men:55 For a vet to be really successful in this line of work, how
important is it that they are...confident, level-headed, independent, decisive, skilled in business matters, stands up
under pressure. Items were rated on a 7-point scale (1 Not at all important – 7 Very important; α = .78). Items were
averaged to form a composite. Higher scores indicated stronger endorsement of a stereotypically masculine vet

fwd9r4i,t1_fwc9ctd,2020-06-29 14:10:12,science,">Are you saying Sweden is more sexist than Iran? Because Sweden has much less women in stem than Iran does.

Nope.  Would also help to quantify what you mean by ""much less"".  Iran has a population of 81 million to Sweden's 10 million, so Sweden probably has ""much less"" men in STEM compared to Iran as well.  It's  the ratio that matters, but the ratio in isolation doesn't give any context as to why, but certainly acts as a barometer to a potential issue.

In the US, only about 13% of the Engineering workforce is female. 
 https://alltogether.swe.org/2018/09/swe-research-update-women-in-engineering-by-the-numbers/

30% of women that have left the engineering profession have cited organizational climate as the reason, and 61% said they need to prove themselves repeatedly to get the same level of recognition as their male colleagues.

That link also shows that women earning engineering bachelor's degrees are on the rise, at least from 2011 to 2016 it went up 38%, so it would appear that sexist stereotypes in the engineering field are being addressed at the elementary level, but women then run into sexism in the workplace and leave the field.  MIT helped quantify some of the ""why"" back in 2016:

http://news.mit.edu/2016/why-do-women-leave-engineering-0615

>“For many women, their first encounter with collaboration is to be treated in gender stereotypical ways.”


So, to sum up and clarify my position, 13% Female / 87% male gender split in the engineering workplace on its surface appears like macro level sexism (cultural biases, stereotypes, expectations, etc.) could be at play, since it's so far off from the approximately 50/50 M/F split.  And yes, research indeed backs that up that there's sexism in the engineering workplace in the US.

At the same time, being so far imbalanced from the 50/50 split was merely a possible indication that something could be out of whack, which was confirmed by research that something is indeed out of whack thanks to sexism/cultural stereotypes both in adolescence and the workplace.  50/50 is not necessarily what the M/F ratio ""ought"" to be in the engineering field, but the current 87/13 split is so far out of whack thanks to sexism in the workplace.

Next, HR departments attempting to correct for imbalances in the workplace by focusing on the hiring process and forcing a 50/50 M/F hiring split without accepting the realities of the current candidate pool is not helpful and counter-productive, especially if they're not addressing sexism after the hiring process.",LTEDan,t2_3ypaqsqe,-1,0,reddit3

fwbrmdi,t1_fwbors9,2020-06-29 02:01:55,science,"This article is talking about academia.  Academic tenure-track hiring is totally different from corporate hiring in every way imaginable.  Among other things, the people making the hiring and pay decisions are other faculty.  And they have enough clout that they can be as racist and sexist as they want without being held accountable.  The other issue is that there are typically hundreds, if not thousands of applicants for every academic job opening, and most of them are highly qualified for the job.

But apart from that, I don't think the pay negotiation was an issue, but asking for less workload demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the tenure-track process.  As an assistant professor, you are expected to work like a dog for 7 years to prove your worth to the department. If all the other faculty like you, you might get tenure at the end.  If not, you are out on the street.  It's basically a 7-year-long probationary period.

It was a study that showed that both genders would call a conversation “equally male and female” driven if men contributed to the conversation between 65% and 85% of the time, while they called it a “female driven” conversation if women contributed to 35% of the conversation or more. A conversation was only considered “male driven” if men took up more than 85% of the conversation. The same study showed that the majority of both genders viewed a “male driven” conversation as a positive thing, and saw a “female driven” conversation as a negative thing.

I still feel there are feminine and masculine leadership traits that a petson can carry regardless of sexual organs so I do back your point there. I am pleased when men of leadership can display feminine traits and vice versa.

********

Ones that feature women?   Most war and sports games are only/primarily male players, and are male areas of focus (no women in the NFL for example, fighting in wars has been historically mainly men)

Even the smurfs have only one female.

Almost all the video games I can name off of my head have male protagonists. (Save for ms. Pac-Man)

I don’t know much about animal crossing but I am guessing some of it’s appeal is that there is lots of female representation.

I know I usually gravitated to neutral games as a kid , such as Tetris, frogger, centipede, etc. and I am wondering if that is the reason.

********

And Lara Croft, lol, uh, she was designed for the male gaze.

And I am glad a new game, features a woman, (of course she is a teenager...). As you know the first last of us had a male protagonist,

But yep, this type of change can encourage more girls in the future.",ExtraDebit,t2_wl49k,1,0,reddit3

In Sweden for example, if i recall correctly ~85% of nurses are female and ~90% of mechanical engineers are male. Contrast this with India, where computer science (edit: in undergrad), a field overwhelmingly dominated by men in developed nations, is ~60% male.

There is a trend that, all things being equal, given the chance, men will overwhelmingly be interested in things and women will overwhelmingly be interested in people. This trend is seen the world over and even within the same discipline. Medicine in the developed world tends to be slightly more female dominated, yet surgeons are primarily male (fun fact: plastic surgeons have the worst gender ratio in medicine, being almost exclusively male). Also males tend to take more risks, prioritise pay over benefits and family. Whereas women tend to play it safer and prioritise benefits over pay. These differences have even been seen in other primates, females tend to prefer dolls, males tend to prefer balls, noise making toys and other gizmos. Males also tend to be more destructive and lose interest more easily, while females tend to be more careful. Yet, just like us, individual variation means that there are two distinct yet overlapping bell curves. The same tyoes of experiments have also been done with toddlers and infants, the findings always point to the same conclusion.

This is not to say sexism doesn't exist. It just does not account for the majority of differences, at least in developed nations. As an anecdote, I've known very capable women who were accepted to top universities, i'm talking caltech, harvard, mit. But decided for lesser schools because the boyfriend got accepted there, or because her sister was already there, or her husband got a job somewhere else. They prioritised other things than their carreer. And like them i have known of many cases where the husband or boyfriend has gotten a job elsewhere and the whole family moves, even when the woman had a good job and the current combined income was higher than the guy's salary at his new job. I've only known one case of the opposite happening.

This is not to say these are rules or roles people play, it is a tendency and individual variation need not limit one to one box or another. In my estimation, where we fail most as a society, is in devaluing these non-material yet very important aspects of life. It's one of the many failings of capitalism the way it's currently implemented.",KrunoS,t2_53azv,95,0,reddit3

It’s not a ‘female’ vs ‘male’ thing, as I thought I was clearly pointing out. The entire system is based on the way males think things should work/the way things work for them, and anyone who wants to succeed in that system needs to work within the system. Male or female 

However, outside of business the way society works still imposes/expects women to operate in a way that is inconsistent with how businesses work. Whether that’s childcare or the way female ‘aggression’ is treated or expectation that men are leaders

So you have a society that tells women to behave one way and judges them on that basis, and then a business system where success comes by behaving in a different way. 

It’s like training women in field hockey and men in ice hockey and then saying ‘if you want to succeed in business, it’s based on your skill at ice hockey’. Some of the skills women have learnt are similar but other skills are not. Some of the skills required for ice hockey aren’t skills women have been encouraged to learn at all

I can't tell you the difference, but all these studies claim they can. There are differences, observable, verifiable differences. How they relate exactly to behaviours is difficult to say. A lot of them use MRI but i did see one that did an autopsy and found structural differences.

In terms of real life, incontrovertible differences, males tend to be more violent and less risk averse than females in homo sapiens and the pan genus. So there is some semblance of different behaviour that is indisputable, that behaviour is advantageos in a materialistic society and a cut throat corporate world. Also can't really dispute bonobo and chimp studies.

Hips, spines, hands, feet, skulls and muscle cell type ratios are also sexually dimorphic in humans. There's also a ton of overlap in those too.

I never said there's a box we all fit into. In fact i was explicit in saying there is no box.

Perhaps i used the wrong wording, but it was an easy way of categorising rather than saying on a spectrum of androgenisation/feminisation, males tend to have more androgenised brains.

In much the same way males are more agressive and prone to risk taking than females in both homo sapiens and the pan genus (chimps and bonobos). This doesn't mean women don't rape, or murder, or get into fatal accidents. They just do so at much lower rates. Again, analogues of these behaviours are found in other primates and in particular the higher rates of violence among males, you find that across vertebrates.

Ada Lovelace, i'm very aware. But CS was never female dominated. Back then, women weren't even allowed in universities for the most part.

It's also not all hormones. A lot of the differentiation happens in the womb. Google scholar is your friend. There are plenty of articles, search for brain development male vs female primates, sexual dimorphism in brain development. In fact, these differences in brain structure indicate that transexuality begins in the womb. It is completely natural and the differences are in feminisation of biologically male and androgenisation of biologically female brains. The infant, toddler and primate studies all aim to remove this societal conditioning. In particular the infant and primate ones. Again google scholar is your friend.

I'm also not claiming we know everything or that sexism does not exist. There is much to learn.

If you're a woman that displays masculine dominant character features you're seen as assertive as the boys, one of the boys. Tons of CEOs and high level women discount femininity (to a degree) while being women themselves.

Don't get me wrong I don't think this boils down to simple physical appearance, but rather to the level of assertiveness, regardless of idea merit. Women TEND TO use their inside voices more when expressing ideas while men TEND TO be more aggressive in approach to self expression and righteousness in their ideas.

fwdfvs6,t1_fwbzkbw,2020-06-29 15:07:20,science,"I'm going to pay closer attention to your second link there since humans are quite different from other species when it comes to sexual dimorphism. In many species, for instance, the females are larger than males, and that's just one difference. Further, when it comes to providing evidence, referring to a search of a database is...problematic to say the least. Not all of the studies in the search you linked actually find sex differences (that's the problem with only using the keywords you selected). Also, structural differences are inevitable given size differences between men and women; men can be significantly taller and larger than women, which create anatomical differences based not on gender, but on size. Many studies (too many, for the field...) fail to control for size differences between men and women when examining anatomical structure differences in the brain.

If studies that demonstrate no sex differences is what you're looking for, there are plenty, since sexual dimorphism of the human brain is far from settled science. See [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468?fbclid=IwAR1yvJl4c2vdLroc_gu23Blx2Cv1RwfJswrqhvT7ljoV5Wus6tClqKgIQpA), [here](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/12/eaaz1170), [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00399/full), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899308000401?via%3Dihub), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811916307431) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811915007697). 

And even then, these studies by and large ignore how the framing of the research into sexual dimorphism was...flawed, to say the least (see [here, for a good summary, though try to ignore the clickbaity headline](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x)). The key takeaway from a lot of these studies is: 
>That’s where the theory that brain differences are consistent across the sexes began to fall apart. Very few of the samples—six percent in a study of 281 brains from males and females and 2.4 percent in a study of over 600 brains—were internally consistent as “male” or “female.”


So as I said previously, if I gave you a brain to analyze with no demographic data, you would not be able to consistently determine that the brain was either male or female with any degree of certainty. I think that your latter statement is closer to what the actual facts of the matter are, i.e., androgenization vs. estrogenization (when you're comparing two distinct things, I would try to stick with either feminization or masculinization or refer to the hormones at hand, solely). But, again, the overlap is more significant than you're making it sound (see the quote above, where at most six percent of brains are 'extremely gendered'). 

Finally, the 'trans-male vs. trans-female vs. cis-male vs. cis-female' study that you mention in your other comment is [vastly more complex than you made it sound](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/are-the-brains-of-transgender-people-different-from-those-of-cisgender-people-30027).",atypicalfemale,t2_5x508,4,0,reddit3

There arent structures in the brain, anything tangible really, that we can infer causation from. As far as research goes, it's very hard to pick apart from socialization. I'm not saying anything definitive, because there simply isnt the evidence to do so. Again, while interesting, primate research isnt exactly high level evidence. Toddlers already demonstrate the effects of socialization, so the problem remains. And while there are single conflicting studies. Without reproduced results and meta-analysis theres simply not the evidence to draw conclusions from. There certainly isnt anything close to consensus. 
Uh no, not just Ada lovelace, as interesting as she was. A fair bit after that.  Programming was once -'womens work'. Much the same, teaching used to be male dominated, until being one of the first careers women could enter. And how do you go from, 'until recently women werent allowed at university' to 'these differences in employment that largely mirror the social structures of the last millennium are clearly because 'lady brain'.

If there are more women than men enrolling and the culture is toxic, that means you're saying it's most likely women who are making the culture toxic. Or at the very least letting a minority dominate them as a majority without being able to put up any resistance to it.

Luckily you are confused. There are no studies showing more women enrolling, except in a few third world countries where it can be a way out of a life of poverty and they have little other choice. In fact, the more socially progressive, equal and feminist a country is, the less women enroll in computer science.

I know there are some toxic men who are mean to women and that's no fun. In my experience of computer science in my country I have met zero of those, and they would be fired immediately if they did anything inappropriate to a woman. Yet we have less women interested in computer science than most other countries. It's ok that different genders in general have different interests, there's nothing wrong about that.

I work with a male artist/graphic designer, and I get paid at least double on projects that he initiates with a ""misc unknown programmer"" versus projects that I initiate with local businesses with a ""misc unknown artist"".

Usually when we start a new project, they assume that he's the programmer and I'm the artist. We are equal partners in a lot of these projects, but employers consistently direct questions to him, with the expectation that he's in charge and I'm just the hired help. The general assumption is that he understands programming better than I do, too. Nothing that I say is taken seriously unless he concurs.

It's plausible that I'm just worse at business than he is, but I hear the same story over and over with the same themes with other people that freelance.

Still, half the dev team leaders were female. Where i'm at now, the gender ratios are more pronounced, at least in the subjects they have in common. A few sciences are female dominated---at least in current students, both grad and undergrad, probably not professor-wise---while others male dominated. 

It's really strange, the degree of skewness changes on the subject too. My supervisor talks a lot about trying to get more women and more diverse people, but they're just not applying. There's tons of dedicated outreach programmes and they haven't really helped much. Most of them are focues on getting women in STEM, because STEM jobs generally pay more, but no one tries to get more men in psychology or refugee studies.

Such a strange issue, hard to say how different aspects play into it. But i do think that we place too much emphasis on materialism.

j0pw48o,t3_zomuoa,2022-12-18 15:22:58,science,"> Individuals who are bullied in the workplace become more vulnerable to conspiracy theories, study finds

This incorrectly implies that the study found that people's belief in conspiracy theories increased after being bullied. What they actually found was that at a single point in time, people who self-reported being bullied at work also self-reported higher levels of belief in conspiracy theories. Reasons off the top of my head why these might be correlated:

* Being bullied actually increases belief in conspiracy theories.
* Higher levels of paranoia make people more likely to classify ambiguous behavior as bullying.
* People who believe in conspiracy theories are weird, and weird people are more likely to get bullied.

They did a second experimental study where they asked half the sample to imagine being bullied, and then afterwards those subjects reported higher levels of belief in conspiracy theories than those who were not asked to imagine being bullied (How much higher? That's behind the paywall). Ostensibly this demonstrates a causal connection, but social priming studies like this have a terrible track record when it comes to replication. My guess is that the result was just barely statistically significant, and that this wouldn't replicate if done again.",SerialStateLineXer,t2_gnwo83gf,22,0,reddit4

That, and a severe mental illness made him turn to this group of people who are not safe for him and who would throw him under the bus to save themselves.

This will not be the case for most individuals with schizoaffetive disorder, but it may be the case for some of them.

Genetics in schizophrenic spectrum disorders tend to affect an individual through a small set of high risk genes and a large set of low risk genes, it is unlikely that an individual without several high risk genes will be able to develop a schizophrenic disorder, but many individuals with several high risk genes will never develop a disorder.

There absolutely will be a sample set of individuals who, through a specific dramatic event, will develop a schizophrenic disorder.

Many individuals with PTSD will develop the condition as a result of a singular event, while it is not the norm singular events, such as pregnancy, grief or singular traumatic events can cause mental disorders.

What is not clear is whether these individuals would have developed any conditions regardless at a later date without experiencing the event, and this is indeterminable. Equally it is indeterminable how severe or at what point the condition may have occurred without the traumatic event, as the individuals in question didn't develop the disorder as late as possible or as severely as possible.

Don't get me wrong I'm fairly sure we agree with each other and at this point are arguing over semantics, but I will die on this hill.

Part of it is caused by a reinforcement feedback loop. ""I don't want X on my team because X just stands there and takes it, so they must not be a high performer if they're just sucking that sort of thing up."" coupled with ""Oh, look, X just snapped and started yelling at everyone! What a psycho! Gee, I don't want them on my team, they're unpredictable and brittle!"" How the hell do you escape that trap once it starts besides outright leaving?

Business is built around money and power, and like anything associated with money and power, it attracts less than admirable behaviours unless tightly policed. Get someone in a position of top power who actively encourages dysfunction, and you have a whole workplace that emulates their behaviour. Everything good and normal becomes sacrificed to the gods of money and power, and anything that is in any way counter to those goals becomes sidelined.

What this has taught me is that if you think you are a moral person, look very carefully for this sort of trickle-down behaviour from your company's top tiers, because you might find you start to compromise on what you like about yourself if it's there and you stay there too long. So react early so you don't get caught, or just ride the train and abandon your morals and wade into the swamp with all the other alligators.

My last clinic was like this. We had an MA who was amazing with all of the internal systems and clerical work, really knew her stuff.  She was also a horrible manipulative, conniving, passive aggressive asshat who did everything in her power to limit access to those same systems for others and would regularly reduce her fellow MAs to tears once she was promoted to lead MA. 

Later, she was promoted to clinical manager. Our worst MA now had sway over the surgeons and mid levels.  That's when the real nightmare began. Almost immediately after suggesting that it wasnt her place to write my notes and H&Ps, or to pre-diagnose patients (complete with pre-fab clinical exam findings), and that I would report to the board if I saw it again (all of which was done with direct, professional wording)  I received an 'anonymous' sexual harassment and hate speech complaint from a patient and was summarily fired. 

Haven't been able to find work at a clinic since. 

It's been 2 years. 

Came to find out that I was the 5th provider in my position in a fiscal year. 5 providers. Less than a year.

In that time since, the clinic has lost every employee that was there when I was, including the other surgeons. The only employee consistently there?  You guessed it. When I recently spoke to one of the former rad techs, the clinic owner had explained that MA was ""too valuable to the practice"" to ever consider releasing. 

Wouldn't call a passive aggressive hole who flushes your provider and support staff as often as her home toilet ""valuable to the practice""

Luckily for me he is not my direct boss and my direct supervisor is the nicest person I have met. I spoke up about it, went to HR and my boss backed me all the way. The solution HR came up with was that this person should talk to me only when my boss was present and keep communications on email as far as possible. I had a few things going for me when I complained. I am in a job where it is very difficult to replace me as it is a very niche technology. However since the minimal contact rule I have had almost no problems and my efficiency and productivity has definitely improved. 
Here is what I learned from the situation:
1) I didn't speak up for a long time because I didn't want to be perceived as the one causing trouble. This led to increasing problems and when I did speak up it was like an explosion because no one had any idea this was happening. So I could have handled it much better than I did.

3) the bullies are usually spending all of their time sucking up too people and not really doing the work expected of them. So if you have the patience, just wait and watch them implode.

I worked with a very toxic person.  Fortunately I've only worked with two people I'd call toxic in a 20+ year career.

In this case, I was the person less than a year in the company.  The other person had been in the company for several years.   The person simply wasn't cut out for the role in all manners, lacking strategy, personality for customer facing discussion's and proper stress management.  

The person had inherited a lot of valuable things due to organizational growth.  The team was small, only 3 people. Fortunately, my other team mate, who was also new, was also treated poorly. There were two of us reporting the toxic bullying back to different reporting structures in leadership.

 I was also in the position where I had a pregnant wife at the time.  The toxic person, nothing negative happened to them.  They just moved me and the other person that was being bullied to other areas.  The branding was that we didn't want to deal with the pace....A very frustrating experience as most in the office new the toxic person wasn't qualified for the role.

The criticism is usually not hyper specific either it'll be stuff like ""He is never prepared"" or 'he misses deadlines"" that way when I do inevitably make a mistake it can be used as an example to reaffirm the bias.

The bully will also find other allies in the department. Usually, people I was promoted over and are happy to be critical to blunt the blow of being passed up for a promotion.

In my opinion that's how we should view some of these findings in the social sciences that affirm societal ailings - instead of using it to stoke the fire surrounding social issues, we should see it as an evolutionary explanation for why we are the way we are.  This is how evolution made us - what relevance is whether or not something is a ""character flaw"" if it's born out in our behavioral statistics as the norm?

ei7p7jz,t3_azfb7b,2019-03-10 16:16:34,science,"My office is currently uder this kind of stress. We have a bully who is on her last leg. I am a supervisor. Despite my best effeorts over several years, my calls for disciplinary action has gone on deaf ears. It has been extremely difficult. The business fears a wrongful termination lawsuit with this woman because she uses lawyers. Car wreck she caused 2 years ago, still in the courts.

Recently 2 employees have come forward threatening to quit. Everyone is very upset, tension is high, and the bully is playing the victim card. She came to me because I am the only person willing to talk to her. At this point the other supervisor and manager are so angry they are almost wanting the bear to be poked so she snaps and the boss fires her. 

Here is where I am put into a very difficult situation. The bully is being ostracized, no one is working with her, talking to her, they are truly being petty. She came to me and I had to calm her down and reinforce that she is looking at losing her job due to her actions, the way she is treating others. She is a toxic person. Everyone is being very emotional. I work in an office staffed with 99% women, being a man doesn't necessarily help me either as I try to tell them to keep emotions from over taking their thought process on this situation. If I cannot defuse the time bomb, she will explode, she will be fired, and 2 great stellar employees are going to quit.

My manager and the other supervisor are upset with me for talking to her and calming her down. I am seen as being her friend and favoring her, which I am not. I am protecting the other 2, not the bully, I want her gone. Though I cannot afford to lose 3 employees at once. I am trying to work with everyone here, I am stuck in the middle of this.

The cause is usually the way we treat power and status in the workplace (and outside of it usually - think about it - people who sit there and take it are probably ""weak""). The problems are the associated heuristics and our attribution errors.

&#x200B;

The bias is that initial thought that if ""someone takes disrespect then they are weak"" and if someone else is ""mayeb bulying but they are a great asset to my firm"". The issue then is that we automatically tend to see the power levels and as some psychology studies repeatedly show, we are attacted to power an want to distance ourselves from the weak.

The problem gets worse when you put into the mix the fundamental attribution error. If a person is perceived as weak, then the bias would say that they are weak because of their own internal / intrinsic faults rather than contextual issues. ""So what if someone is weaker because their salary is in danger if they speak up, they should be better"". That would be the bias speaking. It also work for those we favor of course - especially if decision makers are themselves powerful (or power aware) individuals. The bias then would work in the favor of the powerful since any weakness is deemed as contextual rather than personal.

&#x200B;

What can we take from this? Well first if abused then recognize that there are things in your power to act upon (leaving, speaking up but in a manner that speaks about actions rather than persons). Also understand that if people say you are ""weak"" because of speaking up then that is bias speaking rather than an intentional or true judgement of your character. As for managers? If someone speaks up - stop and question your initital gut instinct if you can and try to look into it a bit more rather than excusing context. Usually repeated offences should be the best sign there's something wrong.

When I started to work I noticed that everyone seemed to be very ""type A"": very controlling, detail oriented, perfectionist, pretty anal. Those, when kept in check, aren't necessarily bad, but in a group environment you really need other types of people to balance things out.

After the company's feedback questionnaire, they did a huge presentation on the findings, which were over all pretty excellent. It was a great place to work. But they worst score they got was on individual feedback. Only 60-70% of employees felt they got enough individual feedback. Clearly, we needed to work on this number. Which is what called for this HUGE, expensive, and drawn out course about feedback.

From Jan until I quit in Sept, you could go one week without some sort of group discussion about how to give feedback and give more feedback. And of course the truly type A psychos went WAY overboard with it.

HR set up multiple seminars for us to attend on company time regarding feedback and personality types. Every single week. They gave us goals of providing feedback X number of times for rewards. They taught us how to give feedback is various ways: directly, to the manager, through different channels, how to word it well.

They never taught us how to accept feedback. And crucially, they never taught us what kind of things are WORTHY of feedback.

This fairly healthy, great workplace self destructed in a matter of weeks. It became such a toxic environment with ridiculous amounts of micromanaging, petty comments, and just general assholery.

ei81p42,t1_ei7f5o0,2019-03-10 18:47:46,science,"Worked at a manufacturing company that was setup for the maximum backstabbing and office politics.

The company has a policy requiring departments to bill each other, and holding them accountable if they ""go into the red"". E.g. Machining department pays die cast department for raw parts. Assembly department pays machining department for machined parts. Plant A pays Plant B for stuff.

Bonuses are paid based on the company's overall performance, but a fast way for a manager to have senior management breathing down on their neck is if they have a budget deficit, which encourages passing costs to other departments or plants.

I would also assume some managers use the ""we're always in the green"" as a way to advance their career, even if that meant hurting other departments or plants in the process.

The end result is stuff such as:

- A department is still on Windows 2000/XP because of their custom software, and it's possible that those custom software were so poorly written that they wouldn't run on virtual machines. That department wanted IT to pay for the software upgrade. IT told them to take a hike. Then the two departments mishandled a malware incident that pwned the Windows 2000/XP computers, which resulted in a mission critical Windows 7 ""server"" (made of desktop parts) to get infected and bring down the entire production.

- RAID 0 of used office desktop HDDs being used in a server made of used office desktops because IT and the production departments wouldn't pay a single cent for hardware upgrades

- A production department delaying maintenance on a major pump for 2-3 weeks to make their quarterly financial statement look better, then is surprised that the other pump died from the increased load because the two pumps were suppose to be redundant back when the coolant supply demands were lower, and instead they were both in almost full operation to meet the new coolant supply demands.

ei91gnr,t1_ei7f5o0,2019-03-11 02:29:08,science,"This is why I left my last long term job. I was caught in the no win situation of having to either take it and never get ahead or stand up for myself and give the impression that I couldn't handle the job. Nobody liked me at that job. Not anyone that mattered at least. I had to be a perfect machine and never make mistakes just to  for my boss to think I was competitive with another candidate who literally refused to do their job and had zero integrity to boot. 
But the boss was friends with their mother and went to church with them so their shortcomings were never given any weight. My shortcomings were deeply problematic and my mistakes were always a very big deal. 
There was also the issue that I was in many respects more experienced than the boss in the first place. Other people were so convinced of my aptitude that they begged for me to be given the promotion over the other candidate but to her their opinions were flawed, they didn't see the potential in this other person and just hadn't seen the problems I had. 
It got so bad that one of the other leads sat me down and told me straight- it doesn't matter what you do- you will always be wrong. Your best bet is to move to another location. 
By then I was just ready for something else. I couldn't pretend that job was for me anymore. I grew a lot as a person and I even met my wife there but I had gone as far as I could go personally.

ei8q0x4,t1_ei7oy5p,2019-03-10 23:53:59,science,"Good luck in your job search. I work for a VERY well known hospital. The level of ass kissing and toxic, bullying behavior that is condoned by management is INSANE. I had a Nurse who put me through the ringer. Continually ran to the director with blatant falsehoods about my performance and I went through literal hell for 5 months. 

The director started to target me and I was pulled in to her office weekly and debased. Said director was hardly ever in our unit to supervise my performance, instead had Toxic Tammy (who had been promoted to charge) report to her regularly regarding my performance/behavior. I was being overloaded and ended up doing the work of a unit clerk in addition to my normal MA responsibilities. 
I was being set up for failure. Every week, there was more added to my plate and I started going through a mental breakdown. I would arrive home multiple times a week in tears and frantically started looking for other jobs. I kept my head down and worked myself to the breaking point. All with a smile on my face. And yet, No matter what I did it was wrong. I could follow their instructions to a T and it was still wrong. Mind you, with all of these new responsibilities I was hardly given any direction and literally told to “figure it out”

In the meantime, I had gotten my annual evaluation and in it, I was destroyed. I got a “does not meet expectations” across the board and it was signed off by the director but was worded in the style of Tammy herself. I was put on probation. Director went out on maternity leave and in comes interim director who sees my value and sees right through Toxic Tammy and her shenanigans. I spoke with interim and they bring my concerns to the VP who backs me up. I now had support and my confidence level went through the roof. I dreaded the day that Director came back from maternity leave. 

Nothing ever panned out with the job search and you know what they say about karma, right? 

One day, we get word that Director is coming back from her leave two months early. Rumors start swirling. Fateful day arrives and it was very low key. I stayed busy and kept my head down and surprisingly, nothing happened. The very next day, director announces her resignation from our department. Her excuse was all fluff (of course) but she was returning to her original department. I felt like a massive weight was lifted. Toxic Tammy would have less power, now that no one was there for her to feed her negativity and lies to. A few weeks later Tammy gave her resignation. Fast forward a few (relatively quiet and pleasant) months and Toxic Tammy was met at the front door before the beginning of the shift and was told her resignation was effective immediately. I never found out the reason as to why, but I took the gift that the universe delivered to me and skipped happily off into the sunset. I felt vindicated after the literal hell that I had gone through. I still work there and now have an amazing manager and Director.

Again, good luck with your search. Self preservation is indeed necessary in our field. Ours has one of the highest instances of bullying and it is sadly overlooked.

Also constantly complaining about how awful her (second) husband was (he was also her 3rd baby daddy). But god forbid you try and give her advice, because she’s instantly defensive... even though she’s always saying she “doesn’t know what to do”.

BUT ANYWAY she was a terrible employee, but also so far up our managers ass. I was 25 at the time, working the same position as her, happily married and really good at my job. She was completely terrible to me, and so was my manager. They left me out of meeting conference calls with our client, didn’t include me on memos or pass on notes I was supposed to have. She would loudly ask every single person to go to the nearby cafe for lunch, and purposely leave only me out. It was torture, and other people witnessed it happening. Somehow, this woman was promoted over me. It was the last straw. I put in my notice (I had found a better paying, better over all job) and filed a workplace complaint about bullying and left. I cited all my sources, had dates and times as well as some email proof. I was friendly with a woman who stayed behind and apparently after I left multiple people came forward to put in their own complaints, especially because this awful woman found a new target, and the department ended up having a complete overhaul.

It was justice after the fact because the woman got demoted. But the manager just ended up being transferred, and there was no real accountability on the upper management allowing this to happen despite the fact I had brought it up to the supervisor above my director manager before. She told me that “I can’t make people like you” and basically ignored the rest of it.

When you hear people complaining that the data doesn't mean anything, typically those are the popular people who are used to receiving far more credit than they deserve.

They come in, say the wrong thing too often, piss off the one or two quietly efficient backbone people who won't work with them any more, and then get shown the door.

But I've also seen bad people take over good workplaces through a position of power, such as when a company gets bought by another and someone new is sent in to lead the new division. In one case it led to a super-unhappy team that was stuck there because they didn't have highly transferable skills (they were mostly older software developers supporting systems that should have been replaced years before), and in the other all the best ""leader"" people left almost immediately due to the new policies and atmosphere, and the place got sold again because it went from highly profitable support service organization to losing money hand over fist within 18 months.

I couldn't read the study either, but my speculation is this:

Jim says something rude to Bob.  Without knowing the whole story, there's two possible reasons for this:

a) Jim is a bully and Bob is a victim.

b) Bob is a bully and Jim is fighting back/ standing up for himself.

&#x200B;

Without wanting to spend the time or effort to get the full story, the probability that Jim is a bully is higher than it was before the incident.  Also the probability that Bob is a bully is higher than it was before.

&#x200B;

Also, I'm not sure who is classifying employees as victims.  If it's an objective measure, that's fine.  But if it's a self-report, that could be a problem with the study.

&#x200B;

In most circumstances managers oversee quite a few different jobs, some of which require in-depth specialization in a skill.  

It's the manager's job to have a broad understanding of each role and have good judgement when executing a company's strategy.  it is impossible for them to have the specialist knowledge of each role.  

This means that a good manager should be using the opinions of those specialists to influence their decisions.  

The person probably wasn't initially a bully when they gained their influence with the manager.  Over the next few months/years they probably provided excellent feedback/advice that paid off.

Then as more time passes, the bully may have personal issues that change their temperament, they may fear a rival whom they would need to share the spotlight with, they might just have a personal dislike to a person.

The bully then uses their relationship to manipulate the perception of the other person.  The manager doesn't know any better since the bully had previously been giving excellent advice.

I've worked in several places where there was an absolute asshole who was ""too important"" to replace.  It's especially common when working in IT.

ei83hj5,t1_ei7hnvc,2019-03-10 19:09:30,science,"As someone who has been on all three sides of this situation I can explain it pretty easily.  Bully behavior is always changing depending on who is in the room.  

When the boss is there the bully is always guiding and helping and positive.  There may be some aggression or snark there but it will be within the boss' acceptable level (sometimes your have to be a little hard but fair is how the boss would justify this behavior).  The goal of the bully here is to make everyone else look a little more incompetent and make the themselves seem a little more competent and in-control.  Note, that this behavior will not look the same to the victim as the victim will have vastly different context and power-dynamics.  

If the bully does this all correctly it will look to the boss like the bully is a little gruff when necessary and the boss will come to ""understand"" why the bully is perceived as a bully by the victim (Heck, the boss has been accused by lazy people they had to fire as well;  Sometimes people just be like that).  The boss will think that the victim is just not a team player and so is receiving this ""mildly caustic"" attitude from the bully.  The boss will think they are finally witnessing the ""bad"" behavior first-hand and will more easily dismiss future complaints as the boss will think they ""understand"" the dynamic going in between the two and will side with the bully.

The victim will see the boss ""witnessing"" the bullying.  To the victim the same behavior the boss is seeing will seem much harsher because of their previous context with the bully.  The victim will think ""the boss sees it now!"". They will get their hopes up.  Later their hopes will be crushed when the boss ""doesn't care"" or says they understand now but they blame the victim.  This will make the bullies position vastly stronger as the victim will feel utterly powerless.  The victim thinks the boss is also a bully or -best yet- think that they deserve the treatment (""maybe I deserve it"" ""there is no help anywhere"" the victim thinks).  The victim will now more easily accept the bullying.  Eventually if the bully is skilled at grooming the victim can become a toadie.  The perfect victim.  Someone who does the bully's bidding (including bullying) and eagerly accepts any time the bully throws them on the fire to take blame or elevate the bully's status.

I can go on and on about this dynamic.  Feel free to ask for clarification or further nuance about anything.

ei87qi9,t1_ei7hnvc,2019-03-10 20:01:50,science,"It's simple, and it corroborates what I have observed in office settings. Typically, bullies will not just go and pick on anyone. They will pick on someone who they know will not retaliate, and will silently bear the brunt. Now, why would anyone silently bear the brunt of a bully? Because they (the silent ones) are not socially adept, and can't think of a good response to bullying. They are not good at the normal things like going and chatting to colleagues for hours together about how cold it was yesterday, or asking everyone including the rat hiding in the desk about ""how was your day"", or attending office parties to get wasted. These people are not socially active because their brain wiring will not let them be socially active. However, humanity being the genius species that it is, will see these people as ""rude"". ""Huh he didn't come over and talk to me for 2 hours about how my babies are doing, and what plants I have in my garden. What a RUDE guy!"" 

These people are seen as ""rude"" regardless of whether a bully picks on them or not. Unfortunately, it just so happens that these guys are also the best people for boosting a bully's self esteem, because he/she can screw them over without fear of retaliation, thus boosting the bully's already massive ego. So the bullies will ALWAYS pick on these guys, and the boss will say - ""oh the RUDE guy is complaining? Must have been the rude guy's fault. Can't be the bully, huh, the bully talked to me yesterday about my golf scores, and saw pictures of my son for 4 hours. He's the best guy on earth! It's the RUDE guy who's in the wrong. Carry on, nothing to see here!""

Unfortunately, there is no solution to this. Humanity is not, and probably never will be, smart enough to understand that not everyone can be a mirror image of themselves, and that brains are wired differently. The only solution at the moment is for the socially inactive ones to suck it up and live with it. It's easier than it appears. As long as you just go about your job and don't try to be ""popular"" when you know you will never be, then you'll be fine. People will keep you around as long as you're doing a good job.

Your best friend or the person they try to hurt? Your best friend will probably spin it to make them look more noble or you get the intentions behind their actions.

Have you ever done something with good intentions, but it came off rude? Or have you ever disliked someone because they came off rude? You justify your actions towards them. If you can’t relate, try to remember someone similar to what I’m talking about. 

So if I bully you for example and I’m friends with the boss, then I can tell the story from my point of view. And guess what? I’m not going to say bad things about myself, I’m going to justify it instead. “Someinfosecguy is so whiny, of course he’s going to say that about me. He says that about everyone. He’s so sensitive, he can’t take a joke, I was only joking.” And I’m already friends with the boss and you’re not, so they’ll believe me. Ive already convinced them that you’re dramatic and you over exaggerate, so you can’t be trusted. 

Do you follow? See how I can use the friendship to my advantage? If you’re friends with someone, you side with them? Think of all the stories your friends have told you about them being victims. You just believe them, even if they were being the ass hole and deserved it. You have no choice because you’re not getting the”other person’s” side of the story.

By the time my friend got back to his office, five minutes later, the group manager had sent a mail TO THE ENTIRE ORG announcing my friend's departure.

Now, that obviously wasn't binding, as he had witnesses to confirm he had not actually quit. But that was the last straw.

The next day she emailed it out to the team, including our VP. Only, it wasn’t the final version (that I wasn’t 100% on anyway) it was another one I’d marked as ‘draft’.

That was not a fun conversation and she tried to blame me and called me out in a meeting later on - even though I had about 6 replies to the email from others pointing out that it was the wrong version and didn’t make sense.

This is someone who has mastered the art of passive-aggressively sabotaging and harassing others while making themselves seem like an innocent victim. 

In one specific instance, I had a young, brash, direct male employee who was being actively-but-covertly sabotaged by a quiet, sweet, shy young woman. She was brilliantly passive-aggressive and could ""play innocent"" in a way that made you feel protective of her. She would cause issues, find a way to get him blamed for it, and then vent to her co-workers and HR.

In that instance, the male employee actually left for another job when it became clear that HR was taking the young lady's side. It wasn't until over a year later that it became apparent to management and HR what this young lady was doing. If the young man had stayed, we almost certainly would have fired him based solely on the word of the young lady and her ""witnesses."" 

We have this stereotype of a bully as this loud obnoxious extrovert who takes out his insecurity on others. But a quiet introvert who just wants to be left alone can be a bully too.

When the staffer accidentally broke a tool, my boss went nuts trying to have me fire him for that one mistake when of course people around the place made costly mistakes all the time without penalty.

""Reclusive"" is seen as ""weak"" and ""Vocal"" is seen as ""strong"" - so evolution will favor the latter (vocal). However, what surprises me is the amount of introverts that have made it so far into humanity's timeline. If you look at it from purely an evolutionary point of view, introverts would have typically been seen as ""not breeding material"", and would have found it extremely hard to find partners to breed with. In simpler terms, the reason girls like ""bad guys"" is not because girls are jerks and the ""bad guys"" are ""bad"", it's just that someone who is more extroverted and vocal is seen to be carrying genes that will ensure a better probability of survival and a good life for the offspring. So, historically, females should have ALWAYS bred with the extroverts / vocal ones. With that being the case, how is it that the proportion of introverts has remained so high, and is actually INCREASING? This goes completely against the laws of evolution. I would be really interested in some study around this. What happened that caused this shift, where more and more introverts are able to find partners, to the extent that they are able to increase their percentage in the population?

One issue here is that a person might be lying or overexaggerating for personal reasons, and with human beings generally being a rather irrational species, it isn't hard to imagine that individuals might abuse a system in which their own subjective perception of an event is valued higher than that of an entire group of individuals.

I am not trying to validate victim blaming here, but at some point you have to ask: ""Why does an individual perceive themselves as a victim?"" and opening a dialogue around that so that everyone is on the same page is way more helpful than to just say ""They are a victim!"" or ""They are not a victim!"", because in a scenario like this the key issue is a miscommunication between two individuals and in the end no one tried to pick on one another just for its own sake.",Voeglein,t2_bdn86,10,0,reddit1

People don't know what label to slap on me - I buck too many stereotypes, so I'm threatening in ways they can't define except to say that I'm ""too weird"", ""stuck up"", etc.  The assumptions people have made about me are often both hilariously incorrect and contradictory.  In reality, I'm pretty private, so all of this is pure conjecture on their part.

I'm in a pretty good workplace at the moment, but I have a new coworker who is engaging in some kind of game or has some agenda and I seem to be the focus. Fortunately, what she's doing is pretty obvious (even to the other new coworkers) and she's really not making herself look good.  She's actually grossly overqualified and the supervisor decided to ""take a chance on her"" for other reasons, so I think odds are good that she'll get pushed into another, more appropriate position ASAP, as she's been checking off a fair number of the ""don't do this when you're new"" rules from [Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/).

ei9bmit,t1_ei8k05v,2019-03-11 05:15:43,science,">>Socialism means at the very least that all work place decisions are made democratically

The problem with this is that you get a suboptimal strategy for handling your business.  Should workers have a say in working conditions, hours, pay etc? Sure.  Should they all be allowed to choose how the company is run completely?  No.  Many of those employees wouldn't understand the consequences of their decisions nor would they know how to make the better choices.  This would lead to companies without a focused plan on how to handle their business.  

>> and that workers are compensated for the full value of their labor. 

Problem with that is, the company does need to make more than it spends.  If it doesn't then it can't expand operations when it needs to or buy new equipment or train new employees or pay for research etc.  

Also properly calculating everyones pay so that they are ""fully compensated"" would be abysmally challenging.  



>>You're also assuming that intelligence is an entirely genetic trait and not at all influenced by environment which is patently false. 


It's not entirely genetic, but that which isn't genetic is learned behavior.  Sad to say but poor people are conditioned to be poor by their parents.  It's part of the cycle of poverty.  You might try to say that society conditions them, but these spending behaviors and temperament are heavily regulated by what their parents do.  


Lastly on socialism:  you say the boss doesn't make the product, the workers do.  Well yes and no.  A lot of planning and money goes into figuring out how to make those products efficiently and effectively.  Usually the people who start a business have risked a lot and worked very hard to get it up and running. Additionally, most businesses are not guaranteed to succeed, most fail.  To discount this as them not making the product isn't being honest.  Without the risk and work of employers most people wouldn't have jobs at all.  It makes sense to compensate people for this.  So having equal income would be terrible for society.  Why would someone take the risk or work harder if they know it won't benefit them in any tangible way?

And there is absolutely no evidence to indicate that intelligence is primarily determined by genetics.

From the National Institutes of Health:

>Researchers have conducted many studies to look for genes that influence intelligence. Many of these studies have focused on similarities and differences in IQ within families, particularly looking at adopted children and twins. These studies suggest that genetic factors underlie about 50 percent of the difference in intelligence among individuals. Other studies have examined variations across the entire genomes of many people (an approach called genome-wide association studies or GWAS) to determine whether any specific areas of the genome are associated with IQ. These studies have not conclusively identified any genes that underlie differences in intelligence. It is likely that a large number of genes are involved, each of which makes only a small contribution to a person’s intelligence.

>Intelligence is also strongly influenced by the environment. Factors related to a child’s home environment and parenting, education and availability of learning resources, and nutrition, among others, all contribute to intelligence. A person’s environment and genes influence each other, and it can be challenging to tease apart the effects of the environment from those of genetics. For example, if a child’s IQ is similar to that of his or her parents, is that similarity due to genetic factors passed down from parent to child, to shared environmental factors, or (most likely) to a combination of both? It is clear that both environmental and genetic factors play a part in determining intelligence.

Generally people who have gone through CBT feel great in the aftermath, but then subsequently decline once it is complete.

gp5rfvv,t3_lud1km,2021-02-28 10:49:01,science,"If depression is making it more difficult for some unemployed people to land a job, one type of therapy may help, research suggests.

In a new study, 41% of unemployed or underemployed people undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) found a new job or went from part- to full-time work by the end of the 16-week treatment for depression.

Those who had a job but found it difficult to focus on and accomplish work tasks because of depression said the treatment helped to significantly reduce these problems.

“For the most part, researchers have focused on showing that therapy relieves symptoms of depression,” said Daniel Strunk, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at The Ohio State University.

“But reducing symptoms isn’t the only goal people have when they start CBT. Many are hoping to find a job or improve their productivity at their current job. Here we found that therapy can help people achieve these goals, as well.”

Many therapists will work on price schedules with you, but that can be difficult if you have trouble asking for help in the first place, to also then ask for financial concessions on top of asking for help.  But you can always renegotiate after some initial meetings so you can get to know each other first.  They will be more compassionate once they know what sort of rocks and hard places you've been stuck between... as opposed to random off the street customer asking for discounts.

But also after a bit of therapy perhaps some crutch expense can be cut back to make up the difference.  Spend less on drinking or weed or whatever other self-soothing hobby and more on the therapy since they somewhat are trying to fix the same thing.  I personally cut back a ton on dabs switched back to flower which not only helped make the therapy more effective but also saved me more expense than the cost of the therapist.

So it may not be affordable if it was completely ineffective, but since it improves you so that you can waste less money (and/or earn more money) then it sort of pays for itself in all the extracurriculars you no longer need to do to cope, or in having more productive use of time rather than constantly feeling useless and unmotivated.",spudz76,t2_wu5vd,35,0,reddit2

There's places to investigate that may not be on your normal radar. Try calling your city's information switchboard (usually 311). Your local Assemblyman's office staff should be able to help- they're there to connect you. A bit further up, your area State Congressperson's office is another place to ask for help. In a perfect world they'd put pressure on your employer to offer insurance- might not hurt to make this known, but you're the priority right now. 

My favorite secret weapon is to find Colleges offering Master's degrees in Marriage and Family Therapy, etc, to their students. These almost ready to be turned-loose adult students need a certain number of counseling hours to get their degrees. Their work is supervised, so you are protected. My experience is that they are eager to help and to use their training. in a lot of ways it's an ideal starting-place for someone new to therapy. The supervision is done via session notes, or camera if you approve (surely varies by State) or audio-only. 

If your employer has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that would be another place to begin at. As others have said, negotiating fees with therapists is a thing. A licensed MFT will likely bill less than a Psychologist. I agree with the post that this can be life-changing.

And eventually if you keep using CBT tools against every time the trauma is triggered, it can begin to break the triggering even without solving the trauma itself (although that is still a form of band-aid at least CBT refills are free once you know the tricks, versus meds, and CBT likely has no negative side effects).",spudz76,t2_wu5vd,2,0,reddit2

n=8000 is just the ones who got placebo or vaccine, the vast majority never got COVID, but they calculate efficacy among the infected. If you use 8000 as sample size, your vaccine efficacy is 1-(8/7992)=99.9% efficacy... (nope)

i agree that n=8000 is large in the sense that more people = more potential infections in shorter period of time and it's n=8000 for adverse effects.

I found it much easier to keep myself going when I’ve got a set schedule and people who have expectations of me who set clear goals that I need to achieve (here is this paper you need to write and you need to write it by x date and time vs the very open ended deadlines of most of adult life where you know you need to get something done “soon” which to me translates to “never”). When you lose that, it’s really hard to seek it out yourself. Also living alone makes it even harder, because it’s super easy to disappear into yourself and shut out everything that could help you since there is no witnesses to say “hey this is a problem”. Then all of a sudden I look around and think “I’m so bad at being an adult! I can’t take care of myself! Everything is broken and I’m broken and it’s all my fault!” But still can’t find the mindset to change it.

For me, it’s the executive functioning and negative self talk that’s my main problem. It’s the sitting around obsessing over everything that I really need to do, and then freaking out about it all and then not doing any of it, which then turns into depression and anxiety. Don’t get me wrong I am FAR from out of the woods on all of this. I only began the medication (Strattera, non-stimulant) a few days ago, but it feels like I’ve been thrown a rope and I’ve just grabbed on and can start climbing out of this hole I’m in. Also vitamin D (which is most likely what’s actually kicking in right now to give me some more positivity to start climbing). I’ve also been told that the medication might not work all the time, or be the right one, and we may need to try different doses or different meds to find the right one that works for me. I started with an SSRI a few months ago and that just made the anxiety way worse actually. So it all depends on you. Which sucks when you just want someone to solve it for you.

I’ve been reading a lot more about ADHD since my counselor said she thought that was what my issue might be, and the more I read about it the more evidence I find that it is indeed my problem, and actually nothing like what I used to think it was. Human beings are incredibly adaptable creatures and so most people that are diagnosed later in life seem to have just been really clever about finding ways to deal with their scattered thinking until one day it all snowballs and falls apart.

Edit- also maybe check out some of the ADHD subreddits. I’ve been on ADHDwomen quite a bit in the last few weeks and there are some really great stories and anecdotes that people post that can help you go “huh yeah that’s me!”",nos4atugoddess,t2_z08eg,2,0,reddit2

Others live paycheck to paycheck cause they don’t get paid enough. I’d put my wage on the fact that people that get paid less have a smaller-to-none amount of rainy day savings.

Also these people that are in lower socioeconomic classes have lower education access / vocational experience and therefore also lesser potential with employers.

Some people have the luxury to choose the job they want to do, others don’t. 

Personally I live in a country where we provide those that want to re-educate themselves a level of support and welfare in addition to having a good backbone of an ok amount for minimum wage. (Definitely many improvements still required but speaking relatively to US policies)

I have the privilege to quit my job and not stress that I don’t have to pay for basic amenities.

I am not OP, but I have been in psychotherapy for years. Psychotherapy can be immensly helpful, if you are motivated enough, find the right therapist and with some luck. For a lot disorders we don't have good treatments yet. Particularly, personality disorders are extremely hard to treat. Or you live in a very dysfunctional environment. Once or twice a week talk-therapy can only do so much when people around you dragging you down 24x7. You have to be realistic what can be achieved with psychotherapy.

>CBT being the only option

My take is CBT is the one that's easy to do experiment and very easy to grasp and on the surface ""it makes sense"". That's why it's being offered as the only option in may instituitions. CBT is defnitely helpful in some cases, but the way CBT is marketed as snake oil for every problem in life is borderline fruad. Moreover, it harms the patient because the patient is ""treatment resistant"". Think about it, it's not that the therapy was not effective, it is YOU, the patient, who is ""resisting"" the treatment.

My own ancedote: I have been in therapy with psychodynamic (modern reincarnation of Fruedian psychoanalysis), attachment based and neuro-science based trauma therapy. It has changed my life. I am glad that I didn't go to a CBT therapist. I have read some CBT books.

Psychedelics aren’t something people can binge on - literally. A very small, minute number of people may have a psychological addiction to use them as a means of escape but I suspect (hard to produce studies when the government makes such things almost impossible to do) that alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, etc which can be abused far more regularly and achieve euphoric highs or a disconnect, would be just as suitable.

Hallucinogens in the HT2A (serotonin) sense just aren’t things that ruin people. There’s a lot of valid talk about drugs that “it’s not the drug, it’s the mental issues” that are probably true for 99% or abusers outside of alcohol, benzos, and the like, but almost impossible for hallucinogens so I’d be cautious that although you were well meaning and logical to imply that “self reporting” is an issue in this specific instance",BooksandBiceps,t2_tu3d2,3,0,reddit3

100% not true.

Look at the native cultures, especially the North American ones. Those societies existed for millennia without overconsuming, they didn't completely deforest their environment, they did not mine mountains out of existence. It wasn't until Europeans came that this destruction began. Most, of not all, native cultures practice being one with the natural environment. They value the environment in a way that respects the natural order, and the systems that support them (all of us, really)

Its a European mindset, specifically the *capitalist* mindset, that drives exploitation. The history of Europe is the history of wealth and power over the masses, of exploitation and annihilation. We aren't *required* to be this way, we allow a few select people to *force* us to be this way. 

Many cultures over thousands of years have lived remarkably simple and balanced lives. It was the Europeans who labeled them savages, it was the Europeans who forced assimilation, it was the pursuit of money and power that decided nature was for the taking instead of something to be respected.

My absenteeism is generally highest when I haven't been able to get out of my own head for a while. 

The truth is, calling into work and taking a day for yourself probably won't fix the problem that made you likely to do so in the first place. At least in my country, most days off aren't likely to be paid, so you are taking a very real tradeoff to do so- a day of sitting alone costs a lot, and doesn't make you hate the job *less*.

Instead, I've noticed that psychedelics in particular make me more sensitive to the nuances and small details about somewhere I spend a lot of time. I'm more likely to seek out a workplace and peer group that's good for me, and to be more confident about stepping away from places and people that dont. These are not characteristics I can't muster well otherwise, for a lot of reasons- so taking these chemicals regularly has measurably improved my ability to advocate for myself and not be passive.

Instead of making me more likely to skip work, they have helped me consciously try to shape my environment in ways that make me less likely to avoid it. If I had to speculate, I'd say this is likely for others as well.

_______________________

>**Insider knowledge**

>For decades, some members of the fossil fuel industry tried to convince the public that a causative link between fossil fuel use and climate warming could not be made because the models used to project warming were too uncertain. Supran et al. show that one of those fossil fuel companies, ExxonMobil, had their own internal models that projected warming trajectories consistent with those forecast by the independent academic and government models. What they understood about climate models thus contradicted what they led the public to believe. —HJS

>**Abstract**

>Climate projections by the fossil fuel industry have never been assessed. On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the “carbon budget” for holding warming below 2°C. On each of these points, however, the company’s public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data.",avogadros_number,t2_bmfil,465,0,reddit4

Dont buy fast fashion, or at least dont throw it away so quickly. And finally dont overuse AC and Heating so much if its cold outside it diesnt have ti be warm onside, it just needs to be a bit cold, if its hot outside it doesnt have to be freezing inside.

Traditional butcheries and fisheries still use waxed paper and it works perfectly fine.


I think that its clear that politicians have no interest to change the law to protect the environment, and lobbyists will just keep doing what they do to avoid it.

It was regurgitation of others work and badly done at best.  It's like a single graph on a page and if being wrong by a large margin  is remarkable then I don't know what would it be called now if it was more accurate. 

Also the theory used to make the predictions has since been corrected with better understanding of how CO2 warms the atmosphere.  So today's understanding of CO2 and warming disproves the science used to make those predictions.

The only remarkable thing here is they copied other people's homework to creat a graph that predicted warming using science that is no longer considered valid, so they guessed correctly there would be warming by using flawed science. 

But if you look at the details it doesn't even match reality.  It's off in several ways.

Also if you had applied a line of best fit at the time to the actual temperature record you would have got a better prediction.

This always baffles me.

>Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn’t just know “something” about global warming decades ago—they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. 

>But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it—including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

[THE MYTH OF THE 1970s GLOBAL COOLING SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26220900)

>Climate science as we know it today did not exist in the 1960s and 1970s. The integrated enterprise embodied in the Nobel Prizewinning work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change existed then as separate threads of research pursued by isolated groups of scientists. Atmospheric chemists and modelers grappled with the measurement of changes in carbon dioxide and atmospheric gases, and the changes in climate that might result. Meanwhile, geologists and paleoclimate researchers tried to understand when Earth slipped into and out of ice ages, and why. An enduring popular myth suggests that in the 1970s the climate science community was predicting “global cooling” and an “imminent” ice age, an observation frequently used by those who would undermine what climate scientists say today about the prospect of global warming. A review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth's climate on human time scales. More importantly than showing the falsehood of the myth, this review describes how scientists of the time built the foundation on which the cohesive enterprise of modern climate science now rests.",avogadros_number,t2_bmfil,28,0,reddit4

There are a number of takes on this, though I am personally in favor of the following argument:

I don't have a choice, and that lack of choice was created by them. I was born into a world that is reliant on fossil fuels for energy. If I want to have any kind of success in this world, I need to use their products. Even if I wanted to move to alternatives in some form or another, they aren't really feasible yet and that's not because of me or demand from the public, but rather their agenda that keeps their products meaningful. They actively fund misinformation campaigns to the public, lobby against laws and regulations, greenwash via R&D but then withhold the patents, etc. 
It wasn't the public that killed the first electric cars, or even began the anti-nuclear rhetoric. You absolutely can blame them.

>It's as simple as that.  A chick in every pot and a car in every garage is simply not possible for most of the world to have.  Ever.

It actually is possible, the problem isn't production, it's humanity, corruption, and logistics. 

First corruption. We are proper bastards, and I'm convinced this is just an inherent trait. I'll explain. Years ago, Haiti had an earthquake that decimated it's local infrastructure. These are people that are poor and what you generally see in those 'donate for the cause' commercials. Problem is, we can give to we're blue in the face, and nothing will change because the ones in power basically took all that money and hired their friends, who then did fuckall with the money. There was no incentive to fix the infra, and we donated a few million to try.

Second humanity, capitalism sucks. In the US, we have an us vs the other mentally.  We want cheap goods, and historically, these cheap goods were made by impoverished people in China, though, now we have to move it elsewhere because China is financially doing better. So we'll move production to Vietnam, Indonesia, etc, until we run out of cheap labor. Though, once we can figure out more and better automation, we can forget people completely as a factory could eventually become 'insert raw materials, take finished product'. And then that's just pure profit for our capitalism gods. We're not too far away from that with developments in AI and robotics being able to perform QC. 

Logistics is the third. We actually produce plenty of food and we have more than enough to go around, but we can't really get them there, and even if we could, we're greedy ducks and why pay for starving Africans when we can just throw it away. Localized production of things with, for example 'smart farms' could actually solve that issue, but everything is dependant on power. 

>There are not enough resources available for them to consume like western consumers do, and even if there were, we could not tolerate the pollution that would come with it.

Part of the problem here is power generation, corruption, and humans again. Nuclear makes this issue moot. Allowing bootstrap technology like coal and oil to take hold is why the pollution would take effect. So, solve those problems by not allowing them to be used and gifting and training 3rd world locations to have nuclear power plants and actually design them to withstand more than just bare minimum. 

The are plenty of resources, the problem is again humanity. Power generation is effectively a solved issue. We have nuclear and solar. Hydro was an option but oops we done fucked that up with plenty of pollution. 

>So there are basically two options.  1) leave the developing world to squalor and death 2) Pull down the global standard of living to a new equilibrium.

Nah, the real trick is actually getting off or collective asses globally and elevate the third world and stop treating other countries like it's not our problem. 

>
>The average western citizen consumes 200 kWh per day of energy.  The average person in the world consumes 50 kWh per day of energy.  If you make it so western people have to consume 1/4 of their previous energy use you are going to send us back to pre-industrial standards of living.

Why do you think we need to dial back energy AT ALL? We actually don't need to. Again, stop using fossil fuels for power generation, and use literally anything modern. Personal vehicle pollution is a fraction of industrial pollution as a whole as well, so that's also not nearly as important. If the US completely dumped CNG, and coal completely for power and switched to current generation nuclear power plants, solar farms, and wind, all of which are existing technologies, then we'd have to do effectively nothing to stop our power usage at all for 3rd world countries.

For transport and industry, ships need to also be beholden to set pollution standards and either upgraded, or decommed if that's impossible. Sorry not sorry.

j469ip2,t1_j462iwo,2023-01-13 13:38:14,science,"Yes, I am aware. I was pointing out that already 72 years prior to Arrhenius' work, the composition of the atmosphere was being hypothesized as an explanation for Earth's climatic conditions. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that Arrhenius first hypothesized the effect of CO2 upon the climate.

Arrhenius reviewed the state of contemporaneous climate science and made the first climate model, which he used to quantify the effect of doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

Before that, in 1856 and 1859, Eunice Foote and John Tyndall independently tested the insulating properties of carbon dioxide (and other gases such as water vapor), and related these properties to changes in Earth's climate. This added the piece of the puzzle of which constituents of the atmosphere affect its temperature.

In her 1856 paper titled ""Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun's Rays"", [Eunice Foote wrote](https://www.davidmorrow.net/eunice-foote):

>""An atmosphere of that gas \[i.e., carbon dioxide\] would give to our earth a high temperature; and **if as some suppose, at one period of its history the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than as present, an increased temperature from its own action as well as from increased weight must have necessarily resulted.**""

John Tyndall's experiments were much more rigorous, producing absorption spectra for CO2. However, his interest lay mainly with the physics and not the climatological implications. But in 1861, he laid out the climatic implications of his findings very clearly:

>""DE SAUSSURE, FOURIER, M. POUILLET, and Mr. HOPEINS regard this interception of the terrestrial rays as exercising the most important influence on climate. Now if, as the above experiments indicate, the chief influence be exercised by the aqueous vapour, every variation of this constituent must produce a change of climate. **Similar remarks would apply to the carbonic acid diffused through the air; while an almost inappreciable admixture of any of the hydrocarbon vapours would produce great effects on the terrestrial rays and produce corresponding changes of climate.** It is not therefore necessary to assume alterations in the density and height of the atmosphere, to account for different amounts of heat being preserved to the earth at different times; **a slight change in its variable constituents would suffice for this.Such changes in fact may have produced all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal.** However this may be, the facts above cited remain; they constitute true causes, the extent alone of the operation remaining doubtful.""

Carbonic acid is a carbon-containing compound which has the chemical formula H2CO3. Solutions of carbon dioxide in water contain small amounts of this compound. Its chemical formula can also be written as OC(OH)2 since there exists one carbon-oxygen double bond in this compound.

H2CO3 can dissolve limestone, which leads to the formation of calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2. This is the reason for many features of limestone, such as stalagmites and stalactites.

Well, not really. We lack sufficient fissile material to power the world, and if you are powering less than half the planet at a time, you cant use nuclear for peak load anyway. 

2021 saw 176,000 TWh of energy used, between biomass, coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, wind, solar, modern biofuels, and ""other renewables"". 

The suggestion to ""just stop using fossil fuels"" is on its own a little funny. Combining it with ""stop using ships"" makes it outright laughable. 

I agree regards the avgas, but if you think personal vehicle pollution is a small enough fraction to ignore, avgas is far smaller again, so why does it rate a mention at all? For what its worth, G100UL is coming to an airport near you. Unless you think jets use leaded avgas? Avgas is not jet fuel. Airliners use Jet A1, or Avtur. Avgas is for aircraft with internal combustion engines. Cessnas, not Boeings. Jets already burn 100% lead-free fuel. In fact, jet aircraft have never used TEL, or any lead additive. The purpose of adding TEL to fuel is to decrease the rate of combustion under high pressure, allowing for higher efficiency power of the engine for a given fuel burn. Jet fuel already has such a high octane rating that this is not needed.",primalbluewolf,t2_eg2d0,1,0,reddit4

While Western consumerism is a large factor when it comes to individual carbon footprint, again, it's nothing compared to industry. Keep in mind that even though people may consume, they don't really have a choice in the matter, and furthermore they don't get to dictate how the resources are extracted or where the goods are made and how they're transported to market. That is ALL industry and has nothing to do with the consumer end.

Let's put your above statement to the test and see how well it holds up...

>"" ... the bottom 50% of the world population emitted 12% of global emissions in 2019, whereas the top 10% emitted 48% of the total. Since 1990, the bottom 50% of the world population has been responsible for only 16% of all emissions growth, whereas the top 1% has been responsible for 23% of the total. While per-capita emissions of the global top 1% increased since 1990, emissions from low- and middle-income groups within rich countries declined... Finally, the bulk of total emissions from the global top 1% of the world population comes from their investments rather than from their consumption."" ([Global carbon inequality over 1990–2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00955-z))

It would appear that your aforementioned claim doesn't hold water. Furthermore, in the study [Assessing U.S. consumers' carbon footprints reveals outsized impact of the top 1%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800922003597?via%3Dihub), that accounts for global supply chains, the authors find:

>"" ... In 2019, we estimate the U.S. top 0.1% had emissions (955 t CO2e) 57× higher than bottom decile U.S. households and 597× higher than an average low-income country household.""

Further noting

>US household emissions for the bottom 99% *declined* by 14-23% from 1996-2019, depending on the decile. Meanwhile, emissions by the top 0.1% *increased* by a staggering 50% to reach ~950 t CO2e (and the next 0.9% increased by 9%)

Again, for the vast majority of individuals such as those in low to middle class, their carbon footprint and consumerism is insignificant. The largest emissions sources are from industry and have very little to do with actual consumerism of the masses, but rather the top 0.1% of the populace.

$3.4 million per year is CHUMP CHANGE when it comes to employment. That figure tells me there is not that much actual time or labour involved here.

I'll use the figures from the article. $20/hr, collectively 466 hrs/day, 21,500 total reddit mods. $20/hr x 466hrs/day x 365 days/year = $3.4m/year, so that checks out.

*Here's what doesn't.* 466 hrs/day x 365 days gives you the total number of hours per year spent moderating reddit, and that's 170,090 hrs. That has to be divided among all those moderators, so 170,090 hrs / 21,500 mods = ~8hrs/mod/year.

In other words, *the average reddit moderator spends 8 hours per year moderating their sub*, which would amount to an average yearly revenue of $160 per mod.

From one of the articles:

> ### Limitations
> 
> Our sample of moderators is not a random sample of the
overall moderator population on Reddit. To access one moderator’s mod logs from a subreddit, Reddit’s API requires
our bot to be granted access to mod logs of all the moderators on the subreddit. As such, it is not realistic to randomly
sample moderators on the site and collect their mod logs, **especially given moderators’ privacy concerns about sharing access to this type of data.** Below, we compared our sample of active moderators with the whole active moderator
population. We found that despite statistically significant
differences in several activity metrics such as daily distinguished comment count, our sample’s means, medians, and
standard deviations do not meaningfully deviate from those
of the whole active moderator population.
> 
> **As mentioned earlier, mod logs do not include all moderator activities.** For example, **replying to moderator mail and
deliberation,** two types of moderation work reported in prior
work (Dosono and Semaan, 2019; Gilbert, 2020) do not appear in mod logs. As a result, our estimate of moderation
duration is designed to be ***a lower bound estimate***. Although
**we provide an underestimate, our work serves as a first step
towards quantifying this labor and paves the way for future
work to comprehensively quantify moderation hours.** 
>
> https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.14528.pdf
>
> (**Bold** emphasis is mine.)

The authors note an important skew based on privacy requirements. The moderators included are those least likely to feel threatened. I would posit that the communities where mods feel most threatened are likely those which require the greatest amount of moderation. Hence this could contribute to a substantial underestimate. The mods may participate in Reddit equally, however they may be doing more work due to the nature of the subreddits. 

Another factor which the authors appear to miss is the time spent _reading_. In many instances, if a mod solely relies on _reports_, then there is a large amount of rule-breaking material which will be missed and which could lead to consequences for a community and/or the moderators. Hence it would be appropriate for the paper to include an estimate based on the total time required _to read all of the comments_, rather than merely the actions used to respond to those comments. 

One can see this described in the methodology:

> 
> ### Estimating Moderation Action Duration
> 
> [...] Mod logs only give information on the end
timestamp of an action. To estimate how many seconds each
action took, we identified “streaks” of actions and calculated
how many seconds have passed between each action and its
prior action. A “streak” of actions is a series of actions taken
sequentially by a subreddit’s moderator. Following prior
work (Geiger and Halfaker, 2013), we capped the interval
between two adjacent actions’ end timestamps at 60 seconds3 or less. Put another way, if 60 seconds have elapsed
between two adjacent actions taken by one moderator, these
two actions will be classified as belonging to two separate
streaks. Because no prior actions exist for isolated actions or
the first action in a streak, we assigned each such action the
median value in how long the corresponding moderator
spent on performing this type of action in general. Finally,
we calculated moderation session duration at the moderator
level by aggregating our dataset.

The time required to read comments is partially convolved in this, but really only the time required to read _rule-breaking comments_, which is again likely skewed by moderators responding to a modqueue report. It's the difference between proactive and reactive moderation, and as far as I can tell, Reddit Inc. effectively requires _active_ moderation. And active moderation tends to require reading or skim-reading every comment.

Incidentally, this is an area where the site admin could help: The ""highlight comments since last visit"" feature exists only for those with premium, however it would be useful for mods within the communities which they moderate. 

Lastly, I know that Reddit Inc has surveyed the moderators on the platform to ask, among other things, how much time they were spending, yet to my knowledge they have not publicly released the results from those surveys. They should do that if they have not.",MurphysLab,t2_4lzos,3,0,reddit1

idm6x7k,t1_idlbv46,2022-06-24 22:08:36,science,"But the average isn't really a meaningful number here, because most moderators are dragging those hours down.

Reddit has a gargantuan amount of tiny pornography subreddits, small hobby subs, meme subs that begin with a particular joke that lasts a while and then die off, and many other sub categories that get very little traffic and don't have much of an advertisement demographic.  
 
The product reddit sells is targeted ads and relevant user data, and those mostly come from the truly big subreddits, which have much more active mods who actually have to curate content. 
  
The subreddit for foraging wild food neither attracts spam bots spreading scams and shady porn sites, or any form of astroturfing, and isn't going to have much in terms of high-profile controversy or illegal activity that would either draw government attention or drive away companies, so at most if a moderator spends a few minutes per year making the users slightly more pleased with the subreddit they're having the impact of getting a few people to maybe spend a few more hours on the website per year, which doesn't have as much of a return as banning the thousands of bots from individuals who haven't paid reddit a single cent who pollute thread with spam about an NFT scam or something of the like. 
 
Realistically, the average moderator isn't really producing much value at all, but the are plenty that are. The thing is, a lot of those probably do get paid in some form or another,  but internet moderator culture is such a mix of petty tyrants within ingroups with clout-obsessed power users coexisting with people who just like having a community of people with similar interests that it's hard to gauge what exactly is going on from the outside.

One needs to read deeper into the papers (there are  two), beyond just the title and the press release. 

The authors note that the time estimate is **""a lower bound estimate""** in the paper:

> **As mentioned earlier, mod logs do not include all moderator activities.** For example, **replying to moderator mail and deliberation,** two types of moderation work reported in prior work (Dosono and Semaan, 2019; Gilbert, 2020) do not appear in mod logs. As a result, our estimate of moderation duration is designed to be **_a lower bound estimate_**. Although **we provide an underestimate, our work serves as a first step towards quantifying this labor and paves the way for future work to comprehensively quantify moderation hours.**

> https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.14528.pdf

The estimate solely revolves around estimates based on mod logs: public ones and others which were privately shared. Hence the estimate largely reflects the amount of time taken to click on the `REMOVE` button (see later in the methods section). 

Those clicks represent a tiny fraction of the time investment. 

Much more time is typically spent with:

- reading comments
- deliberating
- discussing
- replying to modmail

Hence this reflects only a small fraction of the total value of the work performed by many mods.",MurphysLab,t2_4lzos,1,0,reddit1

Whether you're paying someone to conduct original journalism or mop floors, that person needs things like food, shelter, and medical care, so occupying their time ought to cover those costs. It might as well come from the business that's benefiting from the labor rather than government welfare that essentially subsidizes profitable businesses for no reason other than that labor has a stigma of being something that's acceptable to underpay for.

Businesses that rely on valve inlet covers can pay a fair price for them or all the vendors will stop offering them and they won't be available anymore. Businesses that rely on labor can pay a fair price for it... or they can all agree on offering very nearly the same price that just happens to be a ridiculous lowball figure (legal minimum wage), and people will still sell their labor because they need money to live and have to take what they can get. Barring some ridiculous fantasy like businesses owners simply deciding to pay fair wages out of the goodness of their hearts, the two options to push wages higher are increasing minimum wage or forming unions.

idov1q6,t1_idlldhk,2022-06-25 14:25:11,science,"I’m a mod in a sub that deals with a very contentious topic with two strongly opposed “camps”.  Over a decade, the sub has evolved over a dozen specific rules to keep the debate civil and not descending into the usual internet trolling and flame fest.  The rules are basically that you can say anything that doesn’t violate Reddit hate speech rules, but you can’t directly attack or insult the person you’re responding to, including with sarcasm or casual profanity.

I have been active in internet fora going back to Usenet, and am grateful to the Reddit subreddit /mod system for providing a place for serious discussion and engagement on this topic of bitter divide for a century.  The active mods there have created a place where sincere people can talk and trolls get kicked to the curb pretty fast.  

The point I’d like to address is the form of moderation.  We don’t just go around and arbitrarily delete comments and secretly ban users.  We publicly warn rules violators, quoting the offending comment and exactly which rule(s) violated by rule number and often further explanation. We do this to “educate” both the offender **and ** the sub community in general.  We don’t allow OPs on new accounts (<2 mos.) to keep noobs who haven’t participated in comments and general reading of the sub.

I’d say that although we are a small sub (~25,000) with about ten active mods, each of us spends hundreds of hours on the site, mostly reading and participating, but also jumping on rules violations when we see them or when they’re reported by others.  I’d say it approximates 500 hours/yr, judging from my IRL jobs where I’ve been expected to “bill” >1,600 hours/year.",jackl24000,t2_149cn5,1,0,reddit1

Read the article and allow it to fill in your lack of understanding. Here, I'll help by quoting the relevant section:

> ### Statistics about Hourly Rates for Comparable Commercial Content Moderation Service
> 
> To estimate the value of the hours moderators spent on moderation work, we sought to collect statistics about the hourly
“wage” or payment rate for comparable paid work. [...]

> We found 160 commercial content moderators on UpWork by searching for keywords related to content moderation and community management services such as “content
moderation” and “community manager”. We used a new account to minimize personalization in search results. Commercial content moderators’ rates varied widely, from $3/hr
to $160/hr, and have a long-tailed distribution (Median=$10.0/hr, Mean=$14.6/hr, all in USD). Out of the 160
workers, 31 are located in the United States and their median
hourly rate is $20/hr (Mean=$26/hr). The Philippines, where
many U.S.-based social media platforms such as YouTube
and Facebook employ many commercial content moderators,
has the largest number of workers in our dataset, 50, and the
median hourly rate is $6/hr (Mean=10/hr) for this population.

idm54d7,t1_idl2db6,2022-06-24 21:55:38,science,"Gotta keep in mind that a lot of the average redditors don't follow hobby subs or more than the default subs. Hobby subs are typically moderated by a handful of people who haver experience with the hobby and made the sub and were recruited because of their activity in the sub. I personally moderate a sub devoted to growing mushrooms (/r/MushroomGrowers) and basically I got put on because I used to participate on other web forums a lot and I knew the person who made the sub. I volunteered to help moderate the forum because I know that with the topic there can be a lot of spammers and scammers and I don't want something cool to be lost because of bad actors. So I said hey, I'll help moderate that. I still participate on the sub a decent amount, and overall myself and the other mods are very hands off. We have almost 250,000 members on our sub, we might ban 1 maybe 2 people a week, most bans are actually suspensions and only last 1-3 days, and most of them are just from people arguing and being assholes (though we have had to do permanent bans due to things like animal cruelty, repeatedly harassing people, asking for drugs, asking people to break the law, things of that nature). 

&#x200B;

TLDR; the main pages with hundreds and hundreds of subscribers that anyone can input to will probably have the stereotypical asshole mods on a power trip, whereas hobbyist subs are more likely to be ran by hobbyists who are just looking to have a nice place to hang out.",gratefulyme,t2_tx1wf,13,0,reddit1

Programmers don't typically code for free *for* a company, rather it's companies using that free code. I don't think most Reddit moderators either feel that they are moderating *for* Reddit, rather they feel that it is for their community.

The norm for moderators also isn't *necessarily* to work for free. E.g. news medias employ professional moderators, whether inhouse or outsourced. Reddit also has paid admins, though they are more concerned about a higher level than a single subreddit.

Point is - surmising the market value of something is not as easy as looking at the compensations in a single specific context. It's more complex than that. These simplified claims about how salaries and compensation works just mislead people. Other than free work, lots of people also work underpaid, because they are not aware of the actual worth of their labor or because they do not have the means to fight for it.

The limitation wasn't nearly as bad as I thought, because they went for more relevant subreddits, but their methodology was worse* than I assumed, because they only counted the time it takes to do an action that is logged onto the mod logs. 
 
For deleting comments, reading the comment itself takes from a few seconds to a few minutes, but the methodology can't account for that, and they even acknowledge this. 
 
The end result is that the total number of hours of work they've recorded is far too low in the first place, since deleting a comment can't take more than an actual second. 
 
It's the equivalent of counting working hours at a clerical job by the amount of time spent  submitting a document rather than writing it.

You might be modding a small close-knit community of 100-1,000 subscribers with a pretty manageable unpaid volunteer workload to maintain it.

Suddenly you've got 10,000 members and almost nobody is bothering to read the rules or hang around and get a feel for the sub's existing community. 

Even for slower growing subs the workload quickly spirals out of the real of manageable for a single person. You know what's extremely difficult to find? Other people that share the same principles of good moderation that are willing to invest a useful chunk of their time towards moderating a now out-of-control sub.

You're absolutely right.

His comments really shows how out of touch some mods are.

It demonstrates the mentality of mods that are on a power trip.
They lack basic decency/respect for others and happily remove their posts/ban/mute for no justifiable reason or by greatly stretching the sub rules when it suits them.

You try to have a conversation with these people and they have an air of smugness about them and seem offended you would dare to appeal.

Oh no you attempted to appeal a decision I made in a friendly manner? you will be muted!

There are a ton of mods on a power trip and it's provable, some of these are contemptible people but that doesn't mean I'm sending them hate mail or harassing them but it just means they shouldn't be in the position they are in, (a proper reporting process should be in place for mods of default subs, some just don't belong there)

Being able to recognise when someone is being a power hungry jerk and treating people poorly doesn't imply we'd send them hate mail and it's odd he would conflate the two.

> Neutrality doesn't inspire people to insist that mods are ""handing out random bans, and mute people for complaining about it"" or banning people ""for no cognizable reason"" with little to no prompting. 

I mean this is something that actually happens, mods do hand out random bans
they do mute for complaining/asking/inquiring about it,
bans for no cognizable reason or by greatly stretching the rules just for your particular comment (and if they honestly applied that same ruling 99% of their sub would be wiped out)

People have a justifiable reason for holding these beliefs, because it's simply true.

The insistent comes from facts and experience which you gain by actually using the website and encountering these people, hell there are even ""power/super (let me try to mod every sub i can even though I can't reasonable provide anything useful to these communities)"" mods that will try to manipulate the platform for their own advantages.

It's not.

No, I think if women and those who support their rights don't think men deserve them -- **that's** sexist.  I believe in equal rights, and if the only path toward equal rights is for women to lose bonus rights, then so be it.  If you can do the mental gymnastics in your own loosely constructed brain to conclude that a support for equal rights is sexist, then you seek to destroy the meaning of the word itself.

Unless all of the people who use the water supply want to ingest fluoride, water fluoridation is a practice that infringes people's fundamental rights.

The goal of a water supply should be to provide water that is as pure as possible, and to only add things that increase its practical purity: So for instance, if there is a risk of bacterial contamination, it makes sense to add chlorine to remove the bacterial impurity.

I mean, studies have shown that it is healthy to engage in at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, but I would never support a state-mandated program to enforce that.

For starters, it is just looking at data from Sweden. Sweden doesn't add fluoride to their water, so the study assumes the amount of fluoride a population ingests is based upon the (naturally occurring) fluoride concentrations measured at the nearby water treatment center(s). While they did say they adjusted for income differences, I would assume that since the fluoride is naturally occurring it was more ""randomized"".

From the results, it doesn't sound like cognitive ability was increased in populations that had higher fluoride rates. It just says that there wasn't a negative effect to cognitive abilities due to fluoride levels. This counters another study that concluded fluoride ingestion was correlated with a decrease in IQ scores. 

With respect to the positive correlation between increased fluoride ingestion and higher incomes. The real benefits/difference could be seen in lower socio economic demographics.

>To gain a deeper understanding of these assertions, we reviewed the levels of human exposure, as well as results from animal experiments, particularly focusing on developmental toxicity, and the molecular mechanisms by which fluoride can cause adverse effects. Moreover, in vitro studies investigating fluoride in neuronal cells and precursor/stem cells were analyzed, and 23 epidemiological studies published since 2012 were considered. The results show that the margin of exposure (MoE) between no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in animal studies and the current adequate intake (AI) of fluoride (50 µg/kg b.w./day) in humans ranges between 50 and 210, depending on the specific animal experiment used as reference. Even for unusually high fluoride exposure levels, an MoE of at least ten was obtained. Furthermore, concentrations of fluoride in human plasma are much lower than fluoride concentrations, causing effects in cell cultures. **In contrast, 21 of 23 recent epidemiological studies report an association between high fluoride exposure and reduced intelligence. The discrepancy between experimental and epidemiological evidence may be reconciled with deficiencies inherent in most of these epidemiological studies on a putative association between fluoride and intelligence, especially with respect to adequate consideration of potential confounding factors, e.g., socioeconomic status, residence, breast feeding, low birth weight, maternal intelligence, and exposure to other neurotoxic chemicals. In conclusion, based on the totality of currently available scientific evidence, the present review does not support the presumption that fluoride should be assessed as a human developmental neurotoxicant at the current exposure levels in Europe.**",FelixVulgaris,t2_34ivz,1,0,reddit2

>Microbiological analysis of natural mineral water at source has always revealed the presence of some bacteria that are capable of growth and can form colonies on appropriate culture media. After bottling, the number of viable counts increases rapidly, attaining 104–105 CFU ml−1 within 3–7 days [5, 21]. During the following weeks, the bacterial counts decrease slowly or remain fairly constant. At the end of 2 years storage, colony counts are still about 103 CFU ml−1[22]. The heterotrophic bacteria selected during the times are psychrotrophic, because they can grow at temperatures as low as 5°C, and their maximum growth temperature is about 35°C. Furthermore, they do not have growth factor requirements such as vitamins, amino acids or nucleotides and are, therefore, prototrophic, in contrast to auxotrophic bacteria which require many of these growth factors.

>The rapid multiplication of heterotrophic bacteria in flasks containing natural mineral water has been documented by many investigators [7]. However, possible explanation of this phenomenon is under much debate.

Extremely high levels of fluoride are known to cause neurotoxicity in adults, and negative impacts on memory and learning have been reported in rodent studies, but little is known about the substance’s impact on children’s neurodevelopment. In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children. Based on the findings, the authors say that this risk should not be ignored, and that more research on fluoride’s impact on the developing brain is warranted

Keep in mind, that while the food industry often does get their water from a municipal supply, they can also get their water from their own supply (i.e. groundwater well). Large water consumers will also often work with municipalities to 'T' off their main supply line pre-treatment. Even if the water is treated from a municipality and meets drinking water standards before it enters a plant, it can still need further treatment prior to use. Because of this, some facilities will just cut out the middleman, and treat the water themselves. (It really isn't that hard.)

Using municipal water for agricultural purposes is usually limited to just post-harvesting processes (i.e. washing produce, application of waxes, etc.) However, again for large scale operations, they may obtain and treat their own water for these purposes, which is often just disinfection. The volume of water required to irrigate and feed livestock is just too large to make it economically feasible to obtain from a municipal supply post treatment. Plus, most farms and ranches are in the middle of nowhere. They do not have access to the municipal water supply even if they wanted to use it.

>**Looking at the estimates, they are very small and often not statistically significantly different from zero.** Sometimes the estimates are negative and sometimes positive, but they are always close to zero. If we take the largest negative point estimates (−0.0047, col. 1) and the largest standard error for that specification (0.0045), the 95% confidence interval would be −0.014 to 0.004. We may thus rule out negative effects larger than 0.14 standard deviations in cognitive ability if fluoride is increased by 1 milligram/liter (the level often considered when artificially fluoridating the water).

It's important to understand, -0.14 standard deviations on an IQ scale is -2.1 IQ points and +0.04 is +.6 IQ points. The above comments misunderstand what they paper is saying.


They go even further: 
>**However, the effect of fluoride may not be linear. We have therefore run several specifications addressing nonlinearities**, and the results are presented in the appendix. Figure A1 displays the effect for each 0.1 milligram/liter of fluoride, table A5 present results for quartile regressions, table A6 is a dose response analysis, and table A7 is an analysis where we have restricted the sample to 1 milligram/liter or higher. Figure A2 is a spline regression where we have predicted cognitive ability on a set of background characteristics. We then use the ranked predicted values to run regressions with fluoride as the independent variable in a flexible interaction model, where fluoride is interacted with a vector of cubic splines. The spline specification picks up nonlinear treatment heterogeneity over the predicted cognitive ability distribution. **All in all, we conclude that fluoride does not have an effect on cognitive ability in these nonlinear specifications.**

Rather the same Vitamin D added to milk should simply be provided for free in pill form (or whatever is cheapest, I guess).

It seems the guys who did the science think flouride doesn't impair cognitive ability: ""Let us continue to our main results. We begin with cognitive ability for men born between 1985 and 1987. Our conclusion from Table 4 is that fluoride does not affect cognitive ability""

They specifically tried to emphasize that flouride was disentangled from wealth because flouride was not added in swedish water treatment, but that it was only reduced to below 1.5 milligrams/liter to comply with regulations and that flouride was only due to nature.

They think the data points to flouride points to better performance on the job specifically in service sectors offering this possible explanation: "" Interestingly, the effect seems to be relatively large in sectors in which workers have customer contact, where good-looking teeth and good breath is important. This hypothesis originates from Blinder (1974), who provides an early analysis on teeth and income... ...We do not want to stress these results too far given their exploratory nature, but they provide weak indirect evidence that beauty due to dental health may be one salient mechanism.""

You could also read their ""If we take the largest negative point estimates (−0.0047, col. 1) and the largest standard error for that specification (0.0045), the 95% confidence interval would be −0.014 to 0.004. We may thus rule out negative effects larger than 0.14 standard deviations in cognitive ability if fluoride is increased by 1 milligram/liter (the level often considered when artificially fluoridating the water)"" statement as increasing cognitive ability by up to 0.04 standard deviations per 1milligram/liter, but they choose to say that it doesn't have any particularly strong influence on cognitive ability. A standard deviation of IQ is 15 points. Been a while since I took statistics, so this might be the wrong way to do it, but 15 * -0.14 = -2.1 and 15 * -0.05 = -0.75 and 15 * 0.04 = 0.6. So increasing flouride concentration in water by 1milligram/liter could maybe drop your IQ by 2.1 points, or it could drop your IQ by .75 points, or it could have no impact on your IQ, or it could even marginally increase your IQ!

For example, your constant claim that fluoride is medication. That's semantics. Its a naturally occurring mineral that is found in water supplies. But because you label it as medication, it then allows you to evoke an emotional response not only in yourself, but in others that may be reading this. You then dismiss salt as a medication when we could apply the same logic. If salt is added to distilled water, does it then become medication? It also makes you dismiss the notion that perhaps there is optimal levels of fluoride that we should be ingesting in our water supply. 

So we now must discuss if fluoride is forced medication and its implications. Personally, I don't think it matters, but because you give it the title of ""medication"" it does to you. That doesn't change its nature in the slightest and even if in a very technical sense its medication, it can also be other things at the same time. 

When we try to emulate the contents of natural water, is that turning it into medication? Should we treat water at all? Should all treatment of water be devoid of additions, even if those additions reduce pathogens? 

If we dismiss a naturally occurring mineral as medication because our body uses it, then there are implications if we completely write it off as an additive to our water supplies because we now need to ask this question to every additive or treatment.

Do you have an idea of what ideal water for human consumption should contain? Is it just pure H2O? 

Okay.....so we got bogged down in the implications of you getting seriously mad because you decide to call it force medication.

> That's clear in the article.

In regards to thyroid function? 

Sorry if I wasn't clear enough, but I'm referring to the Chinese meta study and cognitive function. Nobody here seems to be in doubt that any mineral in excessive amounts can have health implications. The question is now what are these implications and in what amounts? If we drink too much water we can suffer from numerous negative effects and even die of water intoxication. The optimal of water to inject is not zero.

> why are you just throwing arbitrary questions

I'm not. Again, this paper is based on a meta-study. It doesn't isolate variables or effectively account for other possible contributors. I also question if there might be additional variables in China that we don't experience in the West, for example lax standards in terms of pollution controls. Is it not possible that the poorly treated water in China also might contain other contaminants? 

> and instead try to find errors or fraud,

If I worded my responses poorly before, let me be clear, I'm not implying there are errors or fraud. I'm going off the assumption there was no fraud and that the information is accurate. 

> but then you need to do that for every study you read

I agree. Thats why I also acknowledge that meta-studies that show the opposite also don't isolate variables. Its very possible that your assertion is correct, and that any amount of fluoride will result in cognitive decline, thats very possible. We have numerous meta-studies that don't find this relationship but there could be other factors at play such as improved education or better environmental standards that would more than offset negative effects from fluoride. 

But much like the Chinese study, I would treat these as a starting points for more controlled studies, not as some gospel that I get to pick and choose as my champion in this debate. The reality is, there have been numerous statistical studies done all over the world on fluoride and they show it to be safe. The Chinese study is the outlier.  I'm not dismissing the Chinese study but I think its important to recognize its nature.

> Doesn't medical ethics preclude forced medication of healthy populations?

So this is where we would then get bogged down in semantics again. I don't believe medical doctors are generally employed at water treatment facilities. So its kind of a moot point if you want to argue that its in violation of medical ethics. 

This is more of a question of have far reaching the social contract is that we engage in when voting for our local representatives. I'm sure you can make a good case for government overreact even if fluoride is safe and beneficial in optimal amounts.  

> Shouldn't policy be to err on the side of caution rather than risk poisoning the brains of healthy people to moderately benefit their dental health?

I think this is a very valid point. Not to advocate other meta-studies, but from a policy makers point of view, statistically they see no negative effects like you are claiming after the introduction of fluoridation, and numerous benefits. 

So yeah, I get it, but we can just keep pleading ignorance and say we must always err on the side of caution despite the clear benefits because despite the numerous controlled studies that show no cognitive decline from water fluoridation we can always argue thats not enough proof that its safe. We can apply this same logic for radio communication, electric grids, personal transportation(which can be argued is far more dangerous to cognitive function but we accept these pollutants). 

This now becomes a whole new conversation. I suspect we agree that lead additives to fuel were far worse than fluoride could ever be. What about other industrial pollutants(which also might very well be the reason the Chinese study produces its results and has mixed consistency)? 

At the end of the day, we keep seeing that controlled fluoridation is statistically safe, and the benefits appear to be pareto.",Gardimus,t2_4ai3n,1,0,reddit2

If a genius solves a complex problem with little time and effort, does that make the genius worthless because he didn’t work hard enough?

For example, if you wanted to have a conversation about ice skating, your first could be an intro, like ""I heard you did ice skating in high school. Tell me about that and how it grew (or didn't)."" Then later on one of the questions could be ""So what about stuff you did for ice skating that wasn't directly skating? Maybe you joined a club, or spent time preparing your skates, or taught ice skating to children. Anything that you did in your life that wouldn't be there if ice skating wasn't."" Then maybe your final question is to ask about other things that took up time in their life indirectly.

\-

The reason that this is my preferred way to do interviews is because of a very unique person me and my university hired to basically run our faculty-student association (which handled all the money). This person had a huge issue talking about stuff like ""Name a problem you solved and why it led to your growth"" and whatnot. We were questioning whether he even understood what we were saying.

Later on, we asked better questions, and we found out that this guy jumped from school to school and took the worst schools and fixed them until the students were happy, and then left. He would give every student who asked his personal number and answer 24/7 any texts or calls, and would update students and make a legitimate attempt to fix *every* issue. 

If we had simply asked him what he did in the average day at his previous uni, we would've had a better answer. But if we talked to him casually, we would've said our needs, we would've found out what he did, and we would've found out how our needs were met (if he could meet them). And it would've been a decent interview. We got lucky when we hired him.

In my experience, there is ""success"" that is handed to you by circumstance (being born into a wealthy, well educated family and having all the resources that entails) but almost all self-made success is the result of hard work. The cheesy saying ""99% perspiration"" holds true. Almost any task can be accomplished with hard work: brain surgeons practice for thousands of hours, rocket scientist spend years learning how to do what they do. Although hard work and smarts aren't mutually exclusive, the smartest people I know tend to be a bit lazy and a bit arrogant. When you're designing a spaceship, you want someone who is going to run those numbers 10 times using three different approaches, not some savant who thinks he's too good to do grunt work.

Was there ever a time you disliked or didn't get along with your superior? How did you handle them?

What do you think you contribute most in group projects?

Most important thing in answering these questions is to fully explain yourself. Lots of times people forget minor details because they think what they did was common sense but that's exactly the point. These people don't know you and just want to see that you have some sort of common sense when it comes to behaving in the workplace. Don't sell yourself short because you think its something everyone already does. Because believe me, there are plenty of people out there with zero common sense and you gotta show your potential employer that you're not one of them.

EDIT: Lots of people asking what the correct answers are for these questions. There are lots of correct answers. Interviewers want examples. They want to hear that you actively try to fix things. That you can handle your own and don't need your boss/manager/superior helping you all the time. Don't give rehearsed or generalized answers. They will know.

How is that relevant information for those doing the hiring? Who cares if you ""want the job more""?

EDIT: Based on some of the replies, it seems people are thinking of this as ""wanting the job"" vs. ""not wanting the job"". It isn't binary like that, there is an infinite range of how much someone can want a job. Yes, you want employees to be on the ""want the job"" end of that range, obviously. However, if you have 2 people who want a job, and one of them ""wants it more"", it doesn't matter. Wanting a job more before you have it likely has almost no correlation with how good a fit that person will be.

Sometimes, different questions were being asked at the same time. Like, ""If an African-American customer wanted to buy a computer, would you try to upsell them on a graphics card?""

The honest answer is, I have worked retail before and don't like upselling where it doesn't happen naturally. It would also depend on if the computer already had a decent graphics setup to try to make it saleable in the first place. Granted, that answer probably means I'm not a good fit anyway, versus other people that like/are good at pushing sales for the sake of it, so it makes sense if I get picked over. I just will still keep applying, because I know that if I *were* hired, I'd still be a hard worker. I have a history of it.

Problem is, race has nothing to do with that question for me, but the way it's asked made me feel like they were trying to find out if I'd treat people differently. They could just ask about that directly, but then I considered they might be trying to be subtle so people who are racist don't lie. At the same time it's not being asked in a terribly subtle way so I'm not sure if that's the goal, either.

I know they can't really interview everyone, but it does seem like a case where if I *was* able to be interviewed, it'd be clear without being asked (or if I were directly asked) if I had a problem.

I am not a conflict resolutionist. I am a conflict preventionist. If I notice stark indications that shit may be on the rise, I will promptly address the concern before it hits the fan. To avoid being distracted by information that is irrelevant to the work, I may seek resolution from higher authorities if necessary in maintaining productivity.

>Was there ever a time you disliked or didn't get along with your superior? How did you handle them?

Liking and disliking is irrelevant. I'm not here to make friends; I'm here to create quality products.

>What do you think you contribute most in group projects? 

As a result of a series of traumatic incidences throughout my childhood, I've spent most of my life reclused from society and immersed in the various layers of escapism that only technology and the arts could have provided. Due to this, I have learnt to see the world from more theatrical perspectives than my peers. 

In group projects, my overall sense of direction would be an essential contribution. Few may be intimidated and possibly even dejected by this potential; but I assure you that most will find it inspiring.

If an interviewer just asks ""can you solve problem"" and the candidate says ""yes, I do that all the time"" - that really doesn't give the interviewer anything to go off of.

If the interviewer uses behavioral interview techniques and asks ""tell me about a time when you were able to solve a problem you had in the workplace"" and the candidate has to say ""well I was working on a project to implement a new accounting system, but we were running out of time to configure all of the software and we were going to have to push back the implementation. I was able to work with another leader and find two individuals who had extra time to join our team for two weeks and complete all of the necessary configuration needed and we were able to meet our deadline and roll out a complete system"" - that provides a lot more for the interviewer to go off of.

I know it's an unpopular opinion, especially on Reddit, but HR/Recruiters get a bad rap when it comes to interviewing. Behavioral interviewing is absolutely not about trying to make candidates jump through hoops or us just playing a game with them or just asking stupid questions and we are going to hire whoever we want anyway. It is about trying to get as much valuable information out of candidates to try and see who is the best candidate for the job.

Those that are most capable should be  able to provide real world examples of different situations (not just conflict)

It's not always conflict. Sometimes the most capable workers need leadership, problem solving, systems experience, or any number of other qualities. There are behavioral interview questions for all of those qualities.

It is my job as an interviewer trying to follow behavioral interviewing to try and guide you and help you find a different example that might still work. I would try to guide you a little more with follow up questions. You've never had someone who wasn't pulling their weight at work? What about someone who would try to put work off on others? How about looking back at your time in college, I'm sure there were many group projects - was there any difficult project team members you had to work with?

Hopefully one of my follow-up questions would spark an example and then I would work with more follow-up questions to build a full STAR - finding out what the Situation was and what Task/Action you took to try and make the situation better, and what the end Result was.

It doesn't always work, but with some of that guidance most candidates are able to find examples. And specifically for the ""working with a difficult coworker"" question - there is almost a 0% chance that people don't have a multiple examples for that question.

Behavioral interviewing isn't about making you tell me what kind of color you think you are or having you dance like a monkey. It is simply a way to frame up questions (and follow-up questions) to try and get better, fuller examples out of candidates. 

It is not helpful to me as an interviewer to ask you ""can you work in a team?"" Yes. ""Would you say you are a hard worker?"" Yes. ""Have you used Excel?"" Yes. That all gives me nothing.

Behavioral interviewing is about asking ""tell me about a time when you had to work in a team"", ""when was a time that you had to go above and beyond your normal duties"", ""is there a time that you had to use advanced Excel functions like v-lookups and pivot tables, if so in what way did you use them"". Those behavioral interview questions help me to guide you into giving me a much more useful response with information that allows me to gauge what level of experience you have and hopefully understand if you are being truthful with your experience.

So, if answering interview questions is ""mindless hoops"" then I don't know what candidates are expecting. We are just trying our best to get information out of candidates so we can objectively compare them to each other and hopefully find the best candidate for whatever job is open.

'Effort' and 'Success' are not as generalizeable as you make them out to be.

***

When I go to job interviews, I think of them as a way of finding out whether or not I want to work for the company - just as much as I think of them as a way  for the company to find out whether they want to hire me.

For both these goals, standard behavioral questions and cookie cutter answers accomplish nothing. I don't find out anything concrete about the working climate in the company and the company learns nothing about me, other than if I am good at answering these questions.

Unless it's a job where the specific skill set of making a good impression in difficult situations is an important part of the job (like sales or marketing), this is a waste of time.

It might even detrimental, as it is a great way for the company to end up with someone in the job who will put in effort into making a good impression, but not into doing their job.


People will put effort into their job, because the tasks I get are interesting to them, the results satisfying, the colleagues great, etc.
The same isn't necessarily true for a job interview. Especially people who are good at what their doing and not desperate for getting this particular job will probably not put in too much effort.

***

Also, if the interviewer bores me with standard behavioural questions, it's an indicator to me that they have not put in enough effort into the process of hiring people and makes it harder to me to truly grasp the culture of what I might be getting into.

Answering questions about those skills that are valuable to a specific job in the STAR format is what is valuable (or whatever format - I don't care if you use STAR, CAR, or whatever the heck you want). I just am hoping to get a full response out of a candidate that fully explains the question I am asking you.

If that valuable skill that is important to the job that I am interviewing a candidate for is ""problem solving"" and I ask you ""are you good at problem solving?"" (not a behavioral interview question) and your response is ""yes, I have to solve problems all the time at my job right now"" - that is not helpful at all to me. How do I know if that is true? What types of problems? What is the severity of problems - are you missing stamps to mail something or are you in a factory where machinery is unexpectedly breaking down and you need to fix it?

Now, if I as a more behavioral interview question of ""can you tell me about a time when you had a big issue and had to figure out a solution for it?"" and you say ""well the customer called in frantic on a Monday saying that they didn't get their order of important part that was supposed to be there by 8:00 am and I had to figure out what was going on"". Then we are getting somewhere - you are giving me a real example that we can build off of. I would ask you what action did you take to try and find out what went wrong? When you found out the problem what did you do to try and fix it? Do you think that was the best solution or looking back would you have done something differently? What ended up happening with the shipment - did you get it to them and are they still a customer? This would hopefully help me to get a great example out of you that builds on the truthfulness of your response and gives me more insight into your thought process and how you might handle similar situations in this position you are interviewing for.

Again, I don't care if it is STAR or anything else. I am just trying to get a full of a response (and hopefully honest) that I can so I can objectively look at a number of candidates and see who has demonstrated they have the experience in those skill sets that are most important for the job.

I also think it's good to ask a question back to get conversation moving on the other side and maybe learn something about the prospective employer. So I try to find natural segues for that.

Another opening I look for is opportunities to talk about unique contributions that changed the game somehow. Something with a meta element to show I'm analytical and persistent, and will make them think ""we should grab this guy before someone else does"".

At our company we have a large number of externally-filled positions that come via Indeed. The I would say that is followed up by LinkedIn, campus recruiting and just general jobs posted on university career pages. 

Also, behavioral interviewing isn't a personality test, far from it. It is just a different way to ask interview questions, as well as follow-up interview questions to try and get a full answer from candidates. An answer that can hopefully help to show what a candidate's true experience really is. It is absolutely not about punishing anyone - if anything I would say that our managers would say that it is more work for them, otherwise they could just go with their ""gut feeling"" about candidates or just pick the ones that they thought would be cool to hang out with on their team at work every day. Instead, we try to objectively compare candidates' experience by asking them targeted behavioral interview questions (the same for all candidates interviewing for each position) in order to try and get as much useful information out of them about their past experience. This allows us to compare candidates and their experience objectively. We do the same interview process with internal candidates as well.

I would also like to point out that our recruiting team receives at least a handful of ""personal referrals"" sent directly to us every week that we need to follow up on - I would say at least 80-95% of those are individuals we just have to go through the motions with, but don't ever even end up interviewing. I don't care who you are or if the CEO referred you - if you don't have the right experience for the position then you are not getting past a courtesy phone interview with me. It is my reputation on the line with my hiring managers and I don't want to put a crap candidate in front of them just because someone important referred them.

I will say that networking definitely does have it's benefits - there is no doubt in that, but if you don't have the experience to go along with it then you are out of luck. A contact at a company may help to get your resume in front of the correct person, but after that it is up to you to show you have the experience needed for the position.",Berkster,t2_bhvtj,1,0,reddit3

The candidate doesn't have to jump through hoops or do anything crazy at all - they have to *answer questions*. In an interview. Crazy, huh??

You obviously have been jaded against interviewing, and maybe you have had some poor experiences in the past. That does suck. I have had the pleasure to work with great recruiters and hiring leaders who sincerely care about asking good questions to help them truly learn about candidates in order to find a great employee to join our teams. 

I get that not every company is like that. It doesn't mean people should just think interviewers are just playing games, and it definitely doesn't mean people should think they don't have to prep for interviews. It's as easy as looking at the job description to see what responsibilities/requirements are listed and coming up with some specific  examples from your past that touch on all of those.

For example, I might ask you ""tell me about a time when you were able to creatively solve a problem"" and you give an answer along the lines of ""I once was able to find an extra $1,000 in our budget to allow us to continue working on a project"". Your answer really only sort of touched on the ""A"" of STAR (action). I would ask any number of follow-up questions to get a complete ""STAR"" response and try to get a better understanding of that specific situation. Those questions would probably include most of the following:
* Why did you need the money in the first place? (explain the ""S"" - situation)
* Tell me more about how you were able to find that extra money? (completing the ""A"" - action/why)
* What was the end result of the project? (""R"" - result)
* Is there anything you wish you would have done differently? (seeing how you analyze your actions in retrospect)

Not to be mean, but how? I think one of the biggest problems in interviewing is that there's no way of objectively comparing the effectively of certain methods, because so much is at stake. People interview in a certain way and then hire people. Generally, you can't afford to say: I'm just gonna try this other way of interviewing for a year and then see what gets me the better candidates.

And I never said that standard questions are absolutely useless, just that I genuinely believe that for most positions there are better indicators for how qualified someone is.


>Is it perfect? No. But it does produce interesting results.

I absolutely agree here. But I'll also ask whether you don't actually think that the results are more interesting and more useful when people don't prepare for the questions?

***

Granted, I'm not an interviewer, but I often get to participate in interviews when we're searching someone for my team, and I also had some interviews myself, obviously.

And I always feel like one of the best things to look out for is *flaws*.
In my experience, people with *perfect* results are just people who are good at interviews. They walk in, you talk, they walk out, you're none the wiser.

However, if during the interview, someone admits to having a serious 'problem', it gives all the positive aspects of them much much more weight.

Like if I the applicant outright tells us that they sometimes have trouble to get up on time in the morning, I would likely consider that something positive, unless it's about a job where punctuality is *extremely* important. (And in that case, it probably wouldn't have been the right job for them anyway, so good on them for telling us.) Because it shows me that they're genuine. And it also shows me that they have confidence in themselves to be able to admit to something like that without fearing it destroys their chances to get the job. And it shows me that they value honesty and are not afraid to admit to shortcomings, which are great indicators for people being teamplayers. 

And I'm not talking about these typical weaseling out 'I have weaknesses, too' answers. I'm talking about things that applicants can never be sure that you won't consider a red flag. Things that indicate that they didn't prepare for the interview to make a good impression, but rather believe they're good at what they're doing and want to find out together if those are the skills that are needed in their new position or not.

However sometimes they're necessary simply to meet the expectations of a role. As an example, I was recently on the interview panel for a MRI scanner operator, where there is considerable scope for injury to a member of the public receiving a scan.

It felt almost like a competition between the candidates to mention safety considerations as much as possible, almost as a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling to show they were very much aware of and concerned about these considerations. Trying to distinguish candidates became a matter of hunting through the parts of replies before they became discussion of of how the candidate would tie their laces in a MRI safe fashion.

Yes, in reality anyone at the level we were recruiting at would be aware of the risks and issues involved, but from the panels perspective we'd have been metaphorically shot if we'd recruited a member of staff that was involved in an incident and it later turned out the candidate hadn't bored us to tears about safety during the interview.",total_cynic,t2_gluk1,1,0,reddit3

j9t28pj,t3_11ao9yr,2023-02-24 10:31:26,science,"A new study from Harvard Medical School researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital suggests that men who regularly lift heavy objects at work have higher sperm counts.

The study, published in Human Reproduction, is part of the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) cohort, a clinical study that aims to explore how environmental chemicals and lifestyle choices affect reproductive health.

“We already know that exercise is associated with multiple health benefits in humans, including those observed on reproductive health, but few studies have looked at how occupational factors can contribute to these benefits,” said first author Lidia Mínguez-Alarcón, HMS assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s and a co-investigator of the EARTH study.

“What these new findings suggest is that physical activity during work may also be associated with significant improvement in men’s reproductive potential,” she said.

Infertility is a growing problem that can be caused by a wide variety of complex factors. However, about 40 percent of infertility cases can be traced to male factors, such as sperm count, semen quality, and sexual function.

In particular, sperm count and semen quality are thought to be the major drivers of growing infertility rates among males: A previous analysis led by the EARTH study team found that among men seeking fertility treatment, sperm count and quality declined by as much as 42 percent between 2000 and 2017.

“Further, there is increasing evidence that male infertility is associated with common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disease, highlighting the broader importance of male reproductive health,” said Mínguez-Alarcón.

When i worked in a plant last, the guy on the end of the production line had to stack pallets by hand. They always start guys there because it is totally doable, but 3-4 out of every 5 guys wouldnt make the first day so they would wash out and the idea was that the capable, tougher guys stayed because each guy in the line depended on everyone being a monster to maximize take home pay (paid by weight). So when a little/skinny guy found his way into a spot, he’d either realize he wasn’t built for it or hed bulk up hella fast and tough it out until then.

> _Incredible the authors are so comfortable stating causality with such small sample size, extreme selection bias, and no instrument to control._

**The authors are, in fact, NOT claiming ""causality""**. The authors note that this is *an association* and that it is *significantly more likely* than the *null hypothesis*, which in this case is ""there is no association"": 

> Men had a median (interquartile range) age of 36 (33, 39) years and were predominantly Caucasian (87%). Of the men who completed the survey, 12% reported often lifting or moving heavy objects at work, 6% reported heavy physical exertion at work, and 9% reported evening or rotating shifts. Men who reported often lifting or moving heavy objects at work had 46% higher sperm concentrations (P = 0.01) and 44% higher total counts (P = 0.01) compared with men who reported never lifting or moving heavy objects at work. Similar results were found for men working in rotating shifts compared to those in day shifts, as well as for men involved in heavy levels of physical exertion compared to those with light levels at work. We also found that men involved in heavy/moderate levels of physical exertion at work had higher circulating testosterone concentrations compared to those with lighter exertion (adjusted means of 515 and 427 ng/dl, respectively, P = 0.08), and men who often moved/lifted heavy objects at work had higher estradiol concentrations, compared to those who never did (adjusted means of 36.8 and 27.1 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.07). Men working evening/rotating shifts had 24% higher testosterone (P = 0.04) and 45% higher estradiol concentrations (P = 0.01), compared to men working day shifts. No **associations** were observed for ejaculated volume, total motility, morphologically normal sperm, or serum FSH and LH concentrations.

> ""Occupational factors and markers of testicular function among men attending a fertility center"", Human Reproduction, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dead027 

Additionally, these *associations* are inherently limited to the group being studied. The results *may* also extend to the wider population, but that would _require additional studies_, as is often the case. 

It's also *very important* to study sub-populations. Consider the disparate impact of COVID on the obese, Black people, or on young male athletes. Those are all sub-populations. They may experience _different_ effects or they may experience _enhanced_ effects. It's also worth noting the impact to the sub-population, as it helps medicine or policy to address different groups according to their needs. 

And something which shows up with greater frequency in a given sub-population is helpful, since it might suggest that _more general_ [population studies were underpowered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) and hence _missed_ the effect. A potential example of this is [the AS03 Adjuvanted AH1N1 Vaccine](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033536) which happened to trigger narcolepsy (likely in those with a genetic predisposition), but the link [was only clearly observed in Finnish kids](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/h1n1-2009-pandemic-influenza/studies-confirm-h1n1-vaccine-narcolepsy-link-finnish-kids). The study was a sub-group, but it motivated changes to public health. 

Now, about your other question:

> _What editor was good with publishing this???_

Most *good* biomedical editors would be *""good with publishing this""*. It's an [observational study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study), which is extremely important for studying human health because it offers additional information without significantly impinging on the lives of those humans involved and generally without causing the human subjects to experience increased risk. Observational studies can be limiting, but they are also extremely important because they tell us what is happening ""in the wild"", outside of a controlled setting. 

### Male (in)fertility research needs more research & funding

The context is also important: We lack sufficient data for understanding male fertility in contemporary times. [There has been observed a decreasing trend in recent years in the fertility of men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility_crisis) (and much controversy around the issue!). [The authors of this paper have previously examined the same trend within men at a fertility clinic.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6279498/).  Given that we lack data for male fertility in contemporary times, any properly performed studies of male fertility should be welcomed.

Science also has plenty of investigations examining the link between weight loss and fertility for women, but a relative paucity of such studies focused on men, [as you would see from this 2017 review](https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmx027). Part of the problem is that national research programs tend to fund fewer studies focused on male reproductive health compared to the reproductive health of women:

> **the number of awards for female-based research is generally higher than for the male group (ratio of ∼2:1 in UK, and 1.3:1 in USA)**

> _Research funding for male reproductive health and infertility in the UK and USA [2016 – 2019]_, Human Fertility, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2022.2045521

Before anyone gets conspiratorial, note: The article _""[does] not examine submission numbers, triage, rejection rates, etc. and thus prioritisation of research cannot be assessed.""_ Nonetheless, more research is clearly needed.

### Role of fat and exercise in male fertility

But from the results which we already have, the authors' results fit the the partial pattern we have for the effects of exercise on the health and fertility of men, _e.g._:

Here is the result from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining how weight loss affects 

> The men lost on average 16.5 kg (95% CI: 15.2–17.8) body weight during the low-calorie diet, which increased sperm concentration 1.49-fold (95% CI: 1.18–1.88, P < 0.01) and sperm count 1.41-fold (95% CI: 1.07–1.87, P < 0.01). These improvements were maintained for 52 weeks in men who maintained the weight loss, but not in men who regained weight. Semen volume, sperm motility and motile sperm count did not change.

> Hum Reprod. 2022 Jul; 37(7): 1414–1422. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9247415/

See also this excerpt from a review on the effects of exercise on male fertility, which notes the inherent difficulty:

> It has been suggested that physical inactivity may be associated with reduced semen quality (Stoy et al., 2004) and indeed sedentarism/obesity turned out to be correlated with a lower sperm count (Magnusdottir, Thorsteinsson, Thorsteinsdottir, Heimisdottir, & Olafsdottir, 2005). In addition, television watching appears to be inversely associated with the sperm concentration and total sperm count (Gaskins et al., 2015).
> 
> The association between physical activity and semen quality is not so obvious; this lack of an apparent association may be explained by several potential factors. The results of andrological investigations are difficult to compare due to their heterogeneity. Studies are often conducted on populations that are subfertile or infertile (Gaskins et al., 2014; Wise, Cramer, Hornstein, Ashby, & Missmer, 2011), and doubts are regularly raised about the quality control of semen analysis techniques. In addition, physical activity (as a variable) cannot be easily quantified using the currently available tools.

> Am J Mens Health. 2017 May; 11(3): 654–662. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5675222/

So the present article's results might not be too surprising: physical activity promotes male fertility. Perhaps the surprising thing is that that still applies even among the subfertile male population; there is still a fertility benefit to having a physically engaging occupation, even if you face fertility challenges.

### Closing

I hope that helps alleviate your concerns about the present study. My personal frustration with the article is that it isn't open access. People deserve to know, given that this is government-funded research [according to the study's funding statement acknowledging the NIH & NIEHS](https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/dead027).",MurphysLab,t2_4lzos,18,0,reddit4

The whole point of reading is to accumulate knowledge to some degree. When you read enough within a certain field you start to form your own understanding around the subject and are granted a better ability to discern something more representative of the truth. Maybe we won’t know the absolute truth 100%, but we get ourselves closer and closer only by rigorous and consistent study. I think if you stay online on tiktok you’re bound to end up confused, but in books that are generally years in the making with sometimes decades worth of research behind them you will usually have a more solid foundation to go off of.

In my four years as manager I’ve never had anybody quit because of me until recently. An employee I had to write up for poor performance many times. I worked with her on my own time for hours and hours. We had an entire training package created to help her. (This was a positive that we still use so I am not complaining about that. Just showing the man hours above and beyond I spent with this employee) I allowed her all the flex time she needed to cope with personal issues. I reworked so much of her work I can’t even tell you how many extra hours. No matter what I did, her work was sub par. She ended up quitting because she felt like I was toxic. 

I took what she said to heart and reflected on what she said to see how I could have approached things differently. My issue was giving her too many chances when in reality she was not cut out for the job. That was totally unfair to her. I knew she needed the job. I learned a valuable lesson from this experience. If someone shows right away they aren’t cut out just let them go. Unfair expectations are just that. Not everyone is cut out for every job.

I have a LOT to learn and experience, but What I’ve learned thus far about being both a managee and manager/leader is that in almost all cases, people WANT to do good work. They WANT to be successful. So managing people isn’t about pushing them to do work, it’s about enabling them to do work. 

Their metrics are low? Telling them to work harder isn’t the answer. Figure out what’s going on and remove that roadblock. 

Someone is putting out suboptimal work/breaking things? Hone in on the specifics around it and get them training/shadowing opportunities to learn more about that topic. 

The biggest and most successful thing I’ve found to enable a team is fostering collaboration. I create Teams chats and daily/weekly stand ups to get the team together. Some people have a hard time reaching out for help unless you foster an environment that allows them to easily. If the directive of a (regular, frequent) meeting is “what are you working on and are you struggling with anything”, people are more inclined to speak up than if you just tell people “ask if you need help” for instance. 

My department is HIGHLY metrics driven, but I personally don’t really drive my team towards metrics being the end goal.. I am driven by enabling the people on my team to be efficient and successful and them them drive their own projects. I only use metrics as a tool to see if I need to poke or prod someone to see what’s going on and what I need to help them with. The metrics follow and it gets you a more motivated and happy team in the long run. No body wants to hear how their utilization percentage went down 2% as of last month and they need to figure out why and correct. That’s a great way to demotivate someone, fast.

IMO, these are some of the best ways to develop a healthy professional relationship between a manager and their subordinates.

I say keep your head down and keep churning out whatever you're doing now as clearly it isn't setting off any alarms and your manager is happy with it.  It makes both your jobs easier; let your manager spin the narrative that everything in their department is hunky dory and not in need of review. Once upper management starts to call in consultants to trim the fat, they'll go looking for roles that aren't doing enough and try to change your role or give you a second job to do.  You want to go unnoticed by doing your work well and just never complaining or drawing attention to yourself.  That's my policy, just lay low and hope they don't notice that you aren't drowning in work.  When other co-workers mention being busy just nod and create the illusion that you're also busy.

h1r3sl5,t1_h1q738g,2021-06-14 17:31:07,science,"I think the reality is that many people are bad at their jobs. Or another way to look at it is that few people meet *all* the expectations for a job. Managers come off poorly because they manage many people so they are subject to many different expectations. Few people can live up to all of them at once, so there is no shortage of complaints about their performance, demeanor, competence, compassion, etc. Then look at it from the manager's point of view, they are responsible for not just you, but also the rest of your team. All those people with their complaints. Among all those team members how many live up to the manager's expectations? Given that their job is to basically find and fix fault with employees, managers probably come to feel they can only count on a fraction of team members to give 100% of what they're looking for and develop a dim view of the majority. Again, not because the employees are totally *bad*, but because of unmet expectations. So perhaps a lot of workplace enmity comes  from unreasonable expectations and perspective bias. I expect this to be a fact of life wherever you have ""career"" managers that haven't worked their way up and don't know the reality of the roles they manage.

Therefore the people who would put their success before the company's will be taking credit for other's work, scheduling inordinate amounts of facetime with multiple mentors, maximizing their budget and headcount, and engaging in other sycophant behaviors.

People who put the company's success before their own are usually too busy getting things done to worry about how they look to upper management. There are levels / salary grades that act like a sluice box in the career succession pipelines. Outstanding leaders will commonly get trapped at these levels because they put the company before their career.

It's easy to find these fantastic leaders. Just put the kind of rigor companies usually reserve for finding the party to blame in a failure, into finding the key personel responsible for successes. Also treat risk avoidance as success.

If a bad leader claims responsibility for the hard work of their subordinates where the supervisor's involvement was cursory at best, dig in to find the employees who really sacrificed their time and poured out their energy. You can tell a poor leader by their excessive use of the pronouns 'I' and 'we' when describing accomplishments. Great leaders will praise their best workers by name to their superiors.

It's why middle management tends to perpetually suck. The good ones are promoted on, the good ones that stay behind leave because they can't get promoted on, and the ones left are just garbage. 

If someone has been stagnant within middle management for decades, they're probably not great managers. If they move around and try new things, get different scope or teams, etc, then maybe. If they just love their job and clearly have a passion, then maybe. If they have declined promotions, then maybe.

I don't. I left that job a long time ago because I realized the poor fit you're identitying would eventually grow to be an unbearable stress. Or maybe I left because it already was.

This was not a high-pay environment so essentially any responsible, trainable, trustworthy person would eventually make it into management positions if they wanted to. My role as a manager had more to do with my being trusted with keys and money than to do with my sales numbers. I also managed services more than sales over time.

What's more, I think the kind of training or mentoring you're talking about doesn't necessarily always come from a manager. That's kind of a hierarchical, paternalistic view on work that I don't have.

Technical skills do not equate to management skills, and that's a good thing. Some people are blessed with both, but if you put a management genius in a tech role they are mediocre at, they won't get that promotion to where they would thrive. And if you promote the technical genius, they're no longer delivering their best and are instead struggling to manage while driving off good talent.

Good management is much more than just being a task-master. It's a true skill and much of it is about personality and an innate aptitude (and a LOT of empathy and patience, combined with knowing when to be tough).",PurpleHooloovoo,t2_6fgh4,0,0,reddit1

In fact a lot of what they're doing is coaching players in domain-specific knowledge like teaching them new plays or watching how athletes compete and then giving them tips and guidance and developing training routines to help them improve in specific ways.  That can only be done by someone that has a deep understanding of the subject matter.  The best coaches aren't just going back to the locker room and saying ""alright guys, great work out there, but you need to do a little better, who has some ideas?  Anyone?  Someone tell me you've got an idea for a great play otherwise I've got nothing...""  Coaches are far more than just good with people.  In fact most (I mean maybe all?) world renowned coaches have played the game themselves even if they weren't the best of the best, so they understand the mechanics as well as the people.

> Good management is much more than just being a task-master.

It's also more than just being good with people.  There are mediocre managers on both sides of the fence.  The best managers are the ones that both understand the subject AND understand the people.  Say you're managing a team of engineers, but you have no engineering credentials.  You may be able to mediate interpersonal disputes, but you'll have no idea how to coach a junior employee in engineering-specific tasks or mentor them in where to take their career or how to do something faster or a better way to approach an engineering-specific problem.  You're relying on someone else being there to do the industry/role specific guidance and management and only providing personnel management.  You're barely more than HR at that point, just like the technical person promoted to manager without people skills is barely more than team lead with a bigger paycheck.

Conductors know how to read music, how music should sound, they can hear when an instrument is out of tune, and all of the greatest ones are musicians themselves (usually pianists.)  In other words, they come from a background steeped in the thing they're managing (or conducting in this case) and merge that skill with their leadership skills and charisma etc. to be great at what they do.  They don't have to be a virtuoso in every single instrument, just like managers don't *need* to be the smartest person in the room, but they DO need to come from a background with broad understanding and applied knowledge of the specifics of the thing they're conducting, just like office managers.  

You can lean on your team for highly technical things that are deeper than your understanding goes, but you still have to know enough to be able to tell if they're bullshitting you or not.  Enough to be able to make smart decisions about contentious things and which direction the department should be headed.
