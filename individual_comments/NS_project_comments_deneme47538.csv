**REALITY BLEEDS THROUGH**

Maybe it was the moment I realized our workplace was a runway, a stage set for a performance I never auditioned for. Like that time you suggested, nonchalantly, that my presence could be ""optimized"" if I considered ‚Äúmore professional"" footwear, this unspoken dress code.

And I, in my naivet√©, thought you were merely concerned about brand alignment, not realizing you were endorsing a marathon in stilettos. 

Maybe it was during those endless stairways, where my pain became a background track, the kind you don't even hear half the time. You said something about efficiency, about maximizing client engagement, while my soles screamed in dissent.

""Why must comfort yield to aesthetics?"" I mused, but the question hovered, unvoiced. And I laugh, a sound more bitter than amused, at the irony.

Maybe it was when you equated professionalism with endurance, suggesting that the measure of my commitment was directly proportional to the height of my heels. A ludicrous notion, yet there I was, bleeding for the cause.

Perhaps it was the silent judgment, the unspoken critique when I opted for comfort over couture, only to be met with eyes of disappointment. Maybe you thought I was compromising our brand, not understanding that I was preserving my sanity.

Maybe it was when you discussed ""team dynamics,"" and subtly hinted that my choices were a reflection of my dedication. As if my footwear was a barometer for my ambition. And I, foolishly, wondered if my worth was measured by my ability to conform, to endure silently.

Maybe it was when you couldn't see the absurdity, and I realized that our corporate ladder was less about climbing and more about conforming to an archaic standard of beauty and pain.

Maybe it was the day I saw my own blood as evidence of my compliance, the price of acceptance. 

It hit me, a revelation  in crimson. You and I, we are always going to navigate these corporate battlefields, wearing our scars as badges of honor. I am always going to question the cost of conformity, to challenge the norms that demand our sacrifice.

I've been waiting for a moment of clarity, for the courage to redefine success on my own terms. This world  is always going to push me, to test the limits of my endurance, until every illusion is shattered. Every step I've taken has been a dance with absurdity, a performance I'd never rehearsed but mastered in silence.

And even when aristocracy wore heels, which they started apparently partially because they were associated with masculinity via horseriding, everyone *knew* they were impractical. That was the *point*. It signaled to the world that you didnt have to do any working whatsoever. You could get away with wearing impractical clothing cause you were just that rich and important.

Apparently women started wearing heels as part of an effort to masculinize their outfits. But at a certain point, mens fashion got away from frivolity and started focusing more on practicality, whereas womens fashion leaned *more* into impracticality because... well, patriarchy, I suppose. Women were seen as stupid and emotional and impracticality still had dumb associations with attractiveness, so high heels stayed in womens fashion for a good while longer before phasing out then coming back later.

And as others have mentioned, even in the design of the heels you saw a divergeance for men and women.

Mens heels became blockier and sturdier, whereas womens heels became curvier and pointer, cause I guess blocky means masc and curvy means fem. Men were also not subjected to their shoes being made *narrower* to give the impression of the wearer having tiny feet, which was also seen as attractive on women, stupidly.",Burnerbrrr,t2_dxn2pz0wd,16,0,reddit2

Goalpost moving is often done to avoid tough questions.  Since you dodged the question (as if that would make it all go away), here's your answer:

The National Organization for Women is the largest feminist group on planet earth. Full stop.  Nearly every feminist agenda from #METOO to keeping lifetime alimony has been funded and fought for by the NOW.  

Because of the absolute reach of NOW, the ""No True Scotsman"" argument doesn't apply here. 

NOW has openly and proudly fought against the [recognition of parental alienation syndrome](https://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/the-national-organization-of-women-vs-parental-alienation-the-strange-parallel).  This is something that no only hurts the other parent, but also devastating consequences for the children.   And before the chumps try the next tactic of attacking the source, here it is [in their own fucking words](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/0dab915e/files/uploaded/California-NOW-Family-Court-Report-2002-2.pdf).

Fighting against one parent to alienate (and subsequently harm) the children from the other parent should be a titanium pillar of parental equality. Same with equality measures such as default 50/50 parenting.  [NOW is against that, too](http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2006/0802sacks.html). The red herring is that ""Well some men are baaaaad and should have custody.""  

Sure.  Some women are too.  But even if we stick to men, the courts take these factors into account.   If there is an anomaly, this is addressed. Default shared parenting simply means that the default position is for the child to have equal access to both parents.  

Who spent millions to fight this by influencing judges and politicians to fight or delay shared parenting initiaves (and is still doing so today)?

 Same organization.  

Next direct question to you.  If feminism was about equality, why would this group fight measures for equality? And why don't the feminist icons, supporters, and stalwarts denounce such efforts?  Hell,  even to look askance at the NOW would be a marked improvement for these feminists.  But not even that.  Either tacit approval or complicit silence.",NohoTwoPointOh,t2_2b1m4j1i,4,0,reddit3

I would say that it's because there isn't an equality issue there (maybe other than social stigmas, but thay often goes against both genders)

The problem isn't equal outcome, its equal opportunity. Everyone understands that a gender may naturally lean towards a certain job for whatever reason.. but in the instances of board rooms, it's fairly gender neutral in terms of the people who want to apply.

But I do agree in breaking down gender stereotypical norms. And everyone should be able to apply for whatever job they want without fear of gender being an obstacle

I mean, think of this. All jobs used to be men's jobs right. So when women entered the workplace it was in factories or offices as that's where there was a need for them, or as you say, bealth care because men didnt wanna do it.

yeah, women being immediately dismissed and there not being an investigation is obviously bad but prosecuting and arresting men because a woman has accused them of raping is just ridiculous (i know that you haven't said anything like that, i'm just pointing this out because most feminists want this to happen)

Child support **ISN'T** fair.. because the majority of people paying Child support are men. And, in many cases these men are forced to pay child support without having any legal right to spend time with the child / children they are paying for.

If a man can not pay child support he's called a dead beat and thrown in jail.  
If  a woman can not pay child support she is told she's the true victim here and given support.

Also the system is 100% broken when it will force a boy who was raped by a woman pedophile and went on to have the baby to pay back dated child support as soon as he turns 18.

Let that sink in for a second.. a boy whom was below the age of consent is raped by a woman and instead of getting justice for what happened he is told that the woman is the true victim and he needs to pay child support for a child he was too young to consent to having.

if you murder someone, it's murder no matter who you killed. their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc. doesn't matter. and this applies to every single violent crime and non-violent crime as well. people shouldn't be sentenced less or more depending on the identity of their victims. people should be sentenced based on the crime they commited but anti-discrimination laws make it so that people get sentenced more depending on the identity of their victims and that's absolutely unnececcary in my opinion and prevents equality.",OnThatSigmaGrindset,t2_dtxxqne0,3,0,reddit3

Once the projects wrapped up and we were delegated to work on other stuff, naturally we weren't talking as much. 

Months later I get a disturbing email from an internal investigations group that I was reported for code of conduct violations. I go into the meeting with them completely baffled what it could have been. They tell me who reported and why and drill me as if I'm a monster. After which I sent 55 pages of texts showing how consensual it was. 

Fast-forward to the follow up meeting, I'm completely exonerated once they saw how consensual it really was, and told me she was mad that we weren't talking as much and felt used. 

I was also advised to not do anything that'd appear retaliatory, meaning, I had to keep having ONE ON ONE weekly syncs with this person who tried really hard to get me fired. How fucking uncomfortable. 

A month later she quit. Good riddance!

I'm one of the few lucky ones where an honest investigations group did the right thing, but it could have easily gone the other way.

It‚Äôll end up catching up with them and they‚Äôll end up having to ‚Äúdo a geographic‚Äù to carry on their psychotic ways. It‚Äôs also unfortunate that when the workplace psycho is a woman, they usually get a lot more leeway and can carry on their behaviour for a bit longer

Having said this, your negative experience is not the norm and you need to be careful about how this impacts your life going forward. Whilst I suspect most people will at least know of something like this happening, most workplaces are nothing like this. I work in a department of 12 women and 3 men and it‚Äôs a really great place to work. A nutter will come in every once in a while and they‚Äôre quickly spotted!

Jordan Peterson said something about working in female dominated fields in his GQ interview about how he avoided problems through careful conduct. You don‚Äôt need to go around with a body cam as some have suggested here. Be wary about forming close relationships with people of the opposite sex at work. You should have a better idea of suspicious behaviour in colleagues now. Always try to frame these negative experiences as valuable learning moments in your long and successful life.

I would not leap to broad generalizations based on this one single example. But in the future, maybe be more cautious about immediately developing a close friendship with a work colleague before you know more about their personality and character. And if someone is trying to borrow money after you barely know them, that's usually a big red flag. Even if you didn't meet the person at work.

oh I agree nepotism is a problem, that is a pretty common thing enjoyed by both parties having their children and relatives given big jobs across seas, not uncommon. Does not really affect me or the country. However what does, and people like you never seem to mention is when Kushner can not pass security checks and gets nepotism 20 times that level, and billions from the Saudis, or Ivana and her Chinese millions and copyrights.  Not even remotely close on the same level of harmful nepotism. Thats cool and all you are not American and still giving your opinion, but what is a bigger deal, someone unqualified getting a job that has no affect on your country, OR multiple children getting top clearance jobs that have serious implications on your country and those some half wit shit stain kids cashing out with hundreds of millions of your countries money? answer this please?



> the idea that some random woman can show up with very vague claims

That was a character testimony, for a lifetime position job. She put her life  on the line to do that. She was not random, they went to school together.

The thing you are missing is Kavanagh did the same thing, but even worse. He suggested this was all some mastermind of Hillary Clinton with absolutely no evidence, connection or simple logic to connect.

>I'm not worried about her retaliating, there have been so many complaints about her and she is constantly flirting with myself and others. Everything is recorded. There is enough evidence that I could get her fired for sexual harassment. 

I want you to read very carefully for a minute. If you think the administration is not aware of what this teacher is doing you are dead wrong. By allowing it to happen for as long as the teacher has been doing that class, the school is willfully indifferent. That is implicit support and why willfull indifference is a thing under Title IX.

You say you aren't worried about retaliation but here is the deal. There are many ways a school can fuck with you. The teacher has the backing of the administration if she is getting away with this. Be very careful. When it comes to Title IX issues (which this is) it is like dealing with HR at a company. **Rule of acquisition number 48: The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife.** I have personally been down this road and see some similar mistakes being made here.. This is a topic of study for this professor. If you think that a short email and a quick talk will fix her thinking this way about men you are wrong. She will just do it to another person the next semester at best.

If you are in the USA and *actually* want to do something the *worst* thing to do is tell the administration. It is a conflict of interest for the school to find it discriminates against men. They don't do it. Have you ever read a news story showing a school investigated a professor and found they discriminate against men?

If in the USA you can file federally through OCR for free. I can point you to the website for filing and Title IX legal manual for reference if you choose to. Violation of Title IX is a federal issue. Let the OCR's lawyers represent you rather than hoping the school does the right thing. OCR has binding resolutions that force the school to do substantially more. Once you file, your protection against retaliation goes way up. From what I have read the general idea is that the burden of proof is shifted to the school to show an adverse action was *not* retaliation, rather than you needing to prove it was.

If I was about to, or wanted to file federally the last thing I would do is tip the entire case into their lap by dumping evidence to higher ups hoping the people who support this teacher will suddenly do the right thing. Establishing patterns of discrimination via OCR is useful for people who come after you. Also, more cases like this going to OCR helps set the tone and inform OCR this is a real issue across the country that we care about. OCR looks for case patterns. If we don't file, we arent changing the narrative. Hit me up if you want me to point you in OCR's direction.

Because I believe for example that the societal beliefs around motherhood, having babies by a certain age, staying home to raise children, and the stereotype that women are fragile have led to less women going to school and working. 

As well as the societal beliefs that men should provide, work hard, and financially take care of their family, and the stereotype that men are tough and the shouldn‚Äôt show any emotion have led to men being the majority of the work force and education system.

It's not about woman hating. I'll lay out the issue with the company focusing on the women in the company:

There's nothing wrong with women being engineers and I think you would be hard pressed to find a man that feels they shouldn't be.

There is something wrong with unqualified women being shoehorned into engineering positions due to gender politics.

If, and I said, ""If"", the women were unqualified and shoehorned into their positions (which is possible) then this represents a men's rights issue because they were placed in their position over more qualified men who were discriminated against due to their gender.

What's your point? It *was* a terrible movie, regardless of the gender issue. It doesn't matter what the actors did or didn't say about it, it changed nothing. The movie was bad.

She made the construction of this bridge a gender issue? When? I've seen this claim made twice now, without a single source to back it up.

Because: you want to put your career first, because dating could cause animosity in a workplace where patient's health should be the main focus, etc. Eventually some of them will start to accept your viewpoint even if they don't personally agree with you. And their changed opinions will start to radiate out into the wider workplace. It may take months or years, but stand your ground and they will eventually accept that you have a right to your opinion.

EDIT: another option would be, if your hospital or workplace has a newspaper or newsletter, write an op-ed about dating in the workplace. State why you think dating someone from the workplace is a bad idea (or at least why you think it's a bad idea for you personally and your career), and invite people to offer a response. Make it a human resources issue about workplaces generally, rather than an issue about just one person. Get it out there, get people talking about it.

'Good morning, x.

I hope to be able to speak to you later about a series of incidents involving myself and a coworker. 

The incidents have encroached upon sexual harassment and have resulted in retaliation towards myself from individuals not involved, possibly due to slander. The resulting hostile working environment has heavily weighed on my mental and emotional health, and the severity of the retaliations have only increased in recent days, affecting my ability to provide care and focus on my tasks. 

The seriousness of the incidents, the possible consequences to myself and my career, and the environment in which I now find myself have lead me to schedule a consultation with a lawyer specialising in these cases and to speak about the meeting I am requesting. 

I hope you can empathise with my distress and take steps to assess the situation to figure out what has been said and to whom, and that you won't take this lightly due to the genders.

hyyad2e,t1_hywx6et,2022-03-01 19:50:04,MensRights,"Is it legal to record people without their consent? I did it once as a child and was punished for it and told that it was illegal and could land someone in jail (I was just a child and those idiots overeacted, I had no ill intentions, I just had this little tape recorder and I was recording all kinds of things for fun, like a normal fucking kid does and they lost their shit thinking I was trying to cause trouble, it's fucked up how they deny children their innocence and project all kinds of shit on them, like flipping their shit because a 9 years old girl is having fun playing with her tape recorder or falsely accusing a 5 years old boy of being a sexual predator because he was playing house or doctor when a 5 years doesn't even know what sex is, but it won't stop these crazy folks, especially the radical Left Feminazis, from projecting sexual shit on innocent 5 years old boys and falsely accuse them of being sexual predators or Brock-Turners-in-Training). If it's illegal to record or film people without their consent and he does he, he could go to jail for it.

Someone once said: ""So, if someone recorded you without your consent, it is considered a gross infringement on your privacy, and you can initiate a lawsuit against them. If you win the suit, expect to receive a handsome amount in damages.""

Also even if you can record someone, according to law advice lawyers, you still have to prove in court that the voice on the tape actually belongs to the person you are claiming and not someone impersonating them, show that the recording device you used was capable of making an accurate recording, prove that the recording is a true and accurate representation of the conversation (this is usually an issue when the recording cuts in and out because of, for example, wind blowing through the microphone, which could cause the conversation to lose much of its context), and verify that the recording has not been tampered or altered in any way. 

So you see, recording a cracy married chick who is sexually harassing you is not as simple and easy as some people think it is. He should ask the authorities what is legal and illegal and what measures he can take to legally prove that he's being harassed. The last thing he wants is to go to jail, a lot of men experience prison rape in jail.",312Michelle,t2_2fcotuis,0,0,reddit3

You're likely to get zerged by downvoters just as my remark is above. While I agree with everything you said, that wasn't exactly the concept behind my post.

I was speaking about the fact that feminists decry men who express any sort of preference for any type of woman, and they are attempting to indoctrinate their less radical sisters to that ideology. 

Admittedly, it's an attractive ideology for the lazy, selfish, and entitled women out there. 

Western women already have ALL the cards and all the choices when it comes to child bearing and raising and indeed, whether or not a child is even born. The only choice men have is whether or not to have sex. 

The choices I was talking about though have to do with just not playing the game. Simply avoid women who express current day feminist ideas. Ask them flat-out what they think about things if you need to. 

These feminists do not want men to be entitled to choose a woman that they want to be with because it makes life more difficult for them and it takes power from them. Your power is your ability to choose.

Feminists don't want you to have the choice because it means that when they decide it's time to get a sperm donor and 18 year mealticket, they want to be able to choose from the entirety of the male pool, not just those cucks and stooges that are desperate enough to sleep with them.

Do not be a desperate stooge. Choose women who agree with you, they are out there, I promise you they are!

So, that's is what I meant by having choices. 

The only thing a feminazi hates more than seeing a non-feminazi shacked up with a desirable dude, is a dude who simply doesn't give a fat flying fuck what the feminazi has to say.",CawlinAlcarz,t2_15d22z,2,0,reddit3

Replace feminists with other people, and you've got it right. 

As for the definition of good, it is a largely subjective thing. People aren't taught anymore how to recognize what they want and expect in a relationship, so when the inevitable breakup happens, they just blame the other person and refuse to learn and grow. 

I've accepted that I'm likely going to be single the rest of my life simply because I find myself in an environment where my definition of 'good' simply does not exist in the form of a single woman. Doesn't mean I won't discount the possibility that I'm wrong, just that I've recognized that the traits I'm interested in typically result in a woman marrying young, and staying married.

I don't know how to be encouraging to you in a way that won't sound either patronizing or as if I'm talking past your concerns, so bear with me with what I'm about to say:

You have to put yourself out there and be in a positive and receptive mental state. 

Physical appearance is only reasonably important to women when they are young and even then, a rock star personality can convince them where a Bradd Pitt appearance may not exist. 

I do know that looking back over my life, my best times with women were when I was in the best mental state - when I was happy, outwardly projecting ""good vibes"" (for lack of a better term). I also know that I didn't always project the most positive energy, and it was during those times that I found it hardest to find a date/hookup. 

When I was splashing around confience and positivity, getting laid was like taking candy from grandma.

That is DEFINITELY a thing that you have to ""fake it, til you make it"". 

By that I mean that even if you are not feeling particularly confident or even super positive, you gotta fake it, even if you feel super awkward in doing that. The reason is that you consciously telling yourself to be positive literally changes your brain chemistry (little by little) and makes it easier for you to project that the next time, and it goes on and on like that until you just do it more or less automatically. Fake it til you make it.

Maybe I'm getting caught up in semantics, but I believe that emotional availability isn't what you should try to exhibit, but rather emotional maturity. I wouldn't even try to limit interactions with women with those terms either, as you come off as two-faced if you act differently with men vs women. I've always treated people the same regardless of gender, I've just found that my tendency to be a serious, factual person scares off a lot of people. 

I've always been different from the general population, even growing up. I'm not interesting in lying to myself about how I function, so it's only natural to accept that the odds of finding somebody that accepts me for who I am, reinforces my strengths and helps cover my weaknesses are simply lower than most.

If you have to change yourself in order to suit others just to get a date, those others are not worth your time or energy‚Ä¶ and a massive amount of energy is expended in order to try to fit in. 

I know several people on the spectrum who have not only managed to get dates without having to turn themselves inside out, they even married and had families. Some of those people (myself included) ended up marrying someone else in the spectrum. Some of those people found loving, caring individuals who understood their differences. Some of those people did learn different coping mechanisms so that they did eventually fit into their relationships more easily. 

Whether you‚Äôre neurotypical or diverse, a long term relationship will involve change, it will involve compromise. However you need to find someone willing to accept you for you first, when you‚Äôre actively in a relationship and find that certain behaviour you do annoy your partner, you‚Äôre more likely to actively want to work on changing that behaviour yourself. Many on the spectrum don‚Äôt necessarily notice or realise when their behaviour causes issues. That‚Äôs why communication is important. If your partner of however many years tells you that you leaving the toilet seat up pisses them off, then you need to listen. However, by the same token, if you tell them that their behaviour in leaving their dirty dishes on the table really aggravates you, then they should show you the same respect in working on changing what they‚Äôre doing also.

Honestly, it's the most backwards, anti-feminist thing to do to treat us like poor, incapable ladies who need handouts in order to make it. I know someone who worked in our college admissions office and got to see applicants' test scores, and she noticed a trend where the few females who were getting accepted had a significantly lower bar to pass than male counterparts. Shocking, then, when most of the students who then struggled academically were female. This absolutely does not help against the stereotype of ""underqualified female engineers"" and - in my opinion - almost creates more resentment against women in STEM. I've worked my butt off to get where I am, and I don't want to be given a job just for being a woman and to have male coworkers initially doubt me before they work with me. Too often I've seen underqualified women taking up space that other people have worked hard for and I honestly think it harms BOTH men and women. Ugh.

But, is there any middle ground here? If there was a way, person by person, to evaluate applicants for their experiences and background (socioeconomic, school experience, etc.), is it ever OK to have lower standards for certain people, SOLELY ON THE BASIS of their success considering their struggles?

Let's just say there are two kids, A and B.

Kid A had all the best tutors, teachers, went to a private school, came from a wealthy home, etc.

Kid B did not have any of those things. A crowded, overdunded school, no resources, no money for tutors, etc, but still managed to find success.

If kid B gets within striking distance of Kid A on the metrics of consideration, whatever they are, would it be so wrong to pick B, considering the fact they accomplished so much more with so much less?",confusedbonobo007,t2_16a13r9l,0,0,reddit4

A post about racism in which I said the following:

>Well nearly 1/4 of homeless people are mentally ill. And the rest  probably end up there after a few years on the streets. They probably  end up seething with hatred and resentment. Racism and sexism are easy  tools to use to lash out against ""normal"" members of society. They are  low cost/high impact.

**Follow this format, and do NOT argue with the trespassers:**

1) Identify yourself clearly. Let them know that you work there. Make note of the time and date of the interaction, show the time on your watch.

2) Inform them that they are trespassing on private property and that you would like them to leave.

3) If they refuse to leave, remind them that they are trespassing on private property and that you will call the cops if they don't leave.

4) If they still refuse to leave call the cops. Continue filming until cops arrive. Make note of the time the cops arrive on scene and the officer's names and numbers.

5) Record conversation with police officer and be polite.

I live on property that I own which is right on a riverbank. 20 times a day some group of drunken fucking idiots floating the river decide to use my property as a take-out point (and leave shit loads of trash behind them).

Last year I had enough, So I put an electric fence wire around the property.  Sitting on my deck enjoying sunset one day, a group of stupid drunken women get out of the river, start climbing the bank, and reach out to lift the wire so they could go under.  

I yell out ""that wire is electrified and you're trespassing, I wouldn't touch that if I were you.""  Twat doesn't believe me, grabs the wire, gets about 9 fucks shocked out of her.  Then calls the cops and tries to get me charged with assault.

And yet he's updated things as they've progressed and mentioned calling on powerful prestigious members of the club to aid him, working through indirect channels as well. The response will most likely be very forthcoming under those circumstances.

You should consider talking to your superiors about your ability to record instances of enforcement aka 'doing your job' in the future so that you have this to fall back on in the case of legal matters like this bullshit coming up.  

The signs should then be revised indicating as such that trespassers are recorded/monitored and then the next time something like this arises, record your actions with a camera and immediately let them know they're being recorded before even engaging them.

Any emergency, which may or may not include a crime in progress, such as trespassing, especially after being asked to leave the property, can necessitate a call to 911.

Source: http://www.911.gov/whencall.html

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress

>Important: If you‚Äôre not sure whether the situation is a true emergency, officials recommend calling 911 and letting the call-taker determine whether you need emergency help.

I live in a major US city, and have called 311 to report a break-in from the night before, not even an emergency, and they instructed me to call 911.

Unless you can provide a better source for your claim that 911 is only for **life-threatening** emergencies, you are completely wrong and such information could lead to someone not seeking proper help in the future, for their sakes you should probably correct your statement.

Why not? Didn't they call the police? You would have never even met the two police officers if the trespassers had not been there in the first place.

I'd file charges on the females first then file the complaint on the officers second. While the police officers were obviously biased, they were just doing their job, albeit very poorly.

But if that cashier was accosted by a black guy both times, posted about both incidents in great detail online, explicitly stated that he's biased against blacks because of previous incidents: ""I don't trust any (blacks) I haven't had a long term relationship with"", and makes very dramatic gestures both times?

A few years ago a friend of mine called the fire department because his next door Mexican neighbors  where burning trash during very high winds.  The fire department came rushing out and saw that it was a Mexican family burning the trash.  They didn't even bother talking to the Mexican family, they came over and called my friend a racist bastard.  I'm assuming they would have ticketed them if they'd been middle class whites, but I don't know for sure.

Can you support this with any sources? Where does it say that those are the crimes they are talking about?

It is extremely clear what they mean

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:A fire, A crime, especially if in progress, A car crash, especially if someone is injured, A medical emergency, such as someone who is unconscious, gasping for air or not breathing, experiencing an allergic reaction, having chest pain, having uncontrollable bleeding, or any other symptoms that require immediate medical attention

The website didn't take the time to explain the difference between crimes in progress for which you should call 911 and crimes for which you should call the local number. Could you provide a source for this distinction? I've always been instructed to call 911 by a local precinct when it has to do with a previous crime or one in progress, no matter how minor, which is anecdotal so it doesn't count as a source really, just my own experience, but the website I provided seems to support that.

Do you have a source for your claims, because all you are doing is restating your original claim, and backing it up by saying you were a first responder at a pool and therefore are authoritative on what necessitates a call to police (but you still don't have a source, photo of your training manual on concerning what to call 911 for maybe?), which isn't a source, I'm not going to just take your word on it, because I was a 911 responder for 20 years (I wasn't but I hope you get my point, without a source, everyone is full of shit on the internet). According to you, trespassing by females is not something that requires a 911 call. Do you think the 911 call the girls made was acceptable? Do you think in this situation the police should not be involved at all?

>Some boy in an adult's body who's intimidated by girls sunbathing where they aren't supposed to isn't an emergency. As a general rule of thumb, if it's fitting to go tattle on the girls to their parents then it's not appropriate to call 911 to report something.

Why does the fact that he is a man and they are women matter? Furthermore implying that he is an intimidated man-boy is really just attempting to shame him for doing his duties as a caretaker. Neither of these things are relevant to the discussion.

The **government website specifically on the topic of which occasions necessitate 911 calls** I provided is very clear that a crime in progress constitutes an emergency for which you should call 911.

>An emergency is any situation that requires immediate assistance from the police, fire department or ambulance. Examples include:...A crime, especially if in progress...

Now this last bit was a little rude

>If you are that much of a bitch, keep the local police department's number in your phone or call the operater at 0 and ask to be redirected. But don't trust me, I was just a certified first responder for 4 years at a swimming pool and taught how to deal with crime (call police directly) versus medical emergencies (call 911)

Oh, you worked at a pool, so you still have no source for your claim.

Anyways what is a bitch? Please tell me. Is it a person who won't ""man up"" and solve his own crimes? A boy in an adult's body who calls the police to solve his crime-related problems? Ironically, that's exactly what the girls in this case did, a man told them they were trespassing and told them to leave, and they called the cops. Was their well-being in immediate danger because he is a man and they are women? You seem to be implying that him being male means that he has no reason to call the police if females are committing crimes.

**TLDR** I provided a pretty clear source, all you did was say I cherrypicked it and said you were a pool first responder for 4 years and are therefore qualified to counter that very clear wording on the website. **http://www.911.gov/whencall.html**

Please provide a source for your claim that **crimes in progress such as the one witnessed by the OP do not necessitate 911 calls and do not constitute emergencies, only ""real"" emergencies like the ones you listed do.**

Furthermore, I'm being reasonable and not advocating calling 911 at every opportunity, that's an obvious straw man of the argument I am presenting, verbal warnings and explanations can go a long way to remedy these situations, but when that doesn't work, what is the recourse you suggest someone like the OP take?",,,3,0,reddit1

She calls the cops after letting me in.  I see car in driveway and go out, they're already talking.  One of the cops walks up to me and starts lecturing me about harassing a tenant.

Separating the two parties until it was determined who had a right to be there & who was telling the truth was what they chose to do. Yes they could of just checked his ID but that doesn't mean he wasn't harassing the girls. It does seem extreme to me to cuff him and put him in the car but I wasn't there.

In my state 3rd degree trespassing (since they didn't enter a structure) is a class 3 misdemeanor (not a 'petty' offense) good for up to 30 days.

The bolded part.

If they had asked for ID, seen that according to his ID he lived there, and then chosen not to detain him, that would be a reasonable course of action.  OP *did* say that they confiscated his wallet, so we know he had his wallet on him.  Presumably it had ID in it.  They had talked to each group of people individually before conferring and locking him up.  There was certainly time to ask for ID proving the guy lived there.

If a female burglar breaks into my house, and cuts herself on the glass of a broken window, then calls 911 to charge me with assault when I catch her... shouldn't the cops ask me for my ID to when I say I live here, and the person is a burglar?

Further, they did not arrest the women for trespassing, or even ask the OP if he wanted them arrested for trespassing, when it's his job to enforce the no-trespassing rule.

[arrest](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrest)

""to cause to stop,"" also ""to detain legally,"" late 14c., from Old French arester ""to stay, stop"" (Modern French arr√™ter), from Vulgar Latin *arrestare (source of Italian arrestare, Spanish and Portuguese arrestar), from Latin ad- ""to"" (see ad-) + restare ""to stop, remain behind, stay back"" (see rest (n.2)). Figurative sense of ""to catch and hold"" (the attention, etc.) is from 1814.

-----

DerpaNerb's use of the word was appropriate, and your ""correction"" is out of place.

The arbitrary distinction between ""arrest"" and ""detain"" came into being well after the constitution and the bill of rights were codified.  This distinction came into effect as a way to arbitrarily grant the police more power.

If you use the meaning of the word ""arrest"" that was in use at the time that the constitution and bill of rights were ratified, then the original poster (OP) was *indeed* ""arrested"" without a warrant or probable cause.  As such, his rights were violated.

If you are not using it within the confines of the law (as seen here) you will be charged.  Possibly with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

2) It is not legal in Texas.  Texas Penal Code section 9.42 requires ""the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.""  This situation fails that test when the threat is bikini-clad girls.  Pretty epically.

Firstly, you have much less protection on your property compared to within your home.  Secondly, police can enter a property in hot pursuit of a criminal ie. *you* after assault with a deadly weapon.  Or they just take witness statements along with your carry license for corroboration and get a warrant.  If you don't have a license, all the better!  They now have reason to suspect material evidence is being destroyed and can execute a search without a warrant at all.

See how you're now trying to find justification to shoot a couple of teenagers?  Grow up and behave like a reasonable member of society.

It is unlawful for a person to knowingly make to a law enforcement agency of either this state or a political subdivision of this state a false, fraudulent or unfounded report or statement or to knowingly misrepresent a fact for the purpose of interfering with the orderly operation of a law enforcement agency or misleading a peace officer.

Rape, sexual assault, threats of same, which the girls also cried, are definitely greater in magnitude than trespassing so yes, they should investigate that claim first, if there must be a choice between the two.

However, when the cops separate the two sides, it's to get their stories separately.  The OP said that's what they were doing.  That's a part of their job.

However, when you can verify a part of that story with a 15 second check, that too is a part of the job.  Then she'd know he was telling the truth about living there, which means his story has more evidence than that of the girls.

> This means detaining the alleged harasser.

Telling him ""don't leave, stay over there away from the girls, we're watching you"" style detaining?  That's debatable, but I'm not going to make an issue of it.  However if they should have detained him that way, then they should have detained the girls the same way.

Until they have probable cause of, or witness threatening or violent behavior, cuffs or back of the car are inappropriate.

A terry stop is a type of seizure.  A legal detention is a type of seizure.  An arrest is a type of seizure.  To effectuate a terry stop, you only need to have reason to believe a crime may be afoot.  A detention can be used where further investigation needs to be conducted and is to be limited to what is needed to do that investigation and to protect the officer.  An arrest is where the detention has become more than a minor inconvenience.  The division between these three things is not always easy to make but this sounded like a detention to me.

It says right there that no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, and that they shall name the person or things to be siezed.

If you can sieze a person without a warrant, then why, praytell, is there cause for such a warrant?

And seizing a man without probable cause that he's done something wrong *is* unreasonable.

The natural course of government is to extend itself by bites and nibbles.  The government says ""this is right and propper"", and over time, it convinces people that ""well if the government says it is so, it must be so"".

I have to disagree here with that being even remotely ""good"".  If warrants are never needed, then it'd be pretty idiotic to include any requirements on getting them, now wouldn't it?  The section passage is there for a reason.  If the passage is there for a reason, it affects the rest of that ammendment.

The fact that there are requirements on warrants for searches and seizures, in a passage devoted to protecting the people against searches and siezures, means that they *are* necessary.

That there is nothing specifically allowing for searches and siezures without warrants, then, means that warrants are required for *all* searches and siezures.

This differs from vetting, as vetting implies no foresight was done before applying (more shotgun approach than sniper approach).

The analysis also stops prematurely. Why do women vet more? Is it luxury? Is it a better strategy? Does the vetting of roles play into satisfaction later down the line?

As for personal opinion: things are currently happening in the labor force and company cultures which are severely detrimental to men, and result in women being picked excessively. The obvious one is gender quota. Less obvious is the desired set of skills which has changed over the last few generations: we've become increasingly noisier, more white collar and more ""design by committee"" than before.

But literally since the creation of this account, you have used it *exclusively* to post about situations that vilify men. Literally almost every single one of your posts and comments are about how men are sexist or arguing against the idea that men aren't sexist.


To me, or anyone else for that matter, it's clear that this account was not made with the idea of equally representing both sex's. In fact, I would go as far as to guess that your username is a nod to the notion that it's obvious that more men are sexist or bad in some way than not.


If we were in front of an omnipotent being and rendered incapable of lieing, I would bet my soul that deep inside you, you absolutely believe that men as a whole are inferior to women. You will never admit that you think most men are shit out loud, you'll vehemently deny it in fact.. Your crusade against sexism would have a lot less wind in their sails being so blatantly sexist yourself.. But from the limited bits I've read from you, it's almost undeniable. 


Just the way you talk, I can't literally feel the disdain *radiating* off of your singularly sided words. **MEN ARE NOT BETTER THAN WOMEN** . I bet when you read that line (that absolutely true line) you get a feeling like, ""Damn right"", and as should you. Conversely I can't imagine that **WOMAN ARE NOT BETTER THAN MEN** , an equally correct statement, gives you the same feeling. 


Look, I'll never agree with any ist or ism, for or from either side. You're allowed to have your biased (right or wrong) but it's important that you're able to recognize that no one sex, race or anything is better or worse than the other on the whole. There are just as many fucking deplorable, disgusting women in this world as there are men. There are also just as many good on both sides. 


When you start believing that one group of people are inherently worse than another (be it sex, race, orientation, anything), *that* is when you've begun to cross the threshold of becoming what you claim to be arguing against.

Remember recognition is not done on a per employer basis but on a per site basis, so if you can get 50% of the staff on a single site to join up, the union can force recognition on that site.

That aside, even an unrecognised union can represent you in grievance (or disciplinary for that matter) so you can raise an equality grievance with full representation whether your employer likes it or not. Let me guess, HR hasn't got round to mentioning any of these employment rights to you yet? What a surprise.

Now, that's very much  a 'good one' I believe. Of course if you don't like the collective approach you can continue to handle it alone. I hope that's going well for you.

Still, being serious, I've seen some good union protests on YouTube from the US. I can't believe in a country so keen on litigation, that workers can't use their money collectively to hire lawyers. Why haven't the lawyers done something about it? It's not like them to sit on their collective thumbs whilst money's going begging.

At will employment is difficult, but I would think that would encourage trade union activism. After all, if you've been kicked out there's nothing to lose by grabbing a placard and protesting it.

Not exactly a nuanced position. 

While I agree that feminists are often not comfortable with male behavior, this goes beyond that. Often there are masculine comfort zones and feminine comfort zones and the two are not always compatible. Sometimes the right solution is to find a compromise depending on the environment, something rather neutral. 

While radical feminists often want to feminize everyone's behavior, there are also people who want to masculinize everything as well.

Counter-point. What your mother is describing is that men, and male behavior, has the privilege of being ""normal"". Yes, men act a certain way, but is that the only way people should act towards one and other? If you want to change the models of behavior or challenge them, they have the advantage simply by virtue of the fact that they're 'normal' and whatever you're suggesting isn't. 

Here's an analogy via race - I'm white, and whiteness has the privilege of being 'normal'. I'll never be called an ""American of European decent"", whereas others are labeled ""Asian American"", ""African American"", and so on. 

You mother speaks of women wanting power. I agree, they do. They want the power to create their own models of behavior and not have the model that's ""normal for men"" imposed upon them.

Mainstream feminism takes legitimate contention with the issues of casual misogyny, victim-blaming in rape cases, the difficulties of prosecuting rape, so-called slut-shaming, abortion and contraception, and this, again, totally fails to address how feminism falls short in these ways.
This does, however, attack radical feminism to a reasonably thorough extent, where the difference between mainstream and radical feminism tends to be that radical demands far stricter guidelines be followed when men interact with women socially or physically.
This isn't a game where two teams battle to see who wins, to see who will come through with the best platform and take control of gender issues. We're dealing with an ideological forum wherein the components of every view must be evaluated individually and where each individual should press for each of those best ones to be normalized or institutionalized. Feminism is universally bad to the same extent that the MRM is universally bad; neither is universally bad. You can't and shouldn't try to defeat feminism in its entirety, only in portions.

Sometimes, though not nearly as often as is claimed of course, it *is* specifically disrespectful when aimed at a woman. Just like how men often face gender-based discrimination when it comes to childcare, which is very unfair.

There's also a difference between equal teasing, and the sexual note that is often added in for women.

First off, you are right.  Part of the problem is that those particular women you describe are selfish and want special treatment, like you said.  But here is another problem I often see: many men don't treat other men very well.  They allow themselves to get caught up in the ""man up and don't be such a pussy"" gender expectations.  They *enforce* those expectations on each other over and over and over.  I have seen so much male on male verbal and physical abuse in the name of brotherhood, and sometimes I think it can be very damaging.  

You say that feminists looking for equal treatment don't have thick enough skins to handle what the men dish out.  But I say that *nobody* should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

I really don't see how sex based jokes do this.  You can make jokes about people either fitting into or not fitting into gender roles.  My friends and I sometimes play up being masculine jock roles as a joke, and sometimes play up the clueless nerd roles.  Neither of these activities influences our behaviour towards either extreme.  

> ""Why don't you leave that for the men to handle, sweetheart"" is not--it's implying that they don't think you can do something because you're a woman. 

Yes, it is.  But we don't need to prevent people from saying this.  If a woman replies to the above comment with another aggressively joking comment, like ""Actually, I better do it because knowing you guys you will probably get bored and wander off halfway through"" or something to that effect will do much more for gender equality and the woman being accepted than complaining about sexism ever will.

>There's also a difference between equal teasing, and the sexual note that is often added in for women.   Men don't treat each other as sex objects in typical relations, so when that component is added in for how they treat women, then the women do have a basis to complain about inequal treatment.

Yes, there are going to be some differences in behaviour because of sexual attraction, and that is to a certain extent unavoidable.  Straight men do often joke about being gay (not in a derogatory way), so I don't really see why any sexual comments should be off limits.  I also don't see that it makes that much of a difference what the subject of the teasing is.  

I think what is really going on when women complain about sexual teasing is the idea that women need to be protected from male sexuality is being expressed.  Men are more attracted to physical appearance, and may find you attractive even if you don't want to be in a relationship with them.  Deal with it.

I didn't say that women get better treatment,  I said that they get special treatment.  Personally, I highly value the ability to say what I want without worrying about other's feelings, and I value the truthfulness that I expect from other guys.  I also value the fact that my male friends will call me out if I am being dumb, or whining. 

Yes, sometimes men are jerks. But I prefer to have conflicts out in the open rather than behind others backs.  And yes, men should moderate their aggression, if someone is really in a bad way you should let up or give them good advice and help.  But the standard 'guy' way of treating people is not bad, and I prefer it to pussyfooting around others feelings.

>But I say that nobody should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

What you are offended by often has more to do with your own insecurities than what is actually said or the intent behind what is said.  I think that there is really no reason to get offended by what people say about you in many cases.  If you are comfortable with yourself things shouldn't bother you.  We as a society should be encouraging people to be comfortable with themselves instead of trying to control what everyone says.

>This is a problem with our entire society, I think. Men and women alike should stop buying into traditional gender roles and pushing them on themselves and each other.

I don't think it necessarily is.  I don't mind a certain amount of verbal aggressiveness among my friends, and I think many men feel the same way.  If it is true that most men feel this way, the attitude that men shouldn't say the things they say is anti-male.

> First off, you are right. Part of the problem is that those particular women you describe are selfish and want special treatment, like you said. But here is another problem I often see: many men don't treat other men very well. They allow themselves to get caught up in the ""man up and don't be such a pussy"" gender expectations. They enforce those expectations on each other over and over and over. I have seen so much male on male verbal and physical abuse in the name of brotherhood, and sometimes I think it can be very damaging. 

**So, to summarize**: 

...You're suggesting that we strip men of the masculine behaviour that makes them men, and to 'improve' them so that women get treated nicer? 

Gee, that sounds realistic.

> You say that feminists looking for equal treatment don't have thick enough skins to handle what the men dish out. But I say that nobody should be expected to have such a thick skin, not even the fellow men.

Your entitled views are *exactly* the kind that OP's mother is voicing against. 

Since you're not in a role where you have to face hard, exacting situations and tough people on a daily basis, it's easy to form the impression that no one ""should"" or ""should not"" be expected to have thick skin, but sometimes it's necessary for what a person has to do in life. Especially for the kind of stuff that men, who traditionally are the ones who handle rougher lines of work, have to face. 

Salespeople, politicians, policemen, etc -- you think they can do their jobs if they were all soft and expecting other people to be nice to them? If you want to join a certain sort of league, you toughen up to make yourself an equal and competent member of said league, especially if you want to do your job right and be treated as as equal. 

Your gender *does not* hand you a right to be treated as an equal; it is your competency, and your abilities, that do. And you are especially not, and will never be, an 'equal' so long as you expect others to give you special treatment in handling a job, just because you're a woman, and especially when others doing said job aren't give any special treatment as well. 

> This is a problem with our entire society, I think. Men and women alike should stop buying into traditional gender roles and pushing them on themselves and each other.

Stop buying into traditional gender roles? How silly. The only reason why society works is because each gender has something to contribute towards society -- and feminists have been instrumental in trying to destroy this relationship since they first got vocal enough to do so -- which is why our society is messed up as it now is. 

Not buying into gender roles will *not* remedy issues of equality; it'll only make the situation worse. Men will always be men and women will always be women. ",rabaraba,t2_64ixo,-4,0,reddit3

I do take the point others have made that the jobs in which one is likely to get actually *killed* are male-dominated.

OTOH, the guys working in a lot of the unsafe jobs get a premium in wages for the risks they take (not so much field workers spraying pesticides, but they're a marginal case in America). If you are willing to go down into that mine, you are going to make more money than your qualifications would get you in a safer job.

With that out of the way, my point was that the scenario described in the topic is the very definition of equality, no-one is being treated differently because of their gender. It happens to be in this case, what we would traditionally label as a 'masculine' environment, but there seems to be no implication that anyone is forced in to behaving in a particular way. The problem that exists with some parts of 'feminist' ideology, is that it would disregard how people felt about being in that environment, and focus on the idea that it happens to be 'masculine', meaning somehow wrong or discriminatory. And to extend that further, the same parts of 'feminist' ideology seem to think it's ok to tell men and women that they are wrong to behave in a certain way. The simple distinction I guess that I always draw from this is that (broadly) everyone should behave the way they choose to behave (within the law), but the moment they tell someone else that they shouldn't behave in the way they choose to behave, there is a problem, and when it is done on a basis of ill thought out generalisations to a group of people, it's even worse. You seem to be questioning the right of a group of people to behave in the way they choose, because it happens to be labelled as 'male behaviour'.

Maybe it's just a cultural thing though, because as a European, I can't seem to relate at all to this view that is often put forward about how men and women behave towards each other, and rarely see in day to day life the sort of imposition that may be far more common in America (only perhaps in Politics does it seem to ring true at all).

if you're male. Hence, my remark that men are privileged because they are the 'normal'. If you're male, or, if you're a straight male, or, if you're a straight, christian, white male, you don't have to change a single thing about your behavior or world view. The world was literally made for you, your only concern is how marketable your job-skill set is. Every other person has more to deal with and has to accommodate their idea of 'normal' to match up to white, male, heterosexual, christian views. 

""that the scenario described in the topic is the very definition of equality"" not physically forced, no. But if she wanted to paint the room pink, or watch Oprah (I know, these are throwaway cliches, but you get my point), she would be harassed for it. Indeed, the way she describes it, everybody gets harassed, and she's just resigned herself to it. I'm male (and white) and when other men harass me whenever I act ""non-male"" I *don't* resign myself to it, I tell them to fuck off and give them a lecture on the social construction of gender identities. 

"" parts of 'feminist' ideology seem to think it's ok to tell men and women that they are wrong to behave in a certain way."" - Aren't you doing the exact same thing when a gay man or a woman decides to act in ""non-normal"" ways? If not you, doesn't society at large? If you think not, I challenge you to dress like a woman for a day. One whole day. And go out in public. Subject yourself to that and see if it broadens your perspective at all. 

""The simple distinction I guess that I always draw from this is that (broadly) everyone should behave the way they choose to behave (within the law), but the moment they tell someone else that they shouldn't behave in the way they choose to behave, there is a problem, and when it is done on a basis of ill thought out generalisations to a group of people, it's even worse."" This is exactly what everyone who is not a white, male, heterosexual has to deal with everyday. Again, go out and act blatantly gay in public for a full day, or, if you can pull it off, dress like a woman. Also, I hasten to point out, isn't this exactly what you're doing with the labels you're putting on feminism? What books on feminism have you read? Seriously, read them.

As someone who's called it ""faith-based"" quite a few times, I can say that it's generally just an insult pointing to feminism being rooted in ideology and the tendency of feminists to fit reality *around* their ideology, rather than the other way around.  

More specifically, [a central tenet of feminism is that women, as a class, are disadvantaged relative to men, as a class](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/r5zjr/why_are_there_so_many_attacks_on_feminism_in/c43cmaw).  In most of the world this is clearly true, however in certain places and in certain situations it's clearly not always the case.  An example of this would be [men receiving harsher sentences than women for the same crimes](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/sentencing.pdf).  On its face, this would be an obvious way that men, as a class, are disadvantaged relative to women, as a class.  Despite this, many feminists will tell you that this isn't male-disadvantage...it's just ""benevolent misogyny"" (I can provide examples if you like), or some other justification which looks to re-frame male-disadvantage as female-disadvantage.  Denying reality to protect your ideology indicates belief in that ideology is not grounded in fact, but faith.

As the MRM lacks an overriding ideology, let alone an ideology which requires faith, the ""faith-based"" criticism can't really be leveled against the MRM...at least not in the same way it's used against feminism.

How does its being about power exclude it from being about sex?

I can even see arguments where the fact that it is about sex actually implies that it is about power.  For example, a rapist might deliberately target attractive young women because they wield so much sexual power in society and by attacking them the rapist feels more powerful as a result.

Perhaps the point people are trying to make is that a typical rapist is not motivated by a lack of sexual satisfaction in their life as much as they are by a lack of power in their life.

I'll attempt to answer your questions clearly:

> Why are my views entitled? I am trying to help. I very consciously base my Men's Rights stance on the views and complaints of my male friends and family members who have been affected by gender bias in a very, very real way. 

And you may be genuinely trying to help, which I do not dispute, but if you re-read what you had wrote, this was how you came off: ""Here's how we solve the equality problem -- fix men, get them not to be so manly with each other, they don't need to be tougher; and why is everyone so big on gender differences?"" 

Quick problems in your argument:

- Men and women are physiologically and psychologically different. Gender roles exist for this very reason. 
- For example, going by the most traditional of roles -- men as protectors -- they can only do this if they're more used to sustaining 'abuse' (I hate that word, for the record, because it's over-used and applied to almost anything), whether physical or verbal, and have been roughened up enough to prepare better for their protecting roles. Women aren't necessarily the protectors -- therefore it's silly for them to argue about the way men treat each other, *because women will never share the same worldview that men share with and between other men* on account of the two main differences I've stated above. 

> Should I stop referring to myself as a feminist? Is that the problem? A label? I am an extremely active advocate for both Men's and Women's rights. But every time I tell somebody on this forum that I am a woman and a feminist, somebody always jumps down my throat, moreso than in any other sub. This happens even when I am expressing a view that is extremely contrary to the ""feminist"" views that many people in r/mensrights oppose. 

Yes, your self-identification may be a problem. Obviously, feminists are not regarded happily within men's rights circles, because they are everything that the men's rights circle is against. A rough analogy: It's about the same as being a dog and jumping into a group of cats and preaching to them that you're supporting cat's rights. No matter how true or strong your support for them is, you're still a dog, and the cats are therefore still bound to eye you with wariness.

> The strange thing is, absolutely none of my friends in real life ever react this way when we discuss such things, even the one's who are deeply entrenched in men's rights issues. So what's the deal?

Why must you pose such an obvious question? 

The lack of anonymity in real life prevents honesty such as that which you see online. 

And arguments in real life erode the social grease that keeps you all together -- thus, most people would rather sustain the discomfort of temporary disagreement, than to argue heavily and face the risk of permanent and *identifiable* mutual resentment for one another. 

> It's very difficult to be an ally sometimes when it feels like ""my kind"" is not welcome. 

Your kind is welcome. Do not mistake this. 

> The other reply to my post told me that it was arrogant for a woman to try to help fix things. 

Because that's what women like to do. They like to fix things, and suggest improvements, because they think that their way is the 'right' way to do things, when often, it isn't, and what's worse is that they're completely oblivious to the many fundamental aspects that are necessary to consider when doing suggestions. Especially when it comes to things like gender roles. Most women assume that their understanding of gender roles is better than men -- which is flawed in itself, because you should never approach a contentious issue with the idea that you understand it, and that only you have the ultimate say on how it should be treated... which is how feminists typically approach gender issues. 

> Why do so many guys here react this way? Honest question. 

I've answered this above.

> And how can I avoid this in the future? 

1. **Do not assert that men's behaviour are to be fixed or changed.** You too would be offended if I said that women are fundamentally flawed for being catty, manipulative creatures who oftentimes backstab each other -- which is true, as much as men abusing each other is -- but I do not suggest that women should be fixed for it, do I? 

2. **Do not suggest that gender roles are unimportant.** Understand that gender roles are there for a reason. Gender roles provide consistency and stability to society. Gender roles give identity to growing children, and to families and parents. Gender roles give status to people, both men and women, and are a necessary aspect of our human social hierarchy. Deconstructing gender roles, or asserting that less heed should be paid to it, destroys all this. And I don't mean to offend you, but I'll be honest: Ignoring the importance of gender roles only shows how ignorant and myopic you are. 

> No, this isn't about improving men. This is about men allowing other men to be themselves, whatever that may be, even if it means being less masculine. It's about not having such specific expectations that we would punish each other for falling out of line. It's about human kindness and mutual respect regardless of gender. Perhaps you see that as an unrealistic goal, but I will continue to fight for it.

The above was not how you asserted it. If a man is less masculine, it is fine. There are all degrees of soft men out there, and it is not an issue. What is an issue is when a man professes to be feminine or takes up a more-feminine-than-masculine aspect despite being a man; *that* is societally and biologically wrong, and that is why they are being punished for it. Women do that stuff all the time as well -- they just do it differently. You've seen women punish other women, in full view of the public, for being 'sluts', haven't you? It's the equivalent chastising treatment among women for their kind stepping out of the line and assuming a 'predatory' sexual behaviour typically associated with men; and there is no kindness or respect to these women's behaviour, is there? It's just how the world works. 

Now, your trans friends may disagree, but ask these questions to yourself: even if they don't identify themselves as being of any gender, are they still not leaning towards dressing as being of one particular gender? There is no neuter gender to speak of, so are they not at least sexually attracted towards a person bearing one or the other gender roles? 

Now, considering all that, *are they not still buying into a gender role, despite crying out loud against the fundamental importance of gender roles*?

c44i3ui,t1_c44b6q5,2012-03-24 18:47:02,MensRights,"I guess I didn't expand my point very well, but the reason I say it's the definition of equality is because no-one is (reported to be) behaving against their nature to act that way in the working environment. I could equally say that it's equality in a (stereotypically) female environment, where female behavioural norms apply, if the women treated both men and women the same way.

I think it's a mistake to try and equate gender in this scenario with religion, and especially with sexuality... the former I concede may be again because of cultural differences (though I do live in a very catholic country, I have never been discriminated against because of my atheism), but the latter, where those who consider themselves gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender or any other variation, are a small minority of the population, and it has always been the case. The split between men and women is always, give or take a percentage point, pretty much even, so where arguing that cultural norms cause difficulties for those who make up around 3% of the population (at an estimate), arguing that for 50% of the population takes a much larger stretch.

I would also argue that being the target of banter, whether or not actions fit the cultural norm, isn't discriminatory at all. As I read it (and i'm making as many assumptions as you here), if she did those things, she would be targeted with banter, but she would also if she didn't, and whether or not she did those things wouldn't effect how she would behave otherwise in that environment either.


I'll state very clearly that I know i've got a very different perspective on life to many, but having grown up with an ignorant bigot of a father, I learnt very quickly from him how not to behave. I don't judge people based on their gender, sexuality, or anything else, though I do admit to also having a pretty sharp sense of humour about mocking these stereotypes, and am pretty intolerant of the intolerant (if you'll pardon how hypocritical that is). My point wasn't supposed to be that feminism alone does this, it's that feminism can be as bad as anything else in society, and can be as narrow minded and bigoted as any other group based on gender, age, culture, religion, taste in ice-cream or any other catergory you could think of. That's why I don't like the language of 'priviledge' and 'victim' because the truth is that almost everyone in society is treated crappily by other groups in society.

In reply to your next point, I would argue that men are the subject of as many prejudices as women, as far as cultural expectations of behaviour go. You even mention this yourself, when you talk about people harassing you for 'non-male' behaviour, so i'm a little confused by the response you are making. As I said earlier, the reason I talk about the problem with some parts of feminist ideology, is because i'm intolerent of intolerence, and not a fan of hypocracy in general. I would go in to more details, but I've got to rush off soon, but I do want to make it clear that i'm not criticising all feminism, but only parts of it.

I have no idea myself - but based on what happens in movies and books, I should think that women gather fruits/berries/roots etc, while men hunt animals.

If the women looked after children, they don't need to put them in danger or run around if they're gathering plants.

This nugget of info is irrelevant.

Dear hipster, 

Have you ever done any actual comp-sci classes? Like, say, programming? Where we do arcane computer-science wizardry like algorithm optimizations, graphic rendering, etc (and I'm simplifying this because I'm assuming that you don't know what these are)? Now *those* are true tests of logic and critical thinking and problem-solving. Philosophy, on the other hand, is pretentious logic-wanking, and useless circular thinking at best. Most pure philosophy majors, no matter how awesome they are at 'logic', will still be dumb-ass clueless when asked to write programs, especially when we're talking about going beyond simple shit like loops.

>Do not suggest that gender roles are unimportant.

Okay.  I won't.  I would appreciate your input on something though.  How do I reconcile the assertion that we should not be blurring the gender role lines at all when considering the following examples from my real life:

* My brother in law is a ""house husband"".  He has been happily unemployed for a decade now and takes care of their child and house while my sister works.  This is contrary to current gender roles and blurs the line.

* My best friend is on the road to becoming a male nurse.  He is facing a lot of unfair discrimination along the way because he is a man and society expects nurses to be women.

* Two of my male friends are rape victims.  Neither of them were taken seriously when they came forward because getting raped ""isn't something that happens to men"" according to current gender expectations.  They face harsh ridicule and shame for this.

* My cousin lost the custody battle over his son, even though he was far better equipped financially and mentally to care for the child.  It was clear to him, and our family, that this happened because of current expectations/assumptions relating to mothers being the nurturers and therefore better suited to care for a child.

* My next-door neighbour committed suicide because he had ""failed as a father and a man"".  The burden of expectation weighed so heavily on him that when he couldn't live up to it, he gave up.

I have heard these men directly and repeatedly say that current expectations result in them feeling ostracized and discriminated against.  This breaks my heart, especially since I know they are just a small sample of the many men who go through these same problems.

Maybe you are right.  Maybe it's ""myopic"" of me to allow those close to me to inform my opinions about very broad issues.  But can you suggest how I might reconcile their Men's Rights point of view with the Men's Rights point of view that current gender roles should not be tampered with or changed?  I am not meaning to challenge you here.  I am honestly struggling with this. 

And sorry if all that was TMI about my personal stuff.  I just thought that if you understood better where I was coming from, you might be able to give useful advice on the matter, given your stance.

I agree with you that sometimes evolutionary psychology is used to explain differences which have not been demonstrated to exist.   I think what ends up happening is that since it is not politically correct to do research into gender differences, because gender differences are hard to prove, and because people often cry ""socialization"" people turn to evolutionary psychology to attempt to give reasons why we would expect gender differences to exist.  

What people are often doing when the use evolutionary psychology is making an argument something like this

-we know we evolved

-given this assumption about the state during the time in which we were evolving, this is the role of both sexes

-the sexes would have adapted to this role

-therefore we would expect to see difference X which would help this gender fulfil their role. 

Since we then have a reason to expect gender difference X we can attribute the existence of gender difference X to biology if it exists, and we can also put the onus to a certain extent on others to show that gender difference X does not exist.  

This type of argument can be flawed, but it is in principal correct. Of course, the assumptions about roles in the past can be challenged, and gender differences can be shown not to exist.  

Evolutionary psychology is far superior to what appears to be the alternative, attributing any sex differences to socialization.  We have reason to expect sex differences in behaviour, and their are many phenomena that are not easily explained by attributing sex differences in behaviour to socialization.  It may be that often evolutionary psychology is used incorrectly, but it is fundamentally much more sound than alternative.",themountaingoat,t2_6dtja,0,0,reddit3

I didn't think you actually were, I was just letting you know you sound like one.

Thinking can be important, but some thinking is arguably more useful or practical than others.  Thinking, for instance, that all men are created equal is more useful than thinking about whether or not there may be some abstract ideal of any given thing of which the things we see and deal with are merely pale copies.  Fiction and art have other uses, such as entertainment, education, and showing us other perspectives.  The ""diversity courses"" at my college claimed in the course listings to show other perspectives, but they didn't-- they dictated them.

We are not measuring food by the quantity of labour or skill required to obtain it, not by raw amounts obviously.

>And no science works backwards. 

Yes, it often does.  Very often scientists assume something and then look at what would need to be true for that to be the case.  Look at the history of special relativity.  Many people assumed that there was an either, and formed elaborate hypotheses to explain what would need to be true for the ether to exist given experimental data.  Einstein did the other thing, he assumed some broad principal and then explored the consequences of it, in some cases before those consequences were even tested.  Science works both ways. 

One of the main features of science is falsifiability.  Evolutionary psychology is the same as evolution in that it is somewhat hard to think of something that would falsify it because it is almost a logical necessity.  In some sense evolution and the paradigm of evolutionary psychology don't are just necessary logical truths.  However, individual uses of evolutionary psychology can be disproved, and they are scientific.
>First you have to prove women are more manipulative. Then you have to prove it's biologically based and not due to cultural interference. Then you have to prove it happened in history.

Why the assumption of cultural interference be the default?  We have a reason to expect biological differences in behaviour.  Because of this differences in behaviour should be assumed to be biological be default, or at least should be an equivalent hypothesis to social conditioning.


>It's the exact same stuff people used to try to prove that white people were more evolved, and that black people were just meant to be slaves.

Yes. Most feminist advocacy papers rely on the following flawed methodology.

1) They do not ask women about their own violence. 

2) They survey non-representative populations such as women in a battered women's shelter.

3) They do not include men.

4) They expect men to either label being abused/raped as a crime or as abuse/rape. Due to men's socialization, men resist anything that makes them sound like a victim. Asking for specific _acts_ is the only way to capture the abuse victimization of men.

5) When they do include men and do ask for specific acts, they do not consistently use male interviewers for male interviewees. Men are less likely to disclose abuse to a female interviewer.

6) They do not _ever_ mention the studies that indicate most intimate partner and sexual abuse is massively under disclosed by men. For example one study found that men with verified case histories of child sexual abuse disclosed that abuse on a neutral survey instrument at _one fourth the rate of women._ 

7) They often omit the vagina as a instrument of rape in their studies on sexual violence, creating vastly lopsided rates of rape. (You can do exactly the same thing in reverse by deciding that a man penetrating a woman is not rape, but a woman enveloping a man is.)

Ironically despite these limitations general population surveys are getting closer and closer to parity. Rates of men being victimized already exceed in some places women's victimization within the last 12 months.

Because culture impacts everything from food and appetites to what we find sexually attractive. Because culture has constantly changed its assertions about behaviour. Like with women's sexuality--culture has varyingly said it is nonexistant, weaker than men's, and stronger than men's. Or girls liking pink--pink used to be a masculine color for boys. Or women being more nurturing for nursing--nursing used to be a strictly male profession, just like a lot of ""traditionally"" female careers. People used to think women had no need to be literate, but now science is showing that women's brains are better suited for language-based work than men's are (which of course doesn't mean men are bad at it, just like women aren't bad at math or science just because male brains might be better suited for it). Whether we say we're attracted to thin women or fat ones is far more culturally taught than biologically. So if you assert something is biologically based, you first have to prove it's an actual biological fact, not a culturally taught one.

Basically, you have to prove your assertion is true, before you bother trying to theorize as to why it would happen. Otherwise you end up with the same conclusions that any mythology has--you're just making up excuses for false beliefs.

Hell, I'll admit one of my own faults. I believed for most of my life that glass was a liquid, just a slow-moving one. My mother told me so. My school told me so. I *learned* it, it was a fact. And the proof was obvious--look at old windows, and how they ripple and are thicker at the bottom. Because the glass is slowly melting. 

Glass is a liquid. It melts. That's a fact. And yet I was able to stand there and look at Ancient Egyptian glass bottles, without ever wondering ""Hmm, why aren't they a puddle of glass??"". Because my brain just *knew* that glass was a liquid, and didn't bother to think about contrary evidence. (Because obviously, glass is **not** actually a liquid, it was never a fact, my brain was just taught that it was and accepted it.)  That's how strong confirmation bias is.

Let me get this straight.  We have extremely strong reasons to believe that the sexes should have gender differences in behaviour that are due to biology.  However we should assume that all gender differences are not due to biology because some factors can be influenced by culture.  There are also the cases of people who were raised a different gender than they were born which highly suggest a high degree of biological determination of gender.

Citation?  Yes, what is seen as ideal in paintings ect varies with culture, but sexual tastes are not always in line with the cultural ideal's of beauty.  For example men find women most are attractive at a weight much greater than the typical supermodel weight.

I agree with you that confirmation bias is an important thing, but it works both ways.   It is an article of faith among many people that all differences between the sexes are due to conditioning, and there is no reason to admit this.  Accusing others of confirmation bias however does nothing to solve anything.  What you need to do is to critique their reasoning.  For example, if you disagree that women are more manipulative do a study on it.  If you agree that women are more manipulative but think it is due to conditioning, then attack assumptions about the state of nature, or do studies that attempt to show it being due to conditioning.  

>If you think that women being more manipulative is an obvious fact, you still need to prove that it is. Because you could just be ignoring all the evidence against that, from confirmation bias.

We do not have extremely strong reasons. Some things have some reasons. But we do not have very much sexual dimorphism in our species, so ""extremely strong"" is an incredible overstatement. Most sex differences that do exist can be easily explained by how hormones affect our bodies and brains, with no psychology necessary. They are sometimes just side effects of the way other things that are necessary and selected for in our biology works. Like men being more likely to be colour-blind; it's not because women needed to be able to see berry colours because they were gatherers (which is the kind of argument evopsych would make), it's just because it's a defect that happens to be carried on the sex chromosomes.

>However we should assume that all gender differences are not due to biology because some factors can be influenced by culture. There are also the cases of people who were raised a different gender than they were born which highly suggest a high degree of biological determination of gender.

You really don't understand how evolution works.  Evolution is what determines what hormones exist in our bodies and what they do.  Hormones are one of the mechanism's of evolution, they are not separate at all.

And I could say that the cultural conditioning hypothesis is bunk because they don't prove that differences don't exist first.  You don't need to have an absolutely certain empirical evidence in order to try to look at what might cause that effect.  In fact, some physicists explore the implications of things that we have no direct evidence for, for example magnetic monopoles.  In fact, evolutionary theory is so obviously true the fact that sex differences are highly suggested by evolutionary theory is strong evidence for them on it's own.

Apparently the military can do anything but make women a soldier.  I'm saying this to flush out the crypto-chivalrous sentiments that women can't be soldiers.

But since you seem to need a recap.

The standing point is this: democracy is undermined when you have a majority of the electorate who can vote for wars that they are exempted from fighting in. That creates a moral hazard in which the costs of choosing warfare are not born by those choosing it.

There are some cases where you would be correct. But they often do. ""Women evolved to have sex with one high-status male while men evolved to sleep around."" Biology directly contradicts that, with the physiology of the penis. As well as plenty of historical and cultural accounts that also contradict it.

Scientists predict empirical phenomena from theories all the time.  This case is another example of that.  We predict from a well established theory because it is difficult to empirically test sex differences.

>Because we're talking in generals. I'll sit and tear apart individual examples as much as you want. But you also have to show any evidence of it being true, too. You've shown none. Just because you think something should exist doesn't mean it does. 

You haven't done a very good job tearing apart the manipulative example.  In the case of the manipulative example the evidence of it being true is evolution.  You have no evidence to suggest otherwise.


>You also are conveniently ignoring my colour blindness example of why you need evidence before you make an assertion.

I don't really get what you mean with that example.  Sure, one thing was not explained by evolutionary psychology, that is hardly reason to think that nothing is.  And that example gives no reasons to prefer social conditioning as a reason compared to evolution.

iwbeqhm,t1_iwai1mw,2022-11-14 11:45:25,MensRights,"After I ETSed in the Army, I came home and had some issues with adjusting and reintegration. I ended up getting arrested within a few months and sid a little time in a central Florida jail. A girl had a seizure one night, and fell onto concrete from an 8 foot bunk. For hours they refused to open the door and come get her for medical attention.  When they finally did, she never came back. She wasn't in the infirmary, she was just gone. Another girl gave birth in the pod, once again because no one would open the doors and help. Jails in Florida are awful. Most of the inmates don't have the means, or even anyone who cares about them, so they know they can get away with it. When someone fr otl m a wealthy, caring family is in the pod, they are always treated differently once their family becomes a thorn in the jails side by calling and fighting for their family member to be treated like a human being. 

One girl had been raped repeatedly at a local prison, by guards. She got pregnant, but hid the fact because she knew she could be badly hurt or outright killed if they knew. She got out and had twin girls. She tried to go against the system, but her house kept getting raided, she had to start sneaking out of the neighborhood hood just to catch a ride to work, because if she just left she would be pulled over and often searched. Out of nowhere her license became suspended, she didn't know why when I knew her, but she got pulled over and thrown in jail. 3 times in five years of basically anything means your a ""habitual offender"" and as such can be charged with a felony.  When she got out of prison years before, she had trouble getting her life together, and if you miss an insurance payment in Florida your license ends up revoked and it used to be 250 these first reinstatement, 500 the second, and 750 the third. In those times, she had been pulled over withour a license the DAY her suspension became active. So she started being careful.

 She was doing very well for awhile. Until she requested paternity tests against those prison guards so she could begin getting justice.  She was so afraid. She knew they were going to send her to that prison. Even if she survived, she was silenced. She regretted ever trying together those rapists removed from a place where they raped inmates freely. She just wanted to go home. Her story seemed like too much to me at the time, but she had documentation. ""Lehal papers"" were allowed, and she had slid in some of her papers regarding the whole affair into large packets shipped in my her mother. Unless a guard went through and actually read all the papers, they wouldn't have known they were there.  She cried every night. She was afraid and missed her daughters, she was afraid for them as well, because now the potential fathers knew of their existence. She left for court one day and never came back. I don't know what happened to her. :(
 

A pseudo uncle I had growing up died in jail. They said he fell. When his family got the body his neck was broken and he had LOTS of other injuries, even broken bones, with signs of healing. The didn't have the money, or the means to go up against the system, and no lawyer would touch them as soon as they told them their story.  

In Florida there is a common saying ""Come for vacation, leave on probation, come back on a violation.""  Some of the things I've personally witnessed law enforcement do, even in my own neighborhood, was making me lose faith in humanity. I felt hopeless, like everyone else on that pit of despair that central Florida has become.  I left. Moved away. I'm the sole survivor of my friend group, and I watched my friends slowly lose hope overtime in that place. I have more surviving friends from the military, than I do back home.   Once you start to feel that your voice is that small, that those who are supposed to protect you, are no better than gangs of thugs that enforce local political interests...  it's an awful place, and I was the optimist for a long time, because it took me longer to see it.  


Florida's open records laws regarding arrests are some of the most open in the country. That's why there are so many ""Florida Man"" stories.  Crazy arrests happen elsewhere, but with how the reports are written, and how freely available thay are as soon as they're put in the system... it's just funny how, when they arrest someone, the details of that arrest are made public, where anyone can read every detail of someone's worst day, but every time an inmate dies and it actually reaches the media, the records kept on what happened and how often these things happen are all the sudden ""confidential.""

2) For people who did victimize someone, the lengths that the other person was victimized has high variance.  Someone who maybe vandalized something is not the same as someone who got arrested for fighting, and that in turn is different from murder.

3) ""What about the victim"" does not actually work in practice.  The very idea of justice only can ever work in ""eye for an eye"" context.  There have been a myriad of studies of this done on relatives of murder victims that show that the death penalty does not actually help with the grieving a loss process.  Your reasoning is innately broken here.

4) Not every prisoner is guilty.  Our ability to determine guilt is always going to be flawed to some capacity.  Your position would make innocent people fare far worse than they already do for improper imprisonment.

5) ""Make it a living hell so they never want to go back"" is, in fact, something we learned doesn't work.  That's why we have made changes that prohibit things like chain gangs.

6) Without a proper rehab program to get people in prison proper life training, skills, and ability to function in society, all you get is a bunch of people who live a harsh life in prison, and that's all they know.  Inducing heavy trauma on people already broken *does not* make people suddenly be functional in society.  This would just increase repeat offenders rather than actually keep crime down.

7)  The war on drugs was built entirely on this stupid premise.  That is a giant disaster that failed on every conceivable level, cost people their lives, helped nobody, cost incalculable amounts of money, and we are *still* reeling from it, and attitudes *just like yours* keep perpetuating it.

Please learn to actually think about the consequences of your opinions instead of just going with what feels good, because shit like this is why we'll never have proper prison reform to help people.  Also maybe learning a thing or two about facts would help you.",Rob__T,t2_bdudg,9,0,reddit4

This happened in the UK...

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/06/26/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent/

Was a big push of Hillary Clinton during her candidacy. The platform website isn't there anymore, but there are articles.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/27/opinions/hillary-clinton-women-and-mass-incarceration-crisis/index.html

The article makes many excuses for women comitting crime. No empathy for men with identical backgrounds. Studies show the majority of men convicted of raping women were raped by women as boys. If this is justice, (which I'm not sure it is) why should men not also get a pass for adverse childhoods?

Things are headed this way in Australia with the same narrative. All women criminals have reasons. Men are just naturally criminals. Women don't deserve to be punished like men. I suspect in Australia laws will pass within the decade like they were in the UK.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/17/a-mass-imprisonment-crisis-why-more-women-are-doing-time

Now they are saying we shouldn't even put women on trial for selling drugs in the UK.  Not people based on a certain scenario, women.

* The altercation starts with DW's wife being distraught and DW grabbing her hand.

* Only after her hand is grabbed, wife slaps DW, **trying to free her hand**

* DW lets go of her hand and slaps her

* Wife tries to walk away, DW grabs her and **slaps her again**

They example i give is Chris brown and Rihanna. While this situation with Dana white seems mutual and as I said I believe that makes it completely forgivable. They both owe each other an apology. Maybe publicly for displaying domestic violence as celebs but other than that I don‚Äôt think he should lose his job or anything close to that.

But with the whole Chris brown Rihanna they would fight each other fairly equally apparently until one day he almost beat her close to death. She never even came close to doing that to him and likely wasn‚Äôt hitting as hard as he was. That to me is a clear example of when it‚Äôs no longer fighting back and it‚Äôs a man abusing a woman.

inrnuwa,t3_x9ux8y,2022-09-09 19:52:42,MensRights,"Hello, Marine veteran here. Ever since women were allowed into the military they have had lower physical fitness requirements. 

As far as different pt tests for different jobs? It would never work out, you expect too much of military infrastructure. The AVASB passing score for the marine corps is 50 ok. Those chuckle heads can barely run two annual fitness tests, let alone 7-20 varieties of tests. 

There are allowances for age, older you get, the more lax the standard becomes. You still have to run 3 miles, fast, though.  

As far as gender discrimination? Good luck with that. Your best bet to make change happen, would be to find a compelling argument as to why women need to have higher pt standards, and if they can fight that, then the next fight you need to have is to lower the male standard to its female equivalent. Either way this will fuck up mission readiness, if too many female marines fail a higher pt standard, they can't deploy, if males are held to a lower standard, it will cause unexpected labor issues. 


Ultimately however, these arguments have already been made, and the at the time honorable Mr. Mavis of the office of the secretary of defense said ""its OK that women are weak and lack mission readiness, we can rely on them as much as we rely on the men, on the condition that we continue to rely on the men to the same standard as before, while expecting them to pick up the easy to calculate slack that the equally trained women will need picking up after once the going gets too hard.""

Nowhere is ""defacto equality"" specifically defined for this or any other purpose.

I recommend everyone review CEDAW - the [United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-elimination-all-forms-discrimination-against-women?fbclid=IwAR2fUZvdCG6nfG_unHS8ankixh8zUX1zKFdQz1Jezgkxemzc88zlY9o_TmQ), Article 4 (with reference to Article 1).

Article 4:

1. Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved.

In every country that has ratified CEDAW, there will be a Sex Discrimination Act that references this UN Convention. Eg. [Australia](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00002):

""The objects of this Act are:

  (a)  to give effect to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and to provisions of other relevant international instruments;""

The point here is that **the US has not ratified CEDAW**. They are the only country to have signed it but not passed legislation enacting it.

applicants for military service are regulated. During fitness  
testing, the same tests are administered; however standards  
and scores are adjusted to recognize biological differences  
between women and men. All remaining selection tests are  
the same.  
Description  
The physical selection test measures the physical potential of the applicant taking  
into account biological differences between men and women. The score on this  
test is included in the overall score of the applicant. A ranking, of the applicants,  
based on this overall score is made up.  
In the case of a limited number of vacancies, the best applicants are recruited.  
Standards for physical tests related to certain functions (e.g. pilot, combat diver)  
are the same for men and women.  
Advantage  
‚Ä¢ The test measuring the physical potential of men and women is no longer  
gender neutral.  
‚Ä¢ Women are no longer put at a disadvantage, so their chances to be recruited  
increase.  
‚Ä¢ Increase of the number of women recruited.  
‚Ä¢ Recruitment is seen to be fair and unbiased as the best candidates are  
recruited, regardless of their gender.

This makes sense, because when people are being brought into military service, they aren't necessarily going in for a purely combat role. While strength matters, our military isn't engaged in sword-fighting, so there is a practical limit on how big or strong someone needs to be in order to shoot a gun, throw a grenade, or drive a vehicle. While it may be true that women on average may be less capable of say, carrying a wounded comrade out of danger, this is also going to be true of some men.

Let's take, for example, the biggest gap provided in the fitness standards - pushups.

On average men under 30 are expected to hit a minimum of 33 pushups in 1 minute versus just 18 for women.

Taking the heaviest people on the youngest end of this chart: [https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards](https://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/army-height-weight-standards)

We are looking at women being as heavy as 227 lbs' versus men being 235 lbs' and as light as 119lbs vs 132 lbs respectively.

That means that both men and women are on average maybe 8 to 13lbs apart? In a combat situation where a woman might have to carry a wounded comrade out of danger, it seems VERY unlikely that someone capable of hitting either minimum benchmark for ENTRY into the military would somehow not be fit enough to do a fireman's carry.

&#x200B;

Basically, while I can see the minimum standards allowing for women to have weaker upper body strength on average in order to be accepted, I don't see these standards as being so VASTLY different as to require a change in pay that wouldn't more reliably correspond to a change in their assigned duties (which would better reflect the specific reason that individual was accepted for). 

These guidelines are broad, but active duties seem, in my understanding, to be quite varied. These are minimum fitness requirements, and the minimum requirements don't seem to be off significantly enough to result in significant differences in individual performance for positions candidates wind up being sorted into.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,3,0,reddit2

Places like figher fighting. Or military. You need need the physical requirements to be met. Cause if your buddy gets hurt in any way or form. You trust your life to yea partners to safe you. As the so you. 

And everykne knowing the can do that in when needed cause its a requirement to stand next to you. Gives trust and give piece of mind to the people that do those dangerous jobs.

But people dont seem to get if you make. 1 not have to be held up to the same requirements. That same bound and trust from knowing the person got your back is simply not that. Cause the nevwr had to prove that the could. So places where people get hurt like on front line in wars. Or figher fights the should be no where in the building where that requirements are needed. 

And even do its already happening and girls just not take serious and why would yea take them serious. If you put a lot of pride in your job. And where you are. And see people left and right have to do 50 procent less. Where you basicly saying 2 off those girls makes 1 of you. And the cant do the job thats requirement off them so you have to pick up the slack.

People say thats not true. But i work os a physical demanding job. And you can call me ass hole all you want. If you get payed the same. You wil do the same job as everyone else. No pick and choose the easy jobs. Cause its simple pride in your work. As a professional. Cause job titles mean something.

Cant say your a plumber. But wont do any of the dirty of physical demanding jobs. You should not be allowed to call yea self a plumber. Thats the simple fact. If you in a typ of job. You should be required to become able to do everything that job requires of you. To be called a professional.

Same way i cant go to woman dominate fields. Like teaching. Or day care. Pick and choose what jobs suits me right. Simple rule tale it all or none. Why the fuck is subpar work acceptable to meat dumb quotes. That often make work for more people. Dubble work loads. And slowly burn out people. Cause you need 2 often 3 of those girls to 
Fill one man. When physical demands a requirement in almost all parts off the job. And all the easy jobs. That people often seem as a small break of back breaking work houre after houre. You dont even have that anymore. But the get payed the same as you. Fucking funny as hell. Who would try there best anymore seeing that shit day after day. Not even talking about most the girls are sick like 8 times a year easly. Not even joking or being mean simply spitting facts. What i have to deal with on a daily basis.

In general, men are about 10% taller and have 50% more mass than women.

But that is in general. Many women can run longer and faster than a subset of men. Some women are stronger than even most men.

Equal opportunity means everyone has the opportunity to do a job, regardless of physical attributes.

Women overall, are not as strong as men, and physical standards for women in the military, just as for men, are significantly higher than for the overall population. Basically women, like men, have to be fit, be capable of running non-stop for two miles, be capable of lifting their bodies. But the standards for women are based on things like shorter legs and less upper body strength. 

Lots of guys make it through basic training requirements who are > 50 lbs overweight at the start. It is amazing how a low calorie, high protein diet and burning 7000 calories a day can radically transform the human body in 8 weeks.

BTW, this argument that women are too weak to do the job goes back > 40 years. It wasn't true then and it is not true now.

44% of women failed the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) in 2021. 7% of men failed. People who fail the ACFT multiple years can be denied re-enlistment. It depends on whether recruitment is high or low, because the military sets requirements for the total number of soldiers.

No arguments to the first layer, but the military has layers. It's a real ogre of a problem, and really, the physical aspect is a distraction. Males excel at carrying casualties and other heavy loads, which is relevant in combat arms to a point. I say to a point, as we are losing more to suicide than casualties in combat. 

The much more important layer is the mind, which is the great equalizer. To those who say the mind is your greatest weapon, I've met too many that choose to fight unarmed. The mind is where real resilience is born and real strategy is formed.

And as for your moaning over why it is that standards are not the same- they are in other ways. For instance, female and male Marines attend the same basic infantry school together and are there held to the same physical requirements. They have to complete the same rucksack hikes, complete the same obstacle courses, complete the same warfare training and manuevers. 

Further, in terms of specific infantry MOS Marines, there are very few female Marines because they are held to the same physical standards and most cannot complete the school training.

But, outside of general fitness and sound mindedness, your ability to carry a fallen Marine or soldier would hardly enter any real life combat scenarios for the majority of enlisted.

HOWEVER, both in USMC basic bootcamp AND infantry school (which all Marines attend and must pass) female AND male Marines must carry simulated fallen platoon members from a prone movement position (that is to say, carrying an actual person on your back while you low crawl) across field lengths AS WELL AS running movements.

So, why not interrogate the root of your question first, as opposed to creating a vast conspiracy theory in your mind?

Your best bet to make change happen, would be to find a compelling argument as to why women need to have higher pt standards, and if they can fight that, then the next fight you need to have is to lower the male standard to its female equivalent.

Let's just say that if our base was in danger of being overrun and females were not issued grenades I'd be happier, for everyone's safety, because of my personal experience. I'm not blaming them. People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do.

There was not pass/fail criteria. I don't know why).

The military exists today in a state that intends to not be used or seen as a traditional military, but the needs and standards of a military still need to maintained to traditional standards. As far as I can tell, everything should funnel into one of the following:


1. Military standards continue to degenerate due to psuedo-peacetime which turns the military complex into a weak and ineffectual office waiting to be exploited by actors foreign and domestic.


2. Military ground forces are finally replaced with terrifying Boston dynamics robotic drones piloted by VR, Thus eliminating the gender issue, but raising tons of moral and ethical questions. 


3. A real no-shit war occurs, and current politics crumble under the stress, allowing a return to traditional form for the military as they move into a war time mindset. 


One of those three realities with caveats surely.

I see you've never attended military training where you have to throw grenades. It's part of the US Army basic training. I wasn't aware of this before, but during the grenade throw I became aware of how horribly ineffective the average female is in throwing stuff far away. It's a well known thing.

Let's just say that if our base was in danger of being overrun and females were not issued grenades I'd be happier, for everyone's safety, because of my personal experience. I'm not blaming them. People are born the way they are. It's up to the job to weed out the ineffective people based on what they are supposed to do. But rather than weeding people based on gender, they should do that by giving them a test that makes sure that they can throw a grenade properly (the grenade throw event wasn't a test. There was not pass/fail criteria. I don't know why).

I don't doubt that women won't throw the grenades as well as men, but this is a fundamentally different claim from the idea that ANY man would be a better, safer candidate simply because he could out throw a grenade better than any female soldier.

If this is the only criticism you have to offer on my position, I don't find it to be a compelling one. Because my position involves far more than a comment that was fundamentally about the distinction size differences make between modern and ancient warfare. Which I don't see women underperforming compared to men in distance throwing to be the only factor worth considering in whether or not someone is qualified to be a member of the military.

I mean, have you considered that the men who don't qualify are potentially worse at throwing than these women? Some men suck at throwing, some women are great at it, that's why these averages matter.

inr7m81,t1_inq4565,2022-09-09 18:02:49,MensRights,"Fitness is important to the military. It shows discipline, commitment excellence, and shows that the individual takes care of their body. It exists to weed out people who are undisciplined and cannot commit to a goal to achieve it. It helps ensure that enlisted personnel are less likely to experience adverse health conditions. But to test for those things doesn't require a set amount of strength or endurance. On average, women have less upper body strength. That's just a fact. A perfectly disciplined and committed individual woman can be at her peak health and fitness and still not do as many pull-ups as a man. The key is to look at the demographic. Whatever an average woman who achieves an excellent level of physical fitness can do, that should be the standard. They should be at the top of their demographic. A man who performs the same number of pull-ups as an average woman of great fitness is likely well under his own peak for fitness, just based on physiology alone.

Just look at the Army page: [https://www.army.mil/acft/](https://www.army.mil/acft/) Is the purpose of the test to measure abilities? Instead it lists: ""improve solider and unit readiness;"" ""transform the Army's fitness culture;"" ""reduce preventable injuries and attrition;"" and ""enhance mental toughness and stamina."" These things aren't ties to the exact physical abilities of the individuals, but to their overall level of fitness and health.

I've noticed a similar dynamic at a household level.  The wife takes the authority but not the responsibility, so the husband refuses responsibility.

inuglp8,t1_insm4li,2022-09-10 12:00:58,MensRights,"Sure, but my point about the standards was that they didn't result in a significant variance between recruited men and women. Yes, men will outperform women on average with some of these tasks (like grenade throwing) more often than not, but if the women can reliably throw a grenade over 250 meters at a minimum, they have reached a minimum physical requirement for them to be qualified candidates.

That it's easier for men to meet that minimum physical requirement doesn't mean that this should be an advantage for ALL military positions that might be filled either. There are benefits to having a gender diverse military that outweigh the advantages imposed by gender neutral physical requirements that result in an imbalance of men and women recruited. For example, when the military goes in to occupy an area they will have to deal with the civilians that live in that area. Just like police, there is a benefit to deescalating conflicts that might arise, and some of those conflicts might be more easily resolved because a woman is available to do the deescalating. Not because women are better at de-escalation, but because the civilian might be able to trust or relate to a woman more in that particular circumstance, making a woman the better soldier to use in that situation.

The point is that there is a balance of factors at play, and the complaint that the physical requirements are gendered doesn't mean there isn't a benefit to having different physical requirements if they still allow for the same ""minimum requirements"" for a candidate to be deployed in a specific way.",tomowudi,t2_t578n,1,0,reddit2

Fitness is important, even if actual strength is not, and men are physiologically better at certain things, like pull-ups. So we can't easily say they should reduce the number of pull-ups for men because that will allow unfit men to pass. The goal should be for all fit people to pass and all unfit people to fail. On the other hand, for deadlifts, the standard should really be a percentage of body weight, although honestly, the standards are low enough that a weak man can easily pass them. The minimum for a male under the age of 21 is only 140 pounds.

That's why I actually think a medical exam would be better. They could test bone density, muscle mass, body fat, and cardiovascular health. Of course, I recognize that there are many reasons why a basic fitness test would be easier and more cost-effective to administer.",countrymace,t2_mjhctq3w,2,0,reddit2
inrebyd,t1_inr70uf,2022-09-09 18:47:59,MensRights,"Was that the Marines? I think they deploy more often, which is probably why the age limit for first time enlistment is so much lower? 

The scope of their duties is obviously different. There is a pretty minimal level of physical fitness required for that. Any man or woman who is has reached a great level of physical fitness can manage to get into a truck or helicopter. I mean, did he have to climb up a rope to get in the heli? 

Even assuming that a deployed JAG officer does need an elevated level of fitness that directly translates to performance on a fitness test, does it make sense to hold everyone to that deployment standard throughout their entire time in the military? There is plenty of legal work that needs to be done in the U.S. and in other non-hostile locations. Everyone needs to be disciplined, committed, and healthy, but not everyone needs the upper body strength that they could climb up a rope or jump to catch a moving vehicle or anything else that could come up. 

I'll give you an analogy to firefighters. I see a lot of people complain about lower standards for women who apply because they think everyone should be able to do all of the jobs in an emergency. Now that's not a bad idea- if it's possible- if you have enough applicants that are physically and mentally capable of performing all jobs satisfactory. To be clear, where that is possible, that should be the goal. Where I'm from, that's just not possible. Our fire department is small and mostly volunteer. There are no women, but many of the men are very fat or older. Should they be booted from the department? No! We literally need them, and it's better that they are willing and able to perform some jobs, even if it's not all of them. If the team is well rounded enough, this works out just fine. If a woman wants to join, but she couldn't carry anyone out of a burning building, that doesn't mean she would be useless to us. If she is good at other roles in the department, then that benefits all of us and frees up others to focus on the roles that she can't do. If we had a strict fitness standard, we would not have very many firefighters at all. If you call EMS, and the paramedics can't get you to the ambulance (referencing that story about the guy who fell in a hole that was posted recently), you're really not any worse off where I live. They can't get you out of the hole, but they were the only available paramedics in the county, so you're stuck in the hole either way. You are just lucky that any EMS showed up in a reasonable time.

My point is that only some military jobs require more than just being in shape, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to hold every individual to that standard if you don‚Äôt plan to deploy them. That‚Äôs why the Army is thinking of having a separate test for combat positions where the job actually requires specific abilities.

Why does this matter? Why not always pick the best of the best? Well for JAG specifically, I‚Äôll be blunt. The best of the best do not go into the military. There‚Äôs too much prestige and money in private practice. Get too strict with the fitness requirement, as in more than is actually required to do the job that needs done, and you make the pool even smaller.

What I‚Äôve been trying to say is that making a standard lower makes it easier to achieve.  If the standard is to run a mile in 8 minutes but then gets increased to 9 minutes, that is objectively easier to obtain regardless of gender or age.  It may still be hard for some people but just because its hard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong/unfair and needs to be adjusted.  What is unfair and should not be the case, is having one person have to run that mile in 8 minutes and someone else being allowed to make the cut by running it in 9 because of their gender.  I don‚Äôt think thats a necessarily outrageous or incorrect sentiment, and its one I apply not only to running but to any sort of weight training requirements.  There should be a single standard per weight class.  

To add to that sentiment, I feel having the separate standards for men and women, just increases the divide between men and women.  If the men are held to higher standards that make them bulkier and heavier, then the difference in standards is going to show even more.  

As for the non-combat positions the physical requirements make sense and should remain the same for them IF they are in area that there is a possibility for combat.

You said:

""This assumes that the point of the physical fitness test is that it literally translates to required abilities to perform the job.  
It is""

You've changed your position here because later you agree that the purpose is to ensure you're ""in shape."" That does not directly translate to ability to a job. It's like the LSAT for law school. It shows you're mentally ""in shape"" but it does not directly indicate that you have the skills or abilities to be a lawyer or even law student. It just serves to weed out people who are definitely not smart enough to be a lawyer.

  
""Sometimes that is true, but many times, it is not.  
The main PFT is the minimum just to be in the military. You may not have to pull yourself up into a helicopter every day, but you better be able to when the time comes. If you need someone else to help you into a helicopter, you are putting yourself and others at increased risk.""

Someone who is physically fit will be able to do this. You're just looking for someone that is not carrying excess weight in the form of fat and has normal muscle mass. Different gender standards do not effect this as long as they are tied to the average performance of a physically fit person of that gender. 

  
""Men and women simply have different performances for the same level of fitness.  
The tests are based around your own body weight. Pullups, pushups, situps, running: You are only moving your own body weight. A 110 lb woman is not required to pull the 200lb man up, but she needs to be able to pull herself up.""

Well, that's just not true. The Army changed the test to include deadlifts, among other things. And it allows both women and older men to pass while lifting a lower weight. Young men have a higher standard because it's needed. An older man or woman that can deadlift X pounds is likely to be able to lift themselves and has demonstrated physical fitness. A young man that can only deadlift X pounds doesn't need to be as fit and could be overweight or unhealthy, so young men must be required to lift Y weight to prove fitness. Even bodyweight fitness tests, the difference between one and four pull-ups is not that great. If you can do a pull-up, you can pull yourself up when needed.

They will have expended the same about of effort. Yet ask them to do pull-ups, and the man will be able to do more. She will experience the same difficulty at a lower number that he will at a higher number. Therefore, for them to be equal in terms of effort and fitness, it‚Äôs necessary to have different pull-up standards. If you have the same standard, the woman will have to work harder and be more fit than the man to pass the same test. That‚Äôs all.

Firstly it's done via a survey site, which means it's self reporting, which is less credible than an actual interview. 

The questions that are posed can in itself nudge the participants in answering in a certain way, and self-reporting is very susceptible to that.

The women that choose to participate may share some characteristics, for example they may have been dissatisfied with the division of labour in advance and therefore be interested in venting that frustration, hence skewing results. 

Secondly, and this is an important fact, the women that was included in the study had to meet the following criteria; ""cohabiting with someone who identifies as a man for six months or longer and living with a dependent 12 years of age or younger.""

This means that there is a child involved which means this is a study about mothers or foster mothers, not women in general. The distribution of household chores may be a proxy of the satisfaction with the quality and distribution of the tasks in child rearing.

>Wanna turn your lady on? Clean the house without being asked

That's a gross oversimplification.  Too many guys think just ""doing more"" is the answer on how to be more attractive to her to turn her on, but it's not.  Taken to the extreme, it ends up just being simp behavior which ends up backfiring and turning her off even more.   

It can work when the situation is that you **are already** attractive to her but the dishes piling up ends up basically being a c*&# blocker, because her mind drifts toward things that need done instead of sexy time.

j00e4zc,t3_zk39xp,2022-12-13 04:04:20,MensRights,"> Women perform approximately 2.5 more hours per day of household labor relative to men

What the fuck are they doing for two and half hours every single day?   How can that be possible?  So I had to look it up:

From the source that quote is from (emphasis mine):  [source if youre curious pdf warning](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2019/statcan/89-503-x/89-503-x54931-eng.pdf)

> The total work burden of women and men was equivalent in 2015 (7.8 and 7.6 hours, respectively). However, when unpaid work performed as a **simultaneous activity** was included, women‚Äôs total work burden was an average of 1.2 hours greater per day than men‚Äôs in 2010 (9.1 versus 7.9 hours).

Simultaneous activity means that for the last two surveys the researchers have allowed respondents to list multiple things they were doing at once.  So if you both vacuum and dust for 30 minutes, thats not 30 minutes of housework, thats 60 minutes of housework.  Or if you watch tv for 30 minutes while you put a pizza in the oven for 30 minutes, thats 30 minutes of primary activity and 30 minutes of housework as a secondary activity.  Pretty fucking clever huh?

Otherwise the authors wouldnt have anything to talk about but see by fudging the numbers a bit, you can get a woman's day to add up to about 30 hours.  So she has time to do about two and half hours of housework every day.  (this is the average between those with and without kids) Canadian houses must be goddamn immaculate.  I cant imagine how clean my house would be if I paid a housekeeper for just 1 of those hours every day.  I used to have one come in once a week and it was practically brand new feeling, but every fucking day?  It must be how billionaires live.

I dont know about women I wouldnt speak for them but if I felt it took me two and half hours to get my house in order... EVERY DAY.. of my life, I would be overwhelmed with what a giant fucking waste it all is.

""In a recent review, Mark and Lasslo (2018) outline individual (e.g., cognitive focus, stress), interpersonal (e.g., relationship length and relationship satisfaction), and societal (e.g., restrictive sexual attitudes and egalitarianism) factors associated with low desire. 

***They note that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the research to specifically examine the societal influences into maintaining sexual desire in long-term relationships has been limited‚Ä¶ This is an area with ample future research opportunities, and we encourage researchers to explore this as a priority‚Äù (p. 575).***""

I pointed out the double standard regarding how gender roles for men are still expected while they vanished for women and got downvoted to oblivion.

A poster said they would not want to date a lazy man child but that parent-child dynamic is supposedly okay when men are the parent. Men must adhere to their gender role by earning more, protecting their wives and doing all the dirty jobs at home like home and vehicle maintenance. If she calls him daddy it's okay. He must provide and protect like her dad did. But if she must cook and clean like mom did we have more of a problem with it.

It is hypocritical of women to want men to adhere to their gender role while expecting men to not want women to adhere to theirs. Imagine if a study came out saying men lose attraction to lazy wives who won't cook or clean. How well would that be received?

He also went to INSEAD, one of the top ranked business schools in the world and was such a good student he received the Henry Ford award for best student of the year /outstanding academic performance. The he went to Harvard for a business management program.
He was a professor in the Portuguese bank training institute and the Catholic University of Portugal while being the VP and head of capital markets.
In Brazil he was CEO of Banco Santander Brazil , also the chairman of the Santander Group. Then was CEO of Santander UK. 
He was recruited to turn Lloyd‚Äôs around.  He worked so hard he once stayed up for 5 days without sleeping and he had to take time off for a month for his mental health. Due to this His leadership at Lloyd‚Äôs  he made their business profitable again, and helped thousands in Britain needing loans. With increases in vehicle and mortgage loans(Lloyd‚Äôs is Britain‚Äôs biggest mortgage provider )by appealing more to account owners or customers.. And he helped fully restore the banking group to a private nongovernmental ownership at 900 million euros above the value they were paying back the government for. All while eradicating government regulation violations that were present at the the group. Gradually throughout the time of  all these achievements, his salary was sequentially increased. He didn‚Äôt start with that figure, he essentially saved the banking group and was awarded it.
He did so well in banking and leadership he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from: university of Edinburgh, university of Bath, and the university of Warwick. 
He was awarded the Gr√£-Cruz order of merit by Portugal. I don‚Äôt know much about Portuguese awards but from what I‚Äôve read just now, it‚Äôs one of the highest civil honors.
It seems like he earned his salary and I don‚Äôt know why they feel the need to portray him this way. He didn‚Äôt unfairly get the job over more qualified women, he was internationally recruited because of his success and qualifications. Those women have different job titles and roles. He is higher up than them and has had a far greater impact. Why would have the same salary?",,,16,0,reddit4

The biggest difference is the bonus and stocks/options portion... and those are all about negotiation. They're not handed out like candy.

Even if female CEOs do get less bonuses on average - you can't make the conclusion that it is due to systematic sexism. There are too many studies that show that women in general don't negotiate as much or ask for what they think they deserve. There've been multiple best sellers on the subject.

A non-executive director (abbreviated to non-exec, NED or NXD), independent director or external director is a member of the board of directors of a company or organisation, but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from executive directors, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as corporate officers). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.

It isn't twisting the article at all, it is seeing through the narrative being portrayed in the article. Board level roles are overwhelmingly pushed towards women in order to make boards more gender diverse. This is so obvious and consistent with all statistics about how board demographics have changed over the past decade or so that is [doesn't need sourcing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors#Encouraging_gender_diversity_on_corporate_boards)

TL,DR; A colleague (27M) joined our firm last year and since then he has had zero issues socialising with the guys we work with but always finds an excuse or says no to hanging out with the girls after work, even if we go out together as a whole he rarely talks to us and its making some of my friends uncomfortable.  
So early last year our firm hired Dan (27M). In the first few weeks he was really quiet and didn't talk much and that's just how we thought he was. Every conversation with him was short and to the point and never deviated from work, asides from pleasantries (Have a nice weekend etc). About 2 months in he started becoming a bit more friendly with the guys in our office and they would hang out every so often and have normal conversations. However, whenever any of the girls in the office tried to do so he would quickly change the conversation back to work or just not reply. Even now after a year of Dan working with us he straight up refuses to socialise with the girls in the office and it is making them feel uncomfortable. He avoids any discussion of himself outside of work related events and future plans and doesn't ask any of the girls either. Where as he is, what I can only assume, pretty good friends with the guys in the office.  
Even on work meals out to celebrate events he is only doing the bare minimum when it comes to conversation with the girls where again with the guys he talks to them like there is no problem whatsoever. I don't know if I'm overreacting but one of the girls is considering go to HR about this because she is saying its creating a hostile work environment. Dan treats us like he treats clients we work with; cordial and strictly about business and its wearing thin now.  
Any advice is appreciated.""

He was like 65 at the time and said a quiet joke to me , He said Hey Jim, guess what my girlfriend said to me this morning? I said what? He says, Not again. I said I hope my wife is saying that to me when I am 65. Haha, right. It was just the two of us. We got turned in for sexual harassment by a female co-work that I swear was standing a good 25ft away at the coffee pot. She must have had bat ears. It wasn't even towards her or about her or nothing. 

That is when I changed, never again. I stopped chatting, sharing, acted just like the guy in the post. I never commented or responded about makeup, clothing, children, dating, nothing from then on.

And most have a very difficult time handling disharmony.  If a man (or woman) is being too friendly or not friendly at all, its on an extreme, and becomes disharmonious.....creepy.

But most men are not like that.  And since they were boys they were mostly with boys and boys do not work so hard to manipulate a group into a group of harmonious equals.    Group dynamics are based more on what one can bring to the group, and social harmony is not much considered unless there is a serious problem, like constant fighting.

And between those two cultures, especially in a large work group,  there is no way to have balance.   One or the other has to dominate or there is confusion and trouble.

I am used to working in female dominated work environments....but even I am not always perfect at this.   I am well aware of my tendency to withdraw and seek out space to be alone, and I know that makes women feel they are being avoided (they are) and that its due to there being something wrong with them (there isn't...I just need privacy, space and quiet).    And while this is a source of tension, I know I am doing it and so I have strategies to make up for it.

So I don't really feel that anyone here is ""wrong"".   What I do feel is that those people can't work together because one is kind of too male and the other is kind of too female.

So what does it come down to?   It comes down to one feeling the need to complain and the other not feeling a need to complain.   So I would tell the complainer to go find a work environment more suited to her and wish her good luck.",TheNewMasterofTime,t2_v9f91r25,-3,0,reddit1

juktmdj,t3_113lgp5,2023-08-03 04:40:47,MensRights,"I almost think that the OP (the woman complaining about the man not talking to her) might be a trolling post.  However, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that this sort of thing would happen.  Hell, it probably happens a lot, but posting about it on Reddit (in relationship advice no less) seems a little suspicious.

I guess there's no way to know for sure.  The anonymous profile makes it a little bit suspect as well.

I will say that if this is real, then it's toxic femininity in the extreme.  I'm a tall handsome dude and I used to be really bad at talking to women so I just wouldn't do it and I think it did make women uncomfortable... not as uncomfortable as it made them when I did try to talk and came across like a bumbling dork who had no game.

I really had to learn to play to my strengths and eventually I did figure out how to be charming and to come across as desirable.  
Now as a man in my mid 30's most women are happy if I just leave them alone and I'm happy to oblige them.

I've been in a bunch of trainwreck relationships and my synopsis is that romantic relationships are highly overrated.  At least within certain groups in our population.  My stepbrother was MGTOW for years and he ended up marrying a girl from the Dominican republic who is ten years younger than him and very traditional.  I hope it works out for him in the long run.  He seems happy.  I haven't met his wife yet but from what he tells me about her, he seems to have made a wise choice for himself.  A woman like that is more in line with what he wanted, and he is the kind of man she wanted as well.

Damned if you do damned if you don't... Yes, in my experience, but maybe it's just our postmodern culture here in the west still getting it's footing.  We are growing and changing as a culture and unfortunately the strict political divides have put men and women on opposite sides sniping at one another in a culture war that is blown way out of proportion by social media and the like.

Men were creeps towards women for many many years in many many ways.  Now women are getting the upper hand in some ways and I think that without any institutional foundations in place to ease the transition to a more balanced social framework, the whole thing is erupting into chaos where no one seems to know how they are supposed to act towards one another.",Creatural_Shade,t2_jkd859gp,1,0,reddit1

Getting someone to agree with a shitty opinion of yours is easier online because it‚Äôs anonymous and it‚Äôs the entire world. The fact that OP got a group of people agreeing about something like this, and we don‚Äôt know how many women were in this group mind you, tells me at least that there is a more systemic problem present.

And especially after I saw that Google post from a while back where the manager got fired for rejecting a female boss‚Äôs advances, I wouldn‚Äôt put this ridiculous idea past some people. This is MeToo gone haywire",TheGrandScheme3,t2_4c47t793,5,0,reddit1

Work from home has so many synergistic benefits, including reducing workplace sexual tension, but it tends to highlight the inherent friction in relationships through men and women spending more time together. Current society is very good at minimising male-female time spent together through external work, resulting in a home being more a place to sleep and eat than actual cohabitation. It's why Covid was so devastating as relationships had come to rely on that separation.

Considering that the UK and many other countries have laws specifically to protect women and the fact that Men are heavily biased against in both criminal and family courts. along with many other factors that have been pointed out time and time again.. to me it feels more like we are living under a Matriarchy  
Look how easy it was for the Duluth model to be adopted by the police.. the same model which assumes **ALL** men to be the aggressors in cases of domestic violence..

he4b20u,t1_he49k12,2021-09-24 18:06:39,MensRights,"> Interested to hear why that's historically incorrect? 

While his point is historically accurate, it is a [red herring](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Red-Herring) and has nothing to do with whether contemporary Western societies are ""patriarchal"" in that they are dominated by men as a cohort.

The social construct of gender as a whole is indeed rooted in historical patriarchy. However, [as I explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/o1z40x/cancel_culture_is_when_mods_remove_content_that/h2a3zli/) to a [fauxgressive](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/fauxgressive) (pseudoleftist) male feminist who argued that this means contemporary society, in which the gender construct still exists, is patriarchal:

> > Patriarchy does influence gender norms, and it has shaped it.
> 
> Sure, but this doesn't mean they're the same thing. Just because these norms were fashioned back when society was actually patriarchal does not mean it's retained these patriarchal features to this day.
> 
> ___
> 
> > Saying that ""gender norms =/= patriarchy"" isnt entirely correct, don't you think?
> 
> The term ""patriarchy"" is variously defined as ""[a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS930US931&sxsrf=ALeKk02ViA20wcziPW1r-Uein-esp3Tqkw:1624066183432&q=patriarchy+definition&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDu9H_xaLxAhVJTd8KHcvfAZoQBSgAegQIARAw&biw=1093&bih=526),"" ""[dominance of a society by men, or the values that uphold such dominance](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/patriarchy),"" ""[a society, system, or group in which men dominate women and have the power and authority](https://sociologydictionary.org/patriarchy/),"" etc. Additionally, as I explain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/haivde/trans_people_of_reddit_would_you_still_be_trans/fv6m1ak/):
> 
> > ""gender"" is variously defined as ""[social norms, attitudes and activities that society deems more appropriate for one sex over another](https://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/),"" ""[attitudes, behaviors, norms, and roles that a society or culture associated with an individual‚Äôs sex](https://sociologydictionary.org/gender/),"" ""[roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men](https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender),"" etc. Basically, gender consists of sex-based behavioral norms, attitudes, and perceptions that govern male and female behavior.
> 
> Patriarchy simply refers to male social domination (of women), whereas gender norms regulate the behavior of and apply distinctive rules against both sexes. Not only can the latter exist sans patriarchy or even within a matriarchy, but the former can exist sans the latter, i.e., it's possible in principle for men to dominate women in a genderless society. There is no necessary connection between patriarchy and gender; again, they are not the same thing.

I don't feel targeted as a rapist or scum when looking at feminism. Nor am I threatened by the more mainstream goals of feminism (healthcare, wages, justice). Again I think a lot of people get caught up in the trap of listening to loudest and angriest individuals in a group and thinking they represent the entire group.

It's the Zero Sum attitude between the genders that I think gets my goat the most. Women gaining more agency and power in society does not mean men get less. When working for a more equal society we are hurting ourselves by working AGAINST women.

Think of the draft. No it's not right in my opinion that I had to sign up for selective service and women don't. The solution is not to drag women down and make them sign up for the draft. The solution is dismantle the draft for everyone. 

Likewise think of the justice system. Men get harsher sentences on average. The solution is not to give harsher sentences to women. The solution would be to remove bias (gender, racial, and economic) from the justice system.

OP's post was divisive in that way and I disagreed with him. The whole all men are an active part of the patriarchy didn't ring true for me. I don't think of feminism as anti men nor do I feel the need to stand in the way of women and their goals of equality.

We have a similar problem with paternity leave here in the UK - only about 18% of men claim their legal entitlement.

There have been some high profile scandals, e.g. finding that the top female BBC presenters were being paid a lot less than their male counterparts, which came to light because the BBC was forced into transparency over salaries.

 Imagine being so intolerant of male heterosexuality, that it's considered acceptable and commercially viable to police men for even looking at women. In what world would men be forced to require a woman's consent to even find her attractive or to desire her attention, yet still also call women oppressed?

And ran an advert campaign in cramberra called 'boys will be boys' which was later considered sexist

And once had sheilas wheels, an insurance company that discriminated men and became international until the uk and europe abolished seperate car insurance rates for women

2. Staring is rude
Thats what i was taught growing up, so nobody should be staring at anyone, least of all where alcohol is involved, because two guys staring at one another in a bar or club is likely to result in a fight.

Staring ar someone lustfully is just creepy (be it a man at a woman or a woman at a man), it kinda reminds me of the smiler logo (alton towers ride, google it if you dont know of it)

So for me its unnatural, so i do see their point on harrassment as it is antisocial behaviour

But... How does that get policed
Ie how do you tell the difference between a malicious stair vs an innocent one

Examples:

25 yr old in a club, sees a girl across the club, he thinks he went to school with, but cant be sure as shes older and hair style, colour changed and might of put on a bit of weight, might of lost a bit so face has a 80% recemblance

What if he has a lot on his mind and just staring into space but happens to be a girl other side, he isnt intending to stare at her his just dazed

Now this one is illegal, he could be on drugs and monged, again his no threat to the girl, he isnt thinking of the girl, he just isnt concious of his actions because his drugged up (i suppose the club will welcome kicking him out for licence purposes)


What does amaze me is
In the late 90s early 2000s it was considered more risky to meet people online and unsafe vs a pub or a club, now this article is saying, dont come to the club to pick up a partner

that's why it's always going to be enabled by rich capitalist men at the very top pretending to be white knights who are for things like this bc it reinforces their dominance hierarchy and gives them permission to publicly shame to make examples of their competition when an opportunity comes up to spin a situation to make something innocent appear malevolent, bc it makes them more powerful as well. so it's a win win for women and rich men. 


bc obviously this bar owner who's implementing this system is immune from being kicked out of his own club no matter how many women he approaches or what actual sexual harassment he does. 


rules for thee but not for me is the history of our species, its important to remember that freedom and democracy are the exception not the rule. in every system except democracy, dumb rules exactly like this were used to keep the average guy down with stupid rules like royalty, caste systems and bullshit religious customs. and now the feminist agenda is trying to bring those same dumb types of customs to a free democratic state. 


it's no exaggeration to say bringing violence and the police state into nightclubs is an attack on men's freedom. creepy men who get handsy or aggressive and sexually harass women are already kicked out of clubs or pulled away by men like you and me bc 99% of men AREN'T criminals. only 1% is. so an unnecessary extra - ""don't even look or talk to them"" without asking rule on 100% of men that they're trying to enforce , is only made so they can abuse it on people they dislike.

""The fresh policy states that ""Club 77 is not a place to come to if your sole purpose is to 'pick up'"".


when people want to go to a place to not be picked up and hangout with only their friends and family - they go to a fucking restaurant where you get your own table and it's considered taboo for strangers to approach YOUR table and try to pick you up. 


restaurants are perfectly happy to serve your exclusive group of friends just drinks instead of food as long as you're paying their upcharges and everyone expects to be kicked out if they're disturbing guests with horniness bc it's not the place for it. that's what this ""club"" should switch to- a fucking restaurant.


but when people want to meet new strangers to pickup - they go to bars and clubs.


of course people are usually more subtle about it instead of being that obvious about it going up to each other saying - ""hey , we're at a bar/club instead of a restaurant , so we obviously both want to fuck, let's go fuck."" 


sure, some people do the direct approach with the ol ""do you wanna get out of here?"" - and sometimes it works tbh 


other times it doesn't work, so they're simply told no thank you. 


and 99% of the time that's fine and everyone goes on with their lives bc we all accept that we're adults and we risk the slight discomfort of being propositioned if you go to a place designed for propositions... what do they think alcohol - the sole beverage of nightclubs - is for ?



 it's for getting enough liquid courage to talk to strangers and ask each other out. how that's done is usually polices itself by what works individually- very good looking guys get success by doing pretty much anything. less good looking guys have to be a little more personable a little more creative and of course buying women alcohol helps them get success too.


but to single handedly attempt to police drunk people even TALKING to each other ? ya i don't see that ending well. why not just go to a Christian dance at that point? either their atmosphere is going to be so incredibly dry and boring that they'll make the already difficult low margin nightclub business even harder than it already is and go broke.


or it'll somehow work and people will come and try to play their stupid little feminist game to impress each other - for a whole 6 months while the fad is cool- and then move on to everywhere that's not so uptight. 


so it'll hopefully fail sooner than later. bc if this shit catches on it's the end of nightclub culture . creepy guys already get kicked out of nightclubs, they don't need to kick out regular guys just for shooting their shots where they should be shooting their shots.",mindset_grindset,t2_h9cqpgm0,16,0,reddit3

if that happens - all that happens - AND the police get called :


‚ÄúIf you are, for example, staring at someone from afar ‚Äì if the attention you are giving someone is unwanted, that is considered harassment,"" the club said.


‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre being harassed by another person or receiving unwanted attention, please seek them out or tell our staff immediately.


""We adopt a policy of ‚Äòalways believe the report‚Äô in cases of harassment and feeling unsafe.


""If we receive reports of any behaviour that has made someone feel uncomfortable, the reported individual will be removed from the venue and the police will be called.""


so basically - you're minding your own business walking up to get a drink, some girl happens to be in your eyeline, for any reason whatsoever she decides she's uncomfortable - maybe you didn't offer to buy her a drink and she's mad, maybe she doesn't like your race, maybe she just hates men- so she immediately waves the feminist white knight police over and no questions asked they jump you and kick you out AND call the police to send you to jail. 


my guess is if this happens a lot then the police will just hangout nearby or outside like they do at hotspots in my town, so it'll be very litteraly straight to jail if you get kicked out. my guess is they'll hire off duty cops for security anyway to basically skip the middle man so these pink vest white knight feminists are essentially police , so if you try to argue or drunkenly throw an elbow as a natural reaction before you know what's going on then you'll have the police throw the book at you for disorderly/resisting arrest. 


so essentially now at this club and others if it catches on- any woman regardless of income, mental health or believability- will have the direct and encouraged armed police state to enforce any ""uncomfortable"" feelings or false accusations they have out of spite or any reason whatsoever.

ilqhdkl,t1_ilq7tta,2022-08-25 14:08:57,MensRights,">Any man that goes to this club is an idiot.

I did a stint as a bouncer in a club during college, and let me tell you that any man that goes to a club is an idiot. They are pretty much money extraction pumps for thirsty guys. We had quotas of who got let in, and pretty much hot girls could walk right past the line. The logic here was that lots of guys would come to where the hot girls are at, and spend a fortune on drinks to try to get in their pants. The girls were aware of this and a lot would just plan on free drinks. Furthermore, some establishments would have paid girls there in the crowd with the express purpose of getting guys to buy them drinks.

So repeatedly Id see a PUA type 'work' a girl all night. She'd literally just walk away from the dude when the local football star showed up, and he'd seal the deal with a nod and grunt then leave with her. All in under half an hour... without buying single drink. Which was absolutely the worst scenario for the club, TBH.

As an aside a girl I was with in college had two roommates who were identical twins. They would openly brag about going out to the club and getting free drinks from guys. If he tried to get their number, they'd give him the number to the local pizza joint. They thought this was hilarious. 

Bottle service was a massive scam. Most of the time the venues just kept refilling the expensive import vodka bottles with cheap stuff from the local supermarket. The 'VIP' room is pretty much the same concept, but for suckers who are known to have loads of  money. Especially the ones that get boozed and cause damage, which they will charge the customer for at an up-charge. 

Even the parking was a scam. One of the venues I worked had VIP parking for $25 bucks. Pay your fee and the guy across the street would undo the little chain across the drive and you got a convenient parking space in a nice grass lot. Thing is they didn't own the lot, and the church that did sent them a cease and desist once they figured it out. 

Working the front doors, you'd better believe we had quota's. 10% minorities, 50% women, 40% white guys. Because for a thirsty dude you want it to appear that there's lots of hot available girls for him to buy drinks for, and if one doesn't pan out there's more you try your luck with. It's akin to slot machines, and I'd say the psychology is pretty much the same.",RunawayGrain,t2_i6tf1,42,0,reddit3

That's most of the West to some extent nowadays, but particularly English-speaking countries, which have it by far the worst imo with the exception of some outliers like Sweden which are equally messed up. Sure, other countries also have problems with feminism, and it has filtered into their discourse and some cases legal systems, but the Anglosphere nevertheless stands out for how pervasive its influence is, and how much it has come to influence nevermind political discussion, but simple daily interactions.

As an example of this phenomenon, France is often seen as a very liberal country, but surprisingly to some, not very feminist. I live in Canada, and it's quite common to see French people immigrate to Quebec (I've been to Quebec and speak passable French, but don't currently live there), and a sentiment that you hear again and again from French expats is that Quebec is far more liberal than France, and feminism ""is taken seriously"" and ""not a joke"". Of course, Quebec is not exactly an English-speaking region, but most people speak English to some extent and most of Montreal is fluent in English, although French is still the native language for most people, so the influence is not as great, and this is reflected in the attitudes. While Quebec is certainly feminist, I certainly find its women more feminine, open, and less angry and judgmental than English Canada's where a significant portion of women seem downright crazy.

Also, I immigrated myself as a kid from an Eastern European country and have always found English cultures to be rather cold, reserved, and restrained in comparison, with few people expressing their true feelings, creating an ideal environment for something like feminism to take hold and thrive. About the only English-speaking regions that are not fully crazy yet in terms of male-female interactions are the Deep South  and states like Florida, where there is a more conservative culture and there are more Hispanics, who are warmer, and tend to be less feminist. In most of the rest of the English-speaking world, normal interactions between the sexes are pretty much a thing of the past.",shydude92,t2_vi41h,1,0,reddit3

Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night.

If want to you feel sexy you can just as easily dress up that way when you're having a wine party, sleepover, whatever with just the girls. However guess what from all the girls I know, they don't dress up in the sake sexy clubbing clothes then. Nor does the majority of girls/women ...  
If it's just to feel sexy you can put on music at home and dance alone or with 1 or 2 friends, then there's no reason to go to that club.

The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind. 

However this is the crux of the problem.
You can either get angry at everyone when they keep on flirting/staring/whatever after you say you aren't interested or at no one. However enough girls will first get pissed at a guy they don't find attractive and then do the exact same with a guy they do find attractive but play hard to get. That's just dumb and inconsistent and even hypocrite behaviour. 
You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. Most guys in clubs just do what they had the most succes with ... Or often what they see others do that are successful. 
Either that behaviour is okay or it's not, shouldn't matter if it's done by person A or person B, assuming they are both strangers to you. However that's not what happens in practice and that's part of the problem ...

You want consent and no staring, then you need to be extremely consistent with that to everyone. However that's not going to happen in practice because most women and many many men, aren't consistent in that regard.

Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...",NwbieGD,t2_3kfvddv,19,0,reddit3

> Why women/girls dress up like that when going out, but not when just home alone for the night

Because men and women can like to look good for themselves, it can help you feel more confident, show off to friends, you‚Äôre dressing for the occasion. That‚Äôs ontop of the people who would also do it for attention

Dressing up at home isn‚Äôt an occasion, it‚Äôs not exciting, you aren‚Äôt really doing anything. If you‚Äôre going out clubbing, you want to look good, you want to dress up in clubbing attire, you want to dress to match the energy of the people and the music at the event you‚Äôre at. You can‚Äôt get that same energy or atmosphere in you‚Äôre basement with ¬£5 wine and a handful of friends, it‚Äôs a different vibe 

Not to mention how it doesn‚Äôt really matter, dressing up still isn‚Äôt an invitation for unwanted interactions. Dressing slutty isn‚Äôt ‚Äòasking for it‚Äô, because people are individuals and have their own reasons. Making grimy assumptions is the incorrect way to approach strangers. You probe, you get a response, and whatever response you receive you respect, simple. 


> The point is you can not be selective in who is allowed to stare and who isn't, not only is that incredibly unreasonable and hypocrite, that's you wanting other people to be able to know what you want without you telling them, people can't read your mind.

Why not? Personal preference or their individual choices absolutely should be respected. An invitation for one person isn‚Äôt an invitation for everyone, that‚Äôs common sense. If you ask someone not to stare or make it‚Äôs obvious you aren‚Äôt interested and they carry on, it‚Äôs unwanted, it‚Äôs making them uncomfortable, it not unreasonable for them to be told to stop

> You know this pushy behaviour from guys is often, not always, learned behaviour because it worked for them well in the past. 

Doesn‚Äôt make it at all appropriate, and it‚Äôs not restricted to men, woman can be pushy too

> Either that behaviour is okay or it's not

Not really, it‚Äôs not black and white. You can want to interact with person A and not interact with person B, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that

> Last problem is that everyone wants different things, some women want to be approached a certain way and will get annoyed if someone asks for consent for everything and since people can't read minds, you can't know what approach someone wants ...

And that just boils down to respect

If you‚Äôre staring at someone for a prolonged period of time with no response, maybe you should take the hint? 

If you‚Äôre staring at someone and that attention is being reciprocated, equally you should take the hint and take it further. It‚Äôs just being respectful and having basic communication skills, understanding the ‚Äòyes‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äôs‚Äô",-Soggy-Potato-,t2_rbmk0wd,-13,0,reddit3

VIP service is a scam. At best you have someone of the opinion that they are a big shot and don't want to be bothered by the public. We had an local MLB player guy that frequented one of the establishments I worked. He had a bit of an overblown opinion of himself, hence the VIP room. Frankly, he was a jerk too. He'd get wasted and have a bunch of barfly girls on him like leeches on an old mule. Then he'd do some minor damage.

Unless you managed to find a place absent of security and often fueled by drugs, you were always subject to get thrown out, for anything, really. But if women complained, you did not have the option to stay inside or even argue, that has always been the case. It still is, unless a man is really rich or is with somebody really rich, he's really not in any position to act out of line. In fact there's plenty of places you probably also get a beating from security after being escorted out, even if you really did nothing just because they can, nobody will see anything and the police will do nothing because it's much easier for them to look away when a few testosterone junkies beat somebody up who didn't yet get the memo than having to respond to some bickering every ten minutes.

The only difference is that usually women didn't care what anybody was doing as long as they didn't intentionally interacted with them over and over. And why would they? However a policy this explicitly laying down that women can get men thrown out even if there is no evidence against them and there is no possibility that they won't be believed, and even the police gets involved, will only have one effect: it's going to encourage even women who never cared and still don't care to be ""empowered"" and ruin at least the night of somebody they think shouldn't be there for whatever reason. And if the insanity continues and we actually see laws pop up making ""staring"" and other thought crimes illegal, men will get their lives ruined even by just not looking good enough and standing ""too close"" to an ""empowered"" woman in a crowd of hundreds where dropping a needle would be impossible, like subways.",,,1,0,reddit3

You're right about this part. But the yes and nos aren't in English. These communication skills aren't at all 'basic' for some, especially men. It's a skill that needs to be developed and can only be developed through interaction, not being told do this, don't do that etc 
intellectually.


I think it would be good for all men to learn and develop these skills but there is no manual for what these yes and nos are. What is lacking is strong male role models and father's demonstrating how to be a man and how to understand and treat women, a lot of which is obviously thanks to feminism. But because of this, a lot of men don't know how to be men and aren't even allowed to be men except only when given permission from a woman.  'Explicit' permission that comes in indirect so called communication, just basically hints.

Dating and engaging women for men is becoming more and more like being a tomb raider. You have to decipher heiroglyphics you haven't been taught or shown how to read and any wrong turn is booby trapped. 

This is how it feels, basically. Yet women in traditional mens roles get to complain and have the world bend to them. That men aren't allowed exclusive spaces, that any women no matter how unwelcome they are have every right to not only exist in any space men can be, but demand that it must cater to them and overlook their deficiencies. E.g. women 'not being heard' or promoted in certain areas needs quotas to address any perceived imbalance against women. Why is it never asked that women just work on their competativeness and assertiveness.

In the dating and social world where men are typically disadvantaged, it's not hey, we have to be inclusive of everyone and their relative skill socially, like it is now with skills in the man's world. It's no, you're not reading the hints correctly and you have 'upset' a woman, get the fuck out you creep.

I think you are wrong about the feeling sexy part. It's not the vibe that makes you feel sexy, it's being desired. What you are wearing inspires desire in men and that in turn makes you feel sexy. If the same scenario of you and your friends hanging out happened, except a guy you were attracted to was coming, I imagine you would also want to look sexy, but sleepover sexy or whatever. The difference is the man to be masculine to make your time worth while being feminine, getting dressed up and looking good. Not the vibe.

So you having done your part in being feminine and dressing up to go out to the club a guy then has to be masculine and make the move. If you don't like the guy and his 'masculine' in the way he approached you, you can have him removed.


Imagine if there was a club where men could be 'offended' by a woman's appearance and have her removed, it would be extremely dehumanising and disgusting.

 But thats happening now apparently to men and it reflects I think a deeper truth. That a lot of women don't see men as human. I think the constant dehumanisation by women drives up the 'creepiness' of the guy. If a lot of women talked to men like humans and not rapists and murderers in waiting, a lot of men would be able to get over whatever it is that makes them appear 'creepy'

I think the position you are arguing from has some truth to it. But it's also shit from the other side is what I'm trying to portray.",,,2,0,reddit3

He said that in his state, the court usually does not reduce child support for people who quit jobs in order to go to school. So you might be able to appeal the case and win (he said that appealing child support cases is possible), but you'd need to do it within 10 days of the decision.   


As far as the bias itself goes, he said that without a stenographer to record what was said, the court is unlikely to punish the judge. The complaint would carry more weight if it came from a lawyer.

But there is one other thing i want to get at. I know its not popular around here to say it but this worries me:

*So I started thinking about opening an anti-feminism online store some time ago.*

While feminism is able to get away with passing off hate as progress the MRM cant do so. Remember they have the high ground.

Personally i think you should frame this as being pro male rather than anti feminist. 

By doing that if your experience became a major incident it would force people to ask whats wrong with helping men and rob feminists of the ability to cry about it being antifeminist.

Remove mention of feminism and they have to stretch to make it all about them.

Frame this as several companies turned your pro male shirt designs away and when people ask why you THEN you show them the termination letters you got and make sure to highlight that last one.

It puts feminists on the defensive to either disassociate from feminists like that and admit that being pro male is not inherently bad or they will remain silent and the public is left wondering why feminists are against pro male material.",Leinadro,t2_5xunv,78,0,reddit1

I think the Civil Rights Act only covers discrimination based on specific criteria, such as sex, race, religion, etc. I could be wrong. I'm not a lawyer. If I'm right in my understanding, then being discriminatory against an individual is okay, just not okay if it's fueled by a larger discriminatory context covered under the CRA.

>I have no doubt that the business does plenty of business with men, and thus it would be reeeaally hard to make a case that their refusal to print a certain slogan stems from demographic discrimination.

You're probably right. But flip the script. What if a MRA guy owned a silk screening place, and a feminist wanted to print some innocuous women empowerment shirts, but the guy refused because he found it offensive because he was an MRA. I think you'd see outrage, even if the guy came out and said, ""Hey, I sell to women all the time."" But is there a case there? Dunno.

cu1ap0l,t1_cu198uj,2015-08-13 05:31:24,MensRights,"Could be. Is that evidence of illegal discrimination? Doubt it. Imagine a few ways that a printing business might respond to customers:

* ""We print shirts for female clients but not male clients."" - Discriminatory, grounds for lawsuit.

* ""We print pro-woman slogans for female clients but not male clients"" - Discriminatory, grounds for lawsuit.

* ""We print pro-woman slogans for *any client,* but never pro-man slogans or pro-equality slogans."" - Does not suggest illegal discrimination. Political views are not a protected class, and if the job is refused on the grounds of *content,* that's very different than if it's refused on grounds of gender or race. 

Naturally, this goes back to the gay cake thing. Couldn't a baker make a case that they gladly serve gay clients, but that they are politically/religiously/personally opposed to content promoting gay marriage, and thus never make gay-themed wedding cakes for *any* client, gay or straight? Not a lawyer, but I'd think that could be a consistent, non-discriminatory position, though they might have an uphill battle demonstrating it, particularly with gay marriage now legally equivalent to straight marriage. 

It's risky territory, because further down the slippery slope is the rural pharmacist who won't sell Plan B because of religious scruples.

>But there are narrowly defined areas of this law, giving wiggle room for litigation such as this.

There is not one ounce of wiggle room in this situation to claim gender discrimination. Just point out to me anywhere in the email where it says that because of penis they won't print the shirt. I mean seriously you are grasping at straws. She CLEARLY states the reason that the company won't print it is because the company doesn't want to be associated with his view.

The difference is that the bakery had baked cakes for weddings in the past. Therefore when this gay couple asked to bake a cake for their wedding, and the company  refused because the company did not support gay marriage they were engaging in a discriminatory practice. The specific reason they would not bake the cake is because it was for a gay couple. That is a discriminatory practice.

It was meant to report sexual assault online anonymously (it was on google docs), and it did ask for the name of the alleged perpetrator. If you gave a name, that person would be called down to the Dean's office and warned about being a rapist.

Because stuff like this is actually pretty difficult to track back to someone. Swatting has been a growing issue in the gaming community for a while now (popular CS:GO players have been swatted while livestreaming several times before) and there really isn't much the cops can do about it. They show up at the victims house, look around, and after a while they realize that they've been played, by which time the swatter has hung up the payphone and gone home.

Up here in Canada, there was recently a case where [some teenage asshat](http://www.theprovince.com/news/Coquitlam+teen+swatter+jailed+told+grow/11201987/story.html) got busted for swatting and sending fake bomb threats (even to Disneyland! Who the fuck goes after Disneyland?!), and it made national news! People need to learn that using the police as a weapon is not ok in *any* context.

As for mail, it's easy to make it completely untraceable. Just don't write your home address on a package when you send it, and wear gloves while handling it if you want to be really sure that nobody can trace it back to you. Sadly, that's the price of privacy and convenience in the mail system.",gellis12,t2_e7irp,6,0,reddit1

This is completely obvious by your attempt to conflate an opinion with the sex of an individual.

YES! because sex is a protected class, opinions are not! At least you know your argument is not realistic.

You have apparently never gotten a ticket. If you get a ticket, you can go to a small court hearing to contest the ticket (and 50% of the time the cop won't bother showing up, so it gets dropped right away), or you can just mail in a cheque or pay with a credit card. You don't even need to go into court to pay the fine. As for ""on threat of greater violence,"" you're a paranoid asshat. Nobody ever got beaten up by a cop because they didn't pay a speeding ticket. If you don't pay or contest the fine, it just gets sold to a debt collection agency. Stop being so paranoid.

> From the moment they flash their lights / turn on their siren, they're threatening the use of escalating physical force.

No, flashing their lights or turning on the siren is just telling the person in the other car to pull over. It could be because they were speeding, it could be because their tail light was out, or it could be because the cop noticed their fuel door was open and wanted to let them know. It's no more threatening than someone saying ""Excuse me"" to you on the street. It could be leading up to a mugging, or they could just want to tell you that you dropped your wallet.
