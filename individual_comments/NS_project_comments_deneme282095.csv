Toxic jobs are often a result of shortcomings of the owners/managers and nothing to do with you. They're not able to solve an issue, so you become the scapegoat for those issues:  
\-It's not the company's business model that's unprofitable- it's your lack of productivity!  
\-It's not that the procedures are inefficient- you're not following them properly!  
\-It's not the products that have flaws- it's how you're handling customer service!

In one job, I was consistently the top performer. I was the dude everyone came to when they didn't know what to do. I trained new hires. Yet, management would regularly pull me in the office and wear me out and threaten my job. It was so bad that I would sit in my car outside the office and smack myself in the face to hype myself up enough to go in. I finally quit, and immediately felt like a weight had literally been lifted from my shoulders.

My last job was in a call center and while it wasn't as dire as the above example, constantly having everything I do tracked down to the second and audited definitely wore on me. I coped by being cynical. I went from being the bright-eyed, enthusiastic, extra mile type to just doing the bare minimum because doing the bare minimum was better for my metrics.

Abstract:

>**Objectives:** This study sought to assess the association between long working hours, psychosocial safety climate (PSC), work engagement (WE) and new major depression symptoms emerging over the next 12 months. PSC is the work climate supporting workplace psychological health.  
>  
>**Setting:** Australian prospective cohort population data from the states of New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia.  
>  
>**Participants:** At Time 1, there were 3921 respondents in the sample. Self-employed, casual temporary, unclassified, those with working hours <35 (37% of 2850) and participants with major depression symptoms at Time 1 (6.7% of 1782) were removed. The final sample was a population-based cohort of 1084 full-time Australian employees.  
>  
>**Primary and secondary outcome measures:** The planned and measured outcomes were new cases of major depression symptoms.  
>  
>**Results:** Long working hours were not significantly related to new cases of major depression symptoms; however, when mild cases were removed, the 41–48 and ≥55 long working hour categories were positively related to major depression symptoms. Low PSC was associated with a threefold increase in risk for new major depression symptoms. PSC was not related to long working hours, and long working hours did not mediate the relationship between PSC and new cases of major depression symptoms. The inverse relationship between PSC and major depression symptoms was stronger for males than females. Additional analyses identified that WE was positively related to long working hours. Long working hours (41–48 and ≥55 hours) mediated a positive relationship between WE and major depression symptoms when mild cases of major depression were removed.  
>  
>**Conclusion:** The results suggest that low workplace PSC and potentially long working hours (41–48; ≥55 hours/week) increase the risk of new major depression symptoms. Furthermore, high WE may increase long working hours and subsequent major depression symptoms.",AnakinGabriel,t2_e5iny,2,0,reddit2

Arguably it should have an effect as productivity has been proven to diminish in depressed workers. However, if the workers are easily replaced without any cost, and if psychopath leaders increase value for a company more than that they decrease value through causing depression by creating a toxic environment, then a company will not care.

Challenge is that this is such a subjective and relative conclusion. One person’s definition of these qualifiers may vary greatly from another persons definition. 

We—as a society—need to get to what truly defines a “toxic” workplace. That way you can hold employers accountable with objective metrics. And employees know the standard that is expected of them; anything less isn’t toxic, you just didn’t meet the standard.

h748sq7,t3_oujqvq,2021-07-30 19:13:26,science,"My anecdote:
I worked for a private business for a few years. Went into the office everyday, unless I was feeling sick or unable to go to the office, then I would either call in or work from home depending on how I felt. No problems. I was happy working and felt taken care of. 

COVID hits and we're all ordered to work from home. No problems there! We end up having the most successful year of business during that time.

Then in April of this year we're ordered to return back to the office. Leadership had turned over at the end of 2020, so there's an odd incentive to get everyone back in the office.

I worked from home on a Friday since returning back to the office because I wasn't feeling well and thought better to keep it at home and not bring it in the office. The following Monday my Boss's Boss sends me an email (and everyone else that didn't come into work) asking for my justification for working remotely (we don't have a formal policy, but I did contact my direct supervisor and Boss about my situation on Friday). As it turns out, HR was monitoring all the badge swipes at the employee entrance and was providing reports to the senior leadership, having them follow up on why employees weren't showing up.

Long story short, I got out of there because of the terrible working conditions and the torpedoed, toxic work culture. I no longer felt recognized or taken care of, and micromanagement had increased severely. There was a lot of cognitive dissonance from what Leadership was saying and what they were actually doing. 

Today, I'm much happier as a result!",spencerg83,t2_7adr7,1,0,reddit2

h753zap,t3_oujqvq,2021-07-30 23:07:00,science,"I suffered an extreme mental breakdown due to stress and it took me well over two years to truly heal from it. Even then, I am not the same person I was before. It was genuinely extreme. I was one person starting, managing and running an entire cosmetics brand from product development, marketing, graphic design, copy, product description, web design. Initially, I hired a team to help me with this but the company hired a CEO.

She took everyone from my team for another brand that she was in charge of launching and left me by myself. I held out for about a year and a half like that before I hit a wall and suffered a serious meltdown due to burnout. 

There are no words to describe how serious burnout is and WHY you need to leave as soon as a work environment is leading you in that direction.

If I think back to those years, there are holes in my memory. My brain was stretched so thin that I cannot recall a lot of things.

My personal life disappeared. I am a person that routinely has a lot of friends. Guess what? I dropped off the face of the planet for about 2 or 3 years and had to rebuild a social network. I had no friends. My life was work.

Because my life was work, my identity became fused with this job. This not only caused severe depression, but suicide ideation. I'm not a suicidal person. 

Symptoms weren't just emotional or mental - they were physical too. I am still dealing with psoriasis that started due to stress. Stress caused a lifelong skin condition that I will now have to live with. Forever. My life now revolves around stress management.

But what I think really scared me was my memory loss and inability to retain information in those days. Anyone who knows me knows how unlike me that is - my memory has always been one of my favorite attributes about myself. I did not have the ability to retain information whatsoever and in one case, I straight up forgot how to get home. I had taken that route daily for 2 years.",,,1,0,reddit2

I was a sales rep, and the owner of the company changed my commission structure, but wouldn’t give the new structure to me in writing. The company itself had no new products that were company designed, and all modern products were OEMed from others. Our prices were high and lead times were long with promised ship dates slipping on the regular. Things were bad. The owner of the company would gaslight me when I brought concerns, and towards the end of my employment with them, I was recording every conversation I had with that owner on my Apple Watch. 

I remember driving in to work one day, and my left arm start to ache with pain going into my hand and up the back of my neck. I thought to myself, “ I’m having a heart attack. This is how I die.” I continued to drive, and realized I didn’t care.  I got to work and immediately called my GP, and at my doctor’s appointment a few days later, I was told that I had a panic attack and put on antidepressants. I left that job in May 2020.

After college I worked at a coffee house for about 3 years. The food industry spend me socially, but I loved it and worked up to being able to open the stand at 5 AM.

Now I work a desk job, from home, and while I enjoyed the idea of working from home at first, I realized I couldn’t love what I was doing. Our first busy season was right after I was hired, and I had bare essential training and only 3 months in the office before COVID. Within 3 months of working from home I received a verbal warning, and was explained to that I couldn’t fulfill all my duties in a timely manner. I was asking for help all the time and getting delayed responses, sometimes for days. After a drowning experience, I learned about a month ago we had over 300 more man hours of work assigned to us than any other of our pods. I was literally too scared to bring this up at my previous review, and only received a 1% raise due to a “satisfactory work ethic.”

For the first year at my new job, I was paranoid I was going to be terminated over every minor mistake and felt as if every question I asked was a stupid one, because that was how I was treated by my previous boss. His abuse exacerbated my depression and anxiety symptoms and finally, at the end, I couldn't take it anymore and quit. There wasn't a day near the end where I didn't cry while getting ready to go in and driving my car off the nearest bridge was sounding more and more like a good idea to just make it stop. The latter seems silly and dramatic to me now, but I was in a very dark place mentally and emotionally and just wanted a way out. 

The people I work with now are amazing, kind, and supportive. A lot of them share and understand my humor, which tends to be dark/droll/dramatic-for-emphasis, and I think a third of them might be related to me somehow with just how easily we vibe.

I can't describe the amount of relief that's given me. I feel more comfortable with myself than I ever have. The money isn't great, but I'm lucky enough to be able to pay my bills and put some money aside every month to build my savings. I've even made new friends, and while they may only be work friends, I'm plenty happy with that. I may not ever fully heal from the scars my previous boss left, but I'm petty as hell and am bound and determined to thrive just to spite him.

Then after a few weeks of noticing something in the air the hammer finally dropped, I was fired and kicked to the curb. It was an awful feeling (and still is a year later) but also deep down I felt a bit of weight lift off my shoulders.

My resume finally went out and I was fortunate to interview with a small handful of companies. I finally landed with a group that is made me feel more at home in the first month than I ever felt in all the years of working at my last job.

I felt great at my job, found it to be a very healthy and positive environment to work in, but somehow there were still issues popping up. I felt attacked, felt I had to do too much, felt like everyone was against me at some point. But I really liked all of my colleagues, my boss. I never had the idea anything was wrong at work, but apparantly everyone else did.

Then I suddenly and finally realised that basically every one of those issues were traceable back to myself. I was the stress factor.

Once I had the 'click' mentally, ""saw the light"" that it wasn't my colleagues attacking me, but actually trying to help me, everything (!) changed.

I apologized to everyone, stopped seeing criticism as personal attacks, started taking more responsibility and ownership, and eventually made not just my own work environment and happiness better, but for the whole company.

If everything seems fine to you, everything seems to go well, but everything and everyone around you seems to be stressed and has the feeling something is wrong, it's probably you.

A work related psychological phenomenon called 'burn out' (but like hEAVY french accent) looks like it's bout to be added to the list of work related injury. And it also looks like it will be taken pretty seriously in that employers can face jail time/heafty fines if found to be responsible. 

The symptoms that lead to a burnout are quite extensive and varied (short temper, weight change, insomnia, anxiety, easily sick, migraines, sore muscles or back). A documentary was made about very serious burnouts where the people had been under so much chronic stress they had damaged their brains. One had dementia like symptoms. Another had nerve damage. One had no memory of a 3 year period of their life. Another had a blackout while driving and crashed their car. All of them had very very poor short term working memory, depression, suicidal ideation and physical issues. 

Teatment usually requires a mix off sick leave (paid and validated 3 months at a time by a dr) and the employer addressing the changing the current work environment to reduce stress. What is happening now, as there are no current legal consequences for work burnout (and some companies are just that toxic), the employee has a burnout and goes on sick leave, they replace them and never have to make changes.",Nervous_Tennis1843,t2_bgi2pcia,266,0,reddit2

However, there's another possibility. When you are fired, your manager has to justify a reason why you were fired. If  you were found to be just doing your job, that reflects very badly on him or her and strengthens your argument when you go to his superior.

And think about the implications of this in abusive dysfunctional families in which one member, the black sheep, is acting out all the issue the family causes while everyone else either perpetrates it or represses it.  The one person who has a breakdown and can’t tolerate the situation is ironically the *most sane* person in the family for refusing to tolerate abuse, and yet is often treated as the most insane and locked up, drugged etc.   such families will continue to be dysfunctional while “treating” the only person who “acts out” as both punishment for the black sheep for challenging them or trying to liberate themselves, and to pretend they’ve done something to fix “the problem.”  The chemical imbalance theory isolates and blames the black sheep and exempts the family dysfunction from further examination.   It’s very toxic and harmful.  Especially if the abusers or perpetuators of dysfunction are the ones paying the doctor, the doctor will be reluctant to openly admit they are the problem.

Yeah, those words work. So does toxic. There's more than one way to describe something, especially coloquialy. 

I could see how you would interpret it that way, and it's a very literal definition ( though I think you would describe the chemicals rather than the workplace to make this point clear, if you want to get semantic) , but describing a bad social environment as toxic is a different and generally accepted use of the word.  Do you think it's legitimately confusing? Because I think most people reading that would know what's intended. It's really not a buzzword, though it has become more frequently used.

Like the only way I see to create a large successful company is to believe that the product or service you are offering is valuable enough to justify the time of all the people involved. That confidence is how you garner a following. How do you build and maintain that confidence without at least the appearance of narcissism.
Capitalism isn't exactly structured to reward humility. 

This question is so important to me as a young entrepreneur it keeps me up at night sometimes. Am I destined to be a narcissist if I find success?

The most common conception - having or projecting an inflated idea of one's self-worth - does not by itself make one a narcissist. The diagnostic criteria requires that multiple markers be observed. The pathology is driven by a need to counteract ego weakness and ego fragility, so it includes shifting blame, dealing insults in order to suggest a favorable comparison of themselves to others, gaslighting and other manipulations to maintain feelings of control, power and dominance, to name just a few. 

Grandiosity(inflating) is also used to selfishly and dishonestly improve another's perception of that individual- indicating self-promotion, like lying on a job application.   The study used ""the number of photos [of the CEO] displayed in the company's annual report"" as  1 of 3  measures of narcissism, even though self-promotion in business for financial goals is extremely common. The study also cites multiple examples of fraud and other unethical behaviors and attributes them to narcissism, when clearly they're the actions of white collar criminals.

The authors of the study appear to have fallen prey to the fallacy of reciprocal logic- that since all narcissists are deceitful, that all deceitful people are narcissistic. They fail to see multiple purposes for many of the behaviors they cite.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,1,0,reddit3

When a narcissist in leadership attempts to protect themselves from criticism, it effectively does the same for their company.

Instead of pro-social guilt, which allows for responsible corrective actions, they experience a self-centered shame, which allows for none. It's merely coincidental that the maladaptive, antagonistic traits which help them counteract that burden of shame, also works well to manipulate others for the purpose of making money.

>Where is the line between being confident person and being a narcissist.

Narcissists are not actually confident. They are bold, a product of being both dishinhibited and callous. There is a difference. To make it as clear as I can, narcissism is more about manipulation and entitlement, than mere egotism. Most people understand narcissism as grandiosity but if narcissists were only about that, they would be mostly laughable and harmless.

The problem that I think arises, and some other posters have mentioned too, is that capitalist organizations themselves reward these sort of narcissistic behaviors with the ability to extract profit. That is a problem with the system itself, not just CEOs or corporations by themselves. 

Think about it - 

Corporations only exist as they do because we have a system that allows for the ownership of important stuff (capital) in nominal terms - you don’t have to do anything in a corporation to own it. You just have to have a piece of paper / digital record that says you’re entitled to ownership because you were able to afford it. The reason to own a corporation nominally (as in, you are not yourself in the business of doing the stuff that creates value) is usually the expectation of some return of your investment.

So what results is a system where those with the ability/choice to distribute resources are incentivized to give the most resources to the organization that returns the most value in exchange. There is little at the base level of this system that asks how that value is generated. Many a problem we get with corporations results from this system.

So, let’s say the researchers polled 100 company CEOs and found that 25 of them have these traits. Even if you don’t know which specific ones aren’t actually narcissistic, you can come up with a mean range of valuations. If that range is greater than and does not overlap with the range of the other 75 companies, that would substantiate the paper’s claims.

I agree with the other point, but the line gets a little hazy when addressing the difference between ownership and effort. In a capitalist system, both are measured in the same metric: capital. Even time is represented in terms of money (wages, interest, etc.).

I’m not nearly as anti-capitalist as I used to be. Capitalism is really great at a couple things: extracting resources and collecting knowledge.

j1bb7pv,t1_j19t9ty,2022-12-23 01:05:20,science,"> Confidence can very well exist without being narcissistic.

In fact, narcissists lack confidence. The show of grandiosity is completely superficial and motivated by a fragile ego that seeks a superlative self-worth, as a protective measure against the inevitable ego fracture. They are trying only partly to convince themselves of it but mostly hoping the public will reflect back what they 
""see"" and validate that for them. The common opinion that grandiose narcissists are confident shows that the ploy works well. 

 And stoicism doesnt require a lack of emotion or empathy. It only requires that your reality cannot be shaken by another's antagonism, that what you have come to believe isnt arbitrary, subjective, or a product of self-deceit,  has a firm basis in reality and is well reasoned enough to withstand challenge.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,5,0,reddit3

Greed will exist under any economic system, whether purely capitalistic or otherwise, although we both know that every economy has a mix of ideological characteristics. 

The question is, rather, how to design a system, both economic and legal, that doesn’t reward or allow exploitation and greed through its basic mechanisms of motivation. 

Some would argue that there is no real way to do this without largely reforming or abolishing the legal structures that allow private ownership and accumulation of capital. 

Others might argue that the worst effects of a capitalist system can be balanced with strong regulation, and that’s totally valid in my opinion, although with a solution like that the issue remains that regulation will always be in direct opposition to unrestricted profit-seeking. 

The system itself will always fight the regulations. But maybe that can be said for any system where greedy desires exist, like you said.",Backlit_keys,t2_177afe,1,0,reddit3

Any country, regardless of its dominant economic system can (and usually does) have successful socialist policies. They are not always explicitly called socialist, however, and there are
Political and social reasons for this. 

Eliminating private ownership (of capital, not in terms of personal property) is one way in which socialists argue we could eliminate the problems with capitalism, but it’s not the only thing socialists advocate for.

People who argue in favor of capitalism often do so from the assumption that trade, competition, and personal ownership of things are all things unique and inseparable from a capitalist economic system, but this is just not true - all of these things have existed before the dominance of capitalist economies. 

Capitalism is a very specific economic system, and this is where you will find yourself “losing the plot” when discussing the issue with more left-leaning people. It helps to understand corporations and owners have a huge incentive to argue that capitalism is the “only choice” we have, because it’s right there in the name - capitalism benefits the owners of capital.

Thus, the “red scare” has a huge hold in our culture and even otherwise reasonable, well-intentioned people have been socialized to be resistant to the “S” taboo. I consider myself progressive and even I wouldn’t necessarily call myself a socialist, partially because of this stigma.

After all, socialist ideas are about improving society for the average person, while many would misrepresent them as wanting to “take” something from the average person. Fear of socialism has a powerful hold on all of us.
