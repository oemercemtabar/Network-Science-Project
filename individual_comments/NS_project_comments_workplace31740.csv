Edit: ok people I did gain a bit of a new perspective. Best answer I got is waivers are like charging difference between MSRP and sales price as income. Which is a better way to look at a waiver than debt forgiveness (which I think everyone can agree is income)

Side note - as a Dad who needs to put a daughter through college in 10 years (and is sweating already) I can say there are some GREAT state schools out there that are affordable and won't put you in a crazy amount of debt. If you think your dream university is overpriced maybe consider going with your 2nd or 3rd choice if it's more affordable.

Theres a ""breach"" between the official exchange (about 80:1) that most people cannot access to (Except politicians it seems), the ones that can are limited to 200usd or equivalent in other currencies to which any expense in other currency even if its converted by the company like netflix, counts towards that limit and has an effective tax on it of 65%; Adding to that, anything you earn internationally is forcefully exchanged into local currency (to the official exchange, even cheaper actually because you are selling, and without the tax). Plus actual exchanges like the ones used in bonds or informally (which btw, some freaking how its illegal to exchange currency privately....) have a value that is over double the official exchange without the taxes.

What does that mean? That everything that could bring USD as reserves, be it import/export companies, including software companies and farm sector (which is a huge part of our economy) see their assets halved arbitrarely - not even counting taxes... -  while they have to access the new stuff they need to buy to, you know, keep the business going, at double the price they received (which also has taxes on it).

I mean, what could go wrong, right? /s

 Still some people are ignorant enough to defend this kind of stuff. I mean, iI get theres no reserves and that if they get freed they will go in an instant, but thats exactly because people  fear the local currenycy and theres a breach between the official (Rather artificial, because its kept under market value with public budget afaik) and unofficial exchanges. Besides is not solving anything either. Im not an economist, and I understand that hey are unaffected, and probably want people to depend from the estate to get the populism going and keep getting elected (in the rather stupid voting system that is ""popularity poll"" even), but this hurts the country itself, its completely retarded, and if you hear what politicians say during, after or before (doesnt matter) applying such practices, its also complete hypocrisy.

If something costs $100k and someone says hey I'll give it to you for $5k just bc you don't have enough, you just received something worth $100k for only 5.

Ignoring the fact colleges may artificially inflate prices for a minute, a ""waiver"" is just up front debt forgiveness. If 5 people pay 100k for a car then bigwig politician walks along and the dealership gives it to him for 5k for favorable laws or something, didn't they just basically give him income if 95k? He received a 100k asset for 5k.

Now with tuition let's say this is a big conspiracy to fuck students and put them in debt.

If that degree isn't worth 100k.... Then you don't have to get it? You don't have to go. You can go to a state school or a tech school or an online school and pay a fraction of that.

Monetarist theory versus humanity (two open letters to Arnold Harberger and Milton Friedman)*, by a Chilean and former Chicago economics student who opposed the Pinochet regime.

The first part or so of Naomi Klein's *The Shock Doctrine* covers the history of laissez-faire economic policies implemented by fascist dictatorships (with the help of the CIA and US corporations) in the Southern Cone of South America, with emphasis on Chile. Klein is a journalist so it reads well but may gloss over details and isn't an economics book.

Joseph Stiglitz [reviewed Klein's book](https://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics.html) and adds some economic context:

>Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies. But Friedman and the other shock therapists were also guilty of oversimplification, basing their belief in the perfection of market economies on models that assumed perfect information, perfect competition, perfect risk markets. Indeed, the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes. They were never based on solid empirical and theoretical foundations, and even as many of these policies were being pushed, academic economists were explaining the limitations of markets — for instance, whenever information is imperfect, which is to say always.",wokewightwonk,t2_89bkn52m,7,0,reddit3

There are worse ways to institute a progressive tax system than bringing cap gains rates up for ultra high income individuals. You are well into the 1% making that much, and most people who ever earn that much in a year are only at that income bracket for a year or two. 

That means most people who may get clipped by the tax due to a single spike in income simply spread some cap gains over a couple years and it is no big deal. If you are an individual consistently realizing cap gains with 6 zeroes behind it, you will be just fine. 

Since this is an economics forum, it also wont impact foreign investment cash flow as non-resident aliens do not pay US cap gains unless it is real property. It wont hurt investment companies. 

The only people who get slapped are super high net worth individual who are continuously liquidating massive investments with huge cap gains, who all have CPAs and attorneys to help them.

And I digress strongly, although  theres a limit to how many jobs there are during a quarantine (specially in a country like Argentina when it got to silly levels without much else) which means people need indeed help from the state, remember that  a) the amount of public expenses we have is ridiculous it can always be toned down. 

What is the problem? As you mentioned, people starve (part of it however is strictly due to the quarantine side of things done wrong) so of course the need to spend the public budget on welfare is much higher during the pandemic, but its not enough, so what do you do?

Obviously, cut taxes. Everyone pays a lot of taxes (if working legally) and this wealth tax is far from the only one that bothers the population. If food cost less is easier for the population to acquire it than to redistribute money on an already dwindling and poor economy, much much more if you take into account as I said before, the already exceeding tax pressure.

Yeah, sure, you would still need to give money to a portion of the population, but it gets smaller, both the amount of people and the amount needed. This, once again, beyond reestructuring public budget and understanding that less taxes does not mean zero nor it has to be that way forever.

&#x200B;

But lets say it works, lets say its enough, everything elsse is ignored... you still loose a very profitable part of the population long term which may offset taking debt as a country even (you never know, and Im not sure what conditions we have in front of the IMF) and it sets an awfully bad precedent that ""stinks"" other investments away even more, as theres no trust.

In short, is simpler to spend less than to ask for more, specially long term. Thats my opinion",simonbleu,t2_16z59s,1,0,reddit3
gd1npo4,t1_gd1kdj3,2020-11-21 11:29:52,badeconomics,"Well, it'd require that you get your land to become, as a property, a certain level of productivity for it to be worth your investment. Consider this. Let's say that the property tax is 1.5% (moved it down by a factor of 10 so it's a bit less ridiculous). You own a piece of land evaluated at... say, $100K. You've built a property that's worth $200K, including the value of the land itself. You're paying $3K in taxes. But let's say your neighbor has an identical plot of land and upgrades and develops her property so that it's worth $600K, including taxes. She's now paying $9K in taxes. So $12K in taxes are being raised, in total, on $200K worth of land.

With a land value tax, you could also raise $12K by putting a 6% tax. Your question is: wouldn't there be a decrease in demand for land? My rebuttal, here, is I don't think so. Because while your taxes increased from $3K to $6K, your neighbor's *decreased* from $9K to $6K. But, the important thing is that you have a proper incentive to develop your land, because you aren't being taxed higher on the increased property value. So it does disincentives you to own land and just sit on it and do nothing productive with it (which seems like a good incentive structure to me)

This is useful for, say, a family that is debating building an accessory dwelling unit on their property.

EDIT should clarify:

The goal of a uniform wealth tax ought to be to tax unproductive capital. The rate of this tax should be 1-2% yearly for an amortized return (over periods of centuries) of 2-3%. This way, if you manage to make your capital productive - for yourself and society -, you keep getting richer.

I agree that incel theory is odd and has a huge number of issues with it, but, if we look at the phenomenon, there exists a rational explanation to why incels exist. 

&#x200B;

Let's look at the data:

 [https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) 

&#x200B;

 

>A data scientist representing the popular dating app “Hinge” [reported on the Gini coefficients he had found](https://hingeirl.com/hinge-reports/whats-the-biggest-challenge-men-face-on-dating-apps-a-qa-with-aviv-goldgeier-junior-growth-engineer/) in his company’s abundant data, treating “likes” as the equivalent of income. He reported that heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing. 

&#x200B;

Or in other words, if you treat ""likes"" as currency, then the inequality in sexual opportunity on hinge is significantly higher then the US economy. 

&#x200B;

In criminology, there exists this idea called strain theory. Strain theory states that society puts pressure on people to achieve certain goals, and when these goals cannot be achieved, people are pressured into five common ways of coping: (stolen from wikipedia)

&#x200B;

>Conformity: pursuing cultural goals through socially approved means.   
>  
>Innovation: using socially unapproved or unconventional means to obtain culturally approved goals. Example: dealing drugs or stealing to achieve financial security.   
>  
>Ritualism: using the same socially approved means to achieve less elusive goals (more modest and humble).   
>  
>Retreatism: to reject both the cultural goals and the means to obtain it, then find a way to escape it.   
>  
>Rebellion: to reject cultural goals and the prescribed means to achieve them, then work towards replace both of them. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at it through the lens of the incel community:

&#x200B;

>Conformity: ask out a large number of girls, follow all the guides on the internet, and hope one of them will go out with you.   
>  
>Innovation: just hire a prostitute man...   
>  
>Ritualism: I can't find someone willing to date me/sleep with me, but I got a friend at last!  
>  
>Retreatism: the /r/mgtow idea. Who needs women anyways right?  
>  
>Rebellion: Who needs sex when you got hentai? I prefer 2d girls anyways!

&#x200B;

If we look at incels through the lens of strain theory: Society is telling these young men that sex is something desirable, and that everyone else is doing it. Therefore, their inability to get laid is creating strain. This drives those men to communities for innovation, ritualism, retreatism, or rebellion. 

&#x200B;

During times of high economic inequality, we aren't surprised to see the emergence of various radical, heterodox, economic extremists. The Jacobins, Bolsheviks, and Chavistas all appeared during times of extreme economic inequality. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, during times of extreme inequality in sexual opportunity like today, is anyone surprised that we're seeing heterodox social theories pop out of incel and/or foreveralone communities? 

&#x200B;

In a sense, it doesn't really matter if the theories don't make sense. I'm going to sound like a communist revolutionary here, but for large swaths of society, ""orthodox socialization"" has failed them.

fm3crn5,t3_fsskb4,2020-04-01 05:34:17,badeconomics,"You have not proven that it is always in the woman's best interest to reveal all her information. There are cases where the linkage principle is violated, in other words, where the seller in an auction can be better off concealing their information. One such case, is when there is an auction for an item that comes in multiple types, where the buyers receives multiple signals. In that case, the seller can be better off not revealing the type of the item. [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.574.3202&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.574.3202&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Incel theory does allow for at least two types of women, Beckys and Stacys. [https://external-preview.redd.it/v4wWExzg1P0Fi8lx5ViZnR8FwYv0sDwt0363Rg3gq80.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a72a031dee29a79701d81d59d84fc0c5c840dfb](https://external-preview.redd.it/v4wWExzg1P0Fi8lx5ViZnR8FwYv0sDwt0363Rg3gq80.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a72a031dee29a79701d81d59d84fc0c5c840dfb) So, the question is, can W send multiple signals? I don't know what incel theory has to say about it. But its easy to imagine ways that one could send out multiple signals in the dating market: telling Republicans you want to date that you are a Republican, while telling Democrats you want to date that you are a Democrat, telling Christians you want to date that you are a Christian, while telling Jews that you want to date that you are Jewish. If incel theory does allow for W to send out multiple signals, then its entirely coherent. If it doesn't, then there are still other ways for the linkage principle to fail, like when the private information of the buyers is correlated, in that case, its possible for the seller to capture the entire social surplus for themselves, just like Incels think in this model[https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf) Maybe there is some other way to prove Incel ideology incoherent. However, you have failed to prove the incoherence of Incel ideology by relying on the Linkage Principle, because it doesn't apply in all cases. I think that what you have actually proven is that Incel's believe that mating markets are auctions in which the seller (the woman) extracts 100% of the social surplus. I don't think that any of them would dispute that. Edit:  On closer inspection, the bit about correlated private information said that there is a way for the seller to extract all the social surplus that they would get as if the bidder's private information was public. In the example they gave, the linkage principle still holds. That being said, there are still other ways the linkage principle can fail besides the one that I have outlined. So it still isn't clear that W gets a higher price by revealing her information.",Sewblon,t2_zj09d,40,0,reddit4

Understandard incel theory women attempt to maximize suffering extracted from men by maximizing the difference between between the true value of a relationship and what men pay.  This is why women gossip so much, it's an attempt to solve the obvious coordination problem since women's true goal is to maximize the sum of suffering across all relationships.",Clara_mtg,t2_37vkt1it,66,0,reddit4

It's optimal for W, before the start of the auction and *before knowing the signal*, to commit to revealing her signal once she receives it.  But there is no point at which an actual, individual woman could make commitments to potential partners before knowing her own value.  Rather, the commitment would have to exist implicitly and collectively, as a cultural consensus that people should release verifiable information about themselves, such that people who decline to do so are probably trying to hide some flaw.

But even that only makes sense if the information is *verifiable*.  If an auctioneer's claims can't be verified (and are not trusted for some other reason), and there are no long-term consequences for lying (not true in reality but can be assumed for this model), then there is no incentive for an auctioneer not to exaggerate their claims as much as possible.  This is true even if the auctioneer's item really is of high value!  In this case, it would have to look something like (...ugh, this is so embarrassing to write...) women agreeing to allow potential partners to interview their associates about their personality or something, rather than just making claims about their own personality.",,,13,0,reddit4

This means that if you gave all men more game. It would make no difference. As hypergamy is entirely based on hierarchy. If everyone gets more game, the hierarchy stays the same.

That is scientifically proven to be true.

Incels understand hypergamy. But the problem is they believe that value is only obtained through looks. Since you can't grow taller, widen your jaw or regrow your bald spots, they think they are doomed be remain low value males and never get into the 10% that women desire.

Value and hierarchy amongst men is not decided only through looks. It's also decided through intelligence, via wealth and social status. Wealth and social status can be acquired through intelligence and effort.

That is also scientifically proven to be true. Women, unlike men, are not ONLY attracted to looks.

For some reason incels refuse to accept that you can climb value hierarchy through social status and wealth (ie effort and intelligence).

What are the incentive structures faced by creators of dating apps? and... to what degree are creators of dating apps incentivised to help their users find relationships or successful outcomes? 

- Given that they are free apps, supplemented by optional opt-in pricing schemes, they are absolutely incenvitised against this. If two people meet on Tinder and then form a long-term relationship, thats customers (and potential revenue streams) that are lost. Additionally, given the business model of app-based products these days, they're incentivised to maximise user traffic (more user traffic = higher IPO share price).

- Conversely, if they were completely ineffectual then nobody would use them. 

- I suspect, though given the matching algorithms are private its impossible to prove, that for men - the incentive is to provide *slightly* sub-desired matches on a drip feed minimal enough to keep them on the app, but there to tease them into purchasing the subscription service.

This needs to be padded out a lot - but this sort of emerged when talking to an old housemate who worked in tech and wanted to create a dating app, and we realised that actually, you don't want your users to find relationships.

The revenue incentives are completely disconnected from the customer incentives. An app or website where you only paid on the event of a successful outcome would be a lot better in terms of satisfaction for most men, I'd wager",HasuTeras,t2_aqp2d,16,0,reddit4

fm5k2hp,t1_fm3cl3c,2020-04-01 20:53:31,badeconomics,"There are a few things here that I find odd.

1. Is Gini coefficient a good summary here? If the top X% of the population have Y% of the likes (uniformly distributed within each high/low segment), then the Gini coefficient is Y-X. If the top 50% have all of it, then G=0.5. If the top 20% have 80% then G=0.6. In the second case, which is supposedly less equal, it's possible that a larger number of people can pass some minimum threshold of relevance (e.g. entering a relationship). I'm not used to thinking about Gini in a matching context, where everyone essentially wants a single high-quality good and extra choice may have sharply diminishing returns past some point.
2. If men are expected to initiate, then you might expect men to signal interest more often than women, who only send out the signal selectively. That's not quite the same thing as who they would be interested in if the other person initiated (e.g. women like their top 5, men like their top 20, both underlying lists concentrate equally). The link doesn't work for me, but is there similar data for responses? How well does the number of likes correlate to finding a relationship? Do women usually go out with people they liked, or someone who liked them first?
3. Is this consistent with other more direct data on preferences? My impression from my own conversations (and I believe some OkCupid study awhile back) was that men largely agree on which women are most attractive, while women have a larger spread. I though the situation was something like the example I gave, where more women get a *high* volume of attention, but more men can expect strong interest from a moderate number of people.

At least online you have equality in opportunity. Everybody is just a few pictures and an intro after all. Or in other words, if you are doing terribly online (relative to other men in your area), it's because your pics are ugly or your intro is bad.

&#x200B;

In person is very unequal. What if your program at school has few women/men?

&#x200B;

IE: a 1 year old is expected to know how to sit quietly and not throw a tantrum. A 6 year old is expected to know how to listen to a teacher and pay attention. A 10 year old is supposed to know how to play well in a team, a 16 year old is expected to have undergone their first interview, etc, etc. 

&#x200B;

Socialization is not really intentional for most people. Sure, your dad might sign you up for hockey so you can learn good sportsmanship, and your teacher might assign group projects so you can collaborate, but kids don't intentionally go into these things thinking ""I should work to absorb social norms"". 

&#x200B;

Yet if you're 20 or 30, and you're extremely socially awkward and incapable of functioning normally in society, something must have gone wrong in the socialization process right? The socialization process that seems to work for the majority of society seems to be failing huge swaths of people. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes people have good explanations as to why they never picked up social skills. IE: ""I had a learning disability, so I was home schooled and never had the opportunity to hang out with neighborhood kids"". 

&#x200B;

When you go to incel subs, sometimes you might see is people who turn this failure of socialization into resentment.

And even if it's not a college town apps connect you to ppl closest to you so you'll still have an advantage. Women so seriously outnumber men at most colleges now that being a decently attractive guy in a college town is a once in a lifetime sex pass if you put in the effort. 

The gender disparity has an even greater effect because based on stats I've seen female students are much less willing to date ""townies"" than male students. Men at an elite liberal arts school get to poach not only from their gender imbalanced school but from townies and less elite nearby colleges too. Whereas women at an elite school care much much more about their partner also being at an elite school.

Someone wrote a great article a couple years ago describing a study on dating economics comparing a pretty male dominated school (Georgia Tech) and a very female dominated school (Sarah Lawrence). Despite the male students at Sarah Lawrence espousing much more pro feminism and pro women attitudes than their GA Tech comrades they basically treated the girls they dated like disposable trash compared to GT students who comparatively cherished their girlfriends. The reason wasn't that guys at GT were better it's just they couldn't afford *not* to be better. The gender imbalance made promiscuity unlikely and thus led to much stronger relationship building behavior by guys at GT. They studied Valentine's day at the two schools for example. At SL Valentine's day was no big deal whereas at GT women reported their boyfriends making them breakfast in bed, buying expensive gifts, dinners, etc.

Also at a Uni you basically just have to compete against looks of other guys at same school. In the bay area you're competing in an area completely unique in the amount of super successful young men.

fm5eg70,t1_fm46vi9,2020-04-01 20:03:23,badeconomics,"I think the lack of geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic restrictions inherent in online dating give access to a wider pool of potential partners, but a less equitable outcome. Online, you're restricted to a few photos and a paragraph of text. This means your ability to appeal to the opposite sex is truncated. 

In real life, we have various options to display our potential as mates over a wide range of timescales. Online, you have only two ways: be physically attractive (and photogenic) enough to stand out in a functionally infinite group of men, or be charismatic enough to write something that stands out in a similar way. 

Additionally, a more open dating market, in theory, might create benefits from the top down (where we describe ""top"" as ""most attractive in any given scenario): 

In a closed-off village of 100 people, where social expectations are that you find a partner and procreate, everyone is incentivised in the same way. 

Since resources are relatively scarce (there are only a handful of desirable males) we should expect fierce competition for those males. But we should also expect, once they are off the table, that market participants will readjust their expectations in-line with the remainder of available outcomes (eligible bachelors - or rather, bachelors that look more eligible once their far more attractive peers are out of play). 

Driven by social pressures, people will look for matches to make, enabling less-attractive men to find partners. There will obviously be a bottom to this process, but it clearly extends far beyond the top 2 or 3 men in a village, otherwise we would see enormous levels of celibacy in small, isolated, communities. Historically, we don't see that. I would even speculate that we see the opposite - people in these locations settle down and partner up in greater numbers than urbanites. 

Opening up our little village to the rest of the world is likely to disenfranchise sub-optimal males in the same way that globalisation has disenfranchised a large segment of the working class. 

That hot barmaid Karen who works in the local pub isn't left choosing between the 12 unmarried men in her community - she can travel to big cities, download Tinder, and explore other markets for better outcomes.

For the absolute most attractive people, this creates enormous benefits: not only do they no longer run out of people to bone, but they can also find partners that are as attractive as they are - wherever they may be. 

For the next few tiers of people down, it is probably also beneficial - once they would have been stuck with the best-of-the-rest... now, they can explore other markets for better options. 

Eventually, though, you get to Smeggy David, whose hands are always inexplicably moist, and give off a faint whiff of sardines. Smeggy David has probably been disenfranchised by this romantic globalisation. And the worst thing is - he's probably only half way down the attractiveness-ladder.",leworthy,t2_2956ceaz,10,0,reddit4

From preliminary googling, it looks like the bay area ratio is much closer to 1:1, so there's still something weird going on here.

But that's really sort of evidence for my point - I think some places skew a very specific way, and a lot of incels seem to be in a place sort of similar to mine (steeped in tech, 'smart' but 'stemlordy', etc), and so if they live in places like the bay, it doesn't seem implausible that they just think everywhere is as tough as here when it really really isn't.

Two things to consider:

1. Surely the field in which these students receive education matters? Medieval French literature is interesting, but does it measurably improve productivity? If all these extra students choose useless majors, the productivity does not increase.

2. You have to take opportunity cost into account. Studying at a university means that you spend about 10-15% of your career not working. If a person hadn't studied at university, perhaps they would have learnt a trade, or learnt on the job, or whatever; certainly they would have produced something during these years.

Your example is letting a person voluntarily work for someone else, in an exchange that makes both affected parties better off (they immigrated here most certainly because the alternative was worse, and the hiring individual clearly wants their labor more than their money), and does not take wealth from anyone.

How are those two examples even comparable?

And for what it's worth, as a Dem, the primary reason why I support expanded immigration, first and foremost, is because I think it will make the world better off. The issue is, a non-insignificant number of people are heartless bastards, so if you try to tell them that immigration makes the immigrant's life better, some people will say stuff along the lines of ""I don't care about their life. They aren't American. They can die for all I care."" From there, one must argue to those potential voters that immigration does more than help just the immigrant, but also benefits them personally. That's where lines such as ""Who would mow your lawn then?"" end up coming into play: They are a lot more effective than getting an indifferent person to humanize.

And then, of course, people like you come along, and grasp on to only the last part of the argument, and say ""Hah, I knew those Dems were just as heartless as the people they criticize. Look at them, they just admitted they are only doing it for the mowed lawns. Guess they don't actually care about the immigrant."" From there, of course, us Dems must backtrack and clarify that we care about the lives of the immigrants too, upon which the indifferent folks say ""Woah, first you were talking about how this would benefit me, and now you are talking about humanity and shit. Guess I don't care anymore."" And then we must backtrack again.

From there, the cycle repeats itself.

This is the main reason. The point of this subreddit is to show what economists think when someone posts wrong economics online. 

Economists have mixed beliefs about student loan debt forgiveness. It is basically a big give away to people who are rich, not to people who are poor, and economists tend to think the rich shouldn't get handouts. 

As well, your argument against student loan debt relief is the same one made by student loan debt relief proponents: you can boost GDP by consuming more. This is an argument often made, especially those invoking the Keynesian Cross. That isn't a model of economic growth!

The symptom is ""lots of people can't afford college"". Making tuition tax subsidized is treating that symptom. But the actual problem is ""college is really expensive, much more so than it used to be"". The better solution to paying for everyone college tuition is fixing the underlying problem and only paying for those few people who are truly unable to pay.

It's the same thing with healthcare. Medicare for all and/or single payer are treating the symptom of ""most people can't afford healthcare"". But healthcare in the US is one of the most expensive in the developed world. I realize it's a hard problem, and there actually has been at least some research on why this is, but I have not seen basically any proposed policies, by anyone on either side, that are designed to make healthcare ACTUALLY CHEAPER.

To latch onto this point real quick, I think there are proposals out there to make healthcare cheaper but they (understandably so) often don’t look super appealing to the general public. One that I’m a fan of is trimming off (trimming off, not hacking off) regulations with groups like the FDA to try and lower drug prices while still encouraging research and investment.

That's a galaxy brain take you got right here.

It's almost as if you can decide the incidence of university costs if you use a fiscal policy to fund it.

> But my point is as follows. Once you raise the taxes on rich people, you receive say 1% more of revenue. Once you do that, you can use the money to pay free college for everyone (regressive) or use them to make, for example, public transportation free for everyone (highly progressive, at least in Europe) or to subsidize payday loans (extremely progressive) or give free uni to only people below a certain income level instead of middle and upper class kids.

That value of time is measured using education/training. 

Their model, which they call Ricardian, does away with this educational proxy and instead considers ""jobs"" as a bundle of ""skills"" necessary to complete a job (e.g. a waitress needs memory, customer service, etc). Then every individual has an endowment of ""ability"" that they can allocate to jobs they have a comparative advantage in.

Like in this post, wages are a great example. A consistent argument made by some economists is that certain low-skilled jobs are destined to be fixed at whatever price the market sets them. While it can be true that market forces will have a strong effect on wage value - and thanks to the time and effort it takes to learn and refine a skill that may even be the morally right outcome too - to deny that there is any part of that outcome that is the result of a political decision (or that a power imbalance might scupper one’s negotiating ability) is naive at best.

I am not an economist, but it seems like a fairly strong assumption to make, especially given you can empirically see people doing useful stuff without monetary motivation all the time. 

Some questions I can immediately come up with:

* How do you combine the existence of volunteer work with your idea that people don't do anything useful without being paid? E.g., I work in medical research, and I know a fair few physicians who don't get paid to do research, but do it anyway. They literally chose to work half a day or a day less, get paid less, so they have time to do research. This costs them literally thousands a year in wages compared to not taking that (half) day off.

* You'd also need to prove that the extra value (however you define that) they add for being paid millions weighs up to the lost value by having people who struggle to make a living wage. There might have been another Bill Gates who never got to work on his ideas because he could not afford a pc and/or did not have time because he had to work a low paid to make ends meet.

* I would also be curious if we really need to pay Bill Gates billions more, would he not also be motivated enough if it was just millions or hundreds of thousands more?

* Does monetary motivation actually motivate people to do things good for society, or does it just motivate them to do things that make money? Again, this seems a huge hole in your reasoning, would Steve Jobs not have been way more valuable if there were billions to be made solving child mortality or famine?

If your argument is a moral one, saying they deserve money for doing good things for society, then that is no argument for paying skilled workers more in general. I'd argue there are plenty of low skill workers more morally deserving of making money than some high skilled worker who makes sure you get the ads on facebook that are most likely to manipulate you into buying or doing something. Ultimately, if your argument is a moral one then it doesn't really make sense to argue it, because someone with different values will reach different conclusions anyway.",n23_,t2_i3g3h,-6,0,reddit2

One very important distinction is that it's not ""we"" who are paying these people, it is individual employers. Employers indeed do think that extra money paid to these people will bring more value to the company or else they wouldn't do it.

\#1: Indeed individuals will take a pay cut to do something they want to do, they may even pay to do so. But just because certain individuals will do so for certain jobs doesn't mean it holds true for all jobs.

\#2: As I said before, employers do deem that extra pay brings in extra value or else they wouldn't pay that much. Other people making less doesn't really factor into this decision. If you're talking from a societal perspective (which i think you are) then we're not talking about how much these people are paid, but optimal levels of wealth transfers and the distribution of those transfers, which is somewhat different.

\#3: First, most of Bill Gates wealth was not from being paid but from building and owning something that is very, very valuable. But second, yes people will respond to more money, even on the order of millions. This is not only through incentivized performance but also through competition. Look at the NFL, there are players who are being paid millions a year who will refuse to play until they're paid their market value.

/#4: Things that make money are generally what people want. If everybody put their iPhone budget towards donations towards solving child mortality, then yes there would be more competition in that market and more advancement. It's also ironic that you chose Bill Gates as the example as he's a perfect example of someone who has amassed a gigantic amount of wealth through the free market and is allocating it towards charitable causes.",,,13,0,reddit2

Combined with cultural notions about inherent ability and math being a uniquely difficult or unattainable subject this leads people to believe that their pattern of having trouble in math-heavy topics is due primarily to a lack of innate ability, a lack that can't be changed or overcome, rather than having missed an important building block of their math education. 

Parents and teachers who have math-related anxiety or view it as a particularly difficult topic are likely to (consciously or unconsciously) transmit these attitudes to their children or students. There's a big gender component, too, with the cultural attitude of girls being bad at math getting internalized and passed on.

I *have* worked with students who have learning disabilities around math, and I think there are some people with, for example, severe dyscalculia who would have a prohibitively difficult time ever doing physics at a university level, much like how a tone deaf person would probably find it impossible to be a concert cellist. But I tend to think (and I don't have data to back this up, this is my anecdotal observation/opinion) that one of the most common learning disabilities related to math is anxiety about it, and that's something that can absolutely be managed and overcome.

fpqrjzn,t1_fpq7x6r,2020-05-07 05:43:04,badeconomics,"The “Laffer curve” is definitely real as long as you accept two points and a few regularity conditions (for the calculus, to guarantee derivatives of the tax revenue function exist)

1. If the income tax rate is zero, no tax revenue is collected. 

2. If the income tax rate is 100%, no tax revenue would be collected as people have no incentive to work. 

If these conditions are met, then we can apply [Rolle’s Theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolle's_theorem) to conclude there’s some point in between 0% and 100% where tax revenue is locally maximized. 

However, the limitations of this argument are

1. There could be multiple such points that locally maximize revenue

2. Local maximization doesn’t imply global maximization

3. We don’t know where these points are, just that they are between 0% and 100% 

And others. In order to pin down these points, you need an actual model. [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393217300156) looks like a pretty decent summary of how you would go about doing that. [Older (free) version here.](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2017/preliminary/paper/eAaZ8tyr)

From my understanding, the Laffer Curve either is difficult to pin down empirically or the estimates of the (globally) maximizing point are much larger than what people who taut the Laffer Curve probably think. However, we’re quickly leaving my area of knowledge. But I’m pretty sure most of the literature suggests we (the US) aren’t to the right of the maximizing point. Eg the paper I linked estimated the maximizing point for the US to be around 57%.",rationalities,t2_r8pya,28,0,reddit2

The point of my question is to interrogate to see if anyone does answer exactly as you have.

That you argue an economy can be entirely independent of politics.

A Robinson Crusoe economy is purely theoretical and therefore proves nothing in reality. 

No economist suggest it is reality of course, but they erroneously erase context.

You simply can’t do that. That’s my point, that the question is rhetorical.

And it’s not fruitless because when people are still saying things like “economics is a concept fully independent of politics” as truth rather than the philosophical statement it is, shows that the indoctrination is rife and needs to be questioned.

It saddens me that as economists we aren’t taught to be critical of the things we are learning. We are the one and ONLY science or social science that tries to perpetually uphold our discoveries, rather than to evolve them.

I’m not here to prove one theory over another I’m here to debate and I’m 9/10 met with other economists that just wanna repeat textbooks rather than come up with their own ideas.

The assumptions that you have provided preclude this.  In the framework above you have described a function which is zero at the endpoints and also presumably nonnegative (tax revenue cannot be nonnegative) and not identically zero (there is some level of taxation for which some amount of tax revenue is collected).  Under the weaker assumption of continuity such a function is guaranteed to have a maximum attained somewhere in the interior (proof is trivial: by the EVT the maximum exists and is attained, since the function is not identically zero but the endpoints are, it occurs in the interior).

If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers.

Skill is irrelevant if you are contributing to the economy and helping to make money and keeping the motor running, you are helping to create wealth. 

What is so wrong with wanting people to be fairly compensated at a baseline so they can afford to eat healthier, take their car to the mechanic and fixed it finally, maybe get a gym membership or pay for better childcare or be able to go on a trip with their kids. 

Why are we so obsessed with maintaining hierarchy that we want to make it an impossible shit hole you have to climb out of whilst trying to keep a roof over your head and not get sick and die. Picking yourself up by the bootstraps is an _oxy moron_ it’s meant to be contradictory, not inspirational. Literally go put on your boots and try picking yourself up by your bootstraps because _you can’t._


Corporations have made it impossible for workers to value their own labor. Uber, Amazon, they can afford labor at a wage that would keep people from slipping into poverty, but they just don’t _want_ to pay for it. Well, the rest of us don’t get to control the price of the things around us, yet we’re required to pay it otherwise we can’t have it. 

I’m sick of the argument that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and small businesses. 

Want a small business? Well, if you want labor you have to work towards being able to afford that, you don’t get handouts and cheap labor. Sorry, tough luck. 

Too bad it’s not seen this way and working class people are vilified for wanting to be valued as human beings. Why do poor people have to get fucked sideways and live on a knifes edge? They didn’t do well enough in their first 20 years so fuck them for the rest of their lives i guess. 

People  like Ben act like it’s not a zero sum game when it comes to acquiring wealth when you’re at the bottom, someone else having money doesn’t prevent poor people from making more money, 

But they’re the ones who treat it like it’s a zero sum game! Paying people more for their work isn’t going to ruin the economy and make you poorer either, and if it does than you lied about it not being a zero sum game.

I feel like almost too much value is placed on ""skill level,"" as if unskilled jobs are easy. Unskilled jobs can require physical strength and endurance, a willingness to put up with unpleasant environments and experiences. Is there no value in that?

There's the old story about the mechanic.

>A guy is having some trouble with his car, so he takes it into the mechanic. The mechanic sits there for a moment and listens to the car. He takes out his wrench and turns one nut a quarter turn clockwise, and suddenly the car is running perfectly. ""That'll be $500,"" the mechanic says. ""$500‽"" the owner says, ""all you did is turn one nut. I could have done that!"" ""You're not paying me $500 to turn the nut, you're paying me to know which nut the car needed turned and how far.""

So that's a story of skilled labor, but you can flip this for unskilled labor instead.

>A guy's driveway is falling apart, so he hires a laborer to repave it. So the laborer comes in with his truck, and a big asphalt mixer, and a bunch of tools. After only an hour to demolish the old driveway, and three hours to lay out all the new asphalt, he hands the bill to the homeowner.
>
>""$1,000? All you did was swing a hammer and shovel stuff onto the ground, I could have done that!""
>
>""Yes, but you're paying me to put up with the asphalt fumes, to be strong enough to do it all in only four hours, in the hot baking sun, and to guarantee I did the job right the first time, so you could do something you'd rather do during that time instead.""",Kichigai,t2_31nm3,42,0,reddit3

Isn't this Ben's MO. Like, no joke, didn't he write in his book all the bad faith tactics he employs to ""destroy"" liberals or whatever?

 [http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how\_to\_debate\_leftists\_and\_destroy\_them.pdf](http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how_to_debate_leftists_and_destroy_them.pdf)  

>Rule #10: Let The Other Side Have Meaningless Victories. This is a parlor trick you can use to great effect with your leftist friends. Leftists prize faux moderation above all else; by granting them a point or two, you can convince them that you aren’t a radical right-winger at all. After all, everyone can admit both parties are terrible! 

Bad faith

&#x200B;

> The left is wildly intolerant of religious people and conservatives; that’s why they’re interested in forcing Christian bakers to cater to same-sex weddings. They are anti-intellectual diversity, particularly in areas of American life in which they predominate; that’s why they stifle conservatism on campus and in the media. And as for social justice, if social is supposed to be opposed to individual, then social justice is by definition unjust. 

Not understanding the other argument, equivocation (""social""), misrepresenting the other side, ignoring the paradox of tolerance (it is true that tolerant people may not tolerate intolerance, this is not an internal inconsistency)

> the left won’t argue openly for what they would prefer: forcing people to practice medicine for patients deemed worthy by the government.  

...What?

&#x200B;

I hope this goes to show Ben is a bad faith actor who should not be given the benefit of the doubt and he isn't as interested in substantial, good conversation as you believe him to be.

&#x200B;

He also does have terrible economics.

ex7vw4u,t1_ex6ry1c,2019-08-17 18:11:21,badeconomics,"But your critique here just has so very little to do with what he's saying...in other words, if there is a way to break down Shapiro's statements into economically falsifiable claims; but instead you say:

>What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods.

Looking at/for market power in employers has almost nothing to do with what he is claiming. Shapiro's claim may be wrong and insensitive, but he's not saying it's entirely ""your fault"" (that's just standard leftist reactionary smear tactic to what conservatives are actually saying, and has no place here): he's saying that, the tools to increase one's skill and productivity level are readily available **enough** for just about any mentally-sound poorer person to avail themselves of.

Again, my hunch is that that is not entirely true; but the type of evidence necessary to falsify this claim is clearly not in the existence of monopsonies or undue market power (which should also hurt even more skilled workers, if to a lesser extent); but would have to come in the form of showing that those who personally made the efforts and sacrifices to educate themselves (e.g. take out loans to go back to school) and other very-hard-to-measure factors like ""hard work"" and engagement into that process, still fail to gain skills and promotion most of the time.

Ben Shapiro knows that it's harder for poor people to do this than for people born well-off (who you know, easier risk taking, don't have to worry about living costs while you educate yourself, etc.)

Most of Shapiro's statements are just not worth the time to respond to...but this critique is simply not worthy of the standards of rigor for /r/BE...this belongs in /r/politics.

Shapiro perpetuates the narrative that you ""just"" have to take higher paying jobs and/or educate yourself. Which is just empirically bullshit. Yes, some people can just do those things. Plenty of people can't. That's a problem. And it can be alleviated with good policy. Perpetuating this idea of poor people just not doing those things, not putting in the work for whatever reason although it's simply a choice, doesn't help anyone.

Imagine that your alternatives are a) move to where there are better jobs, or b) starve to death. This makes moving to where there are better jobs a very compelling option.

Now add a welfare state. If you can't find a job in the place where you already live, or a job that pays enough to support a certain standard of living, the government will provide a subsidy that allows you to get by. You might still choose to move! But choosing not to move no longer results in starving to death, which makes it a much more attractive option than it would have been in the first scenario.

Note that this is true even in a third scenario where the government will give you a subsidy if you stay and a bigger subsidy if you move. You might entirely reasonably decide that the subsidy you get if you stay is enough.

Another possible explanation, of course, which doesn't necessarily involve the welfare state, is that even in places in the US with low wages, wages are high enough that people don't feel a compelling need to move in search of higher wages. Rather than being too poor to move, people in these areas may be rich enough to stay.

My main point, though, is that the ""too poor to move"" story is hard to reconcile with the observation that even poorer people are routinely making even more difficult moves, so that's unlikely to be the whole story.

It's one thing to say that firms have some labor market power and can moderately depress wages relative to the optimal market-clearing price. I'm deeply skeptical that this effect is large in the low-skill labor market, but sure, it probably matters somewhat.

But the above is a terrible, terrible way of phrasing this. ""Markets decide wages"" is much, much more true than ""firms decide wages.""

He has been very critical of the apparent rise of the alt-right, racism, and antisemitism.

I think he has been pretty good about criticizing Trump at appropriate times, as well as praising him when he has done things that are consistent with Ben's values.

As for Ben's values, I find them to be quite consistent. He has certain principles, like violence is never okay in a civilized society, unless in self-defense. He has applied this principle many times while covering instances of protesting and rioting, no matter who is protesting and who is being violent.

Agree with his political philosophy or not, he does a pretty good job of laying out what he believes are the boundaries to government power. That would take a while to explain, but I remember finding these discussions very interesting when I first started listening to Ben, since conservatism/libertarianism was very new to me.

His general views of how people should treat each other has inspired me to be a more upstanding citizen, and more polite. I used to be a bit of a troublemaker when I was younger, committing minor crimes, but now any crimes, minor or not, that are bad for communities disgust me.

That's pretty related to his views on the importance of strong communities. He says religion is among the strongest ties a community can have, but since I'm not religious myself, I don't fully agree with him there. But he did make me see the importance of community in a different way.

As much as many people dislike his almost exclusive focus on personal responsibility on economic issues, he has motivated me to be much more financially responsible, and really just responsible in general.

I'm realizing now that much of what I get out of listening to Ben Shapiro has to do with bettering my behavior which is interesting.

I'm just not sure how you can interpret his words as anything other than a statement about mostly past and somewhat present personal responsibility for one's skillset and hireability or ability to start a business or provide for oneself in some other way.

Conservatives tend to chalk up everything to choice and personal responsibility...that's their whole schtick.
People on the left tend to always disingenuously interpret conservative views on choice personal responsibility as selfish, uncaring, ""fuck you, got mine"", which just isn't true, and they chalk nearly every outcome up to social factors completely out of individuals' control, past choices don't matter...that's their whole schtick.

That is where Ben Shapiro is coming from.  He's a smart enough person to know that a poor person has fewer and less-favorable options in the present, than does a wealthy person. Your critique is silly and just plays into the equally wrong thinking of Shapiro's political opponents that personal responsibility is no factor at all, and poor people are completely at the mercy of evil capitalists exploitation of them and the market at large.  It does not enlighten because it does not seek to understand and to falsify on the actual terms and context that subject is operating under.

Edit: his [recent show addresses](https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Ep-840---Solve-Your-Own-Problems-The-Government-Wont) these interpretations of what he said (in response to Kamala Harris saying that no one should *have* to work two jobs), right at the beginning, and basically confirms exactly what I'm saying: that he sees that the market is imperfect and things are harder for poorer people, but that this doesn't mean that present options are zero, or that taking multiple jobs, in the present or past, isn't in many cases exactly how to get ahead.

Decades ago you had to actually qualify for a student loan, so if you were poor, you had a much lesser shot of going to college than you do today. I know that as economically minded people we typically view cost as a barrier to entry, but when 18 year olds can go out and borrow six figures in one day for college regardless of financial background or status then it's not really the same thing as a typical barrier to entry in terms of accessibility.

>And educational requirements for a lot of jobs is relatively new, so there was a time where a person could move up just by being lucky or having some ambition. 

Economically speaking, I don't think that educational requirements are a bad thing. We live in a much more specialized economy now and that specialization has resulted in increased productivity and innovation. 

Also, suggesting that people can no longer move up by being lucky or ambitious is a pretty ridiculous assertion, though I guess you can get away with saying it because there isn't an empirical way to measure it or debunk it.

Well, sticking with the subject, we couldn't use data indicating QoL increases from geographic movement/immigration since on average people only move once the prospective utility increase overcomes their risk aversion. So I don't have data to enrich the conversation.

However I can tell you at places I have worked, headhunters are not valued for the ability to convince people of a prospective opportunity, but rather identifying which networks need to be made aware that such a position is available. Entirely anecdotal unfortunately, although I've seen that in common across SEA.

People become geographically fixed for a number of reasons that appear to expand the mirage of short term utility in lieu of professional development and status. There is often a sunk cost fallacy involved.

How many people do we know where someone turned down a promotion to a new location for an SO only to be broken up with and burn a year waiting for the hiring window again? That was sub-optimal. They made a decision about an easily replaced title, SO, for a job that would have increased their social status and made them a better prospective partner aside from every other QoL that came with it. Risk existed on both sides of the scenario and they chose wrongly.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I don't know how to show the scenario in data. There are many unsignaled job opportunities, particularly out of network, which is most jobs abroad. Technology gets very close to providing frictionless labour movement, but it isn't quite sufficient in minor economies where skilled labour demand can be very high.

This is not true.  

I suspect that Peterson is looking at *household income*, not wages. Household income has been constant, largely because of changes to the composition of households. See [Where Has All The Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) for details.

I'd also suggest looking at [Autor's Inequality Among the 99%](https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/96768), which shows that we have seen increases in wages for the population with college degrees, while those with HS degres or less have not seen changes (or slight declines)

> Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? 

This is the Borjas gambit. Peterson is looking at how women entering the labor force in partial equilibrium, but has forgotten that they would also consume more. 

> What happens? You halve the value of the labor. 

Peterson seems to think that Y=W*H (GDP = Wages x Hours). This is 1.) incorrect. 2.) causing him to reason from an accounting identity, assuming that GDP is fixed.

> So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. 

This is not true. Labor productivity is increasing. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MPU4900062

> So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.

Peterson is missing that women largely moved from unpaid in-household to paid out-of-household production. Hours worked has actually been remarkably stable for women over the last several decades.

Cheaper labor also means more freedom to substitute labor for capital for the firms that can do so, leading again to an increase in productivity.

I seem to remember there being a fair amount of literature exploring whether that theory has been borne out in reality, and no doubt Peterson gets numerous things wrong here, but isn’t the fundamental theory just standard labor supply and demand?

Edit: [Here's one article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.12336) that seems to echo the point that if women entering the labor force merely shifted the supply curve, then we would expect wages to drop.

I've watched quite a few of his debates and interviews and it seems to me that many on the internet are working hard to paint a horrid picture of the man -- an absurd caricature in most cases. On top of that I see a lot of trying to depict those who agree with him as some kind of second-class trump supporting chauvinistic idiots. I'm surprised to see it on this subreddit to be honest. 

A side note on the bolded text: it is true that wages can fall in some sectors with the entering of women into the work forces, although it is unlikely to have that effect on average . This has nothing to do with women per se. One only needs a group with different preferences to enter the work force.  ",esthim8,t2_4y1qc,2,0,reddit4

Well, if women leave the home and work now they need cars and transportation, so we have a massive boost in automobiles, repair services, part manufacturers, tire companies, all of that. The one car family becomes the two car family, and that alone is a massive demand increase. 

And the tasks that women completed in the home were real work that now is either done by both in their free time, or often, outsourced.

Instead of a woman making dinner every night, restaurant after restaurant, delivery after delivery place appeared. All of those jobs. All of that money. 

Instead of women cleaning clothes fastidiously by hand, dry cleaners and expensive washing machines became popular. 

Instead of raising young children, daycare services and services for children got more popular.

Now it's routine to hire a maid to come by and clean your home. It's routine to have pay babysitters and nannys. It's routine to pay extraordinary amounts for daycare.

“I don’t think there’s any legal expert that would say that [this] would meet the threshold for hate speech in Canada,”

What I do enjoy about his work are the 12 rules of life (self help book) and his youtube lectures centered around his other book maps of meaning. He is a clinical psychologist and a lot of his work on self authoring program to overcome depression and anxiety I do find to be empowering. When combined with his articulate lectures I find his work on self improvement at times to be poetic, logical, and genuine. His self improvement lectures might not resonate with everyone. 

As far as his other views on college campus politics, economics, and postmodernism, I take with a healthy skepticism. He brought somethings to my attention in regards to certain actions by university administrators I find concerning. But its something I need to explore further before I can come to a conclusion. 

The reason I think he resonates with young men in particular because he is seen as a someone willing to stand up for them. I think young men might feel, whether justified or not, marginalized in certain aspects of modern university and societal settings and he is seen as a champion for them. 

Hope this provides some insight into some of his works and why he might be popular.

dzgjsez,t1_dzfygr4,2018-05-23 18:58:26,badeconomics,"I think there are alternate ways of fueling demand compared to less at-home-production. 

Don't you think it would be a better society 

. if the currently less at-home produced goods were produced at home as we will produce health and well being oriented goods(rather than profit oriented) for our consumption and the surplus produce can be aggregated by e-commerce or other marketplaces(they can be profit oriented) and sold, thus providing money to households and to marketplace businesses but only now households earn the extra money, have also entered the workforce in a different way and are keeping stuff healthier. This whole ecosystem can be supported by enforceable contracts. 

. Also since we are producing certain foodstuffs and other home oriented stuff for ourselves, more income is now disposable and we can pay for a lot of stuff that is being consumed for free(apps like Facebook, Games, etc.). If we were willing to pay $2/month  for Facebook, that would translate to billions of dollars of revenue which they can earn instead of selling our data and earning from ads. 

. The stuff that cannot be produced at home like hardware, software, vehicles, petrol, etc. can be produced by businesses. 

Higher family income and a consumer mindset is required for demand. Just having the money but not having the desire to buy all those things will not fuel the demand. Overall I have a feeling that this whole everybody earning by working at small businesses /corporations /etc. is part of the ecosystem that fuels the consumer mindset.

can you explain a bit more? i still dont understand. the study's argument is that household incomes have declined because the number of people in the households who are earning incomes has on average declined. yet pew states that there are a lot more households who have 2 people earning income than before. so on one hand we have a study which states that a lot of dual-income households have switched to single-income households (i.e. now there are less dual-income households) and on the other hand we have pew which states that there are more dual-income households. this is a contradiction, is it not?  

which sentence is wrong in the above explanation? 

> There have always been two workers in the household. But the advent of the washer/dryer/refridgerator/vacuum/textiles/IKEA have dramatically reduced the workload associated with household maintenance, such that many women entered the workforce.

so with a single income, it would be easier for a family to live now than 'back in the day' because of technology like washer/dryers that make household maintenance easier? please correct me if i am misinterpreting what you are saying. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,7,0,reddit4

He is popular partly because he offers adrift young men a sense of heroic purpose, and offers angry young men rationalizations for their hatreds.

>Men get frustrated when they are not competitive in the sexual marketplace (note: the fact that they DO get frustrated does not mean that they SHOULD get frustrated. Pointing out the existence of something is not the same as justifying its existence). Frustrated men tend to become dangerous, particularly if they are young. The dangerousness of frustrated young men (even if that frustration stems from their own incompetence) has to be regulated socially. The manifold social conventions tilting most societies toward monogamy constitute such regulation.

dzepywz,t1_dzeo6rs,2018-05-22 21:10:27,badeconomics,"I think I've got this, so let me take a crack at this.

Household incomes have declined because the number of people in a given household isn't as large as it used to be, on average. In plain terms, people tend to get married/co-habitate with a spouse/long-term significant other at older ages, or you live with your parents for longer (which would qualify as a family household rather than increasing the number of earners in your household. At least that's how I'm interpreting it). So if more people are legally single or in a family household for longer, than the number of people in the average household decreases as well. 

So in the terms you outlined, the average wages of the individual have increased, but the average number of people in the household have decreased. Thus, the gains of the individual don't quite outstrip the delay of adding/loss of a second earner to the household.

And your second point is a bit off. A household replaces the domestic labor of a homemaker with a washer, dryer, etc., but that stuff costs money. Which should theoretically be seen as income earned by the formerly domestic spouse who is now free to earn from their labor at a job. But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).",ToastedMayonnaise,t2_bpdts,6,0,reddit4

You can test a woman’s preference in men. You can show them pictures of men and change the jaw width, and what you find is that women who aren’t on the pill like wide-jawed men when they’re ovulating, and they like narrow-jawed men when they’re not, and the narrow-jawed men are less aggressive. Well all women on the pill are as if they’re not ovulating, so it’s possible that a lot of the antipathy that exists right now between women and men exists because of the birth control pill.

i don't get this either. are family households not a part of the broad category of 'households'? if more people are living in family households than before, that will correspondingly increase the average just as much as it is decreased by people not living on their own/with spouses.

But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).

i don't quite understand how my point was off. isn't what i said largely similar to what the implied conclusion is of this above paragraph? how does your explanation prove in a different way than mine that it is easier for a single-income family to live now than it was before?  

or are you disagreeing altogether with the conclusion posited by besttrousers? im not sure if you are arguing that it is easier or harder than before for a single-income family to live. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,8,0,reddit4

>The lump of labor fallacy is the assumption that the quantity of labor required in an overall economy is fixed. This assumption in regarded as fallacious, as the consensus view among economists today is that the quantity of labor demanded varies with respect to many factors. Foremost, these economists argue that employment of labor can expand the overall size of the economy, leading to further job creation. In contrast, reducing the amount of labor employed would decrease overall economic activity and thus further decrease the demand for labor. The lump of labor fallacy is also known as the ""fallacy of labor scarcity,"" ""lump of jobs fallacy,"" a ""fixed pie fallacy,"" or a ""zero-sum fallacy.""

The claim is that this decision and others like it ultimately get made by people calculating the net dollar profit-to-shareholders, and any kind of human factor only plays a role through the lens of profit.

The decision-making process in the corporation deemed it profitable to shareholders to token-acknowledge the existence of non-binary people. It did not deem it profitable to shareholders to design a policy that takes into account the full scope of what ""non-binary people"" means.

Queerphobic attitudes reducing people to their private parts at birth plays a role here, but corporate profit-seeking also plays a big role in amplifying those attitudes' impact on the world.

No one goes on a mission expecting a high success rate, they go expecting doors to be slammed in their face because we all know that’s the reality of it. The socialization of members within the church begins much younger, when we’re children. Growing up most of my friends were Mormon. I know a lot of kids whose entire family are Mormon. You’re taught very young that while there are good people in the world it is also full of temptation, and other Mormon kids are “safe”. Even when you start dating your first date is expected to be Mormon. Mormons go on a mission because we’re taught, from a very, very young age through cute songs and constant reminder, that it’s the lord’s work.

The mormons church specifically apparently work very hard to keep up that wholesome image. After all, you wouldn't want to take up anyone's offer on going along to a bible study or worship if they were threatening?  


Here in Sweden it's mainly the Jehovah's Witnesses who go door to door, and while they try to look like wholesome average people, they are still more likely to tell you that they think you will burn if you tell that that you think they believe in nonsense. I know for sure my parents made them loud and confrontational when they came by, just by telling them what they (my parents) believe.   


I think I've only had them knock on my door once, and I was quite quick to say ""No thanks!"" and shut the door. I know friends who've invited them in and taken the discussion, have, when they've both said their parts hard them walk away only to come back a few days later with a pastor ""Who could explain things better to make them understand...""   


That's the reason for all the [sea-lioning](http://wondermark.com/1k62/) from both them and neo-Nazis, and why their mating call online is always ""Debate me"" or ""Hear me out"". The problem with arguing about their beliefs with them isn't that they are *right*, is that they have much more experience in having that specific debate, and they are trained in how and why to ignore what you're saying, and they were themselves debated into the position they are in now so on some people their arguments work. Online it's even worse, because by re-tweeting Nazis to comment ant say that they are wrong and scary you are still spreading their message. I'm not sure if there's any *religious* cult that has fully weaponized bad faith discussions as effectively as the alt-right, but if not it's likely only a matter of time before it happens.  


I think the most effective way to protect kids from falling pray to any authoritarian powers later in their life is to tell them early and often that *anyone* who tells them that they have some wonderful simple solutions to hard problems is selling *something*, even if they don't know it themselves. Ideas *can* be dangerous and harmful if acted upon, and as such, anyone saying those things should be handled with care. If any *simple* solutions worked, the problems wouldn't have be hard to begin with. That goes for ""How to life your life"", ""How to make the country great again"", ""How to make money while working for yourself"" and so many other easy fixes people will try to sell them.",FurbyFubar,t2_9wru4,14,0,reddit2

While I don't agree with their mission, the amount of money the church makes or their beliefs. I think you would be pretty hard pressed to find mean lds missionaries. They just aren't taught to be that way. they have immense respect for people whose houses they go to typically. You can usually have a very nice conversation. And they will typically be very happy to answer any questions about their beliefs. They may even wish to learn more about your own beliefs. It's also nice to make friends with them if you want. They aren't always out to just convert you. And their mission is very regimented and strict giving them one personal day a week on sunday where they are allowed to contact their families and relax(relax used loosely here)  .

Demisexual people experience no sexual attraction until they have a certain level of connection with someone. Aceflux and acespike people fluctuate in their asexuality.

Patriarchy is more about the establishment of male presence within society or social groups as having more power, say, experience, or “right” than women or NB people. Toxic masculinity is the expression where “traditionally feminine” traits are seen as lesser, and especially as being lesser for a man to partake in or express (like a man who is open with how he’s feeling emotionally would be seen as “lesser”, or a man who uses violence to get what he wants would be a real “mans man” and held up as a standard). At least in Western culture, patriarchy is a big part of how much of our culture has developed in family dynamics, government, and business where women didn’t have much say or decision making available to them.

Reading what you have written, the primary matter for me is not whether or not it is ok to use gay as an insult, but your friend's insensitivity to how you feel as a queer person. I would have hoped that someone who calls themselves a friend would consider being supportive to you as a member of a minority that still suffers from ignorance and bigotry, more important than wanting to cling to a word when there are so many alternatives, and would then desist from using gay as an insult.

Personally, I am not offended by gay being used as a flippant insult, and I think most people who do are not homophobic but just haven't thought about the implications. That said, if I were to point out that it suggests that there is something wrong and unpleasant about being gay and that it made me uncomfortable, even offended me, I would hope those people who respect and care about me, would stop for that reason alone, whether they understood the point or not.

Lady in the grocery store calling me d*ke? Not cool. Friend who is also lgbt  telling me I'm a super d*ke when I put on an outfit and ask if I look too gay? Acceptable. Non-lgbt friend or acquaintance? Not okay.

Same with queer, some people identify as queer. But if someone told them they were a queer to be insulting? Unacceptable. Same with f**got.

(And to be clear, I also recognize that not everyone is okay with f*g and d*ke. Which is why I put the asterisk on those. My thought is this: some people use those terms as a way to reclaim the terms. They (myself included) feel that by using the terms themselves they take away some of the power that other people have over the terms. If I call myself queer in a positive way, it has less power when someone tries to hurt me with that same term.)

__importantly__: it doesn't matter even the tiniest bit whether 90% of the lgbt community is fine with ""gay"" being used as an insult (which is an absurd claim to make either way). *You* are in the LGBT community and *you are not okay with it*. If he can't respect that, he doesn't respect you. And that's all that really matters here. Whether he believed you or not. He should have just said ""oh, sorry, I didn't realize"" and left it at that. And maybe he would have done it still when you weren't around.

iq1om9e,t3_xop3jb,2022-09-27 01:00:11,lgbt,"The short answer is that it's not funny and it's not okay to use the term gay to indicate that something's bad or less than.

That said, some exceptions are made sometimes in the area of humor. This is a tricky thing. Norm Macdonald was getting away with this years and years after it should have been squashed, but everyone including the gay community by and large as far as I can tell agreed it was funny because he wasn't making fun of gays so much as he was making an ironic statement where people laughed at themselves. It was a cringy laugh where people by their laughter were admitting that they had prejudice. Not everyone can pull that off.

Some people in their attempts to be edgy and incorrect will claim that something is funny just because it's offensive. This is incorrect. It is true that very offensive things can sometimes be made funny but that doesn't mean everything that's offensive is funny.

If he doesn't understand all this, he's just an asshole. I would kick him out of the friend group.

Now imagine your other cis-het friend making a private joke with you and using the ""f"" word, the one which is generally considered to be insulting to gay men, and you laugh your head off. It doesn't matter. It's not a double standard, or a conflict. You would not be a hypocrite. There was enough safety there that your friend understood and said something hilarious and you found it funny and that's okay. In this case it's not necessarily oppressive to engage in humor that pokes fun at somebody because they're a member of an oppressed group, whereas in the other case it definitely is.

The difference between the two situations is you. You have the authority. You don't need to come to us and you don't need to go to the rest of your friend group. You have every right to read him the Riot Act based on your feelings, based on your outrage, based on your indignation arising from your identity. Based on not wanting to be put down persecuted insulted or offended anymore, based on your morally righteous determination not to let it happen to you or anyone else ever again.",demonine9,t2_fnx1ov3u,1,0,reddit4

I’m kidding. That being said, as someone who’s bi and neurodivergent, “retarded”, “gay”, “autistic” as insults and even the f-slur and n word don’t really bother me. That being said, they don’t bother **me**.

As soon as someone tells me they’d rather I not use the word in front of them, even if they aren’t part of that group, I respect that. It’s not like the word “moist” where people just don’t like it, the words *do* have history of being used insultingly against those in the group, and insultingly comparing those outside the group to those in it.

I think being insulted by that stuff gives them more power, but that’s just my take, and I’d be an asshole to expect everyone to have the same reasoning or thinking as me.

I will say this - If you don’t like people using a certain word, instead of speaking for an entire group of people who you don’t know, and never will know, every one of, just say you don’t like the word.

Slight aside: I've always identified as ""queer"" (late 30s, out for two decades), and in a recent post many LGBTQ2+ commenters talked about how they hated the word *queer* because they'd been bullied with that word in school. In my developmental years, ""queer"" was yesterday's version of ""gay"" (which I also haven't really heard used since the 90s or early 2000s). 

I didn't personally take the words to heart because in those days we also said people were (deep appologies for the words I'm about to write) retarded, gypped, jewish etc. ""Gay"" wasn't really about homosexuality any more than the other slurs were actually about the people they denigrated. They were just thoughtless insults slung by idiot teens because that's the lingo all the *other* idiot teens were using. 

I'll always refer to myself as queer, because... well, I'm queer. Nothing more or less to be said about it. Call me queer for saying so, but IMHO, words only have the meaning we personally assign to them.",PacificPragmatic,t2_pezw921,4,0,reddit4

So when I was a teen ""gay"" was beyond bad and It took me a long time to come to terms with myself so there were a lot of times that I would use gay and other terms in ways that seemed off color but mostly that was just me introducing those words into my vocabulary.

Looking back I think it was a lot to do with my subconscious fighting against what I'd been taught growing up and trying to see why this word(or words/terms) is something that people are using in a negative connotation. 

My position in this is that everyone needs to try to understand the impact of the words on the audience. This audience includes the speaker, it will have an effect on you. For example if you constantly tell self deprecating jokes it will become part of your personality and can really mess you up and prime you for a bad time if something negative happens in your life.

So in the end we don't care about regulating men.  There is no concern of trans men, because cis men don't see ""women"" as equals, even if they do take testosterone and are men, they will never be as good. Let's not kid ourselves. I have had this argument with folks lots. They tell me a trans man will never be able to compete. Which is a load of horse hockey. There is a trans man on the US national triathlon team, at least there was. There are trans male collegiate athletes and I just saw a doc about a trans male soldier who looked like a soldier of fortune.. Had bigger arms than my father when he was still alive. lol.  We don't talk about them because men don't see them as a threat.

They care about transwomen as they are subversive... Why would anyone want to give up being a man to be a woman. Aghast. The thought of it.  The whole ""we care about women"" is horse hockey too. It is pure and simple sexism. Which is why it baffles me some women are taking the same stance.

When I tell these people I am happy to fight with men... as I think if we train hard, have the same level of experience and weight, we will be pretty equal. I am told I have no idea what I am talking about and I would get my ass kicked. lol.  I have thrown down lots of men on the mats in my time. Half the guys in my training class won't even hold pads for me... never mind get in the ring with me.

If women are not as good, why do we prevent women from competing and earning the same as men... regulation shouldn't matter as women will never be good enough (according to some). But as we have seen, women have become good, and can compete at equal levels in many ways... look at golf.

That is likely deliberate targeting by the advertisers rather than Google's algorithm know as AdWords.   YouTube ads are sold to the highest bidder one ad at a time, because this is super complicated Google has an automatic service which will figure out the most efficient way to show your ads to get the most engagement or clicks.  
I think anti-LGBTQ ads are unlikely to generate lots of clicks or positive engagement on a pro-LGBTQ channel, so it is unlikely this is being done via Google's algorithms.  However, advertisers can also just specifically target individual channels or even individual videos.  I think it is much more likely that anti LGBTQ advertisers deliberately pay extra to do this, because they are trying to hurt queer people.  

The YouTube channel owner also has controls to block specific categories of ads or specific advertisers from ever appearing on their channel. Doing so can be complicated and time consuming if you are not familiar with Googles' publisher controls but One Topic likely has the power to stop those ads from appearing altogether.

Don't stay to watch, don't interact in the comments  don't even dislike the video. The key is minimal interaction. Any engagement, even negative engagement will push it into your algorithm and tells youtube that it gets views.

They don't care if it's good or bad. Even dislikes count as engagement and could go towards that youtuber's profit. It's frustrating to ignore but we need to show youtube we won't even give it our attention.

That said I do know that, as a viewer, if I don’t want to see an ad I can’t block the advertiser, only each individual ad they have. I also know that some anti-LGBT advertisers will re-upload the same ad multiple times while telling YouTube it’s a different ad in order to circumvent this, and force me to see an ad I’ve already blocked. (This happened to me just a few months ago.) I’d be surprised if they didn’t do a similar thing and register as a new advertiser multiple times to circumvent a channel’s controls. After all, it’s not like these people are advertising in good faith. 

I also know that these advertisers will just flag their ads as LGBT content so that it will appear on any channel, or to any viewers, that have interest in that topic, despite the ad being anti-LGBT. Again, they aren’t acting in good faith.

You are absolutely right about advertisers having many copies of the same ad listed as different ads.  This is often done for non malicious reasons, the most common probably being different people using the same ad in different campaigns or they are hosted by third parties which can switch in and out a whole bunch of different ads, it gets really complicated.

Advertisers absolutely do have multiple accounts, but the advertiser is tied to the ad not the account, so that the exclusions listed above can be done.  Very often one account will have ads from multiple different companies they are contracted with.  

Ads ecosystems absolutely do not assume anyone is working in good faith.  Spam and click fraud are large issues that take lots of energy to address.  Creating lots of accounts is a great way to get marked as spam.  Video ads would get manually reviewed for porn, guns and alcohol, because showing these things in the wrong country can result in jail time.  And there were lots of people trying to circumvent to advertise those things.  Of course advertisers would try to find way to circumvent that review process by swapping out one ad for another.

Sadly this is all super complicated and advertisers have an advantage as they only need to get one or two ads pass the censors, while the censors have to be 100% accurate if they want to stop this type of behavior.  

If governments made stronger laws about hate speech this would defiantly result in more proactive action, even the threat of making a new law can spur action.  I wish I had better advice but it's a mess.",lotu,t2_36zyn,2,0,reddit2

She's not enthusiastic or charismatic on the trail in the way someone like Elizabeth Warren is.  She's the definition of the consummate politician whose opinion goes with the polls.   

But I'm voting for her because she isn't Donald Trump and actually has a chance to win.   I may not be convinced that **she** personally has strong convictions for the LGBT community, but we all know she will nominate Supreme Court judges who will actually rule favorably and reasonably.  

A Trump presidency, especially with a republican controlled congress, is the nightmare scenario for the LGBT community and I have a hard time respecting people who won't vote for her in the name of stopping it.   Trump in the White House means at least one bigoted Supreme Court Justice.   Probably at least 2 or 3, who are likely to be replacing our allies on the court.   RBG isn't getting any younger.   This isn't scare tactics, it's fact.  A Trump presidency could set the LGBT rights movement back by 10 years easily simply by ensuring any case to reach SCOTUS over turns rulings like Obergefell v Hodges or simply stonewalls our civil rights that we haven't won yet.

Second, popular vote doesn't matter at a certain point.  You need to win STATES to actually win.  It's the Electoral College that gets a president elected, which is determined by the popular vote: each state gets a certain amount of votes in the Electoral College corresponding to population size.  You need 270 votes in the college to win.  In 48 states it's winner-take-all.  

Gary Johnson is not currently projected by anyone to win a singe state.  His best chances from what I've read is in New Mexico, 5 electoral points, where he is 11-12 points behind Clinton.   For a third party candidate that's pretty good.  For any democratic or republican candidate, that kind of a poll is where you are losing HORRIBLY in.  For Gary Johnson specifucally, that's his home state and best state.  

 He cannot win.  If he's very, very lucky he might crack 100 electoral votes.  Maybe.  Out of a needed 270.    It just isn't going to happen, and a vote for him is as good as a vote for Trump or not voting at all.  The electoral college needs to be revamped and we need to see a system that better addresses third party candidates, it'd be good for the political health of the country.

Thought I'd address this first. This isn't pretty good, this is the best third party campaign in the history of the two party system. Why is this happening? Because these are the worst two candidates of all time, and their views, especially in areas they can actually influence are almost identical. Also, in regards to Aleppo, I do believe that it was a slip, and I also would prefer a president that doesn't just bullshit their way through questions (cough, both other candidates)

>Out of a needed 270

270 is what is needed to win the presidency for any candidate. If neither wins it increases his chances of winning because most senators realize that Hillary and Trump are the two heads of the populist monster facing us today.

His odds of winning don't matter though because where you see the lesser of two evils all I see is evil. I will accept no other option, and refuse to vote for anyone other than who I think should be the president. You are content with voting for the status quo, because you don't think now is the time for change, but in the face of great injustice I always have and always will vote for change.

Maybe Johnson doesn't get elected, but maybe my vote helps influence people to vote for change, maybe the two-party system dies a fiery death and we're all better for it. I'll vote for hope and change while you vote for what most people agree is evil (although there is no consensus on the degree of evil they have reached), fueling war, hate, and the death of choice.

A law establishing LGBT rights and protections does not strip away rights of Christians. It does dictate what public entities can discriminate against.

The thing with the bakery though that gets touted along, and which you say, is that it's just a cake so it's not important, who cares about a cake in the grand scheme of things.

e2qm3ae,t1_e2qm2zl,2018-07-20 18:28:08,lgbt,"**Millennials**

Millennials (also known as Generation Y) are the generational demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.  Millennials are sometimes referred to as ""echo boomers"" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the ""baby boom echo"" was generally less pronounced than the post–World War II baby boom.

Although Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the generation is generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.

Every day I have to write letters and call people and tell them what they're doing is wrong. Already the attacks on uteruses have destroyed the chronic pain community (look at the abortion rights and autoimmune disorders). We are always affected more deeply. 

Let me repeat this: *disabled folks are always affected more deeply by rights being eroded away.*

Between the opioid crisis, racism, lack of legal weed, lack of access to medical treatments, right wingers taking away from social programs, inflation, higher prices but low wages, archaic laws on assets (2k limit), marriage equality, domestic abuse, etc etc etc, we take a lion's share of these issues. 

Why does this matter, we're talking about queer rights? *BECAUSE DISABLED AND QUEER PEOPLE HAVE A HUGE OVERLAP! It's called intersectionality, and that means a huge amount of queer people are disabled as well!* 

Just because we're invisible doesn't mean we aren't fighting. 

Please fight with us and for us. We're doing what we can. But our bodies ache from internal beatings, and we're struggling to even hold a phone to our ear. 

See us, see our struggle, because we're a part of your community too. We're already being destroyed. Fight now, because we've needed you for years, but the second best time is now.",HeroOfSideQuests,t2_2rxxiuyp,30,0,reddit1

Remember the 8 Americans massacred at the Battle of Concord.

Remember the pensive faces of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston as they hunched over collaborating to write the Declaration of Independence, pouring hours of effort into the creed of a nation that, for all they know, may have dissolved a few weeks after its creation.

Remember the terror in George Washington's face as he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey to confront the Hessians and restore his country's morale.

Remember the concern consuming the mind and soul of Abraham Lincoln as he worked tirelessly to piece America back together and to emancipate 4,000,000 slaves.

Remember the stress endured by America's working-class as they begged Grover Cleveland and William McKinley for the most basic efforts to quell their poverty and abuse at the hands of their bosses.

Remember all the brave sacrifices of the Bonus Army, as they rallied Herbert Hoover for rudimentary compensation for their WW1 service just so they could survive the horrors of the Great Depression.

Remember the Allied soldiers and citizens oppressed by Axis imperialism discarding convenience and in many cases life to liberate the world from the vicious, racist desires of the German, Italian, and Japanese governments.

Remember Martin Luther King Jr. sitting in prison merely for standing up to the abominable limits on the freedom and rights of black Americans.

Remember the faces of Mildred and Richard Loving as they witnessed the case of *Loving v. Virginia* being decided by the Supreme Court, hoping that their love and compassion is ruled legally valid.

Millions of people, before, during, and after 1776 have faced pain similar to the pain we face today. Many have been crushed by the callous fangs of tyranny, but most have prevailed. There is no question about if the US will fall back into the sphere of British rule. Similarly, in a few decades, there will be no question about if gay people will be allowed to marry or if trans people will be allowed to be themselves. But to reach that point, continue to fight.

We therefore must abolish capitalism, patriarchy, racism, and the super structure concepts of compartmentalism of people based on one’s effect on population growth and normalcy of gender expression, it’s biologically tying loss of autonomy and commodifies our children as resources just like adults as workers/consumers.

There must be an immediate end of empire too, a serious climate change awareness, land back, land reforms, and reparations. No compromise and no peaceful perspective towards the hawks and evangelical terrorists, they are enemies and we shall never make strides by making peace with the plutocratic dictatorship which is actively stripping us of rights irrespective of how insignificant a minority the Republicans are, Democrats have failed and it’s time we formulate a United front based on our class interest and with real devotion to the marginalized, not lip service toward electoralism.

Greed took over immediately, and then we did something stupid and began separating between parties which absolutely doomed us. Even Washington said doing that would lead to ruin for us, and he was right.

That and we always ignore the separation of church and state, and that's clearly always bit us in the ass at every turn. They're separate for a reason, and yet people want them to always be the same.

Not to mention this government is just completely fucked. We've been just slapping bandaids on a broken arm essentially. The best thing we can do is start from scratch and get rid of it all. It's so bad that anything we do that would remotely fix one thing would need an entire overhaul of how the government works regardless.

- Form a group with **trusted** colleagues in your community and agree on the terms of the cause.

- **Exercise your right to vote** in local and federal elections, **do not jeopardize that right**, and encourage others to do the same.

- Employ two tactics to promote the cause: 1) With messaging designed to explicitly promote the cause, and 2) With messaging that indirectly supports the cause by championing or criticizing individual initiatives, ideas, politicians, and businesses.

- Continually research local events, politicians, political initiatives, businesses, and other organizations using govtrack.us, opensecrets.org, accountable.us, followthemoney.org, various local news outlets, and other resources to better understand how they relate to the cause and incorporate that into your messaging.

- Promote the cause through whatever means is afforded to you by your time, such as with pamphlets, detailed documents, simple infographics, letters to local news outlets and magazines, letters to local politicians, local TV and radio call-ins, Youtube videos, social media, regional subreddits, protests, music, TV, books, 'zines, stencil graffiti, stickers, ""billboard liberation"", ""culture jamming"", etc.

- Ensure messaging is optimized for the format, be on guard for counternarratives that may attempt to dismiss or extremify the messaging, avoid using references or terms that could be used to connect lawful messaging to less lawful messaging, remember the goal isn't to ""win"" or be ""right"" but to promote the cause effectively, and remember your target audience are people that either don't agree with the cause or are in agreement but are indifferent to action.

- Do not conduct online campaigns only, you can reach people in ways that are more personal, memorable, and unique than the online trolls and botnets ever could.

- Retain anonymity whenever possible, continually learn how to protect yourself from surveillance, and continually learn how the medium you use for messaging can be traced back to you. Assume your communications and records can be obtained by others and conduct yourselves accordingly.

- Do not allow others to escalate your activities in ways that could threaten you, your right to vote, your group, or the cause. 

- Understand success requires time and dedication.

On January 18 2012, the day of the SOPA blackout, ICE was in New Zealand raiding the Kim Dotcom estate with the RIAA in short tow, and while researching how this all made sense, too many of the rhymes between the US and the German Reich were already there.

We depend on the same systems that are turning foul, so we didn't want to believe it, or could do nothing about it.

If you have the means to escape the US, _now is the time to do so._ We _may_ get a reprieve if the November election turns out well, but SCOTUS is already looking to review _Moore v. Harper_ and may do so in October. There is a high risk that democracy in the US is already neutered, and the fascist uprising has taken control of Governor, US Senator and US Representative elections.

Well, for starters one set of parents is conservative. I'm not doing anything with them because I can't as they support anti-LGBTQ+ stuff. By the time they start caring it's too late.

The other set has babies. I don't know about you but trying to protest with babies has a good chance of going wrong. Especially with the increase in ""police can legally screw you over"" for lack of a better term.

I don't go to an in-person school so I'm almost always in the house. Even if I did go to a brick-and-mortar school I live in Florida. 

It's great you can go and do things. It's great you have the access to these things that allow you to go and help others. I don't. The most I'll be capable of doing is signing up for a brick-and-mortar school and then protesting there when I can, but that requires many people. With my experience in southern schools most students aren't very ""accepting,"" and being a trans student it gets worse.

Plus... This country literally ignores protests; a good majority of the time it doesn't do shit. 

Right now, I cannot risk it. For my both my physical and mental health I can't. Financially? Both families don't make much either. Plus, as I said I can't get my Dad or step-Mom to do anything because of babies. They make more, they have more resources but I'm only in their custody for the summer. Which is almost over.

Maybe to you, I'm making excuses. But a protest is nothing when the protesters are dead. There are things you should prioritize and for me that's the safety of me and my family.",TiredBoi18,t2_p1ms0c52,1,0,reddit1

Reading this poem outside of the historical context does this poem a disservice and limits the vectors of understanding.

With Hitlers rise to power he started to Crack down on communist organization, as they where the first to see him for what he was. They were the one organizing marches against him and his policies. Niemöller was actually fine with hitler in the beginning. He was for the restrictions on communist organizations. Not only that he believed that unions where destroying the German recovery after ww1. As such he was glad that the trade unions got destroyed. Hell, he even met hitler himself around this time and singed his praises. After this point though he started to have some serious issues with the regime.

1933 rolls around and the anti Jewish laws get enforced for real. This is when niemöller joined a pastoral group against these laws. What you need to know is that while hitler got power through a coup, he did so after getting support of the local catholic church leaders (for a guarantee on being able to still have religious schools).

Niemöller was a Lutheran protestant. They did not support hitler in the same way (though most protestant church leaders did support hitler personally). So when niemöller started to organize against Hitlers programs and anti Jewish laws, he got sent to two concentration camps. First being the death camp Sachsenhausen which he survived. He then got sent to dachau where he survived until saved by the US.

If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. 1 John 4:20-21

Christians should be more concerned about loving people than protecting their own rights. In fact, Jesus told us to expect people to discriminate against us for trusting him...

""If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."" John 15:18-19

So to start off I was raised to think gay people were evil only going one place...hell. My dad hates gay people he would tell me gays only go to hell and burn. Living with that for 16 years I became a bigot I hated gay people just as much as my father, and I voiced how i felt in school. 

My high school had a ""day of silence"" (if you support LGBT rights you didn't speak all day.) Well I decided I would get a group of people that felt the same as me that being homosexual was the wrong choice. We screamed and yelled at kids all day we bullied them, something ill always remember is telling a kid hes a faggot because he had two dads. I went home that day and I like to think that god sent me a message to stop being a fucking asshole. I arrived at my house to see my dad crying, gotten off the phone with my uncle (my uncle also hated gay people) I asked my dad what was wrong he told me my cousin had just come out as gay.

This was a big for me, no one in my family saw this coming and it happened on the same day that I had just bullied all these kids for being gay. I love my cousin he was always there for me and he was just like a brother. I was confused, I called him and asked he said it was all true he was going to cali to live how he wanted to. He got kicked out of our family soon after that It was really sad to see.

I went to school that next morning I saw that kid that I called a faggot for having two dads, he had fresh cut marks all over his arm. That was the turning point thats when I realized I am the bad guy. I took a long hard look in the mirror after that.

I apologized right there when I saw him, I cried in front of him everything was hitting me at once. I changed after that day started studying Libertrainism went off to college and met some cool gay/straight/bi people. I can't change who I was or what ive done but i can learn from it and be a better person and I think that is what being a christian is about living like someone you would be proud of.

All that stuff still haunts me, but me and that kid with two dads are best friends now for the last 7 years so I guess one good thing came out of it. My uncle and my cousin have reunited and everything is ok now, but it was a true life lesson.",12wienerdogs,t2_cpheu,34,0,reddit2

I believe that you are unaccepting that there are Christians that are truly loving and accepting of all people. The Bible is open to interpretation. Some people have used it to do great evil, and others great acts of compassion. The central figure of the New Testament acted with nothing but compassion for humanity. He literally went around and taught the Jews that they were worshipping wrong and misusing the scriptures, the scriptures being what we call the Old Testament now. All those acts of hate and violence are from the Old Testament. I am entirely sure that Jesus would welcome a homosexual with open arms and the same love he offers someone to who isn't.

There's a VERY good chance this will be thrown out and blocked, or if it passes, that it'll be mired in lawsuits.

The problem comes from the fact that it's another wave in the constant barrage of anti-LGBTQI laws and a reminder how the current administration is doing literally everything it can to make our lives unliveable.

EOs don't need to be explicit or come into effect fully to have devastating effects on marginalised communities. Even if it gets blocked, which it most likely will, it's still destabilising.

It sends the signal that now is the best time to try and pass these laws and it will embolden bigots who believe now is the time to act like this. It gives the green light to anti-LGBTQI, racist groups to do things more and more openly.

It gives employers and health care providers the liscense to say 'I'm exercising my religious freedoms'. It's yet another way we're meant to constantly fight to be recognised as human beings with rights.

If there are two cake shops in this hypothetical city, one that discriminates against us and one that does not, people will **flock** to the one that discriminates and it will only cost them the very, very, very few queer people who are born there or never left after reaching adulthood.

So this EO allows someone to discriminate against another person based on how this other person violates or offends their religious view. Let's take out ""gay"" and replace it with ""black"". Say for example a black man is refused service at a DMV or by a doctor because the DMV worker or doctor is an old school Mormon. That could be a situation this EO could lead to. Or a Muslim cashier at Walmart could refuse to serve unveiled women. How about a Jewish store owner refuses to serve people who look German?

Just because bigotry is evenly applied doesn't mean it isn't still bigotry. This EO sets up the potential for unlimited Jim Crow laws against any type of segment of the population. We'll have black water fountains as well as gay, Christian, Muslim, Hispanic, white, people with missing teeth, etc.

Second is the real world model.

As you may know, something like 60-70% of this country is Christian as they incessantly remind us. While religiosity isn't a perfect predictor of anti-LGBT bigotry, it certainly is more predictive then eye color. Let's not pretend that this won't just empower and embolden the Kim Davis' of the country disproportionately compared to other faiths.",Link9454,t2_8dqac,8,0,reddit2

Despite what is in this order, you cannot discriminate against someone based on their religion.

For instance, a Muslim man could not refuse to do business with a woman purely based on her gender, because gender is a protected class. 
A Christian also can't refuse service to an atheist, because atheism is technically a religion and therefore a protected class. 
 
But a Christian CAN use this order to discriminate against LGBTQ people, because they have no class protections and homosexuality is generally condemned in the church, therefore violating the Christian's 'religious rights'. 

This order would just make things worse for LGBTQ people, it would not and could not be used against Christians. ",twokidsinamansuit,t2_60dfk,18,0,reddit2

1) Civil--judicial practices, business practices, criminal justice, etc

2) Ceremonial--Sacrificial offerings, priestly duties, law of atonement, priest regulations, festivals, etc

3) Moral--stealing, lying, cheating, idolatry, sexually immoral practices, loving your neighbor 

Civil laws were only applicable to that Jewish society/government. 

Ceremonial laws became obsolete when Jesus sacrificed himself to pay our debt and became our great high priest.

However Moral laws still stand. They reflect the character and design of God, and He does not change. I prefer Romans 1 as a good summary of the condition of people's hearts/lives apart from a relationship with God.

I believe the Bible teaches that homosexuality is not God's design. But I don't believe anyone in the LBGTQ community is sub-human or should be treated with any less respect than anyone else. We were all knit together in our mothers' wombs in the image of God.

dh469bd,t1_dh42gec,2017-05-04 10:50:25,lgbt,"My view is that people in the LGBT community should have the same freedom as everyone else. Surely there are better solutions to a Christian's ""conflict of interest"" when they are asked to participate in a homosexual marriage. If you're in a government job that asks you to sign marriage licenses, and you don't feel comfortable signing a license for a homosexual couple, then get another job.

(Side note: I believe Biblical marriage and civil marriage are separate. One is an institution of God, one is an institution of government.)

Another big concern would be churches losing their tax-exempt status if they refuse to participate in or allow their facilities to be used by a homosexual couple. In my mind, if the Church feels strongly that it is God's will that marriage should be between a man and woman, then any threat of losing a financial benefit shouldn't be an issue. Jesus teaches us that we shouldn't put our trust and security in money but in Him alone.

Really there is no ""attack"" or fear of personal loss that could ever steal my faith. Not because of my own resilience but because the promises of God always hold true. 

""And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose."" Romans 8:28

And I believe ""all things"" mean ALL things. If the US started systematically killing Christians tomorrow, God is still good and faithful. I'd rather that not happen though ;)

That is a matter of speech, because the actual content of the cake is relevant. In the same vein, a baker could refuse to make a ""LGBT PEOPLE ARE AWESOME"" cake, even if it were for a wedding.

On the flip side, if a Nazi were to walk into a bakery in a place where political affiliation is covered as a protected class, a baker could not refuse to make a normal, typical wedding cake for them, just as they can't refuse to do this for same gender couples where orientation is a protected class.

>Y'all cheered everybody who refused to provide service to a presidential inauguration they found personally offensive. It's a bit hipocritical to complain about others doing it too.

There's a difference though.  I remember hashing this out with some friends, because everyone wants to keep logically consistent viewpoints and you're absolutely right that on the surface this seems hypocritical.

When can you deny service to someone, as a baker?  I see the example of ""Would a Jew have to make a neonazi cake?"" or ""Would a black man have to make a cake for a KKK rally?"" or the favorite of Fox News comment sections, ""I can't wait to make a Muslim bake me a bacon-topped cake, he HAS to, he can't discriminate!""

All of these are flawed, because two of those cakes constitute *compelled speech*, and one presumably uses an ingredient a Muslim baker doesn't offer.  The difference between a gay wedding cake and a straight wedding cake is that two of the names on the cake are the same gender.  This isn't compelled speech (according to judges who have ruled on this), because the bakery's addition of names to a cake is something they generically offer.  A Jewish bakery does not offer swastikas in their cake decorations.  A wedding cake bakery makes wedding cakes though.

How does this compare to the inauguration?  Performing at an inauguration is absolutely political.  It is an inherently political environment, and performing is an implicit endorsement of the candidate being sworn in.  Forcing someone to perform at such an event is absolutely compelled speech, which is forbidden under the 1st amendment. ",Shanman150,t2_7rez1,3,0,reddit2

>Another big concern would be churches losing their tax-exempt status if they refuse to participate in or allow their facilities to be used by a homosexual couple. 

I'm pretty sure that's not the way it works. If a church or Religious organization receives federal funds and beaches anti discriminatory laws, they lose that funding. Paying taxes, it not,  aren't considered part of that. At least not that I've ever heard. If you know otherwise, would you mind citing a reference from a credible publication?

It's interesting to see you see Christian marriage as a different construct than civil marriage. I'm sure this is something refunded through faith but marriage is marriage in the eyes of most people. If two people got married 1000 years ago in Russia, they were married. I really don't care if a Christian pastor or priest was involved. God isn't required to certify to people love and care for each other to commit to each other and share their lives.

The problem I'm having I think is that Christians and particularly religious ones like yourself have to invent it maintain multiple sets of beliefs to incorporate society into your faith. It's honestly mind boggling that had to occur and in its own way is responsible for why some Christians can justify their bigotry and others can either ignore what they don't like or support it in the way you do.

You seem like a good enough person so I'm trying to say that while still illustrating how your interpretation of Christianity is a problem. You can quote scripture if you like but that really only works in the face of other religious people doing the same to justify their opinions. Arguing religious texts is something that should not replace simple reason......ever. We all say ""Thank God"", and while recognizing that phrase is a social norm global, in various languages and gods, it's an expression of relief, not a commitment to limited reasoning within the confines of a centuries old text that was used to control the masses of illiterate and uneducated populous.

Education should promote rational thinking. Religion his people like yourself back. Your interpretation of Christianity and willingness to incorporate modern society into is a positive but how you do it is your way of coping with what the texts are not clear on. The same can be said of the bigoted alt right Christians claiming their faith is being discriminated against. They can't see the negativity towards them is simply a direct result of their own bigotry but claim no responsibility.

Meh, what is my point? I think it's just religion should not override reason and critical thinking. It should come second at the very least, if at all, and no religion is so precise as to not depend on vagueness for personal interpretation. Anyone filling that in with negativity and hate is only revealing their own flaws, and if they get called bigots as a result, it's not God's fault and I blame them for being simple minded.

I still don't understand why someone such as yourself does this though. Can't you just say marriage is marriage? Any 2 people should be able to get married and it's the same construct. Trans people should not have to out themselves to use a public restroom. Things like this seem common sense if you just take religion out of logical thinking.",elyn6791,t2_14th0r,2,0,reddit2

I really wish that people would take just a few minutes to research things and learn about them before spouting off stuff like this. Because it is simply not true. It didn't become true just because people have propped it up as a (bad) counterexample. Political speech and views are rarely, if ever included as protected classes in public accommodations ordinances or laws, so the KKK and Nazis would have no standing to file a complaint.

Beyond that, businesses are free to refuse to write whatever messages they want on cakes. If a gay couple showed up asking for a rainbow cake with ""GAY PEOPLE ARE GREAT"" written on it, the baker would be free to refuse that cake, even if it were for a wedding. That's much more clearly a matter of speech than of just providing a service. What they are not free to refuse is to make a ""standard"" wedding cake. I don't know what a KKK wedding cake would look like...but I'd imagine that, even if being a member of the Klan were a protected class (and it isn't) for public accommodations, it would have to cross that speech vs. service line in order to get that moniker.

Now, if a KKK member or Nazi were to show up asking for a regular old wedding cake, there's no way you would know they were a terrible person, unless they were to express it towards you in some way (in which case, you'd likely be free to refuse service based on their behavior) or if they asked you to put some kind of vile message or symbol on the cake (in which case you'd be free to refuse to do that).

I don't want to be excessively rude, but at the same I'm confounded as to why everyone assumes that they, a layperson, have just now thought up the exception that no lawyer, judge, or lawmaker has considered in the past ***fifty years*** in which we've had these kinds of civil rights laws in some form.",,,4,0,reddit2

You can refuse service to anyone for non-discriminatory reasons. Laws prohibiting discrimination do not change the fact that a business is someone's private property. If we got a customer who was extremely rude or had a dog that was too aggressive to be handled, we would tell that customer they couldn't board with us. Theoretically, if I was a homophobic/transphobic asshole and knew a customer was gay/trans, I could just tell them that their dog was too aggressive and there's nothing that person could do. You need to be able to prove that someone was discriminating against you in court for these laws to work. It's in no way comparable to slavery. Additionally, many of these laws issue fines for violations unless it becomes a constant problem. YMMV depending on local laws.

Personally, I don't think boycotts matter too much in rural conservative areas. The free market is horribly inefficient at preventing discrimination where there's little competition.

dh57qyu,t1_dh4u6vs,2017-05-04 23:40:59,lgbt,"Good thoughts, Elyn. I think I need to start off by establishing my primary premise in life: I believe that there is one true and living God that existed before (and outside) time. He created everything visible and invisible, galactic and microscopic, time itself...everything. We won't get into the ""how?"" aspect of the universe's origin because I imagine we differ on that as well. But it's important to touch on important aspects of God's character. He is completely good, pure, loving, just, righteous, all-knowing, all-powerful...and the list goes on. 

He created people, He loved people, people rebelled against His authority despite His warning of consequences, and thus began hunger, poverty, murder, rape, depression, suicide, disease, and so on. As a God of justice He must punish our rebellion and fulfill His judgment on all people who don't live up to His standard (that's all of us); if He didn't, He would not be just. 

BUT He is also a loving God, so he began His plan of reconciling people to Himself, which He had planned from the very beginning (that's right, He knew all along that we'd goof up with our free will). A lot of stuff happens that you might not care about, but ultimately the gist is that God comes to us in the form of His Son, Jesus. Jesus not only teaches us and shows us how to live (being God himself), but He also makes Himself the final and only sacrifice to atone for OUR rebellion. So, in one moment, God demonstrates His perfect justice and love in Jesus dying on the cross for His people. Jesus is raised and is exalted back to His throne in heaven but instructs His disciples to make more disciples/believers and tasks the Church with loving God and loving people (just like He did).

How do I know all this? Well God also, in His sovereignty and power, directed the hands and minds of various authors to write books and letters about these events. Of course, I'm talking about the Bible.

At this point, I might as well have told you ""I'm a Jedi Knight, and I live to serve the Force,"" but bear with me. We could have an endless debate about everything I just stated, but that really isn't the point of my post. I simply wanted to convey my STARTING POINT, the foundation for everything else that I believe. Even though you don't agree with my initial premise, I'm living my entire life under the assumption that everything the Bible has taught me is 100% true.

That being said I want to challenge your assumption that ""rational thinking"" and my faith are mutually exclusive. Based on everything I've told you that I believe, if I TRULY believe it, living my life in any other manner would be IRRATIONAL. If I TRULY believe (which I do) there is an all-powerful, all-knowing God that has instructed me to follow Him and trust His guidance, wouldn't I be a complete fool to live otherwise? Instead my life, actions, relationships, career, financial investments, parenting style, beliefs, etc. are all filtered through the lens of God's truth, which is the most RATIONAL thing I could do if I believe the Bible. In the same manner, since you DON'T believe in God, then you live your life based on your truth rather than God's truth, which is also completely RATIONAL based on the assumptions of your worldview (I'm not promoting relativism; I believe that God's truth is absolute).

The IRRATIONAL people would be those who claim to know and love God...but are hateful and bigoted. In this instance, they believe there is a God, but they live their lives based on their emotions and their own version of the ""truth."" This is the reason I stated Scripture before, to demonstrate that the message of God is love and reconciliation and not rejection, oppression, and fear.

So I hope you understand that I am not putting my own personal spin on Christianity to make it ""fit."" Instead I am looking at the world and trying to understand it through God's truth and design. It's true that society is changing and evolving, but God's Word will never need my help (or anyone else's) to make sense. If anything is limited, then it is my ability to comprehend God's wisdom.

Also, I wanted to clarify my statement about two different marriage constructs. I didn't intend for this to sound like I don't recognize marriages outside the church or that it is illegitimate. I believe that marriage outside of the Church still represents love, commitment, and the union of two lives. I have no problem with anyone getting married to anyone (or anything for that matter) outside the context of the church. I don't really have the authority to tell others what they should and should not do. Just like I can't force them to believe the Bible.

However, I believe I'm within my rights to say that marriage outside of the Church does not have the same PURPOSE as a Biblical marriage. In the Bible, God established marriage between a man and a woman. The primary purpose was to build families in an environment of love, commitment, and union. So far this isn't much different than civil marriage, right? BUT I believe that marriage has another purpose. I would say ""secondary"" purpose, but I believe it's just as important as the first if not MORE important. Bear with me...here comes more Scripture.

""Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.""    Ephesians 5:25-32

In other words, Biblical marriage is a covenant between a man, a woman, and their Creator. God establishes and maintains the marriage. A Biblical marriage is an image of Jesus and the Church (this a regular theme throughout scripture: Jesus is the bridegroom and we are his bride). It is a ceremony and a commitment that can only be likened to baptism and Eucharist (Lord's Supper, Communion). It is an outward sign of a much bigger picture, God's love for His people. I strive to love my wife the way Christ loves the Church: completely, humbly, sacrificially, and unconditionally.

For this reason, I believe civil marriages and Biblical marriages are not equivalent, even if they share some similarities in purpose. But, like I said, I don't have the right to define marriage for my entire country based on my beliefs. People should have the freedom to get married for whatever reason they see fit. I also don't feel that my marriage is threatened or undermined by marriages outside of the church because I am confident the purpose of my marriage is to reflect and honor my Savior. Really the Church should be concerned by ""believers"" who couldn't care less about the significance of marriage. Divorce rates are still far too high for people who claim to share my beliefs.

I hope this helped you understand my point-of-view a little better, Elyn. I'm looking forward to your feedback :)",CtrlAltDylete,t2_140v7f,1,0,reddit2

But this kind of crap almost exclusively came from straight people trying to tell me about how wrong I was about my rights and who was supporting me. Some of them were Trump supporters refusing to take responsibility and admit that they were voting for him because they didn't care enough about his anti-LGBT policies and platform. Some people used it as an excuse to vote for someone else or not vote at all, while LGBT people [overwhelmingly](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/11/14/lgbt-voters-rejected-trump-lopsided-margin/) said, ""No. She's on our side. Don't use us as an excuse."" But either, way overwhelmingly straight.

The straightness of the people posting this kind of thing was an essential element of my complaint. Being straight, they've never really been required to engage deeply with these issues. It's never been life-or-death for them. Because of this, many of them don't have anything resembling a complete view of what the struggle for LGBT rights has looked like. They look at Clinton's endorsement of marriage equality in 2013 and pooh-pooh it, because they don't realize how recent a development it is for any mainstream politician to be in favor of marriage equality. This has become increasingly true post-*Obergefell*.

Many straight people don't realize that we've faced a lot of big fights before marriage equality (and that we've continued to face them afterwards), including just being treated with basic human dignity. They don't realize that people like Clinton who took the positions she did in the late 90s and early 2000s really did stick their necks out for us when we were still a pretty unpopular minority group.

And they need to realize that they, as straight people, sometimes need to shut up and listen to the people who have been forced to confront these issues every day, year after year, because they impact our lives deeply. They need to realize that LGBT people know more about our rights than straight people do. When a marginalized group is in overwhelming agreement on something, you sometimes need to just defer to their lived experience.

On top of all of that that, I'm *not talking to straight people here*, and I don't really care to be tone policed. I'm talking in an LGBTQ+ space to primarily LGBTQ people. I don't generally tell straight people to, ""Shut your yap,"" though I do frequently press them on issues of privilege and on the fact that their straightness has insulated them from really having to deal with the issues facing LGBT people.",,,11,0,reddit2

A lawsuit doesn't always imply guilt, it means that someone found an issue with something someone else did; You can't use the existence of one as proof that there was criminal mischief done at the behest of the DNC.

>and wikileaks documents support the notion. 

Wikileaks documents support the idea that the DNC favored Hillary, someone who had been working for them for decades over Bernie, someone who practically shittalked them up until he decided to run as a Democrat.

>Which only lends more credence to people voting third party; why trust an organization that doesn't respect the Democratic process? 

I like the 'doesn't respect the democratic process' part thrown in there implying that the DNC did more than give their preferred candidate more airtime. 

Do you think that they did some ballot stuffing that caused Bernie to lose the popular vote in the Primary because that's the only possible way I can think of that they could have hijacked the democratic process.

Why did Trump win? Because Hillary and the DNC assumed that they would keep Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania because they had historically voted blue. 

If Bernie had run, would he have won? Who knows? 

He might have won those states but lost others or he might have won those states while keeping the others. 

>And Sanders has a stronger record on lgbt issues than Clinton.   

They both have stronger records on them than Trump; That's why I voted Bernie in the primary and Hillary in the general.

It wouldn't have been ideal but we wouldn't be talking about someone going to trial for disorderly conduct for laughing during Sessions' oath.

I was an EMT for five years, and I can say this is well and truly false. Very few locations have a defined set of rules in regards to a responder's [Duty to Act](http://inpublicsafety.com/2014/03/duty-to-act-legal-obligations-vs-community-expectations/). 

Looking beyond Duty to Act, If you refuse to make meaningful contact with the patient, no one is ever going to be able to charge you with [abandonment](http://www.jems.com/articles/2007/09/patient-abandonment-what-it-an-0.html), as was proved by [this case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyra_Hunter). 

Furthermore, many ambulance services are private instead of being owned by a city or county. Many of those owned ambulance services have religious affiliation. Under these new guidelines, they could simply refuse to go to certain locations (LGBT bars, LGBT shelters, ect.) and there would be nothing illegal about it. A religious ambulance organization could just ask for another ambulance from a neighboring district to respond to a location they find morally reprehensible; however, that adds minutes to a medical conditions that deteriorate in seconds.  

Personally, I don't want my life risked because of some legally gray nonsense. I want my rights protected in equal proportion to others. This pending EO would spit in the face of that. ",,,13,0,reddit2

It frustrates me that the internet already had a phrase for the exact thing we're talking about here, but it's fallen out of use: rustled jimmies.  Having your jimmies rustled is not the same thing as being triggered.  I do get my jimmies rustled pretty often, but it doesn't affect my life much.  I'm talking about reading news articles like this one, and feeling angry at other people's opinions, etc.  

However, I also have an anxiety disorder and at least one actual trigger due to a traumatic experience a few years ago. Since then, when a specific (out of my control) thing happens in real life, I have serious panic attacks.  I do get upset, sometimes very upset, at references to this topic, in fiction etc., but it doesn't make me panic; it's an ordinary type of bad feeling, not world-is-ending, all-consuming horror.  

So, trigger warnings don't apply to me, because there isn't really anything for me to avoid to solve this problem.  However, I know that people with anxiety disorders and/or PTSD can have much more severe reactions to even casual reminders of their traumatic memories.  Also, while my bad experience was very mild compared to other people's, I can say with authority that being triggered to the point of panic is a totally different thing from being upset or from having my jimmies rustled.

However, it may have gone past the point where education about the term was useful.  It became so compounded with misinformation (""students at liberal arts college say literature is too triggering, want to burn all classics"" -fox news, probably) that using the term correctly may have been attempting to drag it too far from it's perceived meaning.

dh5iieq,t1_dh5eb5k,2017-05-05 03:56:12,lgbt,"Yeah, you're right, I guess I did make some assumptions about what your worldview might be. Sorry if I offended you. I guess I've got all my cards out on the table, but I don't know too much about your point-of-view yet.

As far as my ""specific branch"" of Christianity, I don't really like claiming a denomination because there is probably a historical criticism for each. I grew up in a Southern Baptist church. The typical criticisms of this denomination would be that they are legalistic, staunchly fundamentalist, and judgmental. Unfortunately, I even encountered several people that reflected these stereotypes.

But over the years I've studied books, read commentaries, taken classes, and had relationships with people from many different backgrounds and denominational affiliations. There may be slight differences in interpretations of the book of Revelation (prophecy) and other minor traditions, BUT the primary tenets of our faith are clearly outlined in scripture. I've taken Systematic Theology and Hermeneutics courses that have only served to strengthen my beliefs. However, of course the primary source of any Christian's study should be the Bible and learning how to interpret it well.

You may be thinking that this leaves a lot of room for subjective interpretation. However, when taught to reverently study and draw out truths from the Word, you're far less likely to make mistakes. Unfortunately, some people use the Bible for their personal ammunition, flippantly firing off verses without any knowledge of the context or meaning. These would be your bigots and your hate-mongers. 

I can actually provide a good example of good biblical interpretation vs. poor biblical interpretation and address LGBT people who believe in Jesus. 

Scripture can be interpreted in two ways:

1) Exegesis- the process of drawing out the meaning from a text in accordance with the context and discoverable meaning of its author (the ultimate author being God)

2) Eisegesis- the process of interpreting a text in such a way that the process introduces one's own presuppositions, agendas, or biases into and onto the text.

I would say a majority of believers in the Bible would say that the LGB lifestyle would fall into the category of sexual immorality. I omitted the ""T"" purposefully as trans people don't necessarily have an issue with sexuality. For me, this isn't an stubborn belief based on tradition or emotion, it's built on scripture (through exegesis).

""Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error."" Romans 1:24-27

I believe those people who would say that you can be LGB -and- Christian would have to do some hermeneutical gymnastics to interpret passages such as this in their favor (eisegesis). And some may say that they do not believe in ALL parts of the Bible or that the passage should be interpreted in its cultural context, etc. Even so, I don't see a rational argument for being a Bible-believing Christian and LGB. But I know you're right, there are people that do believe in God and openly live a LGB lifestyle. Believing in God and trusting in God are two different things (we can go into more detail about this if you'd like).

Most importantly though, I do not believe LGB people are excluded from God's love and surely they deserve my love and acceptance. In fact, I have an uncle that is gay, and I love him and his partner just as passionately as I do anyone else. Do I believe that they are living a lifestyle that isn't what God has shown us is right and true? Yes. But just like everyone else that is far from God, I pray for them and for opportunities to show them the love God first demonstrated to me. Jesus never tasked the Church with fixing the errors in the world. He told us to love, serve, teach, build relationships, and point people to Him. Changing someone's heart and mind is the work of the Holy Spirit (thank God it's not reliant on my persuasion or charm). For context, the Holy Spirit or the ""Mind of God"" is the way God works in us to make us more like Himself AFTER we receive salvation. In order to be more like Jesus, God eliminates things in our life and calls us to greater things (such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control).

Finally, I wanted to note that I believe you can have same-sex ATTRACTION and be a true believer. Having an appetite and a desire for something is not bad in and of itself, submitting to the temptation would be the error. That rings true for any pursuit that goes beyond what God has outlined for us. I always believed this in theory, but a few years back I actually had a buddy of mine confide in me that he was attracted to men. He's been happily married to his wife for a year now.

>You have the freedom to make the choice to withdraw from a situation hat you do not like. This is the freedom of which you are afforded. As a child, your freedoms are limited. As an adult... leave the situation and coalesce with people that will accept your marketshare.


This is a naive way to look at things, and speaks to a very privileged upbringing. I could afford to leave, so I did; however, many people I was close to could not. If you want a comparable example, look at rural Appalachia. People want to leave. Brain drain is huge. However, many people cannot afford to get out. It is the same for many LGBT individuals in less than ideal areas. 

And on the topic of ideal areas, many of us simply do not want to leave. To make a red state, our home state, more red. We love our homes. We are comfortable in our homes; however, if this EO was fully recognized, that all could be upended by two people who own certain commodities (food and fuel). Or better yet, one person who controls the only apartment complexes in a small town. 


> leave the situation and coalesce with people that will accept your marketshare.


I hate this statement more than anything. Some of us have no where to go. I am a firefighter/EMT with a background with rural departments. My primary hobbies are hunting, fishing, gardening, backpacking, and hiking. I don't like cities, I don't like towns. I just happen to be transgender, and because of that small facet of the greater whole that is me, I have to leave the location that I would otherwise find ideal if only I could assure access to food, fuel, and healthcare. Simple human needs. 

Take that sentiment and jog on.

dh3332v,t1_dh31a3i,2017-05-03 18:13:49,lgbt,">Or maybe the couple were just in the face of the cake makers

And there it is. It has nothing to do with participating or celebrating an event, nothing to do with freedom of expression or the cake as a form of art. It's about being grossed out by gay people or just religious bigotry hidden under less socially unacceptable terminology. What does that even mean? The gay couple were making out in the faces of the cake makers, or swishing too much when they walked, or saying ""gurl"" too often? 

These people do fucking wedding cakes, there are bridezillas and in your face heterosexual couples every day. The cake makers and florists that have been sued didn't tell the couple they were denying them because they were too aggressive; they told them they were denying them because of their beliefs that didn't allow them to build a standard wedding cake for a gay couple. 

Notice that no gay couples sued because a baker wouldn't put the two grooms/two brides on top of the cake. If that were the only issue and the baker just didn't stock male-male/female-female piece, gay couples would and do just buy their own.

And I'm sorry that our courts disagree with you, because in (I think) every case, they have ruled against the discriminating parties, ruling that if you are open to the public and receive tax dollars, you are obligated to offer everyone the same goods and services.

The problem with allowing discrimination in these cases but disallowing it in life/death cases is that leaves the door open for a wide range of technically non-life threatening situations for discrimination. How about a grocery store or convenience store in a small rural town? They could also say that they can't provide services to a gay couple because they don't approve of the lifestyle. If there is only one grocery store/convenience store, that could cause significant burden on the gay people. Or more realistically, a gay couple traveling through a conservative state stops at a rest stop that has the only inn for 100s of miles, but the inn won't accommodate them with a room because they are gay. Neither situation is technically life threatening, but our legislature and court systems have written public accommodation laws because these exact situations can, do, and have arisen, particularly with regards to African Americans during the Jim Crow Era, and LGBT couples in more modern times.

Let's take India, for example , where I am from.   
Horribly misogynistic society by all accounts. Yet, one that has seen far more access to power, privilege and opportunity for cis women than for trans women,**ever**. 

Almost all trans women in India have to beg or sell sex for survival ; a fate that does not befall anywhere as nearly a percentage of cis women. 

There are no rights to any kind of relationship being recognised for trans women. Trans women in India who end up being raped can only have their rapists sentenced for a maximum of two years, while cis women's rapists end up being sentenced for six years minimum to a lifetime. Like, you utter ghoul, the rape of trans women is legally considered less grave than that of cis women, and this is a country that has had huge issues with rape culture as a whole. 

A whole 14% of India's parliamentarians are cis women. There has never been a single trans woman, ever, that has been an MP. The point I am making is that trans women in India end up generally being far worse off. The same is true of ministers or of state legislators. Meanwhile, the furthest Indian trans women have gone is having two *village councillors*. There is absolutely no comparison when it comes to disenfranchisement from having any kind of say in our own fates. 

So when you invoke cis women's suffering in the global south to justify transmisogyny, while ignoring how trans women in the same societies end up far more ostracised, far more disenfranchised, far more exploited , far worse off in the same societies, I'm inclined to conclude you should consider shutting the fuck up  because some of us do see your cynical attempts to justify transmisogyny while erasing the truth about transmisogyny in the same societies, and you are quite simply beneath contempt. 

Also you are just flat out bad at logic if you think OP's context involves asking some random cis woman from the global south to accept trans women , although I will say that even if it was, it is entirely reasonable to ask cis people in the global south to accept trans women in the global south, given that cis privilege exists within societies when comparing the relative statuses of cis and trans people, and cis women and trans women.",GenesForLife,t2_2pl2fi2s,1,0,reddit3

- Primary sex characteristics - things like genitals and breasts.  These usually follow chromosomes but not always, and actual size/shape can vary greatly.

- Secondary sex characteristics - things like an Adam's Apple or cellulite or ovaries.  These also usually follow chromosomes but not always, and presentation can vary greatly.

- Chromosomes - we're used to XX and XY, but that's mostly because it's actually very rare to have it tested and we (including doctors) tend to assume chromosomes based on physical appearance, HOWEVER about roughly 2% of the time (as far as we know) we can get combinations like XXY, XXX, XYY, and more, and we can have those while still having our primary and sometimes even secondary sex characteristics matching our assigned gender at birth.  This is mostly where we get intersex conditions and some don't even know they're intersex until puberty or even middle age.

- Hormones -- some people have higher estrogen, some have higher testosterone, but we ALL have some of both, and just like with chromosomes and every other aspect of ""biological sex,"" it doesn't always line up with who we think we are, and it also isn't often tested unless something is medically wrong.

All these things combined are what make up ""biological sex,"" yet proponents of the term against trans folks are constantly trying to water it down to just genitals or physical appearance or socialization, because they are trying to limit the definition down to their limited understanding of biology, but that's just not how any of it works.",,,33,0,reddit2

Sex differentiation in humans is almost entirely determined by hormones. We all start out with the exact same parts - the cells that will eventually turn into

1. ovaries, a uterus and a vagina
2. testes and a penis
3. any combination/variation of the first two

are identical in all embryos regardless of their karyotype (what kind of chromosomes they have). 

Embryos with a functioning SRY gene (which is usually found on the Y chromosome, but can occur on X chromosomes as well or may be missing in individuals with a Y) then receive a hormonal signal that triggers the process of turning the previously undetermined tissue into testes. The testes then produce testosterone, which causes the individual to develop into a phenotypical male. 

Embryos without a functioning SRY (or a condition that stops the SRY from working, such as [androgen insensitivity syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome)) develop ovaries instead, which produce estrogen and anti-androgens that produce a phenotypically female individual. 

Since this is non-cell-autonomous process (the cells responding to an external stimulus, in this case exposure to certain hormones), most of your body doesn't care what your karyotype is or what kind of gonads you have beyond which hormonal signals it receives. 

Trans people on HRT, who may or may not have had a gonadectomy (a removal of the ovaries and/or testes), are biologically more ""female"" than ""male"" if they're on estrogen, and more ""male"" than ""female"" if they're on testosterone. 

Those hormones can change a lot about a person's body - just look at a prepubescent child vs. an adult. Bone structure, muscle mass, body hair, voice, breast tissue ... even the size and change of the genitals can change. If the reproductive organs hadn't already developed in the womb, deactivating the genes needed to make the opposite type of gonads in the process, you could theoretically change those, too, the way some other animals do in response to hormonal signals.

Intersex people who are born neither male nor female “genetically” speaking are usually “assigned” male or female at birth by a doctor/their parents and are raised as a boy/girl which often creates a ton of dysphoria, they may even undergo surgeries to shape their bodies to be more in line with a male or female body which can make that dysphoria worse.
This is why we call it assigned as you are assigned a gender at birth as it’s the gender you were raised as.",Veryconflicted543,t2_4w8hahu6,3,0,reddit2

i5jj4bo,t1_i5iybo8,2022-04-20 22:32:59,lgbt,"1. I'm not blaming trans people for the existence of bigots.  I am saying that insisting that women use language that's offensive to them is what causes pushback, exclusion and a lot of hard feelings.  Women have been fighting for a long time to be seen as more than just their vaginas or their ability to give birth.  A lot of infertile women have mental health problems because they feel invalid as a woman because they're not able to get pregnant.  Breast cancer survivors who've had to have mastectomies often feel like they're less because their boobs are gone.  Women have been fighting for a very long time for equal pay, equal opportunities and to be seen as more than just a sex object and mother.  For cis women, for women whose physical body matches their gender identity, calling her ""a person with a vagina"" or ""a person who gives birth"" is another way of reducing her to just those things.  This isn't what trans people are intending to do, but it's thoughtless to not consider the effect that ""inclusive"" language has on the people you're wanting to be included in.  

2. Your penis is yours to talk about.  Feel free, go for it.   You're a woman with a penis, and that's great!  Talk about you however you want to talk about you.   Just don't talk about someone else with terms they're uncomfortable with, and maybe realize that they are uncomfortable with it.",Short-Step-5394,t2_8211q4mm,0,0,reddit2

You're essentially telling people to push the myth that trans people want to police language so hard people can't even acknowledge penises and vaginas exist anymore, effectively vilifying trans people.
