(also the bathroom at that bar almost never has toilet paper and yeah I know when you have a dick you don't really need to wipe after peeing but like...what if someone needs to take a shit uh, what if you just took a shit).",nowhereintexas,t2_1xw88dnd,84,0,reddit3

hucweax,t3_sdc7p6,2022-01-26 22:27:44,lgbt,"While interesting I think there better options than this.

The fundamental problem that people will claim gendered bathrooms address is providing a space ""each gender"" can go to get away from the other. This argument is obviously problematic though because gender is not a simple binary, and it creates unnecessary situations for trans people. Plus everyone has multigender bathrooms in the homes anyways, but the key is they are individual. So to better address the problem you could say that all bathrooms should be individual, except then at scale it costs more to install sinks in each stall. However the alternative then is we end up with one large bathroom with toilet stalls and a multigender sink area, which ive seen ppl have...mixed feelings on. They have one like this at a venue in Toronto, and while i personally found it fine some people definitely found it uncomfortable and awkard. 

So its either a somewhat awkward shared sink area bathroom, or a potential most expense to install individual bathroom setup. Which one makes sense i think ultimately depends on the venue, where smaller restaurants and stores should just have individual all-gender bathrooms (like we do in homes), but for larger venues it may have to be a shared sink area and people will have to learn to behave around other and not be uncomfortable washing their hands or fixing their appearance in the mirror next to people of all genders.",Mastermaze,t2_d2oq9,66,0,reddit3

huf1t3x,t3_sdc7p6,2022-01-27 09:02:13,lgbt,"I kinda feel like this was made by an out of touch person. This is dangerous not only because it separates people based on AGAB and could out trans folks but also because women/feminine presenting individuals will end up sharing a private space with cis het men which I, and many others, simply cannot do.

I live in a large city and I can't even walk down the street without being catcalled or take public transit without being groped. I'm also a CSA survivor and I get extremely anxious if I am alone with men. It is naïve to pretend like a large chunk of the cis het male population don't prey upon women and members of the queer community. Are we expecting them to just respect us now? Keep their hands to themselves? Not get aggressive when they are turned down? Leave trans folks alone?

I am a GNC woman and while I reject the picture of femininity society has painted, I identify as a woman. Some men are ""masculine"", others are ""feminine"", some switch between both—they still choose to identify as men. Some folks feel like they are neither men nor women, some feel like both, some would rather not do gender at all—they identify as non-binary or whichever label fits them best. A lot of my trans friends are VERY binary and proud to be a man/woman, and their gender is a large part of who they are. So the whole ""get rid of gender"" discourse perpetuated by some folks is really a slap in the face to others.

While I do agree with that all babies should be given a neutral gender at birth (which they can keep or change later), I do not think gender erasure on a whole benefits anyone. We should all have a right to choose whatever label suits us, be it within the gender binary or not. It is society that needs to understand that our assigned gender is not set in stone, and that we reject the archaic gender norms forced upon us.

My point is, we should be working towards a future where we all have a choice to be ourselves. I don't like this conversation that keeps popping up in our community where one group doesn't want to do gender and tries to speak for everyone else by advocating for its dismantlement.

Tl;dr: We need as many gender neutral restrooms as female and male restrooms but all bathrooms should not be gender neutral.",thisisforrachel___,t2_99ahrx40,4,0,reddit3

Like, even having a uterus doesn’t mean that you can physically give birth. I normally only see “birthing person” used in the context of actual childbirth — for example, sometimes parental benefits will distinguish between a birthing partner vs one who doesn’t give birth. Or hospitals will refer to the patient who’s actually giving birth vs a support person, or someone who’s in the Labor & Delivery ward for a reason besides childbirth. 

I think the problem with a lot of these terms is that they’re created to talk about something specific but people try to turn them into overarching umbrella terms. And then it gets weird because they aren’t really designed to be synonyms for each other.

EDIT: the one I think is really funny is when TERFs get mad about “pregnant person.” Like, how dare you say that I’m…a person??? Haha.

There are issues that only affect women. There are issues that only affect people who are ap able of giving birth. The vast majority of people who fit into one of those two categories also fit into the other… but there are still people who definitively only belong to one. A trans man who still has a functioning female reproductive system is going to be affected by the GOP trying to outlaw contraceptives, but he’s not likely going to be affected by sexual harassment from male colleagues in the workplace. Because he is not a woman. And having a medical condition that makes it impossible for her to safely carry a child doesn’t magically turn my aunt into a man.

Recognizing that there are places that don’t have the overlap is necessary if we want to address all the people who are being affected. If you’re going to try to fix a societal issue, you have to fix it for everyone. Equating “being able to be pregnant” to “being a woman” strips a lot of women of their womanhood, and forces that womanhood onto people who are emphatically not women.

Womb carrier sounds objectifying. It's less about the person, it's about their organs. Does ""virus carrier"" sound nice to you?

In a childbirth scenario, there exists one person giving birth or expected to that is the focus of the medical care. This is the birthing person.

There are zero or more women in the scenrio, one of whom may be the birthing person. Hopefully healthcare professionals are involved, but none of them are thier becasue thier role is ""woman"" or ""mother""

Similarly there are zero or more men in the scenario, a small fraction of birthing people may be a man. Some of the healthcare professionals involved may be a man.

Some of the people in the scenario may not like the term man or woman and thier role in the scenario will not be to stand there and perform gender role.

The birthing person may have a partner, or gamete donor(s) involved in the scenario. Both in terms of initiating pregnancy and being involved with the birth in some way.

There may be other people in the scenario that are pregnant, that are a mother, parent etc.

As such birthing person is the minimum possible information that can always uniquely identify the person the scenario revolves around, regarless of their gender identity or that of anyone else in the scenario.

For one, it feels as though you are reducing that person to an incubator, and removing the focus on their personhood.

A womb-donor, if you will.

Why avoid calling this person a pregnant person?

If they are pregnant, that is a medical condition independent of the person's gender or expression of gender.

And though they may indeed be pregnant, that doesn't mean they will be doing the birthing.

To me, ""birthing person"" comes across as an artifact of misogynous patriarchy that views uterus owners as nothing more than baby factories.

I can't say I speak for uterus owners, as I haven't one myself, so please correct me if I'm wrong somehow.

The fact that we can birth children, and men’s fear of bringing up children that aren’t theirs, means that our bodies have been policed to the extreme. We were breeding stock owned by our fathers and then a dowry was paid by whatever man wanted to buy us, and then we belonged to our husbands. We had no rights. 

And women still face this extreme obsession and control in places like Afghanistan and Iran. The fact that women have to wear the hijab boils down to this obsession over women’s virginity, purity and a man’s ability to be sure their children are his. Girl children are sold off to much older men for sizeable dowries. Girls aren’t allowed to go to school because their role in society is to marry and be birth-givers.

So to once again reduce us back down to nothing but being vessels for carrying and birthing children, is taking us western women back centuries. Centuries that we have fought to have a voice, a say over our own destinies, bodily autonomy, rights such as the right to vote and have a bank account. 

These rights have only been won in the western world in last hundred years and many women still don’t have them. Our rights are being attacked from so many angles and we are scared.

""Birthing person"" is a word meant to create a dichonomy between the ability to give birth and your gender identity. We all know that some nobinary people and men can give birth while some women can't give birth, right? Using the term ""birthing person"" essentially separates the ability to give birth from ""womanhood"" so nobodies gender identities are invalidated by the inability or ability to give birth. It's also just a good way to categorize people with certain body parts in a hospital setting without invalidating gender identity. As an example, if you say something like ""women give birth,"" you're invalidating the gender identities of both trans men and women because some men give birth, and some women can't give birth.

The keyword here is ""dichonomy."" In short, it's a descriptive term meant to separate someone's gender identity from their ability or inability to give birth.

A big fear is that the term invalidates women to their reproductive functions, but with this understanding, it does quite the opposite. The term ""birthing person"" implies that the ability to have birth is simply a trait and has nothing to do with your gender identity.

To me, this seems like an extremely conservative viewpoint, especially from a ""liberal"".  It's fine for a woman to personally feel that being a mother is the most important part of her own life. In fact, it's in the best interest of the children if all parents feel that parenting is the most important part of their lives. But claiming that women's most prized value is having babies implies that women who can't or choose not to have babies are less valuable.

Although I see where you are coming from, and it is a place of kindness and respect, I wholeheartedly disagree, and it relates to intentions vs outcomes. While it may not be intentionally damaging to use either birthing person or any gender neutral varsity or the flipside of gendered, ""regular"" pregnancy terms, there is harms and consequences that come from both, and we currently do not have a solution that leaves nobody feeling hurt, and possibly never will. If you, or anyone else, has any ideas on words or solutions to this current issue that doesn't involved ""just don't feel that way"", then I would highly encourage you speak up, even if it feels stupid or wrong, as you may be onto something.

Also: if you are using a term, any term, to refer to a specific individual, say, your friend for example, you should always use the term they want to be used for them, which for most female individuals that have the capability to give birth (I am trying to avoid using the term birthing person/people until after I have explained why it is *actually* the least imperfect term that we have right now), is going to be mother or mum, and that is 100% okay! They are entitled to those feelings of motherhood, and I support them in their journey!

Anyways onto the actual reply now lol

I can see that you know how gender dysphoria is a really serious and potentially deadly issue, however I think you don't quite get *how* impactful words like Women, Mother or Mum can be really detrimental to a trans-man, or non-binary individuals mental health.

It seems as if you are essentially asking trans men or non-binary individuals (or anyone else who is capable of giving birth) to not get so offended by words that are quite literally offensive to them, just because some words make others uncomfortable. I can see it's unintentional, but that *is* mildly transphobic (specifically: slightly trans exclusionary).

I am really sorry if this seems harsh, and hear me out a little before getting offended(?) for saying that. I genuinely understand that this is a really serious language problem, and I really do wish there was a way to solve it that didn't make anyone uncomfortable, but you can see the problem when you break each term down to what it actually means (instead of the assumed meaning):

mother/mum: feminine/female gendered terms to refer to a parental figure that identifies as female.

Birthing person/people: a term to refer to *anyone* that have the capability to give birth, regardless of if they are pregnant, or have been previously pregnant (Mother's and other AFAB individuals who have biological children), which is intended to be used for purposes such as menstrual related topics (period products, etc)

Pregnant person/people: a term used to refer to *anyone* that is currently pregnant, which is intended to be used for purposes such as pregnancy related topics (pregnancy effects, pregnancy clothing, etc)

I hope that you can see how, while yes, birthing person and pregnant person may be hurtful or those that do associate with the terms mother and mum, but not personally with birthing/pregnant person/people, but to use the word woman/mother/mum when not referring to a specific person *does* exclude trans men (or other birthing people), by definition of those words (as shown above).

Idk, I just want to not exclude anyone, and when not referring to a specific person, it really is a case of main character syndrome to get upset that a term is being used to include everyone, just cause it may hurt your feelings, or even possibly feel as if you are having your gender invalidated in regards to your pregnancy.

Again, for any specific individual, use what term they want, regardless of what anyone else says. However to refer to a collective group of human individuals that are capable of giving birth, please please please use birthing/pregnant (split for if you are referring specifically to those already pregnant or anyone that could become pregnant) person/people (simply split for singular/plural), as it is inclusive of all, and doesn't *actually* reduce a person who identifies as a woman/mother/mum to less than that, is short sighted. 

And I'm really sorry, but trans people *are* giving cis people compassion, and I apologise if people aren't using some terms accurately, which could (and likely is) often be some, or all, of the problem, which then causes some folk to feel as if they aren't receiving the compassion they deserve, but saying:
>We are after all trying our best to make sure trans people feel good about the speech we use, cis people should also be given compassion.
Is straight up acting as if trans people are either inconsiderate of cis peoples feelings, or that they are intentionally causing that, and actually kinda rubs me as (unintentionally) transphobic. And I don't mean to be mean, I really just wanna try and bring attention to what you said and how it may be interpreted, rather than attack you, so please don't interpret it that way, and I don't know how to say stuff in a way that may not be interpreted as an attack (am autistic, really struggle with bringing attention to imperfections without having people feel attacked 😔), with that said, maybe try reflecting inward a little on that? Not sure honestly, but it isn't *too* bad, just rubbed me the wrong way is all :P

[Side note: 
The linguistics lover in me wishes to explain that you can totally refer to the whole group of birthing people by a singular, if you wish to address them all at an individual level? I'm gonna give examples, with both birthing person/people but also with men/man, to show how you already use plural and individual when talking to or about a group of people. 

Plural: 
Period products are for birthing people (plural)
Barbeques are for men!! (plural) (ew, stereotypes 🤮 (plz no hate, was first example and I already spent 45 minutes writing this as of rn... I need a life... Maybe I should adapt this to a PSA/teaching post?))

Singular:
(Advertisement) if you are a birthing person, you should use <brand> pads! (singular)
(advertisement) be a man! Use <brand> <product>! (singular)

Some are aware this is what is going on but the vast majority aren't.  They're just acting from a purely emotional space.

And you're right reactionaries usually are conservative because well, reactionaries are anti-revolutionary and anti-progress. But liberals and leftists can fall victim to reactionary thinking too, it's just a sort of human emotional reaction to change.

I dunno the ""they're erasing women!"" thing is a pretty common response to the ""birthing/menstruating people"" thing.

I was really surprised by Kasparian because this discourse has been out FOREVER and she just came out with this BS like a couple months ago.

I do disagree that birthing person is dehumanizing and antifeminist. One, it acknowledges that not all who birth are women or mothers. Two, are they not...people? How is that dehumanizing? 

I'm a trans man. I have the capacity to become pregnant and give birth. I never will, but plenty of trans men have. They are not mothers but they are people who birthed. A good friend of mine is a step mother who loves her step child dearly, and she is absolutely that child's mother, despite not having birthed them.

Believing that queer people and women should have rights everywhere? Totally fine and not a problem. Using it as fodder to shit on other countries and POC and call them backwards or savage or uncivilized or whatever, reinforcing racist and colonialist ideas of the rest of the world / other races as less than? Not okay. 

And there are people who do this. Who excuse their racism or xenophobia saying they just hate that race/country because they don't respect women or queer people (I believe this is sometimes called ""pinkwashing""), not because they're racist/xenophobic, but they are. Or saying that we should use force or intervention to make them change their ways, which can be a colonialist mindset that we should like take over and ""civilize"" the poor ignorant [insert group here] for their own good. (also super ironic considering that western invaders imposed beliefs and homophobia and sexism on places they invaded multiple times over). 

I think an important question to asks ones self when evaluating the context/intent is something along the lines of: _""is the focus on caring about and supporting and uplifting the voices of women and queer people in countries where their rights are being restricted, or is the focus on shitting on the country or ethnic group as evil, backwards, or uncivilized or claiming that the western world is more civilized?""_ If it's the former, that's good and what you should be doing. But if it's the latter, that that'd start to sound a lot more like trying to find a progressive sounding reason to be racist/xenophobic than actual support of the people being marginalized. 

There is literally nothing wrong with believing everyone should have equal rights everywhere.

Further wether they are repessed or not inside the occupied terroties a genocide againdt palestians is a genocide against every single LGBTQ+ paelstinan.

Giving your friend the benefit of the doubt, Homonationalism and American Sexual Exceptionalism are things you need to be aware of when discussing global queer liberation.

There is a long and well documented history of the United States and Americans in general using the persecution of queer people as an excuse for intervention without actually caring about the liberation of queer people.

One of the ways the War in Afghanistan was justified is that the Taliban persecutes Women so the United States must invade to ensure Women’s rights.

This kind of rhetoric frames other nations as being exceptionally homophobic, and exceptionally patriarchal; and their inhabitants as incapable of challenging patriarchy and homophobia and needing colonialism to save them.

I have seen this most explicitly when a white woman on Reddit seriously argued that if every single Muslim women on the planet disagreed with her that veiling was inherently oppressive than that was only every single Muslim woman on the planet was simply brainwashed by the patriarchy. 

Something she said in defense of France enacting legislation that stripped Muslim women of their choice over whether or not to veil by making certain veiling practices illegal. Because clearly the only way to combat women being coerced into veiling isn’t to empower women to make that choice of their own free volition it’s to strip Muslim women of any choice in the matter by simply making it illegal for them to wear veiling garments.

What’s more this outwardly “feminist” stance is usually empty at best. When the United States pulled out of Afghanistan we left Afghan women to twist in the wind with not way to ensure that the Taliban would not roll back women’s rights. Because our government never cared about those women and defending their rights. It was all just a pretext for intervention for political and economic interests.

i think i understand the sentiment though, when europe was colonising the middle east (and probably other parts of the world but i wrote my diss on the middle east), some authors have observed that europe was pushing itself as superior at everything such as science, philosophy, art, governance. so these countries, who iirc were and are primarily muslim, claimed pride in their culture by claiming the one thing europe didn’t: morality. this is where we see the importance of religion and conservatism; it was the only power these people had over the colonists. 

it’s worth noting though that systems of government do not represent the people living in that country. egypt, for example, is very pro democracy and genuinely hasn’t democratised because america prevented it (mostly on account of the government is good with america but the people mostly arent, officials feared that a democratic egypt would result in anti-american regimes). i’ve also seen mention of lgbt+ and feminist communities, although i can’t speak on those because it wasn’t my area of study.

jk9boo1,t3_13i5bqm,2023-05-15 17:27:37,lgbt,"Because all of these comments have been written in the slightly patronizing tone of western liberalism, I think a HUGELY important narrative is missing from the conversation here. 

There are two issues at play. One has been outlined to us by OP: is it colonialist to advocate for LGBT people in a “homophobic” country in the global south? Arguably, and nearly unanimously in these comments, the answer is: obviously not.

There is a second, interrelated, and highly important question also at play here: do western countries use narratives of progress on LGBT rights to paint themselves as more “modern” and righteous against the backdrop of a supposedly backwards global south? Does that narrative get deployed in harmfully colonialist ways, while the western world unleashes utterly barbaric violence on to the same people it claims are backwards? 

The answer to those questions, in my opinion, is absolutely YES. And failing to address this does a huge disservice both to ourselves in the western world who wish to address this dynamic and to LGBT people struggling against heteronormativity in the global south. 

I recommend you do some reading outside of Reddit on this question.

I have come to learn that when a group of people is being opressed, the only right thing to do is to opose it in however way we can. I don't believe armed intervention is the answer (because it only makes it worse for the opressed people), but we definitely have to speak up, support and promote people's freedoms and human rights.

I’m taking a class on critical race theory and gender in antiquity, and the reason so many non-western countries are what we call “anti-queer” or “anti-woman” is BECAUSE of colonialism. So many of these cultures had rights for women and queer people (not all obviously but some did), and it was actually the missionary Christians that colonized them that brought religion and a hatred for anything “other”. That is a typical “divide and conquer” colonialism tool that allows a society to establish supremacy and break down the social order of the society they are colonizing. There is evidence of queerness in antiquity all over the place. For example, the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of sexuality and as a man, you could have sex with anybody. Homosexual sex was actually encouraged at some point in time in Sparta in the military because it created stronger bonds between soldiers (look up pederasty if you want to know more). The Hippocratic texts on the Scythians show evidence of non binary and trans people being accepted into society as they wanted to be and actually celebrated as divine and blessed by the gods. The Persians show evidence of women in power, however this is less obvious and it’s based off of a few assumptions about gendered names. 

A good example of how colonialism can lead to the issues westerners see in non-western countries is Poland’s relationship with Catholicism. I’m using this example since I’m very familiar with polish culture, so sorry that this doesn’t tie into the racial aspect of this discussion. Poland has been historically oppressed and colonized by many groups, including Russians, Germans, and Teutonic knights. There were times when the Polish language was banned, and the only time people were allowed to speak Polish was during Catholic Church. Polish language and culture survived due to Catholicism, which partly explains why the country is so Catholic today. It was actually such a big deal that the puppet government convinced the Soviet Union that they could not ban religion in Poland because there would be a revolt. Poland is known to be very homophobic (legally, socially depends on where you are and who you talk to), and it used to be extremely tolerant of other religions and groups. There’s a reason there were so many Jews living in Poland before WW2. 

Anyone who says that criticizing the homophobic or sexist laws in other countries is colonialism clearly doesn’t know much about colonialism or the history of queerness.",graceful_ant_falcon,t2_4rrip74g,1,0,reddit3

Colonization is responsible for MANY of the anti-queer attitudes around the world. Most places were actually relatively chill with us till the Europeans came in and forced their ""Christian morals"" on the inhabitants. When you think of how long colonization was ongoing and how recently many places gained independence, it makes a ton of sense that they're still recovering from it socially. We can advocate for change, but should do so strictly through supporting and uplifting the activists who are members of a given society, not by white knighting.

Women's right are one place where westerners need a lot of perspective. Most women's rights arguments around Muslim or former Muslim countries are actually just veiled Islamophobia mixed with benevolent sexism. There's an assumption that Muslim women can't advocate for themselves and therefore need to be saved. This, of course, is bullshit. Of course, folks in places with fundamentalist rulers will have a harder time, and are more likely to be denied education etc, but this becomes such a sticking point for us westerners that we sometimes forget how much sexism we have in our own society.

the history of colonialism’s influence on social justice around the world, though, is complicated. pre-colonization, a lot of cultures actually had no problems with gay or trans people. and though a lot of cultures were somewhat patriarchal and misogynistic, plenty of them had more egalitarian or less restrictive roles for women.

colonizers brought their ideas of homophobia, heteronormativity, and their specific gender roles to colonized countries. and sometimes, it wasn’t necessarily “forced” by the colonizers, but rather came from a place of seeing western culture as more “advanced/civilized” and therefore emulating these values. 

anyway, these values then took root and stayed even after the colonizers left. after a few generations, people in the previously colonized countries internalize these teachings and think of them as their own country’s culture rather than a colonial teaching.

now that western countries start to become more accepting of queer people and fight for womens rights, these accepting ideas appear foreign and western to the colonized countries. their continued resentment towards colonizers and/or their wish for self-determination of their national identity, make them want to separate themselves from values that are perceived as western. hence, declaring lgbtq acceptance and equal rights as “western” and “un-[insert national identity]”.

so, yes, homophobia and misogyny in some non-western countries are western colonizers’ doing, and this weird complicated relationship that non-western countries have with queerness is probably what prompted your friends to say that.",rxniaesna,t2_7epuzcp8,1,0,reddit3

My thoughts about how they are treated by Law:
Many countries, Western and non-Western have anti LGBTQ+ and womens rights laws. The West is not immune to these laws either, but that does not make them any more right or just.

Suppose your friend is from another country, they may be frustrated about the West’s prominence in politics, and general hoarding of power on the international stage. Many countries voices have been ignored within international organizations such as the UN, and there are critics of some of the political bodies that codified some of these ideas and values through international law. 

The Universal Declaration Human Rights (1948) declared in Article 3, “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.“ and in Article 7, “All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.” 

This is an international legal basis of the beliefs that LGBTQ+ and women are also included and should not be discriminated against for any cultural, religious, “moral”, or other reasons. 

Despite believing these two articles are good and true regardless of Western ideas, there is some valid arguments with the organization that created it’s inclusion of all countries in the creation of these “universal” rights. I think Shaheed and Richter say it well, 

“The claims of non-universality also fall flat when looking back at historical support for human rights. Fifty-eight countries assembled in 1948 to affirm their “faith in the dignity and worth of all persons” in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, wherein a framework for preserving that dignity and fostering respect for its worth was offered. Among these states were, African, Asian, and Latin American countries. Thirty-seven states were associated with Judeo-Christian traditions; 11 Islamic; six Marxist; and four identified as being associated with Buddhist-Confucian traditions.”
and you can read his paper [here](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2018/10/are-human-rights-a-western-concept/).

The UN also arguably has some colonial origins and bias.

As for your friends comments on how LGBTQ+ people and women are in foreign media:

Sometimes I do think it is unrealistic to expect certain media to have diverse casts. In some countries homosexuality is still punishable by death. It may not be safe for the creators to produce inclusive media, or it may be a matter as profit as well. While some companies are just trying to appeal to the widest audience to make an extra buck, there may also be some legitimate media that a creator may be relying on as their sole income or profit that they can’t spare backlash in their country where such topics are maybe not legal nor condoned by the public. But this can be a case by case thing, and honestly just expressing a wish for there to be more inclusivity in a media you enjoy, no matter the origin, is not “arrogant”. 

God forbid we want to feel represented and try to enjoy non-Western media. As a Westerner, all influences we have on foreign media are “Westernization” which does have colonial connotations- but it’s not like we chose to be born in the West? I would feel the same no matter where I lived, though I may have expressed my feelings in my every day life more or less depending on the legality and safety. 

I understand anti-Western sentiments, given the amount of whitewashing and colonialism that has happened historically and persists. But why bother people with their hearts in the right place? You’re not the President, what can you do about these things? Your friends arguments make no sense when considering that they’re just talking to. If hoping for peace and safety for everyone regardless of gender and sexuality is arrogant then I suppose I wish everyone had a huge ego.

in south asia, people use the ""its not part of our culture"" argument way too frequently when it comes to being anti providing equal rights and freedom to women and lgbtq+ folks just because the ""culture"" they are talking about was highly influenced by the laws made by colonizers \[ mainly british \] during their colonial rule and put into place for several **centuries**, not just decades. 

for example, in huge parts of pre-colonial south asia and africa, lgbtq+ folks were not only out, they were very well accepted and integrated in parts of society. there were places and times where they were out-casted, but overall, things were much better for lgbtq+ folks pre - colonization.

the british colonizers brought their mindset and religious beliefs to these countries and illegalized lgbtq+ \[ see section 377 of the indian penal code that was brought into works by the pathetic british colonizers in 1861 and took >150 years to be overturned in 2018 \]

so no, idk who it is you are talking to, it is NOT colonialist to be pro woman and pro LGBTQ rights all over the world. wanting equal rights for people across the globe from you shows you are very empathetic being. 

However, i have to say as i have seen so many white folks from the western sphere of the world look down on the conditions of woman and lgbtq communities in south asia+ africa - remember it was western countries and their colonization that is the reason for majority of the problems that are existing in these countries. if india has 99 problems, 98 of them are thanks to british colonizers.

so while it is not colonialist of you to advocate/want/be vocal about equal rights for woman and lgbtq+ folks all over the world, it will seem very colonialist of you to look down upon those countries that were colonized and are struggling on these topics without acknowledging the reason why they are so.

so you *can* want equal rights for lgtbq+ folks and women in countries that were previous colonies, but you cannot act like you or your country are superior than those countries just cuz your country has pro-women and pro-lgbtq+ constitution and believe that countries that have anti-lgbtq+ mindset have *always* been this backwards.

The ""whites"" became so when the european americans realized lowerclass whites who worked as indentured sevants were beginning to have solidarity with the enslaved peeps they worked with. The upperclass got scared and decided a new change of higherarchy was needed. So sprang forth the clasification of races and a surge in eugenics as well. The original classifications were not even fully baised on color even but convienance. To this day certain classifications swing back and forth for convienance on the american census.

The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem The White Man's Burden (1899) by Rudyard Kipling. The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures.

If you take, for instance, Iran's revolution and leadership seriously, then you see that they embrace the premises that 1) secular western thought is a corrupting influence which diverts the proper course of Islamic thought and 2) a strong religious government with the interests of Iran's people at heart must protect their people from that perverse influence. For better or worse this is the government which Iran's people chose, in explicit defiance of western backed leaders. 

If those founding members were right, then the violent and, from our perspective, oppressive enforcement of Iranian and Islamic cultural norms as perceived by the Ayatollah is the essence of the government mandate. To protect gay individuals or kickass punk rock girls from their government would require the foundational assumption that the government is not working in their best interests. This is an assumption which most likely stems from the Enlightenment concept of absolute individual rights and limited government powers. Similarly, it is an assumption which can only be maintained if you reject the assertion that the preservation of cultural norms as defined by a theocratic elite is an illegitimate government purpose. 

This isn't really just hypothetical either, the form of government used in Iran is not new. This sort of theocratic state has a long history in Muslim political thought, often with great success. It also mirrors Christian institutions, like the papacy, which played a similar role in an extra-national capacity.

For instance, I'm from Mexico, and here when I was a kid (15 years ago) homophobia was the biggest and most accepted view on sexuality, you could say that homophobia was ""Mexican culture"". Now, however most people (or at least most people in the big cities) have been convinced to be respectfull and tolerant to lgbtq+ people. It was activism (with the help of foreign influence) that convinced people in our society to expand their worldview and we're a better country for it. 

4.- I have no problem with morality, but with moralism: particularly in the case of Iran, the government is imposing a certain lifestyle and belief sistem on people and I do believe that is inherently wrong. It is not the same to expect tolerance than to expect someone to believe and behave as you do (the equivalent would be lgbtq+ people expecting everyone to be lgbtq and I would also oppose that). Moralism is about control, not about principle: look at how the Iranian oligarchy behaves when outside the county and you'll quickly find that out

5.- This anti western, strong, centralized government also signed the declaration of human rights and stands by that signature, so even by their own standards, they're behaving against international law (freedom of religion, non discrimination, etc.)

6.- If a country does not have a democracy, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, the only way to have your voice heard is through this means, so I thing it's more valid to support civil resistance in theese places than to do it in democracies with actual representation

7.- As a citizen of a country that has been victim to foreign intervention and invasion I do believe in the non intervention principle, but there are some things like financial support, activism and propaganda that should be allowed. However I am a pacifist and wholely believe that war (except as a defense to invasion) is never the solution

8.- I did use the Iranian example, but I do believe when christians, or any other group do it it's just as wrong.",Safantifi_nani,t2_eovmmn9s,2,0,reddit3

What do you think makes abuse distinct from an issue like individualism vs collectivism and can't the answer to large questions like that sometimes necessitate abuse, even unforeseeabley, in the future?  

For a concrete example, if I assume that fascist speech is inherently a destructive blight on democratic governance and that any engagement in it is a threat to the democratic endeavor (the Dan Harmon argument lol) then I might be justified in abusively curtailing speech promoting Nazism, either through violence or incarceration. If it would be wrong for a country to meaningfully oppose my answer to the larger question, how can it be right for them to oppose a truly necessary act in furtherance of the answer? 

What acts would be justified if not invasion? I don't really see much tangible value in social media cheerleading, if that's what you mean by support. But something like economic assistance or even direct participation seem obvious possibilities. How would you administer that type of support without risking the possibility that you're providing outsized power to an illegitimate minority, effectively short-circuiting internal politics through resource superiority?

And just cause I know it's annoying to have these kind of conversations with totally anonymous folks: I'm Abby a law student who formerly studied political science in grad and undergrad. I find this an interesting issue because at home, I am a strong supporter of democratic and social rights for every intrinsic minority. But I've also seen a history littered with devastation wrought when folks from my country or our predecessors start fiddling in another government or culture without any respect for the people they're working with. I don't know how to square the two, but have thus far just placed my faith in the long run democratic capacity of the people in those nations or cultures, with knowledge that harm occurs in the short term .",HonestlyAbby,t2_v6lnk4d,1,0,reddit3

Individualism and collectivitism are differing philosophies that both have their strengths and weaknesses, but neither necessitates abuse at its core. Where people are being harmed, that’s where “tolerance” becomes complicity, and silence becomes a way of condoning the mistreatment of people who have been deemed undesirable. 

As for your example, you are right that society likes to find caveats to behaviour that is otherwise agreed-upon to be abusive. Violence is understandable, so long as it is directed towards a Nazi, etc. I think that highlights more how we should consider/approach domestic issues rather than our need to turn a blind eye to international ones. My personal viewpoint is radical in that I don’t see violence or incarceration as an answer to these issues, and I disagree with their normalization in our society. 

As for justified acts, sanctions might be the most obvious way. I also think, in considering foreign intervention, it’s important to focus resources on the people being impacted from within that country, and offering aid and asylum to those whose lives are threatened. I agree there is a limit to how much can be done without resorting to unethical means, but I think the main goal should be to support oppressed minorities while minimizing their suffering.",masterofyourhouse,t2_6ghwqvn,1,0,reddit3

Everyone in his country, the Republic of Pedophiles, rapes children. They believe that their god, the King Rapist (name Beffrey Bepstein), not only _allows_ them to morally rape children, but outright _demands_ that they do. By your logic, it would be wrong for anyone outside of this culture and religion to condemn this practice. Am I the bad guy if I work to lock Alex up, and to encourage the other nations of the world to act to stop what’s going on in the republic of pedophiles? Your right to practice your own culture and religion stops at exactly the point where another human’s rights begin, which includes the right to partake or not partake in your culture



To be perfectly clear, I’m not making any sort of allegory to any particular group, religion, or culture, I merely choose a crime that is almost universally looked at as evil. I’m Catholic myself, and I’ll gladly send any priest or clergy member who I know is raping kids to be judged by the Creator. Bad things happen in every group. 



It doesn’t make it wrong for someone outside that group to condemn those individual evil actions. It also doesn’t make it wrong to protest a common practice among a culture as evil if they are hurting others. It _would_ be wrong to say that a woman choosing to wear a hijab, for instance, is evil - no one is being hurt in this scenario, and everyone involved gets to make their own life choices. It _wouldn’t_ be wrong to say that a woman being forced to wear a hijab under the threat of death is evil.

The thrust of my questions was to encourage application, not just a retreat to the rule.

Barry), and transgender (see Dionysus myth, ancient Sumerian priests, and that one Roman emperor with the really difficult to remember name who literally asked to be referred to as a Lady and wanted sexual reassignment surgery). These records date back as far as 4,500 years ago.

Eventually we won’t need the term LGBT because our rights will be so entirely engrained into the fabric of society. But it will take time to get there, so for now just be good to your fellow humans.",,,22,0,reddit4

After all, that's how some spaces for queer folk are; exclusionary of cishet folks to allow a more comfortable space for queer people to just exist.

However, that's not really the case when it comes to bi people, esp bi women. Even looking at queer history (granted, I only really know queer history in the US), lesbian wasn't a term that meant what we ascribe to it now. It was a lot more vague and meant non-men attracted to non-men, whether they be attracted to men as well or not. 

Also, why are we fighting each other when we should be banding against the common enemy of a heteropatriarchal society? Infighting just helps The Man get what they want, including keeping us all under their thumb.

Basically, the issue isn’t with lesbians and gays wanting a safe space. The issue is with lesbians and gays who feel the need to state that bisexual individuals are not welcome in that space and ESPECIALLY when they are not targeting other microdemographics. 

For bisexuals, a common experience with gays/lesbians is erasure from our community and a near constant questioning of our identity. When we try to create our own spaces, they’re often invaded with straights, gays, and lesbians who want to complain that we’re excluding them whilst simultaneously questioning our identity. 

It’s just exclusionary and discriminatory and this is more so what I am referring to and not specifically the need for a space as a whole. I wouldn’t state no lesbians/gays if my group was titled “bisexuals only” because the title is self-explanatory

gwcwd9v,t1_gwcpv8d,2021-04-29 23:03:13,lgbt,"I feel the same, thanks a lot for this exchange <3

Essentially what makes it more difficult to me to date bi cis girls is that they tend to find masculine features attractive.
That in itself wouldnt be a problem, but there is the insecurity of them probably liking certain features of me because they I resemble a male ones. My mind would alway spin around if they are attracted to features I desperately try to get rid of or would even love me if they were into women only. Those things don't have to be remotely true but the doubt and self hatred towards those parts of me would fire eachother up and really take a toll on my mental health.

It is also hard for me to think about cishets positively due to my childhood and being a lesbian trans girl.
Having a partner who is sexually attracted to them might be hard to deal with. If cishets are something to my partner I fall short at and I even despise to some extend it is bound to make me unhappy.

Of course those are the worse case scenarios and a healthy relationship with a bi girl is totally imaginable for me. This is just why I am uneasy about dating them, because this usually is no problem in lesbians since I can be sure they are attracted to me for being who I am and not who I was or resemble, you know?",Lynn355,t2_79jufeng,2,0,reddit4

Furthermore, I think it's possible to compartmentalise a creative work from it's creator, especially one that been out as long and been as adapted and augmented as much as HP.

Orson Scott Card wrote Ender's Game. He's also a despicable homophobe. HP Lovecraft pioneered a new genre of horror that has major influences onto today. He was an open racist. I think it's healthier to take a work's themes on face value outside of the author's personal life and views.

I haven't spent any money on the new game yet because I refuse to spend money on a product that doesn't exist yet, but if it's technically sound, feature complete and well written, I intend to buy it.

It looks like it might be similar to Skyrim where you can make your own way through the game's issues.  I can see a world where you get to choose a faction, similar to the Stormcloaks vs Empire, and you process the baggage of either side as you go. That with the absence of a tracked morality system probably means you'll probably have to make choices and deal with the ramifications of those choices.

Many years ago when Eminem was just starting out I really didn't see what the hype was about and didn't care to find out.

Then he brought out the record ""Just lose it"", mass banned in many places, news articles about how it was so controversial etc etc etc.

Then I got curious, mmm, wonder what part of the video or the lyrics made it get banned?

So as someone that had no desire to ever listen to his music, I was then out searching the net for the video that got banned, so then I watched it and thought mmm nothing in it that was actually controversial, but after that I started to like some of his music.

The same thing with Madonna, I hated all her music to start with, but moment she had stuff that got banned, then I was curious to know why, now I like some of her stuff.

Then it hit me, was the perfect tactic, do something to get banned so it draws in those who normally would never give it the time of day.

JKR & Co. are very similar, would they actually be so popular if not for all the media coverage they get due to their controversial comments and things? If everyone just said blehh it's just some moron trying to get attention again then ignored them, would the media then give them the same kind of attention? I seriously doubt it because they can't make money from the hate.

I think as a community if we all collectively just turned our backs on those who hate us and don't even engage with them, make them totally un news worthy it would make the media look at different ways to make money, as it's our reactions that they want to then exploit to the max.

Plus it's much easier to destroy an enemy when they are there in plain sight.

As Rowling is perpetuating transphobia using her considerable wealth, due in part to her popularity as the author of Harry Potter. She uses her success in these endeavours to claim moral righteousness in her trans hatred. 

So, I kinda say we **do** need to point out how  distasteful the game is... on multiple levels... to shine a light on how much soft power she wields.   


Hell, she hides behind the success of Harry Potter to silence her critics, and unaware fans hop on board because they reflexively trust her due to her writing childhood memories for them. 

I see this as exactly the same as Orson Scott Card and Ender's game. You can't claim death of an author and enjoy a piece of work if the author is using that success to stigmitizse and discriminate a vulnerable group of people.

Pop singer Jessie J who is a lesbian was told by her record label to say she's bisexual as that's more fashionable and marketable then coming out right as a lesbian.

Lesbians get ""correction raped"" in countries like Brazil and it's often considered hot for two women to make out with each other in most western countries, yet two men making out offends a lot of people.

Transgender people have always had it worse. I've had co-workers in the NHS tell me they think trans people are all mentally ill and defend JK Rowling or talk about wanting to punch a woman if she has a dick. Homophobia is less of an issue, but it's still prevalent in daily life. The kids in the school I live next to still use homophobic slurs like it's the 90s. I still get some homophobic insults thrown my way from random oiks even though I'm by myself and not bothering anyone or doing anything romantic or sexual.

That doesn’t mean they aren’t out there, and it doesn’t mean they can’t grow while you’re ignoring them.  We’ve seen how white supremacists and fascism have had a resurgence and become increasingly normalized in the last 5-8 years, and that all started with primarily online and fringe extremist groups.  More pertinently, we’ve seen the degradation of public opinion in the UK on trans issues as TERF rhetoric has found a foothold there as a mainstream part of the “conversation,” to the point that the BBC is actively promoting it.  

Don’t think that can’t happen where you live just because your local community is cool.

Just because you can find a safe space from it, or it is still a fringe movement in some areas, doesn’t mean it’s always going to stay that way.

Because I’m watching TERFs gain a kind of mainstream relevancy in UK politics that I’ve never seen before in the ten years I’ve been out, and there’s a general rising tide of authoritarianism and hatred across the globe.  To think it can’t happen here because some actress won an award, and there’s no way enough people in our community are that hateful, is the same sort of hubris I felt on November 3rd 2016.

All it takes for the 10% you suggest are trans exclusionary to get their way is 5 others shrugging their shoulders and saying “I’m not transphobic BUT….” or “well there are points to be made on both sides” or some other enabling BS.  Which, trust me, is pretty fucking possible.

I’ve literally spent the last 5 years watching the Overton window shift in general politics farther right and authoritarian than I ever thought possible, while the insane conspiracy bullshit that used to get laughed off as a handful of crazies became mainstream.

They still face the same problems as cis women once they medically transition and even before that they have problems as women. They would not have problems if they identified as a gender other than the one assigned at birth meaning being a women does cause them problems. Just in a different way than a cis.

Edit I realised I ommited cis in one sentence which made something I said come across wrong.

Edit 2: Also to clarify I am speaking generally. There are trans women who have a pretty similar life to cis women apart from trans things cis women don't go through.

I am in no way trying to invalidate trans women who do feel they have a very similar experience to cis women.

If I say I’m rolled up in the fetal position and can’t go to work, understand that I’m not exaggerating. If I say I’m gushing through two tampons and a pad every hour understand that I’m not exaggerating. But people with uteruses experience a range of cramps and even some afab people never have to experience bad period cramps. But that may be why some cis women feel offended. Periods can be absolutely horrific and you aren’t capable of experiencing that horror unless you have endometrial tissue in your uterus or elsewhere. But women do have periods without experiencing that horror and instead kind of get hormone-driven bloating, constipation, and mood swings and those are still considered a period and since many trans women have those same hormones that definitely can mean that trans woman experience those symptoms. 

But because of the afore-mentioned fetal position situation I take medication so that I don’t get my period. So some women don’t get periods, some men do get periods and non-binary people may or may not get a period. A period isn’t a culture that can be taken away. It’s already not gender-specific.

I have no uterus and no ovaries and have no cycle and no more PMDD (an extreme form of PMS). PMDD and PMS are caused by cycling hormones, during a menstrual cycle your estrogen, progesterone and testosterone go up and down depending on whether you're in follicular, ovulating, in luteal, or menstruating. That variation is what causes PMS and PMDD symptoms. Your brain sends a signal to your ovaries to ovulate which causes a menstrual cycle in the first place. So if you don't have ovaries, how can you have a cycle or period? I've never once heard any ciswoman who is in surgical menopause like myself say they still have a cycle.

I have never heard of any person in surgical menopause having a cycle or period. It's impossible. I'm on estrogen, progesterone and testosterone and my hormones don't ""naturally cycle"" in my body - if they did I would still have PMDD. But I don't. Because HRT delivers a steady dose of hormones and our bodies don't have a magical mechanism to modify the amount of hormones once they're in our system. Plus, to have a period you need ovaries and a uterus, it's a complex system that involves more than estrogen (example: your brain needs to send a specific hormonal signal to your ovaries that isn't estrogen to kick start the ovulation process which leads to menstruation, without ovulation you can't have a period and without ovaries you can't ovulate no matter how much estrogen is pumped into you system). 

As a woman  who no longer has ovaries or a uterus and who is on HRT I need someone to explain how someone can have a period and PMS in this situation.

Before we put it under transphobia, let's see what actually every person is pissed about. Does it give them (everyone) right to be pissed - yes, does it give them right to be aggressive and hurtful towars others - no, are we all jumping fast to conclusions - definitely yes! For OP: I'm very glad you have light periods, for most times I have them light too, but that's not always like that and I clearly remember myself half naked lying on the toilet's floor at work, because I couldn't stand the feeling of fabric touching my skin and I needed cold and had sever pain in my abdomen and all around it, and then being curled up in fetus position in the back of a taxi wanting to get home faster. It's not really about PMSing, you know, even PMS is optional and same mood swings can be present only because of hormonal stuff and without menstruation itself.

iip4671,t1_iinbpy9,2022-08-02 21:19:32,lgbt,">Our ovaries are what causes our hormones to fluctuate.

Your ovaries are just the main producer of estrogen, your brain (hypothalamus &c) regulate your hormone levels. There are other hormones from estrogen and progesterone that play a role in PMS / PMDD.

>I take estrogen, progesterone and testosterone

Very few if any trans women take testosterone. Many health providers even strive to have undetectable levels in their trans feminine patients, Perhaps this plays a role. Given that your care team is treating you specifically to avoid PMDD symptoms perhaps they are keeping you below some lower threshold value of all hormones. Also given the term 'surgical menopause' I would assume your hormone levels are kept inline with someone who has entered menopause. That's not where trans feminine people have their hormone levels. But I don't know your levels. Maybe they're as high as they were before your surgery. We just need to be careful when discussing HRT and doses.  Even just saying ""I take the same drugs"" doesn't mean much when different doses affect people differently. One needs to compare the concentrations in your blood, not the pill doses.

The article I linked to has a number of studies into PMS / PMDD and hormone values and causes so that's probably your best bet for a rigorous explanation.

All I know is too many trans femmes have reported physical symptoms that occur in a regular cycle and would be called PMS in a cis woman. Maybe it's all a placebo affect but the symptoms are very real for those that experience them.",ElementalFemme,t2_ivmzmv6p,1,0,reddit3

PMS is caused by rising estrogen and progesterone levels in luteal phase though, so while some of the symptoms may be the similar its not quite the same thing. I have to change my estrogen patches every 3 days exactly, if I wait any longer my estrogen levels decrease and I feel bad. But it's not PMS, it doesn't feel like PMS at all. PMS is very specific and involves several different symptoms. And it isn't caused by low estrogen, it happens when estrogen levels rise as you get closer to menstruation.

It seems like the simple solution is to get trans women on stable HRT just like cis women are after they have their ovaries removed. I've never once heard of a doctor prescribing cyclical estrogen to cis women in surgical menopause. It doesn't make sense that both groups of women are being treated totally different.

I didn’t/don’t have endo, and everyone I know with endo had ovaries taken too to prevent continued pain since it’s nearly impossible to get it all with the uterus. The ones that kept ovaries, even one, or who went with HRT following total hysterectomy and oophrectomy continued to have pain. 

I will say that GI symptoms (for me) flare up around my period- cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and did the same with uterus in place, so there’s definitely some hormonal aspect of GI function, that could in all probability impact any woman with or without uterus/ovaries. 

Whether it comes from an ovary or the pharmacy, hormones are hormones. As a clinician I could totally see GI cramping, or other non-uterine/ovarian effects being very uncomfortable or disruptive to trans women

Edit: GI cramping is different feeling to me than Uterine cramps, just like I know if it’s GI or ovarian… but if someone hasn’t experienced one, they may not realize the difference.

I think it makes sense for there to be some kind of distinction because ultimately we're talking about two very different things. Having a uterus and ovaries and menstruating every month means you're at risk of certain things and may require different treatment and accommodations. It's really, really hard to get taken seriously when you have disabling period pain. And we're also dealing with blood. It's not just pain and mood and bowel issues, it's also leaking bodily fluids. I guess I just don't quite agree with equating a menstrual cycle to artificially cycling hormones to create negative physical/emotional changes and using the same word to describe both processes.

It's not a competition.

Like I said in my previous post your dose is less important than what hormone levels are actually in your blood. The same dose can have wildly different impacts due to the way everyone's body absorbs it slightly differently. If you'd like to link to some resources about surgical menopause that would be handy. It would be interesting to see how the approaches to HRT differ.

> ...they will experience physical and psychological side effects.

Trans people aren't 'tampering' with their hormones. They're quite consciously and precisely changing them. Generally under medical guidance. You talk about physical side effects yet one of these physical side effects can't be PMS. Why do you dismiss the experiences of others so quickly?

That being said, I'd like to encourage to take a look at drag.   


The drag queens typically have copious amounts of makeup, big hair, big breasts, high heels, and often speak in what borders on the ditzy dumb personality. They also say words like ""bitch"" and ""slut"" frequently, words that are most commonly used to degrade women.   


It sometimes feels that straight men are better than gay men at being respectful to women, only because they are attracted to them.

I'm a cis queer woman and I've always had a complicated relationship to drag performers that express a certain type of extremely over sexualised and stereotypical form of femininity. I totally understand that drag is subversion, that it can be empowering and could help to break down stigma. But I also don't think we talk enough about where it actually reinforces negative stereotypes, or how drag queens who present as female dominate most drag spaces, and whether that has a positive impact. 

I don't present as particularly feminine, and have struggled a lot with that and the reactions from others throughout my life.

I grew up vacationing right near Provincetown Mass from the time I was a little kid.

At some point I think I heard this story in P-town.

At some point I found out that the ratio of drag to transgender was 1 out of 3-4.

It was a time when it was verboten.

And these people would want to go out dressed as their true selves, but were scared.  So their cis friends would get dressed up and go with them.  

A big part of the drag community was done in support of the transgender community.  

But I agree with you.  It seems like the two groups have become misaligned.  And modern drag queens are just attention seekers.  

I also understand that there is a big difference between wanting to be a drag queen and being transgender.

One is about finding the true you.   The other is just an outfit and some make up.

When a drag queen is being referred to as she/ her, people are referring to the character in the costume, not the person underneath it. If a queen happens to use those pronouns in their daily life, that's one thing, but when they take off the wig and the makeup and it's just Dave from Sheboygan again, it's he/him again.

I can certainly understand it being frustrating that a character receives more respect in the pronoun world than the authentic self of a person.

I had a friend that transitioned almost 20 years ago, and the only way she could get a therapist to sign off on her ""real life test"" letter saying she was approved for surgery was to convince the therapist she was 100% a total stereotypical girly-girl without a single masculine hobby or activity in her life who spent all her free time cooking and gardening, going clothes shopping and getting her hair and nails done, and had completely given up hobbies like D&D and martial arts.  

Once she had the letter and all the sign-offs she needed to finish her transition, she went back to playing D&D, stopped going to the nail salon and hair salon each week, stopped constantly going shopping for clothes and all the other things the therapist wanted to see as proof she really was living as a woman.

Drag has been helpful with Pride and the push for Progressive acceptance of LGBTQ.

Saying you should call someone who've put in loads of work to, for the evening, present as a hyper-feminine persona ""he"" just because you can obviously tell that it's an act is sort of missing the point. Especially if they just gave their name as *Miss* Whatever. They know that you know that it's a persona.  

Much like if you're talking to the muppet Miss Piggy you wouldn't call them ""he"" because you know they're played by a man. Nor would you call her ""it"" since you can tell it's really just an inanimate object. With Miss Piggy as with drag queens, it's about buying into the act that's presented. Do note that this isn't true for trans women; that's not an act any more than a cis person is acting their gender. Calling any trans person their preferred pronouns is done because you understand that they understand their own gender way better than you do, and you accept them.

But if we're talking about assumptions and drag queens, it's safe to assume that a queen in full drag will not take offence at anyone calling them ""she"". Calling the persona ""he"" is much more likely to come off as being non-supportive.

One of the "" ideals "" behind TERFism is protecting the minority class that is being a woman. They feel, **INCORRECTLY**, that trans women are appropriating that. And that drag queens are mocking it.  (I cannot stress enough that this is not my personal view!)

But there is no protected class that is being a man. There are no spaces, no boundaries. And as such, there is no appropriating.

j11zvxs,t1_j11qgse,2022-12-21 02:08:02,lgbt,"What's really wild is, that the 90's really were a step up from earlier decades.  

I've heard horror stories about how it was much worse in the 80's, from some women who transitioned back then and the norm was simply to move away when you transitioned and start a whole new life in a new city under your new name, just assuming nobody from your old life will ever want to have anything to do with you ever again and nobody from your new life can ever know about your old life and they must believe you were born and raised female.

. . .but yeah, I remember quite well how shitty the environment was in the 90's and how much transphobia and outright ignorance was out there.  When I first went to college in fall of 1996, and got on the internet for the very first time, one of the first things I searched for was anything about being transgender.

All I found, in late August 1996, was two types of thing:

1. Dry, tedious medical documentation and websites on the gory details of bottom surgery.
2. Lots of *really awful* sex stories about feminization, typically about forcing some really manly guy into becoming some terrible exaggerated parody of womanhood.

There just plain wasn't good advice or guidance to a young, deeply closeted, gender questioning person on the web back then.  You really were mostly on your own, and just having turned 18 and being on your own for the first time at college, it was scary enough dealing with that so I kept that big ball of anxiety labeled ""gender"" shoved in the closet for years to come because I couldn't find anything good.

I tried to come out to my mom once.  January 1999, after I thought maybe I could come back to that issue.  It did NOT go well.  She begged me to take it back and act like the whole conversation never happened.  She insisted I would be expelled from my university because ""no school wants a pervert going to it"", that I would be permanently unemployable and ""unable to even get a job digging ditches or scrubbing toilets"", that every friend I had would leave me, that my roommate would move out and stick me with the entire rent bill, etc.  I learned to never, ever bring up that issue ever again with my mother.",ProminentLocalPoster,t2_7pfler4x,4,0,reddit4

How many hiring managers in the US do you think would prefer to hire a less qualified transgender person over a more qualified cisgender person? My guess is that it's not 48%.

Straight people have these protections already -- they're built in. The only thing that non-discrimination laws do is expand those protections (or privileges) held that had been held exclusively by cis-hetero folks to folks of all genders and sexual orientations.

I get that forcing a Jewish baker to bake a cake with the swastika is pretty brutal, downright gross really. But if a company can deny service to anyone based on their religion or views, an owner of a grocery store can deny a gay couple from shopping there, and if it's only one is in the area, it will effectively cut their food supply and force them to move. That treads far, far more heavily on freedom in America.
> Uh, I would hope every single manager would higher a more qualified person over a less qualified one, what are you even saying? Do you seriously suggest we should hire trans people who are less qualified, just because they are trans?

I know personally two business owners that would 100% never hire a gay or trans person if they could, they would not give a damn if the lgbt person was 10 times more qualified. Some people (many, really) hold their personal and religious beliefs far above making money. Hell, there was even some landlords in my town that refused to rent to Natives because they hated them so much, even when it was hard to find renters and they lost money for it. Edit: I am pretty sure what the person you responded to just mixed up the order, that seems quite obvious to me. I don't think anyone in their right mind would fault someone for hiring the most qualified and suitable person for the job. If a lgbt individual is less qualified and suitable than a straight person, the straight person should get the job. Simple meritocracy. But this also works when the roles are reversed.

Equal protection under the law should be that no one can discriminate against anyone for who they are. I know it really would suck to bake that Nazi cake, but that also means that the Jewish person can go to the Neonazi's business and order services from him (not that he would, but the Neonazi would have to serve him if the Jew wanted to go to his business). 

Another point here is that being gay or trans is NOT a choice, being religious is. If your religion is so opposed to homosexuality, it was your choice to remain in it and discriminate. Gays/trans never had a choice in their sexual orientation (I am not talking the idiot special snowflakes that think they have 18 different genders; they do make that choice). 

To address freedom on a large scale, your thought is also misguided. You're an atheist (as am I). If owners have the right to not hire me or not serve me because of this, that is a fucking huge violation of basic human rights. The way people should act is that they don't have to like or agree with every religion, sexual orientation, view, etc but they MUST tolerate it. I, of course, do not mean shit like crimes or religious views of murdering heathens, etc.  The law should reflect this. A business owner can hate gays/trans all he likes but he must tolerate them at a basic level. Now that is freedom. 

Edit 2: I want to thank you for actually posting your side and debating. I feel it's much more important to talk the opposing side and see where they come from and understand each other, rather than the usual mud slinging that I see in many subs and threads.

>Why is it that ""equal protection under the law"" translates to ""I get to discriminate against you for your beliefs"" to people like yourself?

So, assuming stores are private establishments, I believe they're free to do anything legal they please. If such a sign is illegal, then by all means they should be prohibited from putting it up, but otherwise it should be their right. I wouldn't visit such a store, like I think most people wouldn't (poc or not), which should be enough of a discouragement against such signs.

Picture a very anti-poc person running a store. The sort who's not gonna change their view no matter what. I just think it's better they'd be transparent with their view, face backlash from people, and then go out of business due to lack of customers. The other option being that they're forced to hide their views, get sensored. Which often leads to not them changing views, but retreating to extremist groups where their views only grow more extreme.

Not every country has the same attitude to its constitution as the US does, but that doesn't mean they don't have one, or that it doesn't include explicit prohibitions of discrimination against sexual orientation :)

For example, Britain's Equalities Act 2010 forms part of her constitution, and explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Just because her constitution is uncodified does not mean it doesn't exist at all.

If you wanted to make a more specific point about protections guaranteed in entrenched constitutions, I grant you it might have made for a less snappy title, but I think that clarity is important if you don't show on the map which countries' constitutions you're ignoring for whatever reason.

Constitutional protection of orientation and gender was read in as discrimination akin to the enumerated grounds following ""in particular"" in s.15(1).  The anti-discrimination section was designed to allow evolution as societal views of discrimination changed so it listed agreed upon grounds (in 1982) using the non-restricted ""and, in particular"" wording.

15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

(2) Section (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

Constitutional protection already existed by the mid-90s and kept strengthening very quickly (such that same-sex marriage was getting legalized in the early 2000s because any prohibitions violated constitutional rights).  Constitutional protection was already an evolving thing by the Egan decision in the early 90s (I hope I am remembering those details correctly - it’s been ages since law school).

The information on the Human Rights Act relates to broader protections than the equality rights in the constitution because the constitutional protections have nothing to do with private interactions.  The Canadian constitution protects you from discrimination by government while the Human Rights Act protects you from discrimination in private parties with power like employers, landlords and businesses.  It’s not a part of the constitution at all.  Some people are mistaking the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (part of the 1982 constitutional documents) for the Human Rights Act.

2. No one shall be privileged, benefited, harmed, deprived of any right or exempt from any duty on grounds of ancestry, sex, race, language, territory of origin, religion, political or ideological convictions, education, economic situation, social condition or sexual orientation.

j2tu1sy,t1_j2szslv,2023-01-03 22:21:14,lgbt,"After reading what OP said, the main differences between the Canadian and the British system is the parliamentary sovereignty. In parliamentary sovereignty, the government makes the laws and there are no laws above the government, except the Constitution.

In the British system, *Equality Act* and the *Human Rights Act* are both laws that can be overturned with a simple majority. But, the *Human Rights Act* was written to codify in the British law system the requirements of the *European Human Rights Convention,* which all EU members are expected to ratify. But, this type of law is not as binding as a Constitution.

In the Canadian system, the *Charter of rights and freedoms* is inside the *Canadian Constitution*. Therefore, all governments must oblige to both documents and you can't modify either documents with a simple majority at the House of Commons. You need 50% of the votes at the House of Commons, the approval of the Senate, then the provincial governments of at least 7 provinces which represent at least 50% of the Canadian population need to ratify the changes. So, the likeliness of an homophobic government unilaterally changing the constitution to remove rights is highly improbable.

EDIT: Plus, Canada's Supreme Court has ruled many times in favour of a broader definition of what's included in the protected groups.

>According to the Supreme Court of Canada's Section 15 jurisprudence, the equality guarantees of section 15 are aimed at preventing the ""violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political and social prejudices, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration.""  
>  
>Unlike formal equality, which overlooks personal differences, substantive equality is concerned with the impact of the law on different groups of individuals. Substantive equality requires that there be an equal impact on the person affected by the law.

iyy0c1g,t3_zcien6,2022-12-05 00:45:35,lgbt,"I think people spend a lot of time tailoring their presentation to express a certain message as part of their sexual identity. 

I don’t think it’s wrong for people to go, “Do you understand what I’m saying with my presentation?” / “How does this read?” / “Am I legible to you?” 

Sure, some of it is stereotypical, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad—or entirely unintentional. Hormones are hormones, but haircuts and clothing are something people can control and take pride in, and they feel affirmed when their efforts are acknowledged and seen. 

Also I think that it’s presumptuous to assume that being read “wrong” is a negative or dysphoric experience for others just because it is for you. Sometimes passing as something you’re not IS the thrill. You shouldn’t assume it’s inherently insulting or negative to be read wrong or that everyone’s looking for a certain “right” answer.",robotspierre,t2_iny0k,-1,0,reddit3

I understand if people want to make sure they're coming across as they intend, especially if they don't have supportive friends who would be honest with them, but I also feel like the LGBTQ+ community is not a representative demographic to ask.

Many of us, whether trans or cis, have done hard work to undo what society has taught us about gender and unpacked things about ourselves and our assumptions about other people. Many of us have to do that over and over as we figure more out about ourselves and who we are or aren't attracted to and how we fit into a world that doesn't like to be challenged on its strict gendered tropes.

Posts asking us to evaluate someone's appearance based on those regressive tropes don't come naturally to many of us any more and opening the door to judgement by those gendered standards makes me reflect more on myself and my own appearance and my dysphoria finds a new and interesting way to make me have a shitty day.

They probably didn't know the answer, and instead of owning up to it decided to be mean. It's good to ask questions when you don't know something, but there are always people who have a lot of ego about saying they don't know or can't explain.

If you are still looking for a definition non-binary is someone outside of the social gender binary of male/female. It's basically the ""other"" option for gender, but other than that can be very different for different people.

Free speech, whatever definition you want to apply to it, does not overwrite rules. And so, if the mods wish to limit or ban posts that are actively harmful, of which this is, then there is nothing ""free speech"" can do there.       

Additionally, attempting to shut down discussion on something that is harmful to the community at large is not very free speech of you.",Sesame_Valerate,t2_qf3nvts4,1,0,reddit3
izdst8x,t1_izdrz9f,2022-12-08 10:58:23,lgbt,"1) Never said anything is or is not toxic. Don't put words in my mouth.

2) I'm saying specifically, and only this one thing: Subs are not the world at large, they are small moderated communities where rules are made to keep a sub running the way the mods think it will run best. That means free speech does not functionally exist and using ""free speech"" as an argument is meaningless. Same as complaining about your free speech being violated on Facebook or Twitter or anything else. It's privately run. If you post slurs they will be removed. If you violate a sub rule you will have your post be removed. That's literally all I was saying and I don't know how you've misconstrued what I said so badly.

3) I don't like those posts. I do just move on and ignore them. Seeing posts like that does sometimes make me feel dysphoric and shitty about myself. I don't want to be picking appart someone's appearance and inadvertently make them feel that way too.

It would be nice to have a tag for them or something so I can avoid them better. I also feel like this is the wrong community to be asking as our impression will be skewed and getting reliable and accurate feedback on passing can be a big safety issue. We are probably not the people to be asking about that.

There are solutions here that will make everyone happy. It's fine to express displeasure at seeing loads of those kinds of posts all the time, too. ""Free speech"", right?",RubeGoldbergCode,t2_1pdkkuo7,1,0,reddit3

iyzkz76,t1_iyza3i9,2022-12-05 10:44:53,lgbt,"No, that cis person is just as likely to misgender them unfairly, because most of them are honestly really dumb about anything tied to gender(they just never have to process it consciously like trans people do). Plus, if you would happen to ask for advice, or ""why you look a certain way"", I'm gonna bet almost all cis people are gonna respond with some vague and nebulous answer, or something unhelpful and hurtful, probably unintentionally, but just as likely to be an ass.

If you pass to trans people, there's some real certainty that you ""look the part"" that you long to look. And because of that extra scrutiny you can then ask pointed questions on how to improve things or do better. And trans people would have actual advice instead of nonsense, and insight into the issue, so assuming you aren't talk to a jackass, you can get constructive criticism.

Like honestly, I wouldn't trust cis people with *anything* pertaining to transness especially if it's personal. But that's just my take

hirs0if,t3_qjkeyw,2021-10-31 15:10:20,lgbt,"In reference to the second point. Saint Valentine helped end a ban on people getting married as people thought getting married made them too soft for battle. Aside from that one point in history, which is a mere blip in the history of civilisation, the point stands true. The struggle for same sex marriage has always been a much harder fight to win as we're outnumbered by straights who continue to support oppressive leaders who they're convinced benefit them somehow more then any socially progressive candidate.

The people that think we don't need pride or that we're over represented are often living in a delusional bubble where they think homophobia doesn't exist as we have equal rights and they've got a gay friend. These are often the same people who don't think racism exists, when in fact it plays a key role in maintaining the capitalist exploitation of the working classes; be it wars abroad such as Iraq, supporting ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, selling weapons to the Saudis knowing full well they'll use them to bomb the Yemenese or China enslaving Muslim minorities to make iPhones.

The punch down is designed to empower some at the expense of others and by constantly pitting different disenfranchised demographics against each other, it stops the oppressed collectively rising against their oppressors and voting them out of office. Case in point being the mainstream press portraying Jeremy Corbyn as an anti-Semetic racist, when in fact he's spent his entire life fighting against racism and even demands Israel's government to give Palestinians (also Semites) civil rights.

The same arguments against lesbians in the 90s being in women's spaces, toilets and changing rooms are now being used against trans women. JK Rowling isn't even subtle about it and her Harry Potter books revel in the women's bathrooms under threat narrative via manly trolls and massive snakes,

Queer people are just another target on the punching bag along with the disabled, autistic, darker skinned and immigrants. It should be no suprise that the richest person on the plane Elon Musk supports a fascist government overthrowing a democratically elected left socialist government, saying ""we'll coup whoever we want"".

So why do we need Pride? Because we still have a huge way to go, and because even in progressive countries with all the legal protections, most of the population still has no clue what it's like, what we go through, or are generally queerphobic to some degree. Even those who call themselves Allies are goddamn clueless so much of the time.

&#x200B;

I live in a reasonably progressive country, in a progressive city, that's quite high on the queer safety index. My work had a bunch of video meetings a while ago to talk about Pride month, and how we could celebrate it internally as a company. 

The meetings were all led by a non-queer 'ally', who went to great pains to \*repeatedly\* state how fine she is with queer people and how safe she is, who proceeded to \*explain to the queer people in the group what pride is\*.

Another woman in the group, again a self described ally who said that she had a close friend who is trans, proceeded to misgender her friend \*repeatedly\* while using a throwaway excuse as to why that was okay, and stated that ""\*Everyone, on both sides, needs to be comfortable with people staring at trans folk to work out what they are, and trans people need to not be uncomfortable with that, and other people need to be okay with being open about it, because it's natural to stare and work out what people are, like we all do with disabled people to work out what's wrong with them\*""

Pride has its roots as memorial to those dying of AIDS. In the US, not only did the country actively ignore AIDS and refuse to aggressively research, but the community was continually abused by being denied care, having substandard care while actually in the hospital, being verbally abused and neglected, and then denying loved ones to visit because they weren't married. The community has had to fight aggressively for every right we have.

Pride is about getting the human rights we deserve. Its about raising awareness to issues in the community and looking for/providing solutions. Its putting faces to a minority.

There are some members in my family where my wife, girlfriend and I are the only LGBTQIA people they know. When I write posts during June or on National Coming Out Day, its important that they see me doing it. Public opinion changes over time.

And in some areas where it can be dangerous to be Out, being Out is an act of courage. It can also be a beacon of hope to those in the closet.

Pride is remembering our history, celebrating who we are, and bolstering ourselves for the fights to come. Its evolved over time, but still so important.

hmimpfw,t3_r4qxja,2021-11-29 10:35:31,lgbt,"This is quite minor tbh, but I feel like people expect queer-looking people to be queer in as many ways as possible. Like... as someone who's very active in lgbtq spaces both online and in my friend groups/associations and as someone who's frankly very visibly fruity, I sometimes get the feeling people think I'll eventually ""figure out"" that there's really ""more going on"" within myself.

Like, I've thought about my gender incredibly long and hard, but I've come out the other end like ""huh, I associate strongly and intimately with my assigned gender."" Sometimes I think I might be genderqueer or genderfluid, and I still think that might be true... But I like my binary pronouns, I'm very comfortable being interacted with as my assigned binary gender (although I do dig getting misgendered by strangers... people who they/them me are comforting because they readily use they/them, and when people binarily misgender me I'm like ""ooh, I'm in like a fun and funky stealth mode!"") Then as far as my sexuality I've also thought about it, but it feels more obvious that I'm just plain old bisexual.

Anyway my point in all this rant is: anytime I try to explain any of this nuance I just end up getting some weird like ""ohh you're cis? Yeah okayyyy whatever you say. Well just let me know if you ever want to use different pronouns!"" Like nice, okay, yeah, I get it.

Both my partner and I are bi/pan and the queer community is our family, but I still use gender neutral terms to refer to him.

Like... Screw all pan and bisexual women, right? And why... Because of fear of being left for a man? Honestly to me the whole concept seems to be taking a phobia of men (which is bad on its own) and superimposing it as an insucurity to other women. If someone meets your attraction for their sex and or gender... Their personality is what should be judged next, not if said person has touched a man at any in the past or not. What.

But to your reply, maybe you hanging out with these people makes them assume you share common interests. If you don’t, then why carry on with them if you aren’t clicking. I’m telling you right now, it’s a you problem. Just because you’re not like “them”, you preferring other things is not on them. That goes with any group. 

The things that we are calling stereotypes, like shows people prefer or jokes they relate to isn’t as trivial to them as this thread seems to assume. 

Once you realize that those stereotypes are very much a  part of the gay culture, your culture- and no matter what you do won’t change that, you will begin to understand and appreciate these things and still never have to watch RuPaul or wear makeup. 

I say this because I’ve been there. It’s not about age either, it’s about being honest with what’s bothering you. When I go hunting with my dad and I am with guys all weekend, I hate when everyone assumes I am republican. Not because I am gay, because they make decisions based on emotion and not logic. Even though they say liberal  tears are filling rivers, it’s not true. That bothers me. Ignoring what is, hurts people. Someone assuming I’m into drag doesn’t bother me. I have never done it and don’t even have the slightest urge. Why, doesn’t it bother me? Because it’s lifting spirits, making people feel good, and my masculinity will still be here no matter what. Now my ego doesn’t want people to assume I am republican, especially with the things that come out of my family members mouths. Backwoods republicans are no joke with their lack of education. 

Let’s put it this way. Would you be lying to yourself if you said you aren’t flattered or wouldn’t be flattered if someone assumed you are straight or thought you were a huge jock and were into stereotypical straight male bro stuff? Ahh come on, I know it makes you feel kinda good? Just a little bit? Remember, I used to relate. I know what’s in your head. Ok so maybe I don’t.

hmn5tzx,t1_hmmn3gj,2021-11-30 08:59:08,lgbt,"So, these dynamics can happen with different combinations of people but I'll use the most standard and binary descriptions here...

""unicorn hunters"" are polyamorous couples, almost always one man and one woman who are both attracted to women (ex: a straight man and a bisexual woman) who are looking for a bisexual woman to date both of them at once. Although not always toxic, seeking this dynamic out is often frowned upon because the ""original couple"" usually has a stronger relationship with eachother than with the ""unicorn,"" so the ""unicorn"" can get taken advantage of.

""piggy backing"" is basically the same dynamic, except usually the *woman* in the ""original couple"" starts going out and forming relationships with other women. The ""piggy backing"" part comes in when she then misleads her girlfriend and, in some way, expresses that there's an expectation for the girlfriend to also form a relationship with the man of the ""original couple"" (thus making her essentially a ""unicorn."")

Again many polyamorous people agree that three-way dynamics like this can be just fine if they happen organically... But with unicorn hunting and piggy backing, the third partner is often put on unequal footing from the other two, and may be unreasonably expected to bond with both partners when they were only attracted to one, for example.

It's really shitty. 

Piggybacking in this context would be like if you are on a dating app as a partnered woman talking to other queer women and then after someone talks to you for a while and seems invested being like ""oh btw, my boyfriend wants to join""",EM37452,t2_4h6hveok,2,0,reddit2

I tend to just believe when someone says they're bi, they're bi. If they figure something out and realize that label doesn't fit, that's fine too. Regardless, it was frustrating in the relatively brief time I identified as bi to hear those ""pick a side"" or ""stepping stone to gay"" stereotypes. I think that's part of why I kept identifying as bi even after it became clear to me that being with a man was off the table. I felt like I had to prove my identity was valid because I didn't want to prove right anyone spouting that stereotype.

Anyway, I just wanted to throw in my two cents here. I didn't ""become gay"" or ""pick a side,"" I learned more about myself :)",harmon_atri,t2_15x5td,11,0,reddit2

>For reference, I'm amab and currently identifying as male but very very likely to actually want to be a trans women (the enby in the post knows this), and I specifically said that the constant gender essentialism makes me dysphoric bc it makes me feel reduced to a gender.

I'm going out on a limb here and guessing that you might be someone who is still learning about these topics and about how to express yourself to friends who might not have exactly the same opinions as you / how to live in your own identity while respecting that others who may inhabit the same labels or social spaces as you still have different opinions on *how* you are both queer/GSM/LGBT/etc. or maybe even something as simple as a difference in ""sense of humor.""

From my understanding, gender dysphoria is not the same thing as ""self-hatred"" or ""bad feelings."" ""Very very likely to actually want to be a trans woman"" sounds like maybe you're denying some part of your identity or like maybe you just don't want to be a trans woman, in which case..... you don't ""have"" to be. I don't see what the problem is.

>I specifically said that the constant gender essentialism makes me dysphoric bc it makes me feel reduced to a gender.

What the situation you described between you and your friend is not so much an ideological break or anything even approaching something that has to do with ideology, but rather an annoyance that your friend is ""negging"" your interests and/or hobbies.  
What I think you mean when you use the term ""gender essentialism""\* is that there are maybe generalizations or reductive thinking or stereotypes against ""maleness"" and your NB friend might have some long-standing (and well-founded) resentments toward patriarchy that happen to coincide with some of the spaces or people with whom you frequently interact. Maybe you're both just emotionally burned out and don't know how to be tender toward one another, which is a pretty big part of what friendship is.

Best of luck to you and your friend, whatever you decide.

I just want to clarify that this isn't technically gender essentialism.

What you're experiencing is misandry, or prejudice against men. I think it's helpful to make this distinction for clarity. In the lgbtq+ community, misandry is very tolerated and often seen as funny right now (pulling from my experience on and offline) and I'm glad you're able to identify it and vocalize that it makes you uncomfortable.",Novel_Asparagus_6176,t2_c9rgduv4,1,0,reddit4

Yes, all men. Yes, including me. Even if you're a good man (general ""you""), you can still accidentally uphold and reinforce patriarchy, and you're more likely to do so if you think you're exempt because you're good. You won't be watching yourself so it's harder to catch yourself. If you think you're a good man, so women shouldn't be afraid of you, you might accidentally intimidate a woman by raising your voice at her. If you think you're a good man, and you value women's voices, you might not make the effort to let your female colleagues speak more at discussions. Most men, even men who consider themselves feminist, don't realize just how much they dominate conversations; even when men and women think a conversation was equal, women made up about a third of overall talk time. That's not equal.

Then say, that maybe it’s because men are told that sex is what they should want most. The only socially acceptable way for men to engage in physical intimacy is through sex. And then I would also add that some men are asexual and sex repulsed, and do not in fact want sex. 
You could also talk about how media portrays men as only wanting sex.

I think the phrase “not all men” is so highly associated with dismissal, that I would try to avoid it. But I find that the best way to challenge a bigoted statement is to talk about it.

I disagree. Acknowledging that men perpetuate women's oppression and marginalization doesn't mean we can't acknowledge men who actively work to help women. That's why we have terms like toxic masculinity versus wholesome masculinity. 

>men are always labeled as 'the problem' when it should be misogyny that's the problem. 

Both are true, because men are raised in a society where misogyny is the default, so we subconsciously perpetuate misogyny unless we're actively consciously working against it. Yes, even trans men. 

>As a man, especially a trans man, who's absolutely doing everything I can for women like attending rallies etc within my own limitations, its horribly demeaning to be labeled 'the problem' when it genuinely isn't my kind of man.

And if you can't acknowledge that men are part of the problem, then you *are* being that sort of man. I'm sure you're working to fight the patriarchy in a lot of ways in your life and that's great. But it's not just attending rallies. Lots of us can't do that, but we can help in everyday, more mundane ways, like maybe not taking the elevator when the only other person in it is a lone woman. She doesn't know we're safe. The only way we can show her is by avoiding the situation altogether. And that starts by acknowledging that ""yes, all men, including me.""",snukb,t2_5lfpb,1,0,reddit4

Not all the blame is on the young, social media algorithms are literally trained to bring controversial things to your feed so you will react, comment, dislike, and ultimately engage.

>Talk down to them and grandstand about how stupid they are (anti-drug campaigns have taught me that this universally works)

>The intention here is to mend rifts and prevent splintering within the community,

Listen, I understand that teenagers be bitchin' (and it's often 'bout some bullshit) but why oh why have we all just decided that being patient with people is for suckers? I get it, they say shit that's disrespectful themselves. They'll see a- well, honestly they'll see an *anyone* describing themselves and find a nit worth picking somewhere.  They'll tell transmen they're transphobic for identifying as a lesbian and what-have-you. But contrary to them being this virulent gatekeeper who wants to belittle and destroy the noble and endangered transman (his name is Dave and we love him) in his natural habitat, what if they're just genuinely seeing it as problematic? Yeah, they'll probably perform being unreasonably upset about it (hence resorting to castigating poor Dave as transphobic) but I don't think it takes a cartoon character scratching their head to find a clear logical dilemma with a *trans*-**MAN** identifying as a *lesbian.* Most people (and I REALLY do mean *most people* here not just the population of your favorite LGBTQ+ friendly discord server) understand lesbian as meaning girl + girl. So it's not too crazy a leap to think ""transman calling himself lesbian"" means ""transman is woman,"" which sounds *kinda fucked up.* 

So, and this might be a little far, but maybe let's just talk to them on their level; as best we can. Listen to and take in their thoughts and concerns and do our best to actually assuage them (and please dear God leave the pretentious *teaching* phrasing bullshit out you will reach 5 gazillion percent more young people if you don't open by sounding like a pompous dick.) Now of course they might not listen; they might get even more bitter and defensive—being a minority doesn't mean you can't be unreasonable (**evidently.** (This one is funny because it can be interpreted as being at both mine and OOP's expenses.)) But that doesn't mean we shouldn't actually try to reach them.

Young people ARE stupid. Being a useless moron is an integral part of being a teenager. But they're not a bunch of lesser apes sitting at typewriters banging out entire pages of Blaire White's *Infighting and You: Pandering for Fun and for Profit.* They're just misguided (and very very stupid.) 

Just approach them on their level. Talk to them like they're human beings who have valid-if-complicated feelings about complicated topics (and this shit *is* complicated sometimes) and help them in the right direction. Again, that might not work but you know what *definitely* isn't going to work? This shit. Teenagers are defensive and they see shit like calling them stupid temper tantrum babies fighting over flags and fanfiction as assholish (which it is.) Also, don't call them stupid as I do they don't like that.

And now, we have come full circle. I have performed *my* angry grandstanding asshole for the hour. If reading this deliberately dickish, disrespectful, down-talking, hypocritical, hyperbolic, teetering-on-the-edge-of-bad-faith-engagement comment has made you feel negative or defensive or bad imagine being fifteen again and reading it.

I understand that when talking about stuff like this we get mad because getting mad is easy and makes us feel good and it's a whole hell of a lot easier than having to actually listen to those little bastards. And sometimes the shit they say is fucked. It's hard to be Mr. Rogers when you're surrounded by a bunch of that one three-eyed asshole from The Owl House. But still, come on y'all.

Even so, I have become my own mortal nemesis. Perhaps my compunction with all this mean-talking and rudeness slinging is a reflection of my anguish with just what an angry belligerent jerk *I* am on the inside (and the outside.)

I remember that then, most trans people, trans women especially, had basically created VERY sharp rules if you wanted to be accepted by the community. You had to be full anarcho-com and you had to express that with zeal, as well as being a number of other things. When you're a baby trans and you see all your sisters making their friendship with you conditional based on your political beliefs and behavior, you dive right into that behavior yourself. This phase for me lasted about 2 years, then I would start to question it, lose friends, and keep doing that. When I went to school for philosophy I really started to lose friends around that time.

There were always a few independent thinkers among them though. Like, 1 in 7 or so. I'm still friends with some of them. Some of them are my exes etc. It just made me sad that a lot / most of my sisters were probably feeling compelled to behave a certain way for fear of losing the community - and I don't just mean online. Being a trans woman then, even in person people could be like this. I've personally seen some of them never grow out of this.

Seeing people being mean on online safe havens for queer and trans people and therefore telling everyone to stay offline is nonsense.  

1.  Not a single thing that upset you is only present on social media.  

2.  If you live in *checks notes* most places, you absolutely must use social media because the people around you are assholes. Finding friends from a safe location when you want to is better than remaining alone in the ""real world,"" trying to guess who is cool, who is among the many who don't acknowledge your existence as a queer trans person, and who hates you. I myself discovered online communities (and therefore IRL communities) after years of loneliness.   Without social media, I, and millions of others, might have never escaped.  ""Go to queer events,"" is pretty detached and doing that or being online a lot are not dependent on quitting the other 

3.  Trans people are well known for being online for a reason.  Your personal preference regarding digital socal spaces is not a moral highground.  Not everyone lives where you live or is as conventionally socially accessible and socially able as you are.  Not everyone's 'IRL' world is happier than their Tumblr or Reddit or YouTube, and it's not because they don't know about your post yet.

4.  It's okay if you found out you're better off without online queer communities.  You assume everyone needs to get offline cause you're life is good enough without it, but you have all the skills and networks and transportation and legal protection and money and health and free time and urban liberal access to thrive ..  Not everyone is so lucky and to blindly think they are is a very privelaged and very wrong guess.  Finding friends at all as adults is sort of hard even for a lot of privelaged people.  Mostly young, isolated, vulnerable, marginalized people who might still be closeted (or out with nowhere to go) need online spaces, and unfortunately some of them might actually take your advice until it hurts too much.",madmushlove,t2_jkpko4nw,13,0,reddit1

How does any of that effect you, personally?

Let people be themselves.

Or is this a list of what he says people are needlessly complaining about?

I don't much care either way, to be honest.

This just comes across as shaking your cane and yelling ""get off my lawn"".

I don't see anything problematic in that list of items.

At the same time, if any of those things do bother you, you have the right to say so.

Either way, why are *you* allowing yourself to be upset by *other people*?

As an example: I don't identify or even understand the ""pup"" community, but I follow some on the clock app because they have interesting content.

And it's no big deal.

Let people do what brings them joy.

And if you don't like that? 

Scroll past, that content isn't made for you.

Just like drag story time: if you don't want your kids read to by a character in costume, don't go.

But don't try to prevent those that do want to attend from going.

Oh the horror if everyone started doing whatever they wanted, or expressing themselves how they wanted to, how the work might end! (Sarcasm, clearly, don't at me.)

At worst, people might be happy.

And you might lose some control, or be confused about other's choices.

However, the other side is valid too, whether we like it or not: there is a price to pay for being yourself in public, and you have to pay that price to be yourself.

And that's criticism from those that disagree with you.

We don't get it both ways, we can't be openly who we are, and expect no one to find fault with that.

That's unrealistic.

Sure, that's how it would be in an ideal world, but if the past few years haven't clued you in, this is far from an ideal world.

There is nothing braver than being your true self in public, especially on social media, because you are vulnerable to attack by those that oppose your existence.

Which really, truly sucks, but it's a fact of life that *everyone*, queer or straight, cis or trans, conservative or liberal, exist with.

I think one of the reasons we are seeing such a strong reaction from traditional conservatives against anything that's not, is that they are finally beginning to feel how it feels for it not to be safe to express who you are online, because not everyone thinks like they do.

And they hate having to back into a closet rather than spew their hatred for anyone that's not them.

And I don't care about that.

I know at heart, most people are good, and given the choice, will do the right thing.

But there will always be a few, on both sides, that are dangerously belligerent.

Sorry if this comes across as a rant, but this posting just triggered me, I don't see a reason for the complaint as it was given.

jcnk7io,t3_11totsu,2023-03-18 03:13:02,lgbt,"This is a very privileged and self centered take on it. It is presented like it's focusing on the bigger needs of the community, but it's actually about a persons personal feelings. Just because you have not experienced it personally or had conversations about it personally does not mean it's not happening. And just because the older generation doesn't discuss it doesn't mean it's not a concern. One of the issues at play is that there are things people are NOT talking about that have a bigger impact than it seems.

 We Don't get to decide what other people are interested in and what they chose to talk about. We shouldn't shame people for the things they are passionate about because we don't think they need to be passionate about them. All of these topics need to be discussed, because they all impact the community in some way.

Everyone in our community should be able to express themselves without being invalidated by someone who doesn't think it's important. This isn't the oppression Olympics. 

Think of it like a building fire. Yes, the most pressing and damaging thing is the actual fire, but just having everyone trying to put out the fire instead of doing all of the other things that support fighting a fire will not be as successful as having people covering other roles and doing different related tasks for the fire. And not everyone is able to, or comfortable, trying to put out the fire, but they may be comfortable keeping the crowd back, or wetting the neighboring houses, or making sure everyone is drinking water, or keeping people calm, or giving updates to dispatch, or coordinating with EMTs, or any other task.

If we want a community that can truly express themselves without fear, then we need to be open to having that discourse. And if you think that the online discourse never leaves online, then that's just ignorant. Advocacy groups all over the country use the online discussion to guide them to address the needs and interests of the community.

For example, a lot of people view ""straight"" and ""queer"" attraction as different in certain ways (it's a very person distinction, not something you can define in a textbook), and will identify more with the ""queer"" attraction (in this case, feeling like ""Lesbian"" attraction makes more sense than ""straight"" attraction to women).  

It's also possible that this person feels a connection to their femininity through the Lesbian label, even if they don't identify as a woman.  And this is to say nothing of the various shades of nonbinary people who might call themselves a trans man but have a more nuanced view of their gender than just ""man"".

They might also just arbitrarily like the label.  Frankly, gender is made up bullshit (read: a social construct), so there's no harm in applying the ""wrong"" gendered labels to yourself.  In fact, that's fundamental in the queer community.",Larriet,t2_4gea8wk,68,0,reddit1

A man who figures out his gender at 30 or 40 while dating women the whole time is going to have spent a large chunk of their life as a lesbian. Despite realizing his gender, he might feel like his sense of attraction has more in common with lesbian women than with straight men.

It's similar for the lesbian in a relationship with a trans man. If she met the man before he came out, and she's never been into a man before or since, it may be that the love she has for him as a person means she stays attracted even though he's no longer even looking like what she'd normally be interested in.

People define lesbians as 2 non-men in a relationship. So, by this definition, a woman and a transmasc person could be considered lesbians, because trans masc people are not men, they are nonbinary. 

Although these things are different, I've seen the term ""trans masc"" & ""transmasculine"" used to encompass both groups. Like a general term used for both transmascs and trans men, regardless of whether or not it's accurate.

This is where the confusion lies. I think this take originated on tiktok. Over time, ""transmascs can be lesbians"" somehow turned into ""trans men can be lesbians""

The people who are chronically online believe in an almost purity of attraction and labels, that as soon as someone comes out as trans, say, then they must adhere to everything that would entail, even if that meant they had to break up with their previously same-sex partner immediately because they're not longer same-sex... even though thats not really how relationships and feelings work. This could be the same for the women who discover they're lesbians after being in a fulfilling marriage with kids. Its a sort of fantasy because many of them haven't had the experiences to say ""Well, she doesn't want to divorce and her husband is still like her best friend and it'll be tough on the kids"" and all the nuances that come with it.

But also, in my opinion, people who decide to be together shouldn’t be judged despite their identities, even if the identity theoretically “shouldn’t” match. Sexuality is defined based on gender, and when gender gets different from “man” and “woman” a lot of sexuality labels become pedantic and not fully accurate of the situation. Especially when it comes to genderfluid and non-binary folks and the people attracted to them. So until sexuality gets separated from gender, I say fuck it, use whatever labels you want and get into whatever relationship you want regardless, as long as everyone in the relationship is happy.

So I think it's incorrect to say that using the wrong labels can't hurt people.

Feelings and sexualities are complicated and messy. The 'lesbian' label was very much created during a period of trans erasure, and did not account for more than a single aspect of sexuality - perceived gender identity of the subject.

That's without going into the fact that those labels can very much be support mechanisms (is that a thing ?) for many of us, and she might be feeling ""kicked out"" of a source of strength and support in her life.

jcmu4dk,t1_jckks3i,2023-03-17 23:46:29,lgbt,"The other comments are good, but I'll give you a take as a member of the subculture.

Pup play is a lot of things, and not everybody is all of them. Basically it's a kink slash lifestyle subculture that's adjacent to the BDSM and leather community.

Most participants have pup hoods that they wear at events (often just casual social meetups). There are also moshes, where there are play mats and dog toys and people literally play and wrestle and roll around.

For some people it's also a sex thing, but not everyone. For some people it's furry adjacent, but that's definitely not everyone.

And there's power dynamic stuff in there with alphas and handlers too, but again that can be very opt in.

A lot of people are attracted to it because it's a very liberating and positive subculture. People are consistently very friendly and welcoming, and it's often a safer way to explore BDSM stuff for those put off by traditional leather and BDSM aesthetics. It also has a heavy social and play element, so it's a lot of actual fun, not just sex.

Anyway, all of that gets collapsed down into 'degenerates who are sexually harassing members of a Pride crowd by barking at them from the parade' by the no-kink-at-Pride types.

Edit: Oh yeah. As others have said, it's not exclusively gay men but it's _very very heavily_ gay men. Every pup I know is a gay man, and 99% of the ones I've ever met have been.",sirophiuchus,t2_e36ic,10,0,reddit1

It's not my cup of tea, but I won't dispute if it's someone else's experience.

As for couples - there's so much more to relationships than sexual attraction. Especially if one partner comes out as trans, if there was a loving relationship before, they can find it hard to let go and/or feel so romantically connected that sexual attraction becomes moot. 

We also don't owe it to anyone to discuss the details of our relationship. I know a gay guy whose still married to his straight wife, they love each other as friends, as parents of their children, as life partners. But not in the traditional sense of the word when we think of husband and wife. And that's beautiful to love each other so deeply that it transcends romantic and sexual feelings. 

I agree, words have meanings. If I see two women in a relationship, without any input from them, I'll consider them bisexual (pansexual, omnisexual, etc) or lesbian. But if they tell me that's not what is going on - well, that's their relationship, and I'm sure there's details to their sex and romantic life that are none of my business that make their statement true.",Call_Me_Aiden,t2_omqfkl0k,24,0,reddit1

The answer: Their definition of the label is DIFFERENT than yours.

Full stop. 

Example: ""clocked"" has a different definition in the trans community than ""clocked"" in the cis community. Clocked can mean to have someone usually cis id a trans person as trans vs. to hit someone so hard as to knock them out.

You can pull up the dictionary definition of ""clocked"". Neither one of those two usages is in this dictionary entry [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clocked](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clocked)

Dictionaries record the meaning after society has decided on the meaning. THERE IS NO AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITION for a word.

So your moaning about how ""someone called themselves something that doesn't apply to them"" is just you being petulant.

Having these relationships makes a huge difference.

It can be valuable to work towards an ideal, but at what point is exposing our community to harassment from institutions of violence like the police (literally the gun of the state) too much risk to be worth the outreach? If the outreach has to happen at all, why shouldn't that happen in spaces intended for that interaction to explicitly occur? I don't go to pride with the intention of rubbing elbows with cops, I go to be around queers like me, people I'm in community with. If that were the expectation, I wouldn't be going to pride.

And do you know any trans women who've had to deal with cops personally? Because I do, and as a trans-feminine person myself let me tell you, it's not something that typically goes well. The BEST interactions I've had were ones where I passed, or got clocked and got the stink eye. But I've also been accused of being a prostitute by police, and having the people I was with interrogated on suspicion of being my ""john"" or pimp (I was in college and just getting lunch with a friend). I have friends who are trans sex workers and that's their every day lives, and it's well known among them and their communities that involving the cops tends to make things worse for you, even when you're doing nothing illegal or genuinely need their help (life or death shit).

I hope you've had good interactions with police, and I hope that trend continues. But I personally wouldn't let myself go somewhere I knew I'd have to interact with cops, much less expose myself to their violent authority.",Airie,t2_o7ylz,1,0,reddit1
