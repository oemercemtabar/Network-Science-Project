The dream of everyone making enough money to not worry about tomorrow and jobs everywhere is not going to happen, at least not in the next few decades, this was never the case anyway. Growth in the USA is already pretty solid considering the size of the economy and while the rich may benefit the most, in the end it does benefit everyone since there are more jobs available and more competition for employees.

cyp34cr,t1_cyooi7t,2016-01-07 06:48:01,science,"Yes and no. The Great Recession ended in June of 2009 and the economy has been growing for many years (the mark of a recession is a contracting economy) but the growth has been generally slow and not spread terribly equally.

In particular, wage growth has been anemic and job growth solid but slower than one would expect but returns to capital have been tremendous. The result of this is that if you lost a large proportion during the recession, for instance if most of your wealth was in your house, which is the case for most Americans)and especially so for black Americans) and your house lost a lot of it's value then you had nothing to invest with. There have been very large gains in the stock market since the end of the recession, for example, but the only people who were able to take advantage of it were those who still had enough wealth to invest in the stock market post recession. These people probably lost a lot of money in absolute terms during the downturn, but less in proportion to their total wealth than others.

People who lost a large proportion of their wealth were less able to take advantage of these gains and had to make do with the relatively lower wages they were making, assuming they had a job. The consequence of this is that most everyone lost a lot, but in the recovery those who were already wealthier have seen their wealth skyrocket, leading to a large increase in inequality.

It's worth pointing out at this time that inequality is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. If everyone had the ability to buy a million dollars worth of goods (so if everyone had a million dollars and inflation weren't a thing) except one guy who could buy hundreds of trillions, that would be very unequal in an absolute sense but generally fine because every single person would have a high standard of living, even if one guy's were outrageous.

The reason the Great Recession doesn't feel like it's over is because that is not the case. People who lost everything still have't fully recovered and while unemployment is reaching it's lowest sustainable level, wages are only now beginning to rise. 

Interestingly, this makes the economy (at least that of the U.S) more volatile in general, but less responsive to specific shocks. For instance, if the price of oil tripled tomorrow, people living near the poverty line would hurt badly, and they would alter their behavior to drive less, but they would still have to drive places so it wouldn't change that much, and the very wealthy probably wouldn't alter their behavior much because the impact would be a smaller proportion of their income. 

However, if wealth is concentrated among only a few people or groups, than any changes in the fortunes of a given person or group is going to have an outsize effect on the wealth of the economy as a whole.",DCdictator,t2_6wt5i,1,0,reddit2

Effectively what this involved was pumping cash into the economy in order to stimulate investment. One way they could do this was through buying up commercial debt in order to pump cash into the economy (I buy a $1000 Commercial Bank bond from you, and give you cash for it) this theoretically increases the supply of money, and therefore with a greater supply of money, the cost of it (interest rates) go down. With the cost of money going down, the ease of financing and therefore the viscosity of money flow through the economy should increase. This should theoretically create positive effects in the economy through investment and consumer spending.

The Fed (the monetary policy institution of the US - which acts independently) has attempted to prevent another recession through engaging in QE. Whether or not you agree with QE is another matter. However, the issue with inequality primarily stems from the legal and political branches of government.

And there are a lot of programmers who honestly believe (with good reason, in some cases) that they do certain kinds of tasks better when they're a little buzzed. They might take some beer to work or their work to some beer. In a normal economy, this works out fine for them because employers will bend over backwards to make their programmers happy. In a recession, though, it's a little risky.

Then there are the alcoholics who smuggle flasks into the office because they just can't handle being sober. They don't really have (or need) a reason.",mathemagicat,t2_j2i14,2,0,reddit2

Is that why we've never seen a monopoly that was not a product of a government?

It has *raised the costs of operation* which *increased the overhead of operating the business* which *drove market consolidation to efficiently allocate capital in that sector*, which resulted in ""too big to fail"" banks. 

If costs of compliance were lower, there would be more banks of smaller sizes, and thus none would be systemically important.

Not impossible, *less capital efficiency*. Higher compliance costs mean that your overhead is greater, which means your profits are lower. These are extremely basic, simple accounting relationships. It's like asking for a ""source"" for the alphabet. 

Having a lower margin because of a high fixed cost is an incentive to grow the overall revenues to amortize the fixed cost across a greater revenue base and raise the relative profit margin.

hgb1ap0,t3_q60wb4,2021-10-12 02:24:51,science," This headline is misleading. Literally quoting from the study

>**The “stay at home” orders due to COVID-19 created difficulties for pregnant mothers** and family members during pregnancy and birth worldwide. Our study included recently pregnant and postpartum women who described their experiences during pregnancy and birth during the COVID-19 pandemic including changes to birth procedures and interactions with their family and health care providers. **They expressed a sense of loss,** their interactions with health care providers, unexpected positive experiences, and **adverse outcomes during the birth.** We found in some cases, **mothers had to advocate for care and the maternity team did not provide effective communication during the birth process.**

>**Testing positive for COVID-19 created an unsatisfactory care experience.**

##The women clearly didn't enjoy wearing the mask
>As soon as we walked in, we were given a mask. And we had to wear a mask the entire time that we were there. The only exception was when we were in our recovery room, and it was just me and [husband]. But every time a nurse would come in, we had to put the mask on. And I had to wear the mask during the C-section, which was, oh my gosh, that was a mess, honestly.

##The women didn't like being alone
>Triage says, ‘okay, we want to keep you, but by yourself.’ When they said that, I lost it. I started crying. I was so upset. It was like a slap in the face. This is my time, you know, you see those videos, and you all are telling me I have to be alone?

##The researchers themselves identified this
>Mothers noted they experienced a sense of loss about birthing alone, canceled or changes to their birthing plans, or the fear and worry from the pandemic.

Is this headline based off literally this one quote?
>Honestly no offense to any family that may be watching this. But that [no family and friends hospital policy] was the most peaceful hospital experience ... oh my god I loved it.

Arrived at the hospital after two days of labour, I was READY for the sweet sweet bliss of an epidural. I was having serious problems managing my pain and I was trying to hold my breath to knock myself out because deep breathing was just not cutting it.

I was told an epidural wasn't available due to short staffing (need two nurses present apparently) and nitrous wasn't available because of COVID. Morphine was a nope since they were sure baby was coming any minute.

Any minute turned into the five most horrible hours of my life. My son wasn't fitting through my pelvis. I know exactly what being torn in half from the inside out feels like. I was begging for death.
In order to have a c-section you need a spinal tap. So I suppose I got bumped up in priority. Got my epidural and IMMEDIATELY untensed and my baby arrived.

I must have been squeezing him in there while in my agony fugue. I wish I had my mom (a fricken nurse) present to help me through that. Only one other was allowed in and I didn't want my husband to miss the birth of his son.

However, I can see how that may not be the same for everyone especially depending on the hospital and their specific policies such as if my husband couldn’t be there at any point. 

I had the same nurses both times and they also said that most people were more relaxed and rested with the restrictions. My OB also made it clear what the policies were and to be prepared with whatever we wanted from clothing, toiletries, snacks, Roku, etc. I also had serious complications and traumatic deliveries both times so the constant non shuffle of people made my recovery much easier compared to the first time. Actually, it made the nurses’ lives easier as I even had restricted visitation for my first as I had developed HELLP Syndrome. My husband and I also have very large families that don’t necessarily understand or respect boundaries. Haha 

I sometimes regret not being able to have my then two year old there but in the end I think he would have been miserable and glad the meeting happened at home with him well rested and in a non strange/boring place.

People who are not used to voicing their opinions and advocating for themselves like it when they get to shift the responsibility on others, in this case the governments and other institutions. Delegating any real personal responsibility makes overwhelmed, anxious, and weakened people feel safe. Most people have the option to say, I don't want my extended family present at the birth but don't want to encounter the strain it may put on their relationships if people aren't seeing eye to eye, so they feel relief that they can just blame it on covid restrictions as opposed to facing their family. It's a cop out. 

These restrictions could gave ruined my pregnancy if I let them.

My story: I am American but live in a foreign country and got pregnant March and gave birth in December 2020.

My boyfriend couldn't come to most doctors visits. External midwife couldn't attend either. I needed someone because I don't speak the local language well. The hospital didn't have English speakers. 80% of the time I was uncertain about what was going on. I spent hours on Google translate, couldn't find in-person help, had to take myself places. 

Covid tests all the time, every day for my boyfriend because we weren't sure when I would go into labor, and he needed a negative test to come with me. I had to take a taxi alone at 2am because I went into labor.

I had to labor in a mask, boyfriend wasn't allowed to leave me to work and come back. I was only allowed 1 support person, so when my boyfriend left, I couldn't gave anyone else with me.

I have no family here.

I gave birth alone, and encountered an emergency situation in which both the baby and I could have died.

No, Covid restrictions absolutely did not relieve any anxiety. 

Hospital experience aside, lockdown meant all stores except grocery and pharmacy were closed. I wasn't able to buy a baby bed before I gave birth, or any maternity clothes in the 2 months leading up to birth. Restaurants and cafés were takeout only, and their bathrooms shut. I couldn't even leave my house because I couldn't relieve myself anywhere. It was ridiculous.",asdf3ghjkl,t2_6laop,0,0,reddit3

I only wanted my husband in the room when it came time to actually deliver, and the staff very efficiently got whoever else was still in the room out of there AND even cleared out all the medical staff after my kid was born and they were satisfied that no additional medical intervention was needed at that time... a standard practice there to leave mom, baby, and dad or other partner alone for an hour to bond. 

It was wonderful, but I was also quite grateful after that hour was up to be able to eat lunch. (It was grilled chicken and other tasty things that surely tasted more delicious due to how hungry I was!)

hga3oub,t1_hg985x3,2021-10-11 21:58:44,science,"Actually the study kind of specifically calls out how there was a common theme of “sense of loss” around not having community support around them, *except for during labor and delivery* (aka the birth experience). Which is interesting and counterintuitive and worth highlighting, as the title does. And the title does specify that it is during labor and delivery. 

>	Few women experienced a sense of loss because visitors, including spouses and partners, were not allowed during labor or delivery. 

Note that this quote is excerpted from the leading section on findings, subsection “sense of loss”. Thus, the context strengthens the meaning of the qualifier “few” to highlight how universal the sense of loss was, except for during the birthing process itself. 

I do agree that if someone didn’t read the title carefully, it could lead to the assumption that this positive experience of isolation would be consistent throughout the whole pregnancy and childbirth experience, but the fact that it is specifically pertaining to labor and delivery is clearly stated and you can’t cure poor reading comprehension. 

I’d be curious to hear suggestions on how to make it more clear while remaining succinct; it seems like this title might be the best you can do given the goal of providing a hook and highlighting an interesting finding while remaining accurate *and* brief. 

Edit: I can’t see the title while writing a comment; re-reading it I think you’re right that it could be called a mixed birthing experience rather than purely positive, but I also think that calls into question where a birthing experience begins and ends. To me that is basically defined and limited to labour and delivery, but perhaps other folks consider other possible adjunctive aspects of a hospital visit to give birth to be part of the birthing experience.",amboogalard,t2_13i6d6,641,0,reddit3

hgajpjc,t1_hga40tj,2021-10-12 00:09:14,science,"Gave birth to my son in April 2020. For me personally it was a benefit. I am very close with my family but I did not want them waiting in the hospital on me. My dad has always talked about how he wanted to be in the waiting room while I was in labor and secretly it always just seemed gross to me. We admittedly probably have boundary issues that I couldn’t just tell him (and other extended family members) that I didn’t want them there but Covid restrictions gave us a great excuse. Baby 2 is due in February and I’m not at all sad that visitors are still limited personally.

I’m not surprised about the findings to be honest. He was our first baby and I had no idea what to expect but the last thing i would have wanted to do was have people around me. I’m pretty private in general and I felt gross, was in pain, exhausted and honestly was half naked half the time while trying to figure out breastfeeding. Not conducive to family visits. I would have never guessed how terrible I felt until after it happened and I’m guessing a lot of that is what’s reflected here. Don’t get me wrong, babe ended up in the NICU for a few days and that was a PITA with restrictions as well as my husband not being able to leave the hospital but overall I’m grateful for how it played out.

That being said, I didn’t really read the study as being a recommendation to make that a permanent restriction. Just an observation on responses. Post-Covid I think you should be able to choose who you want in the room obviously but I hope it provides the long term benefit of making it more of a norm if you don’t want visitors and more open conversation for future moms about what that immediate postpartum period is like.",TransportationOk9575,t2_b7ql3if7,17,0,reddit3

This headline makes me think OP is deliberately misrepresenting the study to manufacture consent for stricter Covid policies. I saw one line about women being happy about the restrictive policy. The rest of the study and the researchers themselves painted the Covid policies as creating a negative experience for pregnant mothers. 

Literally quoting from the study

>**The “stay at home” orders due to COVID-19 created difficulties for pregnant mothers** and family members during pregnancy and birth worldwide. Our study included recently pregnant and postpartum women who described their experiences during pregnancy and birth during the COVID-19 pandemic including changes to birth procedures and interactions with their family and health care providers. **They expressed a sense of loss,** their interactions with health care providers, unexpected positive experiences, and **adverse outcomes during the birth.** We found in some cases, **mothers had to advocate for care and the maternity team did not provide effective communication during the birth process.**

>**Testing positive for COVID-19 created an unsatisfactory care experience.**

##The women clearly didn't enjoy wearing the mask
>As soon as we walked in, we were given a mask. And we had to wear a mask the entire time that we were there. The only exception was when we were in our recovery room, and it was just me and [husband]. But every time a nurse would come in, we had to put the mask on. And I had to wear the mask during the C-section, which was, oh my gosh, that was a mess, honestly.

##The women didn't like being alone
>Triage says, ‘okay, we want to keep you, but by yourself.’ When they said that, I lost it. I started crying. I was so upset. It was like a slap in the face. This is my time, you know, you see those videos, and you all are telling me I have to be alone?

##The researchers themselves identified this
>Mothers noted they experienced a sense of loss about birthing alone, canceled or changes to their birthing plans, or the fear and worry from the pandemic.

Is this headline based off literally this one quote?
>Honestly no offense to any family that may be watching this. But that [no family and friends hospital policy] was the most peaceful hospital experience ... oh my god I loved it.

Why is it okay that we ignore all the negative experiences being reported in this study with a headline like OP's? It seems like a desperate attempt to manufacture consent for stricter Covid policies. I'm reporting this for violation of rule 3",Halo_Dood,t2_5h4wc,6,0,reddit3

You can tell he’s a performer at heart, but he gets so scared to be around loud noises or crowds because he just hasn’t been out as much as I would like. We’ve been gradually trying to get him used to going places, but we’re still super careful because he’s so little and we’re at higher risks of complication (both vaccinated and hoping for our boosters soon).",kudomonster,t2_6se67,3,0,reddit3

hiw3274,t3_qkd3f1,2021-11-01 15:05:00,science,"I know Reddit will like this one because the conclusion affirms their priors, but the science involved really isn't very exciting. They did online surveys of top-level sales and marketing managers in S&P 500 / German Prime businesses. In particular, this claim:

>Fourth, the results reveal that wage inequality has an aggregated negative indirect effect on short-term profitability (γ11β41β54 + γ12β42β54 + γ13β43β54 = −.07, p < .05, 95% CI: \[−1.06, −.08\]). By contrast, and in accordance with H4a, wage inequality also has a positive direct impact on short-term firm profitability (γ15 = .26, p < .05). These opposing indirect and direct effects reflect an inconsistent mediation (Aguinis, Edwards, and Bradley 2017), suggesting that the firm performance benefits from wage inequality are mitigated by the simultaneously harmed customer satisfaction.

My problem here is that the evidence for each half of this assessment isn't of equal quality. The direct relationship between wage inequality and firm performance is measured robustly. The indirect relationship is based on their customer satisfaction data set. This data set is sparse (data was gathered for 106 of the 888 target firms), one-sided (they asked managers and not customers how satisfied customers are), subjective (each manager was asked to score various aspects of customer satisfaction on a 7 point scale), and affected by uncontrolled response bias (the sample of responding managers is decidedly not random). If a political scientist were to use a similar methodology in the context of election polling, they'd be given a grade of C or D by polling quality analysts.

Further, the bottom line conclusion is that high levels of wage inequality boost short-term profitability and have no statistically significant relationship with long-term profitability. So, good luck convincing any Fortune 500 CEO that they're bad.

I remember this became even more apparent with the ice bucket challenge (ALS) stuff. When the research company's funding increased by an eye watering amount.

The multiplier should be  tied to the various job functions of a position, each function has its own multiplier which gets added together, then multiply the lowest wage in the company by that number.


This way, in order to increase the pay off higher ups, the company has to increase their lowest paid workers wage.

Germany has some effective % regulation, but their culture is not the same as the ""greed is good"" mentality which has the power reigns in the USA and will never let go.

And that's the issue: since the wealthiest have helped politically support efforts to block or downplay the benefits of worker unions and pay transparency, there is no accountability at the top for excessive executive salaries.  Poor-performing CEOS come and go, cashing in their stocks, etc. and cry all the way to the bank before skipping to their next engagement.  Their worker-level employees don't have such options, are entirely at the mercy of compensation ranges deemed just-competitive enough (or not, given monopolies in some locales) to keep people working for them.

So, there is no real market-based adjustment factor here for executive pay.

One of the main things that got me is CEO compensation to company performance. Mainly because that isn’t all that surprising. Being a CEO is not a risk free job, the CEO of Enron went to prison, and Eddie Lampert is a warning story at Wharton. All things equal, if you’re offered a job as the CEO of McDonalds and the CEO of Barnes and Nobles, you’re likely going to choose McDonalds because Barnes and Nobles is a business on the decline with faltering sales. Board of Directors know this, and approve large compensation packages for their CEO accordingly. A company isn’t just the big guy up top, it’s the people and bureaucracy within it. If things are going fine with a company, then CEOs aren’t going to get massive salaries because the Board could just replace them. Similarly, often a failing company will give new CEOs stock and large bonuses to incentivize them to do well, because, if those stock rise from .1 to 2.50, they’re going to be really happy.

I wonder if customer satisfaction as it pertains to CEO salary is from the same vein. I can’t say I’ve ever bought a product caring about how much the guy up top makes.",Mainman2115,t2_9cz7swd5,-6,0,reddit4

Also, who care about how this study will be received in Political Science literature? Let the political scientist do such study first then criticize.

Chipotle could add 1 employee to every store.

Western Digital could hire almost 5000 employees with their CEO pay.

Burnout is real, and probably near and all time high because of this pandemic, so adding another frontline resource to retail stores, or being able to hire 5000 people at a tech company, could most definitely impact the employee base.

hivnyvs,t1_hivmems,2021-11-01 13:02:49,science,"well, this article adopts a marketing perspective to examine how wage inequality between top managers and their employees may have customer-related consequences (i.e., customer-directed effort, customer-directed opportunism, and customer-oriented culture) that affect customer satisfaction and firm performance. Surprisingly, marketing scholars and practitioners have largely neglected this pressing societal issue. The authors collect a cross-industry, multisource data set, including responses by top-level managers and objective data on wage inequality and firm performance from 106 business-to-business-focused firms (Study 1). In addition, they analyze multisource longitudinal panel data covering 521 firm-year observations for business-to-consumer-focused firms (Study 2). The results consistently reveal that wage inequality harms customer satisfaction. This relationship is mediated by customer-directed opportunism and customer-oriented culture but not customer-directed effort. Moreover, while wage inequality has a positive direct effect on short-term firm profitability, this effect is dampened by the negative indirect effect through customer-related consequences and customer satisfaction. Importantly, the positive direct effect of wage inequality on short-term profitability vanishes in the long run, whereas the adverse effect through customer satisfaction persists, leading to a nonsignificant total effect on long-term profitability. These findings may guide researchers, managers, shareholders, and policy makers in addressing the challenge of rising wage inequality.",Robbotlove,t2_8gl5z,27,0,reddit4

Stop drinking the kool-aid. The overwhelming majority of people would be extremely reasonable in being unhappy with the state of our workplace organization. There is zero chance that any CEO works thousands of times harder than their retail store workers, or mailroom workers, or help desk workers. CEOs should not have 15,000 sqft. mansions on PGA golf courses, while the productive workers of their companies can't afford rent on a 1 bedroom apartment without government assistance.

This shouldn't be a left vs. right thing. There are plenty of poor and working class conservatives. This is a class issue, not a political one. If you can cut a CEO's compensation in half, and then use that money to double the pay of 1000 workers at the bottom of the ladder, there is a serious problem with how people are being paid.

The US has the largest gap between average worker pay and CEO compensation on the planet, and it's not even close. The average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio in 1965 was 21 to 1.

The reason Japan, and Europe caught up to us after WWII is because our executives are not good at their job. They are sourced from wealthy and/or connected families and never had a real test of merit.

They are trained by fancy business schools to focus on the quarterly statements so short term for their investors they can be useful. Long term they hoover up resources for themselves, cut costs to the bone so employees have no incentives to do good work, and gradually lose competitiveness with the rest of the world.

The left's main confusion is that they think all CEOs run fortune 500 companies. Those are the worst ones, the companies that use their market power and lobbying to get success rather reinvesting in themselves (R&D, etc.) or actually bothering to compete instead of buying business from a politician.

Some startup CEOs make about as much as their highest paid tech employees on an average basis. When they exit that might change.

A large part of the rise in CEO compensation in the US economy is explained without assuming managerial entrenchment, mishandling of options, or theft. 

* The marginal impact of a CEO's talent is assumed to increase with the value of the assets under his control. Under very general assumptions, using results from extreme value theory, the model determines the level of CEO pay across firms and over time, and the pay-sensitivity relations. 
 * The model predicts the cross-sectional Cobb-Douglas relation between pay and firm size. It also predicts that the level of CEO compensation should increase one for one with the average market capitalization of large firms in the economy. 

**Therefore, the five-fold increase of CEO pay between 1980 and 2000 can be fully attributed to the increase in market capitalization of large US companies.**

The Walmart Effect is a term used to refer to the economic impact felt by local businesses when a large company like Walmart opens a location in the area. The Walmart Effect usually manifests itself by forcing smaller retail firms out of business and reducing wages for competitors' employees.

The Walmart Effect also curbs inflation and help to keep employee productivity at an optimum level. The chain of stores can also save consumers billions of dollars


As consumers increase demand for Walmart, and all big box stores on low price shopping, their sales and staffing increases allowing CEOs they hire to have a higher Salary

______
Your average McD's Location is making $80,000 in profits, Depending on the quality of the location making $2.7 Million in Revenue. You have 35 workers spliting up 20% of Sales with the GM making $50,000

If I buy a new location My sales double but so does the employee count.  Plus now I need to promote a GM to CEO over the 2 locations earning more than the GM...$60,000 ?

* $60,000 divided by 70 employees 

If I buy double locations again, My sales double but so does the employee count.  Plus now I need to a CEO over 4 locations that a GM may not be able to handle.  earning more than the GM...$120,000 Salary

* $120,000 divided by 140 employees

If I buy double locations again, My sales double but so does the employee count.  Plus now I need to a CEO over 8 locations that the last CEO may not be able to handle.  earning more than the CEO for more work...$240,000 Salary

* $240,000 divided by 280 employees

If I buy double locations again, My sales double but so does the employee count.  Plus now I need to a CEO over 16 locations that the last CEO may not be able to handle.  earning more than the CEO for more work...$480,000 Salary

* $480,000 divided by 560 employees

I've had one Top Leader who is paid $857 per employee.  Should the Line cook get a pay raise because the Company grew?  As we grow we need a better, generally more expensive Leader due to the changing management required.  What if I hired back the GM as CEO at $80,000 and gave all the employees  $800 raises?  Does the GM know how to manage 560 people?  Will I lose the company due to mismanagement.  Ice Town costs Ice Clown his town crown

I actually did some skimming in one of the articles cited ( the Moran ‘18 study) and from my understanding, any talk of regulation is widely premature. They effectively had a sample size of under 200 people, showed extreme comparisons (3:1 CEO salary to worker salary ratio vs 600:1) in which pay disparity wasn’t the only variable, and they also showed only a 2.5% difference.

hiwmq8n,t1_hiw9ov7,2021-11-01 17:26:12,science,"As a follow-up to my comment below as I did some research. Boards with elected employees are not drastically better (or worse) it seems.

In 2018 the Harvard Business Review took a look at the research over what worker representation on boards did for the company. Their finding? Surprisingly little difference. Link below.[https://hbr.org/2018/09/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-worker-representation-on-boards](https://hbr.org/2018/09/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-worker-representation-on-boards)

If you are looking for 100% employee board the best recent example I could find was Toys'r'us with a 100% mirror board following the collapse with 800 stores closing and 33 000 persons fired. The idea was met with positive comment from academics such as Thomas Kochan from MIT Sloan School of Management. Time will tell how it turns out and if they can turn around the chain.

That said, they found that poor relations between labor and management lead to higher unemployment. A study covering Denmark, Sweden and Norway found that during crisis companies with employee representation on the board were better at negotiating alternative ways to reducing labor costs compared to mass firing. There however are examples the unions rejected all such options that lead to companies that would have survived with changes were going under because all alternatives were rejected. Link in article.

Don't get me wrong, I am for whatever works. I just don't see the theory, case history or my experience giving any support to 100% employee being the best. Or that employee participation is a given positive (nor negative).

Mandated worker representation on corporate boards of directors is fairly common in Europe.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker\_representation\_on\_corporate\_boards\_of\_directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors)

The CEOs pay, well bonus, being in stock options means if they can get the stock to go up in value, even for a short while, they make bank.

Meanwhile the shareholders are often pensions and mutual funds.  Granted, both want to maximize earnings but generally are interested in long term gains.  Cutting wages boosts short term profits and share value, but hurts long term profits as your best employees leave for better pay.

An incentive to care about long term stock prices, like bonuses in stock that can't be sold for 3 years instead of stock options, would change the way companies operate.

Our current system of the CEO pay being set by a group of CEOs, former CEOs, and celebrity rubber stamps doesn't work too well. Which is why we know higher CEO pay is not tied to better company performance (and may be the opposite).",Living-Complex-1368,t2_1xdbm4o1,-1,0,reddit4

They could not see that “economical” management by masters meant simply that they, the people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid less!

They were wage-earners and servants, at the mercy of exploiters whose one thought was to get as much out of them as possible; and they were taking an interest in the process, were anxious lest it should not be done thoroughly enough! Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that?

And yet there were things even worse. You would begin talking to some poor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and had never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six o’clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to take his clothes off; who had never had a week’s vacation in his life, had never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything, never hoped anything—and when you started to tell him about Socialism he would sniff and say, “I’m not interested in that—I’m an individualist!” And then he would go on to tell you that Socialism was “paternalism,” and that if it ever had its way the world would stop progressing.

It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like that; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out—for how many millions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been so stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was!

And they really thought that it was “individualism” for tens of thousands of them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and produce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him, and then let him give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run it to suit themselves, and build their own libraries—that would have been “Paternalism”!

hiwgr26,t1_hiwde8q,2021-11-01 16:44:48,science,"I'm not sure what you are trying to get at here. Some quick napkin math:

CEO Salary: $10 million

CEO Stock package: Estimated $30 million

If you cut that $10 million dollar salary in half, even without touching the stock options, you could employ another 50 people with compensation packages totaling $100k (let's say $70k salary and $30k in benefits/retirement). If you spread those stocks out over the employee base, you could give $1000 of stock to 3000 people.

Who needs that $1000 investment more? The guy with a yacht and three houses, or the average family living in a 2BR apartment trying to save up for their kids' college fund? The guy with the $100k country club membership, or the people trying to make a down payment on their starter home? The guy who could retire tomorrow with more money than 99.99% of people will see in their lifetime, or the people worried they'll die before they have sufficient savings to retire?

What reason does the average worker have to be invested in the success of the business they work for, if all of the profits go to shareholders and people way up the management ladder from them?

Bonuses in general end up being perverse in the way they re-align incentives, and often aren't particularly good motivators for most people (as they focus on the bonus rather than all components of their duties to try to maximize it.) Also bonus expectation inflation is really high, and the way many bonuses work, they typically are not directly related to any one thing you do, and aren't timely enough to really do what they are supposed to do. So if for whatever reason bonuses go down, but you felt you exceeded prior periods marks, it has a huge effect on your happiness - even if you get something similar. 

That all said, that isn't all companies, and it can even be different by position within a company - sometimes for good reason (outside sales being very different than remote IT support - or whatever), but most people prefer predictable pay schedules and more visibility into how that is made up, rather than discretionary and opaque bonus structures.",gcbeehler5,t2_p8ekb,1,0,reddit4

If laying people off negatively impacted the companies growth and long term profitability, they’d sell the stock, and the price would go down.

The fact of the matter is headcount and expense reductions are sometimes the best moves for a company. Other times massive hiring sprees are the best moves for a company. When the strategic vision makes sense, companies are rewarded for both choices.

If you want to live in a world where companies don’t control their headcount and can’t lay off unproductive or unneeded employees, you’re free to move France.

hiwm6xe,t1_hiwagw5,2021-11-01 17:22:31,science,"You end up with a scenario where fast food and ""liveable wages"" can only coincide with some mix of:

1. Low CoL area (read: low rent on the building - a $4M building with an 8% cap rate means about $40,000/month in rent on just the building - and it's probably double or triple that in NY or SF - hard to pay workers when EVERYTHING goes to rent) and/or small buildings with minimal parking lots (possibly paid parking lots). This also usually means cheaper employee rent as well.
2. Heavy automation (think 90% of people losing their jobs outright)
3. Prices are higher and/or quality/quantity is reduced

&#x200B;

2 and 3 can certainly happen on their own though and automation is inevitable

A lot of what's hurting the masses is invariably high housing prices. There's a lot of laws mucking things up and holding back development and there needs to be high level reform to limit NIMBY based local regulations that halt development. Imagine a $1500 apartment coming down to $600 in price (the equivalent of getting around $7.50 more per hour at a 30ish hour a week job - or $3.75 if you split the rent 2 ways).

That last bit isn't McDonald's fault and the regulatory environment with respect to building development hurts them too. Blaming McDonald's today for what politicians (and voters) did and didn't do 20 years ago is disingenuous. If you're gathering a crowd and getting pitch forks... find the right target.

Their internal metrics therefore were all about establishing new locations because that resulted in faster 'growth' on their books than fewer higher performing locations.

Locations going belly up was fine for them, as long as there was someone willing to take it back over and pay the fee (and probably a shop fit on the way through).

They don't need to increase prices again, because they're already high for what you're getting. It's McDonald's, not a sit down bistro.

Some places appear to have healthy margins (McDonald's appears to be around 20% overall, though some places lose money and some places make more). Other places are skating on thin ice (I saw a 0.3% operating margin for Wendys)

If a restaurant has a 0.3% margin and you're requesting 5% margin for wages, the outcome is likely a 3-10% price increase, hours slashed and MAYBE bankruptcy depending on how much demand is impacted.

Raising wages by around $1/hour would cut the profitability to around $30k. I wonder how many hours per week each franchise owner works. Would you consider $10-20/hour an appropriate overall wage for a franchise owner that put their life savings on the line and would likely end up FURTHER ahead without any work just putting money into an index fund?

This is a moral judgment that I find HIGHLY questionable and which could hurt A LOT of people. 

If businesses are shut down en-masse you'd end up with something like 30 million people whose only livelihood becomes welfare. This would be a humanitarian crisis. What's everyone supposed to do, try to rapidly develop skills and become a freelancer?

Just because a job pays at a level that makes you feel ""icky"" doesn't mean that people who struggle to get anything better deserve to be homeless.

The two principle root causes of people stuck in dead end jobs while there simultaneously are a GLUT of high paying jobs that are HARD to fill is hiring dysfunction (not EVERYONE needs a college degree, EUGH) coupled with dysfunctional cultures that hold people from growing and developing (read: everyone should be raised with an expectation that they need to spend 100+ hours per year developing new skills, doing interview/resume prep and researching newer and better things to do - there's time, the average adult watches over 4 hours of TV a day).

Education, skills training (including interviewing, career advancement, soft skills, etc) and job placement matter a lot more than making it illegal to NOT pay someone to stock shelves a few dollars an hour more (instead of 10x more to do OTHER things).

Not every job is worth a high wage. Making it illegal for large swathes of people to be employed (most people have a bunch of potential to unlock, some don't) creates an underground black market and can have deleterious, life altering results.

It's easy to say ""I'm a good person, I want others to do what I say"" when you have 0 skin in the game and don't have to pay restitution if you create a permanent underclass of people who are essentially stuck in a poverty trap where they cannot attain ANY employment.

I will admit, my bias is that I STRONGLY fear being unemployed myself (despite having had a job since 16 with basically 0 breaks).

And I want to emphasize, I LIVED the life of ""cruddy deadend job"" for 6 years. I would NOT have been able to pay for college without that ""icky"" job that you seem to think shouldn't exist.

Patients are individuals, and in my case I came to realize I had Aspergers which generated my anxiety. Today I’m strong and calm in the face of adversity and my Rx costs $1 per month. I prefer diazepam because it has multiple active metabolites and a gradual diminution of effects. Contrast that with alprazolam and others that are deactivated and excreted immediately after CYP450 hydroxylation and glycosylation—within 8 hours it’s gone and the Px experiences intense rebound and withdrawals. Physicians trained after the mid 1980’s have made alprazolam the first line therapy, but aren’t aware of the potential advantages (or disadvantages in the elderly) favoring longer-acting homologs  available among the wide-range of benzodiazepines.  Short-acting benzodiazepines have targeted uses, but long term therapy with longer-acting homologs (e.g. diazepam, clonazepam) might have a beneficial benefit/risk profile where chronic anxiety requires long term therapy.",QiYiXue,t2_btnaae4gw,4,0,reddit1

jqys8dk,t1_jqxgruj,2023-07-07 01:00:22,science,"The study simply reports descriptive percentages of responses without running any real inferential analyses, or, most importantly, controlling for any confounding factors. There’s not real way to tell whether “continuing” symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal are actually related to benzodiazepine use at all, or whether they might instead be a product of a psychological or physical comorbidity. This could potentially be accounted for statistically, but alas, it isn’t. The “correlation doesn’t equal causation” mantra applies heavily here. 

Secondly, there is likely to be marked bias in the sample based on recruitment methods. Participants were recruited off benzo websites and Facebook groups (it says so right in the methods — no idea how you’ve missed this tbh). By doing so you’re recruiting people who inherently believe they have ongoing issues with benzodiazepines, and are more likely to give you responses that paint benzos in a negative light. Their responses will not be reflective of the broader population of individuals who have used benzos and aren’t generalisable, because you’re most likely selecting from the extreme end of the pool. As mentioned above, they authors also done absolutely nothing to try and account for this bias statistically. In an ideal world you would recruit people from medical consults, and/or conduct a prospective study that recruits people before they taper off. 

Nocebo and selection bias were both raised as issues in their limitations — albeit ridiculously fleetingly. From my perspective, they are big enough issues that they should have killed the study entirely. My caution is to not put too much reliance in peer review to filter out bad science. I’ve seen plenty of dicey stuff get through.

Sleep disorders also make someone more likely to develop PTSD or serious mental illness after trauma because the body cannot get the rest it physically needs in order to psychologically heal.

1.) No doubt McDonald’s can contribute to health issues, but what becomes murky is whether or not it is the causational factor in every single issue that has been reported by participants, and to what degree. So to say “I have had less energy”, and pin that on McDonald’s — that’s not acceptable. How many other factors can cause this? How is a participant to know that the factor of interest is indeed causative without controlling for broader diet, hours slept, level of physical activity, etc.

2.) Be very careful when assuming that a concentration of a phenomenon is indicative of broader severity. There are plenty of instances of collective panic/delusion/nocebo over issues that arguably don’t exist, or exist in way fewer cases than actually present.

h96tpzq,t3_p5in8w,2021-08-16 18:33:21,science,"Questions:  

* The phrase, ""Allies to women at their workplaces..."" means what?  I personally view myself as an ally to everyone at my workplace.  And I view anyone at my workplace who is not similarly an ally to everyone in my workplace as dysfunctional. Did I miss a memo about workplace conflict as being a good thing?
* The phrase, ""higher levels of personal growth""  means what?  Exactly what kind of personal growth are we talking about?  Greater skills in the workplace? Greater knowledge of culture and society?  I hope this isn't about just weighing more, because I want personal shrinkage in that sense for myself.
* The phrase ""better husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons"" seems oddly phrased.  The use of the terms ""workplace sexism"", ""misogynist humor,"" ""microaggressions"", ""everyday sexism"", ""allies"", ""inclusion"", ""unique experiences"",  etc.  created a certain set of expectations of the perspectives of the Authors.  I'd expect less cis-normative language, i.e. better spouses, parents, siblings, and children.

If you read their caveats, it derails any conclusion they're making from the study to it being a soapbox. 

>For example, 37% of women whose male colleagues saw themselves as strong allies disagreed with that assessment. And just over half of the men who were perceived as strong allies by women didn’t see themselves that way.

Okay thats concerning

>Yet, men benefited from seeing themselves as allies whether or not their female colleagues agreed. And importantly, women gained from perceiving their male colleagues as allies, even when the latter didn’t view themselves that way.

From this, it doesn't show anything about helping women make men better. All it really says is that if the individual feels confident they personally benefit. Being ""allied to a woman"" or feeling they have an ""ally"" seems almost irrelevant from this.

h990bmu,t1_h98tr32,2021-08-17 04:14:04,science,"I don't necessarily mean to turn this discussion to a debate abut Critical Theory, but I actually think you're mistaken about one of the main tenants of CT.

>CRT theorists have redefined so many concepts that discussions become an exercise in futility! Starting with ""critical"" as in ""critical theory"" or ""critical race theory"". It doesn't mean critical as in ""critical thinking.""

Critical in 'critical theory' absolutely has the same meaning as in 'critical thinking', that is, as a critique. 'Critical thinking' is actually the phrase that has moved farther from its original meaning, now being considered to mean basically the same thing as 'logical' or analytical. But that is not inherently what 'critical' means.

>No, they mean ""critical"" as in ""question the idea that “objectivity” is desirable, or even possible. ""

This is the part that I believe you are mistaken about. Critical theory does not necessarily reject objective reality. What it rejects is the idea that any person in particular can judge objective reality. In other words, objective reality may exist, but 'objectivity' probably doesn't. Critical theory sets up a structure through which theorists essentially hypothesis test certain assumptions by evaluating their implications. As backwards as it sounds to start with an assumption and evaluate the implications, it makes sense if you can be convinced that all facts could be assumptions.

""Under several aspects, what Critical Theory wants to reject in traditional theory is precisely this “picture theory” of language and knowledge as that defined by “the first” Wittgenstein in his Tractatus. According to such a view, later abandoned by “the second” Wittgenstein, the logical form of propositions consists in showing a possible fact and in saying whether this is true or false. For example, the proposition “it rains today” shows both the possibility of the fact that “it rains today” and it affirms that it is the case that “it rains today.” In order to check whether something is or is not the case, one must verify empirically whether the stated fact occurs or not. This implies that the condition of truth and falsehood presupposes an objective structure of the world.

""Horkheimer and his followers rejected the notion of objectivity in knowledge by pointing, among other things, to the fact that the object of knowledge is itself embedded into a historical and social process: “The facts which our senses present to us are socially preformed in two ways: through the historical character of the object perceived and through the historical character of the perceiving organ” (Horkheimer \[1937\] in Ingram and Simon-Ingram 1992, p. 242).

Yes ""Critical"" means to criticise, to critique.  But Critical Thinking has always meant more or less the same thing, i.e.

>... educators typically understand critical thinking to have at least three features.  
It is done for the purpose of making up one’s mind about what to believe or do.  
The person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards of adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.  
The thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold level.  
One could sum up the core concept that involves these three features by saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking. This core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical thinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples, their exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding jumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how strong the evidence, **reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or religious perspective**, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a question.

The inversion asserted by CRT relies on axioms that are not questioned, i.e. the nature of power to create oppressors and oppressed, and the assertion that knowledge is not universally available to people, per your discussion.

In particular you pointed to some references I have not yet read as I have just begun my journey down this particular rabbit hole.  More interesting is that I can find very few sources that really dissect CRT the way one might find for various theories in STEM domains.  What I have read from actual CRT theorists  is quite well represented in your own discussion, i.e. theories about the limits others face in even being qualified to do typical critical analysis on CRT.

Two things you said:

>As backwards as it sounds to start with an assumption and evaluate the implications, it makes sense if you can be convinced that all facts could be assumptions.

And

>Critical Theory aims thus to abandon naïve conceptions of knowledge-impartiality. Since intellectuals themselves are not disembodied entities observing from a God’s viewpoint, knowledge can be obtained only from a societal embedded perspective of interdependent individuals.

In contrast, the general understanding of Critical Analysis is pretty universally understood.  The following is representative of many, many references (generally found on sites providing educational or workplace skills) :

>Critical analysis is the detailed examination and evaluation of another person's ideas or work.   
>  
>https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-write-a-critical-analysis

The subjective element of a critical analysis is generally acknowledged, but the idea that one *cannot do critical analysis* of certain works because they do not have a qualified ""societal embedded perspective"" is quite the divergence. 

So in the end, I am not quite sure why my description, *""critical"" as in ""question the idea that “objectivity” is desirable, or even possible* is not an accurate observation.  One might quibble a bit, but it is hard to say an assertion that ""knowledge can be obtained only from <a particular group>"" isn't a rejection of objectivity.  

I got the phrase, via James Lindsay's analysis, where he quotes 

>One of the key contributions of critical theorists concerns the production of knowledge. Given that the transmission of knowledge is an integral activity in schools, critical scholars in the field of education have been especially concerned with how knowledge is produced. These scholars argue that a key element of social injustice involves the claim that particular knowledge is objective, neutral, and universal. **An approach based on critical theory calls into question the idea that objectivity is desirable or even possible.** The term used to describe this way of thinking about knowledge is that knowledge is socially constructed. When we refer to knowledge as socially constructed we mean that knowledge is reflective of the values and interests of those who produce it.

Yep, and that's exactly what I said. From Wikipedia:

&#x200B;

>In the term critical thinking, the word critical, (Grk. κριτικός = kritikos = ""critic"") derives from the word critic and implies a critique; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means ""of judging"", ""of judgement"", ""for judging"", and of being ""able to discern"".The intellectual roots of critical thinking are as ancient as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the teaching practice and vision of Socrates. 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to knowledge.

What I said was that the term ""critical thinking"" as we know it has shifted in meaning, farther away from the concept of 'critique'.

The comment I was replying to claimed that the use of the term 'Critical' in 'Critical Theory' is a concept that was redefined by CRT theorists because it doesn't mean the same thing as it does in 'Critical Thinking'. When in reality, the 'Critical' Theory is closer to the original meaning of 'Critical' compared to 'Critical' Thinking.",Thisismethisisalsome,t2_ygaq6,1,0,reddit2

The study, published last month in Policing: An International Journal, also found that COVID-19 accounted for 82% of deaths among Black members of law enforcement and 77% of deaths in Latinx officers, far higher than the 48% of deaths among white police officers.

These figures align with CDC data finding that race and ethnicity are risk markers for higher COVID-19 death rates, along with socioeconomic status, access to health care and exposure to the virus related to one’s occupation.

While the study looked specifically at COVID-19 deaths among members of law enforcement in 2020, there are important lessons for police and other first responder organizations going forward, said John Violanti, PhD, the study’s first author and research professor of epidemiology and environmental health in UB’s School of Public Health and Health Professions.

It’s the first study to examine law enforcement deaths from COVID-19 on a national level, demonstrating the widespread risk from COVID that officers face in their work.

Moreover, Violanti says, COVID has proven to be another source of stress for an occupational group that already faces numerous stressors that affect job performance and overall health. (Gunshots, automobile crashes, and physical stress were among the leading causes of death among law enforcement other than COVID-19.)

“The study’s finding that the majority of law enforcement deaths in 2020 were from COVID-19 reveals the added danger that law enforcement face during this pandemic,” added Violanti, a retired New York State Trooper and expert in police stress.

“Law enforcement were continuously exposed to the disease and were mandated to assist others in prevention and cure. The study should prompt police and other organizations to make informed decisions about preparation for any future disease outbreaks,” he said.

Assuming that non-white officers are more likely to service non-white communities, then we seem to have a logical explanation for the research’s findings.

My personal gripe is that these studies seem to shy from taking the findings to the logical conclusion. It should be obvious to those who consider the disparity in the context of herd threshold theory, selective bias, and endemic Covid.

In Scandinavia there’s a lot of vitamin D deficiencies amongst immigrants due to our long and dark winters.

And there also seems to be genetic factors in play.

It’s undeniable that communities, that have lower median economic power, would also have lower standards of living, that result in increased susceptibility to disease. It’s complicated, and I think that the phrase “can’t afford to get sick” is appropriate here.

That baseline isn’t going to get better without addressing the ability to afford better food, better healthcare, increased work/income efficiency, etc etc. Cutting back on avocado toast isn’t going to improve the outlook for millennials, right? As of 2020, with no immediately actionable solution, we may as well categorize lower income communities as “least able to afford sickness”. For various reasons, lower income is correlated to minorities, which is another can of worms.

I think that you have a good point in arguing for improving the baseline, but it’s just not realistic to make significant progress within say… a generation. Historically, we’re looking at a scale of multiple generations to overcome the inertia. It’s a worthy cause for sure. My spawns’ spawn(s) may benefit.

Within the context of Alpha wave, however, our response was to have the least able bear the brunt of the virus. Alpha didn’t recede because suburbanites worked from home. Alpha receded because of a phenomenon coined herd immunity threshold. Alpha’s R naught dipped, below 1, as each area’s essential workers were infected. They were essential for the reason that work-from-home people still needed logistical support.

Turns out oximeters don't work as well for us so many poc didn't get medical support until it was too late

Another example. We only recently (7-8 years ago) started funding gender specific research in heart disease symptoms in Denmark. Turns out that women (in some cases) have very different symptoms than men when it comes to underlying heart conditions, which resulted in exces mortality amongst women due the “classical” male derived symptoms doing a poor job at catching the symptoms early on.

We need to keep an open mind and focus on science. Being a pale ass Scandinavian, I know it’s not “if” but “when” I will catch some sort of skin cancer.

Another related thought would be the narrow spectrum of our modern diet. There is some necessity, of course, in feeding 320 million people. The end result is, nevertheless, high volume production of a narrow selection and an emphasis on heavily processed convenience food. I recall that there have been some studies on the nutritional value of modern foods versus that from previous generations.

ibgk9gp,t1_ibgi84h,2022-06-07 06:23:21,science,">The first records of the term Latinx appear in the 21st century,[21] but there is no certainty as to its first occurrence.[22] According to Google Trends, it was first seen online in 2004,[10][23][24] and first appeared in academic literature around 2013 ""in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language.""[22][25] Contrarily, it has been claimed that usage of the term ""started in online chat rooms and listservs in the 1990s"" and that its first appearance in academic literature was in the Fall 2004 volume of the journal Feministas Unidas.[26][27] In the U.S. it was first used in activist and LGBT circles as a way to expand on earlier attempts at gender-inclusive forms of the grammatically masculine Latino, such as Latino/a and Latin@.[23] Between 2004 and 2014, Latinx did not attain broad usage or attention.[10]

>Use of x to expand language can be traced to the word Chicano, which had an x added to the front of the word, making it Xicano. Scholars have identified this shift as part of the movement to empower people of Mexican origin in the U.S. and also as a means of emphasizing that the origins of the letter X and term Chicano are linked to the Indigenous Nahuatl language.[22][28] The x has also been added to the end of the term Chicano, making it Chicanx. An example of this occurred at Columbia University where students changed their student group name from ""Chicano Caucus"" to ""Chicanx Caucus"". Later Columbia University changed the name of Latino Heritage Month to Latinx Hispanic Heritage Month.[22] Salinas and Lozano (2017) state that the term is influenced by Mexican indigenous communities that have a third gender role, such as Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca (see also: Gender system § Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico).[29] The term often refers specifically to LGBT people or to young people. Brian Latimer, a producer at MSNBC who identifies as nonbinary, says that the application of the term ""shows a generational divide in the Hispanic community"".[10]: 60  In 2016, a student newspaper described the term as ""[having] been sweeping across college campuses in the [United States]"".[30] It received wider use after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting.[31]

All we knew was there was this new deadly disease, there was a lack of PPE, and the government was obviously making policy decisions in regards to provider safety based on equipment availability as opposed to science. It certainly didn't help watching politicians on the news telling the American public that we all had adequate supplies, while going to work in an environment clearly lacking of those supplies. Many hospital administrations across the country were pressuring physicians to basically stand in line or face repercussions. It has become abundantly clear that we are expendable assets. 

Patients are upset at the new protocols, such as having to wear masks and limiting visitors. Patients scream at me daily over these things. To add salt to the wound, as patient satisfaction scores are starting to fall, administrations are blaming the physicians despite it all being clearly related to all these COVID protocols and things beyond our control.

There are so many other added stressors. Working all day in painfully uncomfortable PPE. Trying to keep up with new treatment algorithms which seem to change hourly. Fear of bringing home a potentially deadly disease to our families. Isolation. I haven't seen my aging parents in 6 months, as my father is severely immunocompromised and I cannot risk exposing him to potential illness. Even as restrictions are being lifted, friends/neighbors avoid us as we are seen as higher risk. 

I work in an area that has seen its share of COVID, but by no means could compare to some of the hot spots like NYC. I couldn't imagine how bad it is for those guys. Still, this has been enough for me that I am seriously considering a career change.

But hundreds of young Chinese doctors in a new study still experienced a sharp drop in mood, a  rise in depression and anxiety symptoms, and a doubling of their fear of workplace violence, in just the first month of the coronavirus pandemic.

The new findings, published in JAMA Network Open by an American and Chinese team, show in stark terms the potential mental toll of being a frontline healthcare worker in the time of COVID-19. 

The rise in symptoms among 385 first-year medical residents in Shanghai contrasts with data from members of the previous year’s crop of residents who took part in the same study from 2018 to 2019. 

Where this year’s class saw sharp change across most measures of mental health and workplace violence during the first half of the training year, last year’s class had stable scores at the same point in their training. Other research in Chinese and American residents has shown that the strain of first-year medical training is linked to a sharp rise in depressive symptoms over pre-residency scores.

My hospital has an excellent ED, but the nurses and residents and attendings just had a dead look in their eyes. We had to resort to some very creative solutions to equipment shortages that we never expected to happen. People were going around with SCUBA goggles, there were partially used women trays all over the ground because there wasn’t time to clean up, we were borrowing bits From this tray to use on that bed and taking things from that machine to use on this patient. 

The overhead system was going off every 4-7 minutes “anesthesia stat for intubation to 6 bravo”. It was like the background soundtrack in a horror/thriller video game. 

I had a patient on labor and delivery who was crashing because of covid induced diabetic keto acidosis and so we needed a central line and thought she was going to need to be ventilated, called for ICU: no doctors available, called ED: no doctors available, surgery: nobody available, internal medicine, nothing, and it turned out that there were no more ventilators open for us that day (thank God her breathing didn’t crap out). I, a freaking obgyn resident, had to place a central line in the patient’s neck. And the fetus died from the high blood sugars before we could treat her fully. 

Took over 4 hours before X-ray was available to check placement and evaluate the lungs. X-ray guy was swearing at me and on the verge of tears, “they keep dying, on every floor, why do you guys need x rays when we know they’re dying”. God bless the dude, he was upset and essentially alone in the building and of V the short time he was there, his pager never stopped going off. 

Things were so bad and stretched that the department chairpersons were actually transporting patients from floor to floor because they were nearly all too unstable to go with just a nurse. It was like, “give me some ephedrine and epinephrine to keep in my pocket in case they start to code in the elevator”

All this was done while scrapping together whatever PPE we cold find out have donated to us. Taping blue chucks to my legs because we didn’t gave any surgical boots. 

I had a daughter in February, first child, and I started making little video diaries for her, because we kept seeing all this death and seeing our colleagues getting sick. We didn’t, and still don’t, know if we’ll get it. I want my little girl to know her dad’s voice, and know kinda where she came from.

I joined about 3 weeks into that 6 weeks, two months ago. Each day with increasing volumes, the lab buying more BSC, instruments that cost a half mil each, training new people every other day, validating machines, troubleshooting issues as they arise, it’s all so exhausting. 

There were many times I went home crying feeling useless  seeing people push back against testing, safety protocols as I watch the % positive rise, and cumulative amount of people infected rise. Thank god my therapist continued care through the pandemic or I wouldn’t have been able to do it. It was really hard for the last two months doing everything I can to get people the answers they needed and having a very vocal part of the public said what I was doing is pointless and to let people just get infected and heard immunity. (Sweden tried that. Their fatality rate is like twice that if the US. I’m livid. They just let their elderly and compromised die. I’m so glad my grandparents were safe)

I work at an ""outpatient"" clinic that's located IN a hospital (confusing, I know) for children with special healthcare needs. Lots of our kids have trachs/vents or conditions that put them at a high mortality risk if they were to contract the virus, so we've had to be incredibly diligent. At that same time, my dad has cancer, so he's at risk as well. Which means I have an obligation to both my patients and my family to not get sick, as I could kill people if I passed it to them unknowingly. So since quarantine started, I haven't been able to see any of my family or friends. My girlfriend is a nurse too, so we've hardly seen eachother either because we're both so scared of passing it on to eachother - and in turn, to our patients.

The toll it takes at work is pretty obvious, but the toll it takes outside of work isn't considered as much - yet is equally strenuous. Please send your love and support to any healthcare workers in your lives, they probably need it more than you could imagine.",danthemandoris,t2_gm1y1,1,0,reddit4

We see severe traumas and strokes and heart attacks all the time, and while those things can be stressful in their own right, at least we don’t have to worry about those things following us home and spreading through our community.

Now, I keep hearing people say “When coronavirus is over I’m gonna do this or that” but I’m not sure people realize that it won’t just be over, all of a sudden.

Would point out that it added to the frustration that patients were lying to us here in the beginning about coming back from travel or being in contact with potential Covid patients. Because of that some of our staff had to self-quarantine (luckily no one got infected so far) which put even more of a strain on the ones who remained.

And yes, it was crazy (and confusing) how quickly guidelines for tests, PPE and whatnot changed in the beginning. We had minimum 10 emails a day from different sources saying different things (i.e the hospital, the gouvernement, our federation, some association and so forth). Our hospital had to make a special commitee to keep up).

fta0uzb,t1_ft9hkan,2020-06-07 16:02:14,science,"I'm also an ER physician (resident). I echo everything you said. Residency hasn't been so bad, but throwing in COVID has just caused so much uncertainty (especially early on) and what ifs. Obviously in EM, we thrive in the unknown, but a chest pain or abd pain come in and we know what to do. This was just so new and I didn't even feel like I could fall back on my training because I am not far enough along.

One of the hardest things for me has been watching people die alone. There's no family at bedside. If the patient is lucky, a family member is sitting outside the closed doors watching their loved die instead of holding their hand and comforting them. We aren't checking in on these patients as often as we would have been prior. I remember a COVID patient coming in, agonal breathing, DNR, and I remember the mood of all of us was annoyance about the situation. It wasn't fair to him, but we're all on emotional edge. I feel like such a terrible person half the time because I don't feel like I'm being as compassionate with these patients as I usually am.

As a resident, my pay and work hours aren't affected, but seeing the admin and higher ups freaking out about numbers and revenue hasn't helped. Maybe I picked the wrong specialty. Maybe I won't see the salary I was promised. Maybe I won't be able to pay off all my loans. Maybe EM is expendable. 

Then it became normal to have 1-2 covid patients a shift. Some die in the ED. Some go upstairs. Mostly business as usual, but everyone is definitely more anxious and annoyed than before. I've definitely been more depressed and stress eating more than before. I'm very introverted, but even the toll on not being able to be social has gotten to me. 

Patients have mostly been okay. They're annoyed about no visitor policies and having to wear masks, but they're thankful we're there (we're the only trauma hospital in a large catchment area).

My N-95 is a little over a month old at this point, and I always have a small moment of panic when I put it on to run into a code. When COVID first hit, our census plummeted but our acuity skyrocketed. We were having 2-3 resuscitations per shift, and we were intubating in all 4 of our negative pressure rooms. So many dying patients. The worst part was out of all of those codes (I had 15 in a two week period) we only got one of them back. 

Before COVID, I kept a mental list of everyone I performed CPR on. I tried to remember their face, their name, and their room number. It's pretty silly but I was my way of trying to make sure they weren't forgotten. Then COVID happened, and it brought with it all of those back to back CPR in progress medic calls and I am ashamed to say I cant remember all of them anymore. I can't describe the mental and emotional toll of seeing all those dead and dying patients, and seeing the faces of their family members who can't even go into the room to say a proper goodbye to their loved ones. 

I can deal with the holes I rubbed into my knuckles from all the CPR, and I can deal with sore muscles and blisters on my nose. But the mental and emotional toll was getting to be too much.

Since the start of the pandemic we have been told that there is very little PPE; we've been using our masks for a week at a time and I have to keep track of when I hand them out. They are also kept under lock and key because some employees were stealing PPE for personal usage.

Patients do not get it. We screen patients before letting them into our building and some have yelled at my employees for doing their jobs. I have lost count as to how many times I've talked to grown ass adults, and gotten yelled at myself, because I'm asking them not to yell at my employees. That they are taking their temperature and asking them to please wear a mask, not only because it's their job but because its a health precaution - and it keeps everyone safe. I'm glad that my organization finally made mandatory masking enforceable just this last Friday (freaking finally), but the number of people throwing a fit is astronomically absurd. It's unfortunate that some people still think this is ""not real"". 

My whole staff including my doctors are stressed, depressed and exhausted.  Unfortunately, my organization terminated a lot of people. Yet we are being asked to bring patient volumes back up to 100% capacity with a skeleton crew. It is simply impossible to do that when I have employees working with 2 surgeons. We are not being heard, just given the run-around that we have to ""take care of our patients because we have to serve our community"".

ft9xtl8,t1_ft9f1rz,2020-06-07 15:34:01,science,"This. Rather than calling them ""heroes"", hospitals and our broken government should have done them the justice of sourcing and manufacturing PPE. In the last few decades, hospitals have been turned into mega-conglomerate for-profit businesses, led by people with business degrees, who prepped hospitals with the bare minimum and no emergency surplus in order to squeeze more profits out. Healthcare workers used to have a lot more power to change hospital policy. This is no longer the case, and certainly did not help. 

As a student in healthcare with friends in the field, I'd like to add some insight. As you said, the lack of non-COVID patients meant a steep drop in total patients. Nurses, staff, AND doctors in non-COVID fields have received pay cuts and been laid off. In terms of doctors specifically, I know someone in GI pathology who took a 50% pay cut from their company due to the steep drop in colonoscopy biopsies. I believe pay cuts to doctors like her was necessary, as these are hard times, and we need to do our civil duty. Hopefully these pay cuts have helped a little to keep more staff members employed. Hospital CEO's and board members really should have taken the largest pay cuts. They regularly make salaries in the millions, far more than doctors or nurses.

As for N-95 masks, we had a scarce supply, and that needed to be prioritized for those directly facing covid patients. To my knowledge nurses, technicians, and doctors in COVID units all received N-95's (the fact they had to reuse for days on end is another issue....). I don't think it's right if janitors in COVID units did not also get N-95's, if that is the case, but certainly protective measures weren't reserved for physicians. In general, everyone working in COVID units were terribly unprotected. So many doctors, nurses, and technicians have died... I was recently in the ER, and the doctors and nurses had the skin on their nose rubbed raw from wearing an N-95 days on end.

I'd like to take a moment to advocate for resident physicians. Residency is when doctors graduate medical school, but still must do 3-5 years of working training before becoming an independent attending. They do the brunt of the work in hospital ER's and other departments. The average resident salary is $50,000 after 8 years of school, often on top of $200,000+ in student debt. In comparison the average ER nurse makes $75,000 after 4 years of school. Resident physicians are dying from COVID, they never had a chance to ""make doctor money"", and they are working without hazard pay and adequate PPE. When they speak out, hospitals like NYU Langone use their morality to subdue them, sending emails saying their behavior is ""not professional"". It's not fashionable to advocate for physicians, and thus resident physicians have fallen through the gap. There is no doctors union like there is a nursing union. Nurses and residents carry the brunt of the COVID responsibility. I fully believe nurses, technicians, and janitors should get better treatment and pay. I just want to take a moment for the resident doctors on the front lines of COVID.",kokoapuff,t2_b5ixn,2,0,reddit4

Non-physician, non-nurse medical staff is compensated with guilt in the United States, not financial stability. 

The dramatic financial stability difference between equally-crucial personnel standing in the same war zone, side-by-side, is absolutely something that needs to be addressed. 

Ordering delivery of food or groceries, personal laptops for remote family connections, having a home with a bedroom for every individual member of the household, the reality of health insurance quality vs cost, having a personal vehicle for use during these times - for most physicians none of these “luxuries” are a problem because they are adequately financially compensated for the risks they take.  

Non-physician, non-nurse healthcare workers are not paid well and it greatly impacts healthcare. There is what I call a “patient-consideration” or “guilt” compensation that employers force to skimp on actually compensating these people for the jobs they do. 

“You can’t stay in your position because you aren’t paid enough? Consider the patients and how much they need you”

Reality -

“I know Sarah used to do these tasks, but we haven’t found a replacement for her yet. If you could just do these tasks for now until we get someone hired... you know it’s the patients that will suffer if these things aren’t done. Think of the patients.”  
Then Tom retires.
Then joe is out with covid.  
Then Rebecca’s kids’ school closes, so Rebecca can’t go to work either.

“We have to keep holding strong for the patients! You can’t walk away from this, consider the patients and what that will mean for them.” 

Full disclosure: with or without COVID in the equation, this is the reality at ALL TIMES for hospital departments.

ft9psna,t1_ft9mewd,2020-06-07 14:14:58,science,"In medical school right now, and the best advice I can give you is to work as hard as you possibly can to build a competitive application. Apply to schools with one additional factor in mind. How they reacted to covid-19? What guidance did they give their students regarding boards? Were those decisions made to genuinely help their students or were those decisions made with administrative/business needs in mind?

I've been following various threads on medical school responses to covid-19 and some schools were phenomenal in how they handled the uncertainty. They gave guidance early, and were forgiving to their students. With social distancing, many of my classmates and I have gotten our board exam dates canceled, with the earliest rescheduling dates well into our rotations. There were schools that formally addressed this rescheduling problem months ago, and told their students they have till December to get their exams done, with the rotation prior to their exam being converted to a dedicated study period. Meanwhile, my school has yet to formally address us regarding exam cancellations when more than 50% of the class has had their exam canceled. I can't emphasize enough the levels of stress my classmates and I are feeling, knowing we may have to study for boards while on rotations during covid-19. Meanwhile, there are students who know they have till December, who know they'll get a dedicated period to study, and knew of this months ago. The differences between our mental health and theirs is day and night. 

That's the first step. Worry about what residency/specialty you want later. Focus on getting into a school that will provide you with the best support systems, because that will impact your ability to match into your preferred specialty more than just about everything else imo. Many medical schools are businesses first, and schools second.

I know this doesn't really answer your question, but I hope it provided some insight. Medicine is amazing, and it'll capture your heart and mind. It's the external factors surrounding the field that damage it. Do your best to control those factors.",rubadux,t2_8dlfj,10,0,reddit4

I visit Taipei frequently and every time I ride the metro I would think about their policy in 2003 requiring all riders to wear a mask. A key aspect of mask wearing is making sure people who are contagious are wearing a mask. This was my primary motivation for our universal masking policy as I did not trust all healthcare workers to stay home (we tend to work through illness). It was also a safer method to wear a mask for all patient encounters as it avoided repeated donning and doffing. 

In the days since our policy was placed there was a number of exposures that were reduced to moderate from high risk because our healthcare worker had a mask on. Had we insisted on universal eye protection as well it would have been low risk. I’m still working on the eye protection piece. Some institutions like UNC have recently instituted “Pandemic precautions” mandating mask wearing at all times and eye protection for all patient encounters. Back in March University of Iowa, faced with a shortage of facemasks mandates universal face shields which I think is brilliant.

When physicians are allotted only 10 minutes with each patient, not only will they get low press ganey scores, but they will also make serious mistakes! 

Let me give you some recent for instances. Physicians now dictate like auctioneers because they're coerced to produce exhaustive records so fast. I've seen major mistakes. Transcriptions have read out as mms rather than cms, and important diagnoses such as a large aortic aneurysm have been entirely missed. A physician called down a patient with a *massive* infection to have it drained. He didn't have time to go bedside. I took special precautions because I was worried about such haste and it was a good thing too because the patient had the most antibiotic resistant form of MRSA! It should have been done bedside! A physician failed to explain a very invasive procedure to a patient or get any consent she was in such haste. I did it all for her after the fact. Another time a physician was performing a simple clotting of an pseudoaneurysm caused by an angiography procedure. The good news for the patient was that his angiogram was negative, the bad news was that the vascular surgeon in his haste completely clotted his entire proximal femoral artery! Another time a surgeon prescribed a post surgical antibiotic a patient was violently allergic to. She was rushed back to the ER and almost died from anaphylactic shock.

fta7mat,t1_ft9qgk9,2020-06-07 17:02:50,science,"Well physician assistants and nurse practitioners are usually working in the same environment as the MD/DOs of their respective specialties, and from what I've seen they usually get treated worse by management than physicians are. At the ER that I worked they were often treated as disposable because of NP oversaturation in many metro areas. 

I know that despite very high patient volumes for years they (the midlevels) had to fight just to increase their hours to daily 12 hour shifts before the covid pandemic which was honestly necessary to keep the single ER doc from seeing an unsafe volume of patients. Since patient volume has dropped with covid admin actually sent the PAs and NPs home to be on unpaid call for the chance the volume in the ER gets too high for a single doc to handle.

So yes, it is cheaper to go through PA school or NP school, but you still deal with many of the same negatives in the workplace as the physicians but for less pay. Also because of the oversaturation of NPs in a lot of desirable job markets there's the constant threat of ""do what I say or we'll have a new NP here by the end of the week"" from administration. Also I would be weary saying that they can move anywhere and get hired as quickly as they graduate. That is going to heavily depend on where you are looking to get hired, what speciality you're in, and what type of program you attended. Usually those who went to brick and mortar PA or NP schools are able to get a job immediately after graduation but it might not be everything that you are looking for. I've heard it repeatedly that when looking at salary, locations and specialty you usually have to choose 2/3. Many nurses I know that have gotten their FNP through an online/for profit program have had difficulties finding nurse practitioner positions after graduating. I would recommend avoiding those types of programs because they have a bad reputation with employers and usually students are left trying to find their own preceptors for rotations.

For enjoyed physicians it is permitted, but it's not cut and dried.  There are a complex series of rules and definitions at play, mainly that of what constitutes a 'supervisor,'  as supervisors are prohibited from unionizing.  Essentially, if you can shoehorn an employed physician into that definition, then he/she can't unionize.  Also, I'm a surgeon, not a lawyer.

Regardless of the legalities, there are multiple other issues.  There is VERY little public support for physicians to unionize.  We have been successfully demonized as members of the '1%,' taking out tonsils for dollars and chopping off the wrong feet willy nilly.  Not to mention the outrage if we reduced our services, even in the slightest, for 'selfish' reasons like thing to improve our workplace conditions or God-forbid our reimbursement.

 We also tend to be a pretty independent lot.  We are also really, really busy for the most part, and unionizing takes a lot of time.  And, the way that most of us are wired (and trained) is that patients come first.  At the expense of sleep, family, fun, et cetera.",,,3,0,reddit4

fahkxld,t3_e9aoba,2019-12-11 18:12:42,science,"A peer-reviewed study published today in the scientific journal Environmental Research Letters found that emissions traced to the world’s largest fossil fuel companies are responsible for more than half of the ocean’s acidification since pre-industrial times.

Focusing on the 88 largest gas, oil and coal producers and cement manufacturers, the study calculated the amount of ocean acidification that occurred as a result of carbon released during fossil fuel extraction, production and use.



The study examined companies’ emissions during two time periods: 1880 to 2015 and 1965 to 2015. Recent research has documented that the oil and gas industry was aware of the climate risks of their products since at least the mid-1960s. Once these risks became widely known, fossil fuel companies launched a multimillion-dollar disinformation campaign to convince the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant action.

“We’ve known for several decades that burning fossil fuels is by far the largest driver of ocean acidification, but we weren’t able to track how much any one fossil fuel company contributed to the problem, and in what way,” said Rachel Licker, lead study author and senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “Scientists can now quantify how much more acidic the ocean has become as a result of each fossil fuel company’s products.”

From paragraph three:

They cited a very recent paper for that, but it's actually decades old news. A fatally catastrophic industry must be halted when it doesn't adapt to the basic Darwinian survival methods vital to life on planet Earth.

Another related issue not addressed here, is that growing population won't remain sustainable (if it ever was), and the global agencies responsible for health and security haven't been steadily forthcoming with assurances of long-term stability, occasionally warning of the expected encumbrances of coming climate crisis migration and the likely economic collapse that would spark.

faioz6s,t1_faidh0q,2019-12-12 01:12:44,science,"Because Americans want *others* to change. By that I mean, most Americans don’t want to change how they drive to improve their fuel economy and reduce emissions. They want the government to force a change that allows them to change absolutely nothing they do while emissions are reduced. 

You should look up how ridiculously awful the EPA’s fuel economy test is. It’s utterly unrealistic. CAFE restrictions mandating the use of catalytic converters back in the 70s restricted the use of much lower emission lean burn engines for decades. People are mad that Trump rolled back a lot of environmental protections. I’m as that those same people never cared to see how useless and toothless a lot of our environmental “protections” actually are. Much ado was made about Obama raising CAFE standards. Nobody seemed to have noticed that was exactly what the auto industry wanted and that the tests CAFE is based on are ridiculously useless. 

So you write an article claiming it’s all somebody else’s fault to get the average person invested in fixing the problem. Once they’re invested, they’ll push for change. Eventually, ideally, corporations won’t be the big problem anymore. If people are already invested in an ongoing solution when they discover they’re the biggest problem suddenly, they’ll be more likely to change themselves. 

The auto industry has done an excellent job convincing people that fuel economy ratings are realistic and that the way people drive is perfectly harmless. We’d massively decrease emissions by returning the speed limit to 55 mph. How many Americans do you think will support that?

Offloading responsibility is woven into America’s moral fiber. Just point out that a large part of the 2007 market crash was caused by Americans intentionally taking loans they fully intended to default on.

faj4z2b,t1_faii3fp,2019-12-12 04:23:46,science,"To get a little off topic, I worked on a project that was adding a cogeneration steam plant onto an existing oil refinery. It was a very expensive project and one of the engineers I worked with did a little study of his own to compare a nuclear power plant vs the cogen we were building. He reckoned the nuclear power plant was more expensive to build up front but the cost savings over time would pay for itself in something like 12 years (I can't remember exactly). 

One of the problems was these refineries use a lot of steam in their process which is what the boilers produced. The cogen would use the excess to generate power for the refinery and sell back to the grid. If you went to nuclear, you would need the plant located right next to (or in) the refinery so it could generate steam for the process. Oil refineries like to explosively catch on fire every once and a while so it is not the safest place to put a nuclear plant. Granted, there are probably ways to get around it that could be engineered but that was one of the hurdles he came up with. Great idea though, I would love to see it get developed some more.

If you're interested, check out the current power generation for my province. There is a lot of power generated from cogen plants in refineries, they are pretty much the only way we can actually keep up to our provincial demand. http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet.",The_Hausi,t2_6agx8,3,0,reddit1

It’s not a coincidence many trucking companies limit the speed of their semis to 65 mph. 65 mph is the point of diminishing returns from increased travel speed. After that, the decreased fuel economy eats the profits from the increased travel speed. Reduced fuel economy is literally increased emissions. 

Demand a reduced speed limit or stop acting like you actually want change. Because that’s the actual problem. People want change, they just don’t it to be themselves who change. People are worried about global warming but junk mail is legal wasting millions of pounds of paper in the process. They’re worried, but they don’t how ridiculously useless CAFE standards are. They’re worried but they continuously refuse to allow nuclear, wind, or solar power generation anywhere near them. 

If you want change, where is the demand for specific changes? All we get is this continued demand for change in the abstract.

Both of these industries knew that oil production / consumption negatively impacted the environment. And they knew as demand increased so would the negative impact. They are directly responsible for pushing a toxic good on consumers and then to make it worse they are also directly responsible for blocking / removing more environmentally friendly options, so that demand for their product would increase.

While consumers are guilty for buying / consuming the product. It should be more on the manufactures for developing / promoting a harmful product, as most consumers were unaware due to these manufactures manipulation.

>The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been attributed to the rapid release of ∼2000 × 10\^9 metric tons of carbon in the form of methane. In theory, oxidation and ocean absorption of this carbon should have lowered deep-sea pH, thereby triggering a rapid (<10,000-year) shoaling of the calcite compensation depth (CCD), followed by gradual recovery. Here we present geochemical data from five new South Atlantic deep-sea sections that constrain the timing and extent of massive sea-floor carbonate dissolution coincident with the PETM. The sections, from between 2.7 and 4.8 kilometers water depth, are marked by a prominent clay layer, the character of which indicates that the CCD shoaled rapidly (<10,000 years) by more than 2 kilometers and recovered gradually (>100,000 years). These findings indicate that a large mass of carbon (»2000 × 10\^9 metric tons of carbon) dissolved in the ocean at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and that permanent sequestration of this carbon occurred through silicate weathering feedback.

My point, though, is that if everyone got an EV we would have an issue with electricity supply and the power of renewables is not quite as good as the older models. Furthermore, there are potential power outages like we saw recently in California. Nuclear power is shunned, mostly through lack of scientific understanding and the resultant political stonewalling, but it would be a better match for the power generation we currently get from coal and hydroelectric power than solar or wind. Ultimately it still comes down to a consumption issue. If we replace all gas powered cars with EV there would be  consequences to our infrastructure and lifestyles that need to be considered. We tend to look for quick fixes and not dig too deep into the repercussions.

Take the carry out containers that are being made that turtles can eat. Well, if a billion of those containers end up in the ocean we still have a problem and that problem will be different than a sea of plastic. That doesn't mean don't choose that kind of container if you have to or don't drive an EV, but to get to the root cause of the issues we have to seriously consider how much we consume and discard. Behavior changes are required, not just advances in technology. 

Hope that makes sense. I'm not disagreeing with you. I want to add to the conversation. As a scientist that works on these issues, the solutions aren't always easy or fast.

Europe's passenger rail services cover all of Europe. And really when you're taking population density differences you're really only taking about the part of the country in the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.

>Everything’s a lot more spread out here, and public transport doesn’t work too well in suburban areas, let alone rural ones. 

Part of that is changing the US over to a land-tax instead of a property tax so you're incentivised to build higher density housing. The other part of that is building up the public transit network in cities that don't have one to encourage higher density housing around public transit stops. A third part of that is reducing the ability for local citizens to fight new housing, because apartments are always NIMBYS in areas that are already built but have high housing demands.

I'm not going to address your complaints about hobos because you're just complaining about poverty in cities, not mass transit in general. I've never seen a hobo on my local suburban bus system, because we have only one hobo and he's protesting something by being homeless. I never saw hobos on the bus system in the last place I lived either and it was because (surprise) that place didn't have hobos either, despite being more urban.

>Trains are slightly more feasible, and the US already had a passenger train system, but the issue comes down to speed. A flight from NYC to LA takes about 7 hours. A train from NYC to LA takes a whopping 67 hours, or over *two and a half days.* 

Driving between those two cities takes 41 hours according to Google. I'm not sure where you're getting your train times from but they're certainly not high speed rail. Regardless we'll look at your second point:

>Train times across Europe are tolerable as they tend to be similar to flight times in the US. Train times across the US make it unfeasible to take the train unless you have absolutely no concern for time. No one in their right mind is going to take up 5 days of round-trip travel just to get somewhere and back. 

You wouldn't take a high speed train between New York and LA. You would take one between Chicago and St. Louis, Atlanta and Dallas, or Kansas City and Indianapolis. High speed trains are perfect for intermediate distances where the airport itself takes up a significant portion of your trip time. 

I'm not, nor have I ever suggested that the United States needs a high speed rail system between it's most disparate cities. I am suggesting it needs a high speed rail system connecting *all* of it's cities and the primary traffic would be between cities that are roughly a ten hour drive apart. With the US geography, average speeds in excess of 140 MPH across the whole stretch shouldn't be unreasonable for most routes. A general rule of thumb is that with sufficiently high average speed a high speed rail trip less than four hours long is competitive with air travel.

>The answer to transportation pollution is greener cars. 

Part of the answer.

>Public transport in the US doesn’t work and probably can’t work, and that’s fine. 

It works just fine where there's been investment or the urban development demands it. The northeast corridor is Amtrak's primary profit center and they're not even running legitimate high-speed rail in any part of it.

eb1uxp8,t3_a2tyd6,2018-12-04 04:58:30,science,"I work in the motion picture and TV production business. Due to the compressed timeline of film projects, the industry's professional relationships tend to be pretty short-lived: typically 10 to 40 weeks. But they are also very intense, since crews work together under great pressure for sixty-plus hour a week, and tend to become each other's ""alternate family"". As for us ""lifers"",  through the course of our careers we often end up working alongside the same people again and again, in a flawed kind of professional karmic wheel. Your underling today may become your boss, six months or six years from now, then your underling again, the project after that. So what goes around comes around, more frequently than many other occupations.

Early on in my own career, I ended up under a lengthy series of bosses who I still, even forty years later, consider terrible managers: helpful, co-operative and even obsequious to *their own* superiors, but to those under them, they were often false, self-righteous, authoritarian, machiavellian, petty, unsatisfiable, vindictive, passive-aggressive, sullen, sarcastic, or any combination thereof. I worked under whiners, yellers, loafers, cursers, object throwers, shirkers, why-me'ers, scapegoaters and fingerpointers; you name a character flaw, I probably suffered under it at some point. 

Working under these awful people, at a time when I was still too unsure and inexperienced to stand up for myself, was often hell, and several times I considered abandoning the business altogether. But these dismal early experiences also made me promise myself that, should I ever be lucky enough to be in a position of authority, I would try very hard to be a good boss, and to treat those under me with the dignity, honesty and kindness that I, myself, rarely enjoyed at the hands of my own supervisors.

I'm sixty-four now, and after forty-three years on the studio floor, I'm winding up my career. As a hands-on Head of Department with over a hundred productions to my credit, over the years I've had maybe two hundred and fifty different individuals work under me. Occasionally I've managed a team of up to thirty-five, but usually, my crew is a core group of five or six, carefully chosen to complement each others' skills, with additional temps and trainees added as needed. And I've even been fortunate enough to mentor a dozen talented and energetic young craftspeople, who can now compete with me, head to head, for the most desirable shows and best positions.

I think it's largely because of both the number and the variety of *negative examples* that I experienced early in my career, that I've managed to (mostly) fulfil my self-promise to treat those under me as I myself would want to be treated. 

And the proof that I have done so, lies in the fact that even though I am on the verge of retirement, and can supply few additional career favours to anybody, I still get many birthday cards, texts and phone calls from many former crew members, some of whom haven't worked for me for twenty years or more.",theartfulcodger,t2_5pc01,104,0,reddit2

> A new University of Central Florida study suggests abuse and mistreatment by those at the top of an organization do not necessarily lead to abusive behavior by lower-level leaders. When offered leadership opportunities, prior victims of workplace abuse are more likely to treat their own subordinates better by learning from the bad behavior of their bosses.

Breaking the cycle of abusive supervision: How disidentification and moral identity help the trickle-down change course.

Journal of Applied Psychology, 2018; 

DOI: 10.1037/apl0000360

Abstract:

Studies show that abusive leader behaviors “trickle down” to lower organizational levels, but this research ignores that many abused supervisors do not perpetuate abuse by harming their own subordinates. Drawing on social-cognitive theory and related research, we suggest abused supervisors might defy rather than emulate their managers’ abusive behavior. Specifically, we predicted that some abused supervisors—namely, those with strong moral identities—might in effect “change course” by engaging in less abuse or demonstrating ethical leadership with their subordinates to the extent they disidentify with their abusive managers. Across 2 experiments (n = 288 and 462 working adults, respectively) and a field study (n = 500 employees and their supervisors), we show that relations between manager abuse and supervisors’ abusive and ethical behaviors were carried by supervisors’ disidentification, and that the direct and indirect effects of manager abuse were stronger for supervisors with comparatively higher moral identity levels. We discuss our findings’ implications and avenues for future research. ",mvea,t2_6hji,38,0,reddit2

The boss who hired me was let go two months into my tenure for alleged abusive behavior towards former subordinates.  He was fine to me, but had enough of a bad rep to be let go.  Second boss treated us well, but was lazy and ineffective at managing the group.  He eventually left after being forced out indirectly by higher ups.  The third boss was terrible to us.  A crony hire through and through, who was brought on to be her former manager's (now C-level exec) spy on the department.  She was likely hired to report back on our boss, but she was so inexperienced that she ended up treating us like we were the culprits of why the department had been falling apart.  Keep in mind, I had only been there 1.5 years, hardly enough time to screw the department up any more than it had been.

The store I worked at for some time was a managerial training facility and a few of them found positions in our store. They were overall good people and were good managers and seemed to care. They never lasted long and I always figured it was because they were 'too nice' and that wasn't what the company wanted. They wanted the cold Hitler-lites.

This post gave me a little perspective on that. It wouldn't be so hard to believe that many of these candidates worked for Walmart for so many years  dealing with incompetent managers that they wanted to make a difference when given the opportunity but ultimately realized that the nice manager isn't what is really wanted.

Phrase: “Everyone works just as hard, if not harder than you.” 

Context: When you have had 3 people’s workload thrust on you and the others are OBVIOUSLY and IN PLAIN SIGHT, slap dicking, talking about family guy, etc, while clients and users are screaming at you personally that they’re not being addressed quickly enough.

Translation: “I’m trying to overwork you to the point you either quit or become so broken, you’ll gladly do the work load of four people.”

Phrase: “I don’t want to hear it.” 

Context: Often when explaining a reasonable blocker or resource shortage to the boss, and why even buying one new computer or printer will alleviate the issue or pointing out a flaw in the system that’s causing a problem.

Translation: “You’ve exposed my incompetence and you’re a threat.” - even if you are doing it for their benefit...

Phrase: “It is what it is.” 

Context: Something has broken down somewhere and it needs to be addressed in the future to make sure it never happens again.

Translation: “We’ve always done it this way. If we do it better, we’ll draw attention and that’s no good for anyone, especially you. Because I will throw you under the bus.”

Phrase: “Moving forward...” 

Context: Something went awry due to managerial incompetence.

Translation: “It’s your fault, even though it’s clearly mine. If you bring it up again, I’ll throw you under the bus.”

Phrase: “We don’t do worker’s comp here, so don’t get hurt.”

Context: You have to move something heavy, often on demand and not being given the time to put on a brace or get a dolly.

Translation: “I know it’s illegal to deny your worker’s comp claim if you get hurt in the course of your job, but we will find a way to blame your extracurriculars or bad health so we don’t have to pay and hopefully be able to fire you.”

You can have zero ability to lead and can take full advantage of almost perfect job security and eventually you're in charge. The sad part is that all of the intelligent and competent military members realize how messed up the system is, that they have much better options outside of the military, and eventually they cant handle listening to ""leaders"" who only gained their positions by staying in long enough at a job you cant get fired from.

I'm glad to see evidence of this. At least part of the phenomenon is in management writing, which is not the same as reproducible data.

Maxwell notes that new managers start out wanting to protect their team. They identify more closely with their team than they do with the organizational mission. This meshes very well with the idea that subordinates of abusive bosses try to protect against that abuse. I think it would be interesting to see if varied kinds of abuse (disrespect, overwork, micromanagement, etc) have an in-kind response.

I'm really happy to see the evidence because there are also many stories of bad bosses making other bad bosses - I knew one who grew out of it.

To add some color to this: according to both what I've been taught by other managers and what I've read, managers start by protecting, then (eventually) learn to lead (set directions, force choices), then learn to challenge (help people reach for greater results). There are many different versions of that story, but that's approximately it.

This is to say that I wouldn't expect high results from these new managers and wouldn't look for a bump in productivity. That comes later. Good organizations coach their managers through this - usually by indulging their instinct to protect their team for a while, before introducing additional challenges.

eb20bmb,t3_a2tyd6,2018-12-04 06:57:13,science,"As a Supervisor and Coordinator I like to think this study is pretty solid. A few years ago I was a part time AV Technician who worked with a small, local shop. My bosses weren’t the best. There was very little communication, no training, no general interest in my own well being. They overpromised and underdelivered not only myself, but the client that they sent me to go do AV work with. 

Due to my total lack of supervision, training or interest; I let things slide on the site I was on. I became the employee I would dread to have working under me today. I got pulled into the office one day at their head shop and was let go because I wasn’t doing a good enough job. No warnings, no prior talks. No nothing. They basically dumped it all on my lap and said:

 “YOU clearly don’t have the passion to succeed in this job.” 

Looking back, I learned some very key aspects from that job, most notably their management. They taught me how to treat people and clients. They taught me that passion has nothing to do with a job. My passion and drive ran out because they promised me the world, and delivered none of it. I never saw full time like they promised. Never got the training they promised. Never got the communication I needed to succeed. 

I learned as a leader I needed to make those around me succeed. I needed to be vested in their lives and in their success. I needed to be their advocate on the job, to push to get them trained. To make them want to take responsibility and do well, not just for the company; but for all of us as a team.

My experience in corporate life, prior to my current workplace, is that bad management begets bad management: partially because subordinates don't learn good management techniques from the people above them, and partially because people tend to hire and promote people who remind them of themselves.

One bad manager in a fairly low position, like the person who is in charge of most of the entry-level new hires, can stunt a department for years, through hiring weak candidates/friends of friends, through poor training, poor leadership, poor advancement decisions.

If a good person with a bad boss manages to get promoted, then sure, that person will probably be inspired to do better. But I think there's a reason why the word ""boss"" has such a negative connotation.",omni222,t2_9xc8r,1,0,reddit2

eb2q6f1,t3_a2tyd6,2018-12-04 16:22:58,science,"I tendered my resignation yesterday, so this resonates well with me. I’ll not spill my entire life story here on reddit, but things got so bad for me over the past 6 months it began to effect me physically in the form of various symptoms. I’ve seen the doctor, so this is not a self-diagnosis and I am in a much better place after resigning. 

My current (soon to be former) profession is not a difficult or complex job, but it requires patience and a willingness to do the work. I could train almost anyone to do it, as it is not intellectually taxing but there are periods of crippling frustration/boredom. In reality, I just need people to show up to work consistently, freeing me up to accomplish my own job tasks, which are neither complex or impressive.  

Beyond that, my current superior fosters a culture of complete unaccountability. There’s a few people who get their work accomplished, but it’s never really in a satisfactory or totally professional manner. It’s always something slapped together last minute to keep things going. I can’t count how many times I’ve missed deadlines because I was busy doing someone else’s job. With the excuse that it’s “how it goes” and it’s “a part of my job to cover for other people”. Simply put, they don’t pay me enough to be on call all day and to do three people’s jobs. 

My superior isn’t a bad person; merely in over their heads, a horrible manager (never directly supervised anyone before), a terrible communicator, and incapable of making an independent decision.  They selectively enforce rules, let certain employees get away with anything, and refuse to make obvious corrections to poor decision making. Beyond that, they’re completely paralyzed by indecision and whenever a conclusion is actually reached, (we recently spent more than 5 hours discussing something that should’ve been decided in 20 minutes, the loss in productivity was exponentially greater than any poor decision) it’s almost always the wrong choice.  All decisions are discussed and are made by committee, thus there is no clear vision for the workplace. My superior is so insulated from the culture they have created, there is no incentive to change it. Their lackey is also insulated (and at the peak of their professional career let’s be honest here), so no reason to rock the boat there either. These people are holding back the company and it will never grow beyond what it is now, as long as they continue to be in positions of authority. 

That turned into a big complaint and I’ve lost my original point. Point is, I’ve learned a lot from this experience and the past 7+ years (despite not advancing professionally) were not a waste. While I may not have gained any “hard skills” like computer programming or how to install a sink; I have really learned the “soft skills” of managing and interacting with people. I’ve learned how to work with, and manage, a very wide variety of people from vastly different educational and socioeconomic backgrounds than myself. I’ve learned how to connect and work with people in an effective manner when it doesn’t seem we have much common ground at all. At this point I’ve worked with people older, younger, more educated, less educated, people with more experience, people with less; I’m a better person for it and a much better manager. Once I open my own business again or attain another supervisory role, I will not be repeating their mistakes. Of that I am certain.  

In conclusion, I’ll be reaching out to the executive officer and offering them an opportunity for an exit interview; the company doesn’t typically conduct those sorts of interviews. It’s possible they will accept my offer and will listen to what I have to say. Things might change for the people left and, seeing how I’ve got no skin left in this game, that’s worth it to me. However, I think it’s likely that I’ll be ignored and dismissed, with the issues being swept even further under the rug.  ",Appraisal-CMA,t2_14yr9z,1,0,reddit2

Brain scans of child abuse victims show different growth patterns from those who have had stable upbringings. Even things like neglect can shape a childs brain differently. 

As an adult your brain is full formed, and while still malleable you’re likely to have a set personality, moral values and mode of thinking in which to see the world. So when you see an asshole boss, you see what he does is different from everybody else, and you can see the damage it does to people he/she is in charge of and you’re likely to avoid that behaviour when its your time.

This may sound a bit silly but the Marine Corps has 14 leadership traits and 11 leadership principles that I think are a great starting ground to becoming a better leader. I learned them a little over 15 years ago and still do my best to apply them to my work life. They may not completely transfer over to the civilian world but still can make a damn fine foundation.

The 14 leadership traits go by the acronym JJ DID TIE BUCKLE.

> Justice – Being fair and consistent. Giving consideration for all sides of each decision, and having rewards and punishments based on merit. The ability to administer a system of rewards and punishments impartially and consistently.
> 
> Judgment – The ability to weigh facts and possible courses of action in order to make sound decisions.
> 
> Dependability – Having the ability to be relied upon to perform duties properly, and complete a job. Always putting in the best effort so as to achieve the highest standards of performance. The quality that permits a senior to assign a task to a junior with the understanding that it will be accomplished with minimum supervision
> 
> Initiative – Taking action even if direct orders haven’t been given and using resourcefulness to solve problems.
> 
> Decisiveness – The ability to make good decisions calmly and quickly, and announcing your decisions in a clear, direct and professional manner.
> 
> Tact – To deal with people in a manner that will maintain good relations and avoid problems. It means that you are polite, calm, and firm. The quality of consistently treating peers, seniors, and subordinates with respect and courtesy is a sign of maturity. Tact allows commands, guidance, and opinions to be expressed in a constructive and beneficial manner. This deference must be extended under all conditions regardless of true feelings
> 
> Integrity -To be honest and truthful in everything you say and do, and value sound moral principles above all else.
> 
> Enthusiasm – Performing of your duties with excitement, optimism, and willing to accept the challenges. Displaying interest in a task and optimism that can be successfully completed greatly enhances the likelihood that the task will be successfully completed.
> 
> Bearing – The way you conduct and carry yourself. Manner should reflect alertness, competence, confidence, and control. The ability to look, talk, and act like a leader whether or not these manifestations indicate one’s true feelings.
> 
> Unselfishness – To be considerate of others, giving credit to those who deserve it. Avoidance of providing for one’s own comfort and personal advancement at the expense of others.
> 
> Courage – To remain calm, even while recognizing fear. Having the strength to stand up for what is right. Functioning effectively when in immediate physical danger.
> 
> Knowledge – An understanding of science, art, and people. Knowing your job, the unit’s policies, and being informed on current events.
> 
> Loyalty – The devotion to country, and the Marine Corps. Unwavering loyalty up and down the chain of command, to seniors, subordinates, and peers.
> 
> 
> Endurance –  Mental and Physical stamina, which is measured by your ability to withstand pain, fatigue, stress, and hardship.

I would have to say one of the greatest leadership lessons I learned from the Marines is that there isn't any one way to be a good leader.  Different people need different kinds of leadership. Some people respond to an old-fashioned ass chewing while others need the ""dad talk"" of ""I'm not mad, I'm disappointed."" Or a situation where your subordinates did something that failed horribly you give them the ""good initiative, poor judgment"" line and then pivot into ""what did we learn and how do we do better in the future?"".

Also, you have to be willing to do a lot of self-reflection and be willing to learn from the mistakes you've made.

There are also the 11 Leadership Principles.

>Know Yourself and Seek Self Improvement 

>>This principle of leadership should be developed by the use of leadership traits.
Evaluate yourself by using the leadership traits and determine your strengths
and weaknesses. 

>Be Technically And Tactically Proficient

>> A person who knows their job thoroughly and possesses a wide field of
knowledge. Before you can lead, you must be able to do the job. Tactical and
technical competence can be learned from books and from on the job training. 

>Know Your People And Look Out For Their Welfare

>>This is one of the most important of the leadership principles. A leader must
make a conscientious effort to observe his Marines and how they react to
different situations. A Marine who is nervous and lacks self-confidence should
never be put in a situation where an important decision must be made. This
knowledge will enable you as the leader to determine when close supervision is
required.

>Keep Your Personnel Informed

>>Marines by nature are inquisitive. To promote efficiency and morale, a leader
should inform the Marines in his unit of all happenings and give reasons why
things are to be done. This is accomplished only if time and security permits.
Informing your Marines of the situation makes them feel that they are a part of
the team and not just a cog in a wheel. Informed Marines perform better. 

>Set The Example

>>A leader who shows professional competence, courage and integrity sets high
personal standards for himself before he can rightfully demand it from others.
Your appearance, attitude, physical fitness and personal example are all on
display daily for the Marines and Sailors in your unit. Remember, your Marines
and Sailors reflect your image!  

>Ensure That The Task Is Understood, Supervised, and Accomplished 

>>Leaders must give clear, concise orders that cannot be misunderstood, and
then by close supervision, ensure that these orders are properly executed.
Before you can expect your men to perform, they must know what is expected
of them. 

>Train Your Marines And Sailors As A Team

>>Teamwork is the key to successful operations. Teamwork is essential from the
smallest unit to the entire Marine Corps. As a leader, you must insist on
teamwork from your Marines. Train, play and operate as a team. Be sure that
each Marine knows his/her position and responsibilities within the team
framework.

>Make Sound And Timely Decisions

>>The leader must be able to rapidly estimate a situation and make a sound
decision based on that estimation. Hesitation or a reluctance to make a
decision leads subordinates to lose confidence in your abilities as a leader. 

>Develop A Sense Of Responsibility Among Your Subordinates

>>Another way to show your Marines you are interested in their welfare is to give
them the opportunity for professional development. Assigning tasks and
delegating authority promotes mutual confidence and respect between leader
and subordinates. It also encourages subordinates to exercise initiative and to
give wholehearted cooperation in accomplishment of unit tasks. When you
properly delegate authority, you demonstrate faith in your Marines and increase
authority, and increase their desire for greater responsibilities. 

>Employ Your Command Within its Capabilities

>>A leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical and technical
capabilities of the command. Successful completion of a task depends upon
how well you know your unit’s capabilities. If the task assigned is one that your
unit has not been trained to do, failure is very likely to occur. Failures lower
your unit’s morale and self esteem. Seek out challenging tasks for your unit,
but be sure that your unit is prepared for and has the ability to successfully
complete the mission.

>Seek Responsibilities And Take Responsibility

>>- For professional development, you must actively seek out challenging
assignments. You must use initiative and sound judgment when trying to
accomplish jobs that are required by your grade. Seeking responsibilities also
means that you take responsibility for your actions. Regardless of the actions
of your subordinates, the responsibility for decisions and their application falls
on you.

Always tried to stay busy. Came in to cover shifts. The whole nine yards. 

I honestly thought it was real rich coming from a lady who never stepped foot in her own restaurant to work shifts, who never was there when shit was happening and even had cameras installed so she could check (aka spy) on us from her phone.

There was this one moment I'll never forget. The restaurant was slammed like crazy, she made a rare appearance (keep in mind she physically showed up to her restaurant maybe like three times on average every few months), made a comment that it was busy and then just left.

Neglect and sexual abuse sound like abuse. Saying that it's a myth is a pretty big claim based on the research, which you can find \[[here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6229/1480)\].

The evidence for the intergenerational transmission of physical abuse seems mixed - see [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/intergenerational-transmission-of-maltreatment-a-multilevel-examination/D2C37624C51BF76D6BA70FA8E4DCFE9A) for one attempt to explain this through issues with measurement, while others have proposed that it's only the combination of abuse and a particular allele (see here for information on the [allele](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00702-018-1892-2)) that leads to increased risk for physical violence later on life.

1. You could do the obvious thing and promote your best workers

2. Or you promote your shittiest worker because he produces crappy work and by promoting him, you don't really have to deal with him anymore and you also get to keep your best workers in a position that they're really good in. 

He disagreed with option #2, saying you should promote your good workers because they actually know what they're doing and that will lead to better quality work overall.

I took over a store that had a ""not my problem"" mentality - I tried being nice.   I tried motivating people.   I tried giving incentive.

none of it worked.    These people flat out just didn't care about completing the tasks on time, and were so used to getting away with it because that is how the place had operated for a very long time.   These people thought they were invincible.    

well I worked among them for the better part of a year.   I did my job, and I made up for their refusal to get the job done, and you're damn right when I got promoted, and I tried to encourage people to change their ways, and they decided I could piss up a rope.

I didn't make them pay.   I made them broke and jobless - and I don't regret it one bit.

I took the store from being one spot removed from the worst store in the state, to the largest revenue earner in the entire company, and it was because I grew a pair of balls and fired people who didn't get their jobs done.

it went from being a place full of nearly lifeless drones who were there to get a paycheck, to people who wanted to be there, wanted to get the job done, and wanted to at least TRY and have a decent day while doing so.

Not only that, but given that he (quietly) made it clear why he had left to those he managed, and since those people he managed were also tired of his senior’s incompetent, hands off and abusive behaviour, a lot of them left too. Employee loyalty was partly to blame, he treated his subordinates well and with respect.

So he ended up going to a different company pretty quickly, as did a bunch of other people, and his boss got fired by her higher ups because she messed up by not treating her subordinates with any common decency or respect.

A long time ago, I worked at a fried chicken place. My boss-boss (he owned a few stores) found out that the store I worked at had a problem with the chicken delivery. The chicken we got wasn't cut up, and it's a real pain to prep that much chicken for service as dinner was about to start. The man drove all the way down, bringing his own personal chicken-cutting equipment to cut up pieces for us so we had enough to sell until another shipment would come within the next few days.

Now, by all means, some people may think of this as a boss trying to do his job, but this act reflected a boss who genuinely cared about what was happening with his business was doing to the point where he personally made sure the shit got done right.

You have to be able to recognize when its just a mistake, or a huge work load, or some other circumstance, even just an off day - and when its negligence and lack of shits to give.    

in my experience, its usually not the latter - which makes it really obvious when it is.

I had a store where it was almost always the latter.   for a little while anyway.   

I worked 90 hours a week most weeks for about a year to stamp the issue out.    People kept on saying things like ""you cant afford to lose me"" as they walked out at clock out time with only half their job done, and a bunch of their shift being spent playing about on their phones.    I tried.   I tried to be nice...  asked people to spend less time playing and more time doing things, asked people to help each other out, I even at one point started offering the entire crew payouts on the days they got things done completely - not even on time, just completed entirely before just clocking out and leaving....

they tested me one to many times.   One day, one looked at me when I finally snapped and told him to get his ass back to his station and get his shit done, and said ""you gonna fire me?  you aint gonna work all my shifts and do your own shit.  get the fuck outa my way.""    …..     oh boy that lit a fire in my soul.    

Fired him on the spot and proceeded to fill every one of his shifts till I found a good replacement.    Then I fired the next person who mouthed off and did the same thing, and I went down the line till the people who were left and capable of getting the job done got the message.   

I fired 5 people in one day at one point, and the store didn't meet requirements for a month.   I didn't care anymore.   I was done.  I worked 16 hour days 6-7 days a week just to get rid of them and stay afloat while I found replacements.

never fuck with a manager who gives a shit and tries to be good to you.  because when they're done with your shit, they will gut you.

And you can literally ask the person. Even if it appears to be negligence, by some decent communicating you will find something much deeper. Maybe they lack confidence, maybe they struggle in certain areas and constantly trying to over compensate. 

But definitely when someone is just out for themselves with the atittide you described, like you said, it would stand out like a sore thumb.

I used to landscape for a small company. I'd work from 6 am to 8 pm every day, 5 days a week.

In doing so, I'd routinely walk 50k-60k steps. About a marathon, or 26 miles a day.

I did most of that with a wheel barrow in front of me. We'd shovel 20,000 pounds of rock between 2 of us, and it was a typical day.

So much activity that I was eating probably 8,000+ calories a day, and I still couldn't eat enough to maintain my weight.

But I tell you what, I had never been happier or less stressed in my life.

Contrast this to leisurely activity, even something strenuous like working out at a company gym, it's by choice and you're free to take things entirely at your own natural pace and without eyes on you all the time, that's going to feel a lot more rewarding and enjoyable.

Obviously this all depends on the work culture, task itself, and people giving orders and how they give orders, but in general it seems like such would be the case in practically any setting.

People like to hyperbolize and say they're completely exhausted even though theyre just the normal kind of-tired.Everybody gets these hyperboles, but when having a discussion like now, its confusing because it takes being wiped exhausted to be exhausted while for others you may have not even done a thing, but since you spent the 8full hours after coming to the job, which is primarily how to keep yourself not bored during the periods of no work at all maybe all they had worked was 40 minutes, but since they suffered enough till the end of shift - the 8hrs, they feel like as if they were 'working' these 8 hours. mentally they had already finished working, even if not exhausted, its like your brain expects or even simulates tiredness.

also  theres overlap with burn out and other things. people gotta get their definitions straight. 

being tired is normal, but exhausted is basically just saying youre almost up to your limits. pushing yourself that way will suffer your mental wellbeing lateron. Normal kind of tiredness afterwork is of course not unexpected; and its temporary, and natural to feel it. its more of a mental tiredness. exhaustion is both physical and mental severe tiredness

you can push it beyond, but exhaustion (mental+physical) is just a symptom, showing that you indeed pushed your limits, hence why you may break down and have especiially emotional mood swings and outbursts.this is where we gotta emphasize what is tiredness and what is exhaustion (which may ruin your mental health for months) when theres no energy only anger fuels it and thus you have to use anger as a tool for energy, making you snap at everyone for no reason, etc

a since energy is out of reach ya need something intense, which anger is, wtih all its negatives it might give Energy tho :/

Tiredness is normal, yes.

Exhaustion is not (most of the time) its usually beyond your natural limits that this happens. so naturally your brain tries to preserve your energy and since you depleted too much energy, certain parts of brain malfunction, or inhibit themselves resulting in behaviours that facilitate recover and  rest

&#x200B;

Ignore my wall of text. basically im saying tiredness is mainly physical and is normal when you exerted yourself; exhaustion is when both mental and physical exhaustion comes. even mental exhaustion will make you feel physically ill and weak and tired. exhaustion is both the brain and the body being overworked, it can be chronic and very gradual but the mental fatigue catches up to induce physical version even if youre physically rested.",lulumeme,t2_cb30p,8,0,reddit3

Abstract

Background

Little is known regarding whether growing awareness of the financial toxicity of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment has increased clinician engagement or changed the needs of current patients.

Methods

The authors surveyed patients with early‐stage breast cancer who were identified through population‐based sampling from 2 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions and their physicians. The authors described responses from approximately 73% of surgeons (370 surgeons), 61% of medical oncologists (306 medical oncologists), 67% of radiation oncologists (169 radiation oncologists), and 68% of patients (2502 patients).

Results

Approximately one‐half (50.9%) of responding medical oncologists reported that someone in their practice often or always discusses financial burden with patients, as did 15.6% of surgeons and 43.2% of radiation oncologists. Patients indicated that financial toxicity remains common: 21.5% of white patients and 22.5% of Asian patients had to cut down spending on food, as did 45.2% of black and 35.8% of Latina patients. Many patients desired to talk to providers about the financial impact of cancer (15.2% of whites, 31.1% of blacks, 30.3% of Latinas, and 25.4% of Asians). Unmet patient needs for engagement with physicians about financial concerns were common. Of 945 women who worried about finances, 679 (72.8%) indicated that physicians and their staff did not help. Of 523 women who desired to talk to providers regarding the impact of breast cancer on employment or finances, 283 (55.4%) reported no relevant discussion.

Conclusions

Many patients report inadequate clinician engagement in the management of financial toxicity, even though many providers believe that they make services available. Clinician assessment and communication regarding financial toxicity must improve; cure at the cost of financial ruin is unacceptable.

From diagnosis to death is usually 18 months. She fought for 4 years and finally went to her home in heaven. 

Luckily we had good insurance, but even then the cost of healthcare is insane. When she had her first brain surgery our annual deductibles reset just two months later. She had a second surgery and a C section to deliver our daughter. 

People think of cancer as chemo, radiation, surgery and then you’re fine. There’s medications on the back end and a specialist for everything wrong with the patient. When she died we had $18k in credit card debt, and about $7k in medical debt. We had life insurance so the debt was knocked out and the medical was forgiven. This still doesn’t stop collections companies demanding money from hospital bills even after the fact and a grieving uneducated person would have probably paid them. 

PS: my wife went to MD Anderson for treatment and I wrote about the entire experience while we were there. It’s over 200 pages and it’s really hard emotionally to read. If anyone wants to read it PM me and I’ll send you everything. Hopefully it’ll benefit someone or unveil the ugliness that is cancer.

The first time I was hospitalized I had no idea what my insurance covered in terms of the hospitalization. I knew I had already hit my deductible, but what was covered after that? My previous insurance was 80/20 covered so I’d have to pay 20% of the cost of an inpatient stay.

And I can never answer it for these reasons:
I don't know what your deductible is, whether or not you have met it, or how far you are from it.

I don't know what your co-insurance is. 10%? 20%?

In network? Out of network? Copays?

Does your insurance cover the procedure from me as the surgeon but there's a separate charge from the facility that they don't cover?

Is it a bundle payment or will you have a separate charge for anesthesia or hospital care?

Just to name a few of the variables. 

I can easily give you what we bill the insurance company for a given procedure but what the patient pays can vary widely from 100% of that number to 0% of that number and that can vary from patient to patient or it can even vary with the same patient at different points through the year.

Your insurance company can better tell you what your out of pocket costs would be better than any physician ever could. My practice accepts 10-15 different insurances and they all have multiple different plans and tiers. They change the details of these regularly.

I carry Critical Illness insurance on my entire family (kids too since if they were sick I would not leave their side at the hospital) it costs a bit but you can get return of premium with it so if you don't make a claim you can get your premiums back at cancellation.,bscheck1968,t2_155ip5,2,0,reddit1

For example, a married couple has 2 children, one is 16 and one is 20 and in college. Husband makes $40k per year and wife makes $55k per year. This family has a yearly pre-tax income of $95k per year and a household size of 4. The fact that the 20 year old no longer physically lives in their home doesn't matter. 

In your example of ""one person's cancer should be compared to one person's income"" it becomes impossible to account for the 16 year old who has an income of $0 (maybe $5k with a part time job) but is still covered under his or her parents' insurance and a dependent of the $95k per year income.

Things are compared to household income because it gives a better sense of the magnitude of the cost. If one study found that the total direct (appointments, blood work, scans, medications, transportation to appointments, etc.) and indirect (lost income, decreased productivity, etc.) costs of cancer totalled 10 billion freedom dollars and the average household income was 50 billion freedom dollars (20% of average household income) and another found that the cost of cancer was 5 billion freedom dollars but the average household income was only 15 billion freedom dollars (33% of average household income), if you only compared the dollar value of the costs, cancer would look more expensive in the first study, but when household income is considered, the opposite is true.

Money wasn’t high on the list - you can definitely make a good living - but the payoff is delayed by the training time (4 years of college, 4 of medical school, 5 years of residency making a shit salary, 1 year of fellowship making a slightly less shit salary, 100-120 hour workweeks, and 250k in student loans). I provide a service to people, and get compensated for it just like almost everyone else who has a job of any sort. There is a concept that caring for someone’s health requires a certain empathy because it often is an emotionally vulnerable aspect to people. So like anything, we get trained to communicate a certain way with patients that is compassionate. As with anything, some doctors are good at it and some aren’t. But that’s just one aspect of our jobs - there’s a technical aspect, a business aspect, an administrative aspect, sometimes a teaching aspect, a computer-skills aspect (these days), and more. Equivocating doctors to saints is about as old an idea as the Hippocratic oath itself, and probably has little use in today’s iteration of medicine. Honestly, it’s better to have a multi-disciplinary team that includes chaplins, therapists, patient advocates, case managers, etc who can all “help” the patient with their various needs, and leave the doctor to diagnostic and therapeutic duties.

According to a quick Google search, the price of an eight-week course of chemotherapy in the USA is, roughly speaking, in the ballpark of $15,000 - $30,000 depending on your state and healthcare provider. That works out to approximately £11,000 - £22,000, give or take whatever the exchange rate is doing this week. My yearly salary is about £40,000 before tax (that's about $52,500). That means I pay around £9500 per year in tax, of which 22% goes on healthcare, which is around £2100 - between a fifth and a tenth of the cost of a single round of chemo.

Whether you'd rather keep the extra £2100 ($2750) per year but have to pay all your healthcare costs... That's your decision to make.

Usually this is interpreted as including the necessity of not only being likely to violate a specific written law but also to regard a specific judical precedence of unlawful behaviour. Finding a case in which both explicit written law and judical precedence exist is very rare. Example: qualified immunity had been granted to an officer stealing over 200k from a crime scene based on the fact ""We have never before addressed whether the theft of property covered by the terms of a search warrant and seized pursuant to that warrant violates the Fourth Amendment."" (Micah Jessop/Brittan Ashjian vs City of Fresno, 2019). While this is anecdotal, it's not a rare case. 

Qualified immunity is supposed to be a protection for officials to be able to do their job without risking their individual freedom. In reality, it's significantly often decided in favour of officials, especially police officers. Due to this, there's rising criticism regarding this practice that goes up to the supreme court. As Justice Sotomayor put it, it's ""sanctioning a ‘shoot first, think later’ approach to policing"".

It isn't a redefining, it's been the understood definition in academics for a while.


The problem is that the academic understanding (which is often more nuanced) doesn't always align with the common-use of certain terms.

In an academic sense, racism has a requisite ingredient of societal inequality - That is to say, white people being a dominant majority, by the academic definition, *cannot* be a victim of racism *because* they're a part of the dominant power/majority. 

That isn't to say that a black person can't be prejudiced against a white person, just that it isn't *racism* by the academic definition.

For a short demonstrative example, the N-word holds a century or better of weight behind it as a slur. It has been, to an extent, reclaimed by those communities- but it's use is still in most cases utterly taboo if used by a member of the dominant class. 

Compare that to arguably the only comperable ""slur"", ""Cracker. Does it hold remotely the same weight? Nope! Anyone who even suggests it does is being dishonest. 

Common layman use of words is often more clumsy and imprecise - but what's fundamentally happening here is a disconnect between someone who has an academic background studying race and racism vs people who don't who use words with the common parlance definitions.",BeyondElectricDreams,t2_7088k,-19,0,reddit2

And perhaps that's a good reason why how most people use the word *should* change, but it doesn't alter the fact that it *is* a change in how most people use the word, effectively making it a redefinition.

Setting aside what we feel the word should mean, I would paraphrase your stance as ""I'm not saying this word should be redefined, but it should be used differently than almost everyone uses it and has used it for generations"".  I hope you can see why many people would view that as effectively saying ""I'm not saying it should be redefined, but it should be redefined"", which is not a self-consistent or compelling stance for someone who doesn't already agree with it.

You're making a supposition that I think the definition should change.

I don't.

You're shooting the messanger.

When it comes to an academic study of ANYTHING, you need more precise language than common parlance, because at a high academic level you're talking about small, nuanced differences between things. 

This language is often not useful for common use, so there's no reason it should be used in that way.

But what should happen is, if these two groups are going to talk, it should be understood by both sides that the academics are entering into the ""Common parlance"" ring when they leave, but also for people to understand that academics have more nuance to their understanding than the average layperson.",BeyondElectricDreams,t2_7088k,2,0,reddit2

That's an entirely reasonable take.

However, that does mean that someone who tries shoehorning the academic meaning of the word into a non-academic context is the one doing it wrong, and they're doing it *very* wrong if they try insisting that that academic meaning is *actually* the right meaning that everyone else should be using, too.

As a result, it seems we're in agreement that the academic definition should be used in academic discourse and the common definition should be used in non-academic discourse.

For a real world example, two cops respond to a domestic violence incident.  Upon arrival, they exit their cars and when they do the domestic abuser walks outside and begins shooting at that.  One officer is shot and killed, and the other is shot and wounded.  The wounded officer returns fire killing the subject.  Now, I don’t know about you, but fear would be a totally expected response after essentially being ambushed and shot while also seeing your coworker shot.

Or then there’s another situation where a person with a knife is being dealt with by police.  Officer tases him, it’s ineffective, and he begins to stab her.  Her partner shoots and kills him while he is still stabbing her.  

And here’s the kicker, their fear isn’t what actually clears them in these incidents.  One of the primary things that can clear them is found in Graham v. Connor (1989), as well as other applicable case law.  What you don’t know is there are multiple parameters that must be met in order to legally justify the force used.  

This is why you rather stick to stats, even though you avoid how these things don’t occur as often as you’ve convinced yourself.

2) In the early 90s soon after I was born I was part of a small study done to see why there were just some individuals that despite having the same type and subtype of CMT would just have the disease expressed far greater in certain individuals, I was noted to being one of the ones that this was very apparent with.

d57wwkv,t3_4salxq,2016-07-11 14:58:42,science,"  Good morning, and thank you for taking time out of your day to answer all these questions. 
  
  My question is pharmaceutical in nature. I'm only assuming because of your background you may have some insight into why I've suddenly developed this sensitivity. 

  I'm a chronic pain sufferer, and have early onset degenerative disc disease. I've been through 2 failed back surgeries, and because of poor surgical technique, and surgical error, I have many nerve issues now too. As a result I'm on a pretty heavy pain medication regime including 75mcg of fentanyl every 48hrs.  

  The fentanyl made such a huge difference. I wake up with enough pain relief, I no longer need help out of bed. However, after using 75mcg for 3 years, out of the blue, I started to develop intense headaches, dizziness, and throwing up. These symptoms only dissipate after removing my fentanyl patch, I feel better in about 3 hours. 

  My pain management team thought maybe it was a bad patch at first, and had me try another, same issue. The a different box/lot number, same issue. They then had me try 50 mcg fentanyl, but the negative symptoms still persisted. At 25mcg of fentanyl, I had no negative symptoms, but my back pain was no longer being relived. My doctor's want to switch me back to oxycontin, but in the past it hasn't provided the best pain relief.

   I'm just wondering if you've ever heard of something like this, or because of your background, if you'd know why someone would suddenly develop a reaction to a medication they've taken for years. I understand if you're unable to assist me, and want to thank you, for the work you're doing with rare diseases.

Given the for-profit nature of pharmaceutical companies how do you think this will affect clinical research, for better or worse?

A few years back I was diagnosed with dermatomyositis after a battery of tests, and a couple months of both know what was going on with my body. It was very disheartening being told that the medical community doesn't know what exactly causes this disease and that there is no cure. At the time I was 24, and I pretty thought my quality of life was going down the tubes fast. I was prescribed 60mg of Prednisone and a bit of methotrexate and fossomax and steroid cream for the itch. I gained 100 lbs from the Prednisone, and a slew of other conditions started popping up while on treatment. I had GERD, Hand Foot and Mouth, and gall stones which I think all related to the horses share of steroids I was taking. Eventually I moved to Washington state, and I cycled off of the drugs. My symptoms went away, but when I stay outside for a bit too long I get itchy spots. I didn't find that when I used cannabis salves on inflamed areas of my skin it gets rid of the itch almost instantaneously, and with continued use the itchy patch goes away.

I unknowingly had Zika Virus over new years. I believed it was a cold until I couldnt walk up my stairs. Numbness began in my toes and breathing became hard. I then went to the ICU. They told me there that I had Guillain Barre Syndrome and to expect to be in and out of the ICU for at least the next 3-6months. I was in the ICU for only two weeks. We did 3.5-4 treatments of IVIG. 

Also I attribute a lot of my physical recovery on proper strains of cannabis(White Rhino & Hog) and much more importantly LSD.

I was advising my friend to work with Clusterheads to form a [patient registry](http://www.treat-nmd.eu/resources/patient-registries/what/). 

Having detailed information on the people suffering from this disease can go a long way to having a company decide to jump in to search for a cure.

If your group can start to raise money and form a non-profit patient group you can start work towards engaging with different research teams. There are a lot of people out there that would jump at the chance to be the one to find the cure/treatment, but there needs to be funding for this.

Soft tissue like muscles, tendons, and ligaments turn into bone.  Extra ribbons of bone grow out of the skeleton.  Flare ups of bone growth can be caused by illness, injury, or nothing at all.  The extra bone cannot be removed surgically because that causes even more bone growth.  All of my friend's major joints are locked-he's stuck like a statue in a sitting position. The extra bone around his chest makes it hard for him to breathe.  He always beats me (except once!) when we play NHL 14.

We can do everything virtually without a lab. An academic say a physician can have an idea and pretty much test it in vitro for less than $10K.. challenge is in vivo.. there are many small family and disease foundations that could fund such work.. day to day issues in an institute are getting peer support, reluctance filing provisional patents which in turn would limit outside interest, some politics in institutes may also hinder how someone without their own lab can do research, they might require them to work with others to do work inside etc..we could definitely use more reagents for rare diseases but there are more fundamental issues. For example a rare disease parent can become an acknowledged expert on the disease but without a PhD they could not readily publish or go after a grant - which is unfortunate and should change.",Sean_Ekins,t2_zeqki,2,0,reddit3

Short Background on SPS: 
The painful muscle rigidity and spasms that are characteristic of SPS is due to the uncontrolled depolarization of motor neurons, which are usually inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission from spinal cord neurons. GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, regulates the activation of motor neurons under normal homeostatic conditions. When GABA neurotransmission is inhibited, the motor neurons fire spontaneously, causing contraction of the muscles they innervate. SPS is considered an autoimmune disease because it involves aberrant antibodies as the mechanism of GABA neurotransmission inhibition. The primary treatment for SPS is diazepam, which targets GABA-A receptors. Unfortunately, patients require progressively higher doses, which can lead to intolerable drowsiness. Stiffness progresses over time and leads to impairment of function, requiring an increasing amount of treatment to achieve the same level of function. SPS has an estimated prevalence of 1-2 cases per million so I imagine it is difficult to get funding for SPS research, consequently there is very little research being done on SPS. Thus, there is a significant need for the development of new treatments for SPS.

Potential for Gene Therapy:
Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) is on the forefront of gene therapy because it has low immunogenicity and can deliver a stable episome into the nucleus of human cells. The episome can be engineered to carry a gene of interest and will lead to the production of the encoded protein in the infected cell. A gene therapy trial that treated Parkinson's Disease) PD used an engineered strain of AAV that carried the gene for human GAD (LeWitt, P. A. et al. 2011). The patients receiving the gene therapy had significantly improved symptoms of PD with no serious adverse side effects. The only complications came from the procedure of injecting AAV-GAD into the brain. This was not only a clear success but also the first time AAV gene therapy was used to treat a disease that was not of a genetic origin. After learning of this clinical trial, I realized that AAV gene therapy could potentially be used to treat my own mother. In the case of SPS, AAV-GAD could be injected into the thecal sac, which would be no more complicated than the common spinal tap procedure, thus avoiding the risk of surgery. The main question I have is whether GAD production could overcome autoantibody inhibition of GAD so that enough GAD is produced to prevent spontaneous firing of motor neurons. Overall, it may be a long shot and I am sure that there are factors that I have not considered, but it seems that SPS patients are perfect candidates for AAV gene therapy.",,,18,0,reddit3

The whole point of antibodies is to very specifically label proteins that we're interested in. It turns out that quite a few of them were sold as being very specific for a certain protein or part of a protein, while they actually either targeted different regions of a protein than advertised (this is important because proteins can get cut up in the cell) or targeting entirely different proteins.

Honestly, I can't say that my lab really followed up much on this. In the end it is our responsibility to know what our reagents do, but on the other hand we also put our trust in our vendors to give us what they advertise.

I have both contracted a rare disease (Meningococcemia) and have rare sequelae (Addison's disease caused by Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome). Afaik, there is not much anyone can do for me at the moment but in the context of research, I feel like my body could potentially be a wealth of information for scientists. My family has a history of rare diseases (two paternal aunts with TB and rheumatic heart disease, my father recently passed away from S. Maltophilia pneumonia and sunsequent interstitial fibrosis, aunt with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, several paternal relatives with lung carcinoma or adenoma, aunt who died in infancy from Tuberculous meningitis and theres more!). None of us have had any specific immune deficiency identified (I had extensive testing after my illness), but I know there has to be an underlying cause for our susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria as well as lung diseases (I had ARDS when I was in septic shock from the Meningococcal disease). 

Obviously, no one will let me donate my body to science early, lol and I am out of academia for the time being, so I guess my question is, how would I start trying to find someone interested in the genetics behind these diseases and possibly offer myself as a research subject?

d584enx,t1_d5812ur,2016-07-11 17:47:38,science,"My understanding is that it's kind of a case by case basis. Anything is possible as long as you can convince someone. Not all compassionate uses of drugs is done as a trial or a study, but sometimes it will be done that way to track and publish the results. Sometimes families simply get a medication on ""compassionate use"" basis when that drug is not available to them on the market. Sometimes they contact the pharmaceutical company directly, or have a provider contact the company and advocate for them. For companies it's not a comfortable thing to give a medication to a patient that does not yet have FDA approval. Sometimes there isn't a lot of safety data available yet and no one wants to put the patient at risk. But in cases where the situation is dire and there is seemingly nothing to lose, it can and does happen. I don't have a lot of experience from the pharmaceutical side of things but I imagine it would be incredibly difficult to get a medication on compassionate use basis for a condition that is not life-threatening.

As for minocycline, since it's already a drug on the market, you may be able to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe it contingent on the science out there supporting it and some educated risk/benefit analysis but you may have a harder time convincing the insurance company to pay for its use outside of its indication (for example, if a drug is approved to treat condition X, insurance may not pay for it to treat condition Y). Would your brother be able to participate in the clinical trials?

Please note that I'm not a clinician and don't take any of this as any sort of medical advice.

Edit: And yes, as u/mushroom_face pointed out, you still need FDA approval for compassionate use.",VerenValtaan,t2_cb8l5,5,0,reddit3
d586jzf,t1_d5812ur,2016-07-11 18:34:20,science,"Compassionate use refers to the drug company providing an experimental drug to a patient free of charge. It's typically done for drugs that are in the early phases of approval but not yet on the market, or for uses for which the drug is not approved, and thus not covered by insurance (insurance companies generally require evidence that a drug works for a given condition before they'll pay).

Compassionate use is just to allow somebody to use drugs not yet approved by the FDA. Minocycline is already approved, so any physician is free to prescribe it for any reason if you can convince them of the data (no need for any special paperwork). They'll probably want to exhaust the more traditional options, but it's not impossible that someone might try it.

regarding proteins, big molecules you cant use these measures as according to lipinski rule molecular weight below 500 is betst for permeation. proteins are very big comparatively about 50000 dalton. so might be screen without set of rules and later drug delivery system have to be developed according to their properties.

Even for a study that's already in-progress, compassionate use requires going through some prior research to showcase that the drug has the biochemical potential for effect without excessive safety implications. It also requires monitoring by the prescribing physician, so you aren't just taking the drug, but providing significant feedback. 

If you do decide to go down this path, make sure it's with a physician who understands drug trials, has done compassionate use studies (or collaborates with those who have), and is also exceptionally honest about the process (including its pitfalls from having no significant effect to active potential for harm).

Neuroscientists here. I have worked with transgenic technologies and some gene editing, so have some knowledge of this area, albeit limited.

How can you ensure that the data you collect will not be requested by a participant's insurer?  How does someone know that the sample they give today will not result in their child being denied cover in 20yrs time?

3.	The right to access - Companies should make it easy for users to get a copy of, correct, and delete their personal data.

This is a good question, straight out of GATTACA. Outside of Ancestry, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act prohibits insurers/employers from using genetic information (or things like it, e.g. family histories of disease) to discriminate in employment or policies. 

But on the Ancestry side, we have a strict policy about using our DNA database just for our business and our customers. We wouldn’t share your genetic information with anyone without your explicit consent. We also don’t voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement or other government inquiries, and we’d always advocate for our users’ privacy first. Ancestry requires a valid legal process, like a court order or a search warrant, before we’d ever consider providing customer data to the government. And if we ever had to, we’d definitely seek to minimize the scope of any inquiry. Finally, we have a policy of notifying impacted customers unless we’re ordered not to. (To keep our customers informed, we publish a transparency report annually that details those interactions with law enforcement: [https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency).)

As far as we’re concerned, our biggest priority is protecting our customers privacy -- bank accounts are pretty private, but DNA is about as personal and sensitive as it gets. We at Ancestry will not share their data with third parties without their permission and we would not provide data to an insurer without the participant’s consent. 

We’re super aware that this is a new space, so we’ve partnered with our friends at 23andMe, MyHeritage, Helix and others to develop and implement strict guidelines about how customers’ DNA and data is protected. [More on that here :)](https://fpf.org/2018/07/31/privacy-best-practices-for-consumer-genetic-testing-services/) 

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 already prohibits this kind of serious misuse not just of genetic information but even of non-genetic family health histories - things that may indirectly convey information about inherited risk even without a genetic test. That’s our side, and the policy side. But since it’s your data, of course we leave the final ownership to you: you can delete your data and/or have your DNA sample destroyed at any time, and it’ll be 100% gone. Instructions for that deletion are [here](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Deleting-Your-Ancestry-Account).

>Are you comfortable with these companies owning your genetic data? Shouldn't the customer have the right to say NO to their genetic data being owned by a private company?

At Nebula, we're using various data sharing technologies to ensure we **don't** own your data. You should definitely have the right to control how your data is being used and we're working hard to make this a guarantee. 

>Are you satisfied with the current policies on data protection and do you feel safe that your data will not be misused by these companies in the future?

I'm not satisfied with the policies today. A lot of genetic data protection laws haven't been well litigated. I think we need more focused dialogue on how regulators will help us protect our data.

>Why do the companies insist on owning/storing our genetic information, especially when the population at large doesnt realize the potential importance of this information. Is enough work being done on educating the public about all the potential benefit/harm of getting their DNA sequenced and stored by a private company?

Awareness around the value of personal genomics is growing. 23&me has done an amazing job paving the way and educating consumers on why genetic tests are valuable. Now, we need to help people understand how sharing their health data can help us understand diseases and improve medicine. 

>Finally, How can you protect yourself from potential harm caused by intentional or unintentional misuse of this stored data?

That's a tough question. We're building our platform in such a way that we won't actually be storing any data and all data is user owned. But the honest truth is that you are ""shedding"" your DNA all over the place in the form of hair, dead skin, etc and, as sequencing prices go down, there is a risk about malicious actors getting this data.

23andMe customers own their data. It’s our job to ensure that they are in the driver’s seat when it comes to making decisions about how their data is used, stored, and shared. The intersection of genetics and privacy shouldn't have to be confusing. We continuously work to develop resources that are accessible and easy to understand, like our [Privacy Highlights](https://www.23andme.com/about/privacy/) and [Privacy Center](https://www.23andme.com/privacy/). These resources clearly set expectations for how 23andMe will, or will not, process customer data. We also believe it is important to give customers the information necessary to dive deeper into the areas they are interested in learning more about. 

23andMe implements a variety of controls to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of information and ensure the appropriate use of information: 

* We encrypt sensitive customer information both at rest and in transit. 
* Genetic information, and self-reported information are de-identified and segmented across logical database systems to further prevent re-identifiability.
* 23andMe implements a strict least-privileged authorization policy, limiting access to authorized personnel, based on job function and role.

You can read more about our Security practices in [here](https://www.23andme.com/about/privacy/#jump-link-content-security-measures). 

Additionally, all of our research collaborators are required to meet the same rigorous security standards as we hold ourselves to, including robust technical and organizational controls. We've implemented a privacy and security diligence and contracting process with research collaborators that includes periodic audits and reports on their security measures.

While we do our best to give customers the information they need to understand how 23andMe handles their data and respects their privacy, it’s important for all customers to carefully review and evaluate the policies and practices of any testing company they are considering.

While our users can download their data from our protected ecosystem and upload it to third party services like GedMatch, we advise our consumers that when they remove their data from our service that they should carefully review the privacy policies for any third-party services they chose to use.

In regards to your data in our ecosystem, keeping your data safe and maintaining customer trust is a big deal. At Ancestry, we have a strict policy about using our DNA database only for our business and our customers. We wouldn’t share genetic information with anyone without your explicit consent. We also don’t voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement or other government inquiries, and we’d always advocate for our users’ privacy first. Ancestry requires a valid legal process, like a court order or a search warrant, before we’d ever consider providing customer data to the government. And if we ever had to, we’d definitely seek to minimize the scope of any inquiry. Finally, we have a policy that we notify impacted customers unless we’re ordered not to. To keep our customers informed, we actually publish a transparency report annually that details those interactions with law enforcement: the current one can be seen [here](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency).

First, regulations do indeed vary in each continent and country, for example, the EU recently passed an extremely stringent privacy law, GDPR. So we have dedicated team that thoroughly reviews relevant regulations and ensures we are aligned.  With that said, Ancestry has core principles around privacy and transparency (see [here](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency)) - so we protect customers’ privacy, no matter which country they come from.

The second part of your question regarding adding probabilities to our estimates is great. You are indeed correct that very few variants, at least those of appreciable frequency, are only found in a single population.  Our models work to infer the most likely explanation of your combination of variants, but we do indeed provide confidence intervals on our estimates. This is our way of providing our statistically savvy consumers some guidance on how confident we are around the estimates we provide.  See more about this in our white paper [here](https://www.ancestrycdn.com/dna/static/images/ethnicity/help/WhitePaper_Final_091118dbs.pdf) that describes how our methods work.

And finally, you asked about where we find the markers we assay.  This question is actually very important to me as the variation we look at can impact our conclusions.  When we launched our product over six years ago, we used an off-the-shelf platform that assays \~730,000 variants which suffered from the initial European biases in genomics. As we have grown, we have developed our own array which works to balance the representation of variation more globally and this can help us improve our inferences.",Jake_Byrnes,t2_2lvbttan,4,0,reddit1

SNP arrays are also commonly used by academic researchers because they are a very cost effective way of collecting genetic data across large numbers of people, and in many cases, having a large sample size is crucial for the kinds of studies we do. With full sequencing, we can directly measure rare variants that can’t be effectively imputed, and we do use sequencing in some of our research projects.

One additional key point I would like to highlight is that the DTC boom has actually significantly reduced the cost of genotyping arrays.  This is exciting because it has lowered the bar for academic researchers to do bigger and better studies or their own.

Great question! In all honesty, genomics has a clear bias problem and it still exists.  For a good, thorough also dated, write-up see this article ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3708540/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3708540/)). As you highlight, this bias is harming the entire field.  

However, there are a few key advantages that DTC companies have over the broader genomics space in tackling this issue. Ancestry’s tested over 10 million people, so while our consumer profile does tend to be more European than the population of the world, we still have large numbers of people who have taken our test from other regions and groups. This means that we are in one of the better positions to understand how population-specific differences in genetic variation influence traits or reveal your historical origins.  

The best thing here really is that the science need and the customer need are totally aligned -- obviously anyone offering a product to a customer is under direct pressure from the consumer space to make products that are universally valuable.  This means that for the success of our businesses in general we must solve this problem. I don’t think that any experience on the market is where I want it to be for diverse backgrounds, but I am confident that science will get there.

Prior to joining Ancestry, I worked for many years on human population genetics and understanding what genetic variation can tell us about human origins.  When I began my position here seven years ago, the state-of-the-art methods could be used to infer your origins from many hundreds to thousands of years in the past and at the resolution of large regions around the world.  This is because there really is very little genetically that differentiates us all.  At Ancestry, we have worked incredibly hard to develop a new method that is powered by the combination of genetic relatedness and family tree data.  Using these data, we have significantly improved our resolution, and can now confidently tell our consumers where their ancestors were from in the last few hundred years and often down to very small geographic regions such as a county in Ireland such as Munster, a state in Mexico such as Jalisco, or African Americans with ancestors from Mississippi. We currently have over 300 regions like this. You can find the scientific paper about this work [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14238) if you want more details.  This powerful framework allows us to continue to refine our resolution as more people participate.  So the future is very bright.",Jake_Byrnes,t2_2lvbttan,2,0,reddit1

e9u5cfv,t1_e9t9vzz,2018-11-16 20:20:31,science,"Hi, Natalie from Ancestry here! This is a really important question. I reached out to the Ancestry Privacy Team to make this one really clear for you. 

First off, Ancestry has a strict policy about using our DNA database just for our business and our customers. We don’t voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement or other government inquiries, and we’d always advocate for our users’ privacy first. Ancestry requires a valid legal process -- like a court order or a search warrant -- before we’d ever consider providing customer data to the government, and we would seek to minimize the scope of any inquiry. We also have a policy of notifying impacted customers unless ordered not to. To keep our customers informed, we publish a transparency report annually that details our interactions with law enforcement: [https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency).

We keep a really strict data deletion policy which we’re proud of. You can ask for your data to be deleted (or your sample to be destroyed) at any time. Instructions for how to do that are [here](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Deleting-Your-Ancestry-Account).

There are lots of reasons people take DNA tests and they’re all personal. Some people hope to discover new family (my neighbor found his biological dad!), or new things about themselves and history (turns out I’m 99% Jewish, and likely to have curly hair). We want to help people trust us when they go on that journey with us and we’ve developed government response policies as a key part of that effort.

As a final note: all the protections we’ve put in place apply when the data’s in our hands -- but since you own the data, you’re free to download it, delete it, etc. Some cold case solves have gotten a lot of attention, but those have been done with open source databases that have really different protection systems than ours (like GEDmatch). The flip side of customer data ownership is, since you own it, you can do whatever you want with it -- including posting it places that could be less secure :( 

>Also, for how many generations could a sample be used to identify their offspring?

This is actually a really interesting question so I wanted to give it special attention. Although you pass on 50% of DNA to your offspring, that doesn’t mean they’re exactly 25% of each of their 4 grandparents -- because you aren’t passing on exactly half the DNA you got from your mom and dad when you pass on your half. Over time, just because of that fun random bit of inheritance, you become less and less related to your direct descendants. In fact, you can even be genealogically related (e.g., you’re in their family tree) but not genetically related to your progeny. A professor at UC Davis (where I did my bachelors’!), Graham Coop, has written extensively about this and I highly recommend his blog posts on the matter: [https://gcbias.org/2017/12/19/1628/](https://gcbias.org/2017/12/19/1628/)

I'm a data architect.  I speak from four decades of experience.  There are NO data that are 100% safe from misuse or misappropriation.  Genetic data is literally the most personal data that exists.  
  
Decentralization and encryption are both based on one thing: trust.  Someone has to *trust* that the encryption is secure and impenetrable.  Someone has to *trust* that the decentralization and anonymizing is sufficient to decouple information from the associated PII.  
  
The problem comes in where a corporation, researcher, or government dismisses any level of distrust as anti-progress or fearmongering.  To you, a researcher and corporate entity, no level of distrust would be sufficient to dissuade you from going down this path.  This thread, in fact, is fairly useless in that regard.  It's a foregone concolusion: You've decided to do this, and all that's left is the execution of that idea.  
  
Genetic data, unfortunately, is not opt-in OR opt-out.  If a close relation gives up his genetic data willingly, he gives up yours regardless of whether you want that or not.  
  
So you have the absolutely trifecta of issues: you'll never be able to secure this data from misuse or misappropriation.  You'll never stop collecting it no matter how much people disagree with your doing so.  And no one on the planet has the ability to opt-out.

When you first sign up, you answer survey questions which you use to collect points. The points can later be redeemed towards free DNA testing, amazon gift cards and a couple other choices. The survey questions revolve around general health and fitness - on average, how many hours do you sleep, how physically active are you, what type of activity, are you on any medications, have you ever been diagnosed with a rare disease, etc.

My guess then is that researchers query the database of these survey questions (I.e. I am interested in questions 7, 10, and 15, and I want to see people who answered x for my control group and people who answered y for my subject group). They get anonymize tester ids that would be assigned to you when you create your account (i.e. user 6B3Fhe56) with a method to message the account belonging to that ID with an invitation to disclose DNA data to the study. 

Disclaimer, like I said I don’t work for nebula but I have worked as a database programmer in the research field and this is how we have programmed similarly styled research programs. ",NotMyInternet,t2_y7mdx,3,0,reddit1

e9zkfcj,t1_e9w3eq3,2018-11-18 19:41:00,science,"Academia hasn't existed for millennia. I said the institutions wanted to turn a profit, but if you consider professors a branch, they tend to forgo more profitable opportunities. Another more classical impetus was prestige. 

However, universities even a couple hundred years ago weren't profitable per se, or weren't established in for that purpose. They used to rely more on patronage. In the United States puritan universities such as Harvard were founded to train ministers, which is not so different from European universities evolving from Catholic schools (the first in the 1200's). Universities were funded by the colony and later endowments. Being an academic in this time carried social status but tended to still be the an exercise for the wealthy and middle class, stepping down income potential. While the US changed some of this trend with land grant universities like Penn State, founding universities on trying to spread engineering and agricultural knowledge, the largest shift in universities didn't occur until the 21st century. Here is where an explosive growth in Universities occurred, shifting the purpose of Universities into training people for more commercialized professions. In one generation enrollment increased by a factor of 10. The GI bill further increased the enrollment as well as the Sally Mae loan program, which was privatized later albeit temporary. During this second half of the century is when you here about the explosive tuition growth as well as textbook price increases. Despite this increase, the real growth on the university end was in the number of administrators. For profit universities began in the 1970's in earnest with enrollment going from .2% of degree seekers to 12% in the 2000's. Universities have changed and have developed new high wage positions while Associate professors and post-docs go through hell. A classic example was at Columbia which came to light when an instructor was fired for being paid less than the janitor. Universities went from needing to be propped up by other organizations to being capable of collecting funding on their own through requesting donations to collecting tuition.

I can’t tell whether we’re heading closer to Gattaca or 1984 by Orwell.

As far as production increase, studies have shown that change in a work environment tends to increase productivity.  One study tried to prove that increasing the level of lighting, say 10%, would improve productivity.  It did, and they figured the case was proved.

Then as a control factor, they decreased the light by, I believe, the same 10%.  Worker production also increased due to the lower level of light. My understanding is that,  it wasn't the altered levels light that increase  productivity,  it was the fact that a change in their working environment had occurred.  Apparently, a change in working conditions, is what causes the improvement in productivity, so..

If I took my office and one day put lots of plants around the workers. Their environment would be changed. Productivity should increase due to that change, not just the fact that there are now live plants around them. At least, that's how I understood the studies outcome. IDK

That being said.  I love having living plants all around me here at home.  I know that, for me,  the addition of having, beautiful, lush, living plants all around my house, has definitely brought a lot of joy and happiness to me. I love it.... :  ) ",bitcoinjohnny,t2_dm7tl,37,0,reddit2

I don't have the numbers on me, but there is research done by NASA that supports this article. I think some people in this thread are right with their guesses of workplace productivity by mentioning that the work conditions are better. Rarely will offices bring in and maintain these plants, but they will contract outside sources, like my company, to do this for them. I do think that other than the direct benefits having green plants in the workplace, outside factors such as a company doing well enough to afford plantscaping services is likely doing well enough to avoid layoffs, for example. 

Most of these plants have been bred to do well without much light. Most common indoor plants won't flower, and we pluck the parts like the stamen that do reproduce for people who may have allergies. 

My own personal opinion is that interior plants do have some positive health benefits. Whether there is anything to it or not, I have been less sick this year than any other year while being around many new people everyday at work, which includes hospitals, universities, and office spaces.

Lean is about eliminating waste(plants would not be waste), putting a focus on the customer, producing efficiently(flow, rate of demand), and inventory control. In many implementations, such as mine, it is also about a culture of employee driven management where leaders support the employees as opposed to a 'top-down' hierarchy.

Suggesting that plants can boost productivity by 15% is absurd. I think it is a great way to decorate the office and make the employees feel more at ease. I would think a 1-2% boost(which is great).

Some even built whole office buildings *around* elaborate gardens in which employees can relax and/or work on their laptops. We also have a right to be able to see outside through a window from our desk. I know, it sounds crazy, but i'm not making this up. That's the more important reason why this building was built that way.

I notice that when I first purchase something, I'm always super careful with it. When I get a new car, I keep it spotless for the first couple of months, but then eventually I fall into old habits (leaving wrappers / receipts on the floor, empty cans in the console, etc); when I first bought a PS3, I handled the controller like a newborn baby. Now I just toss it across the floor when I'm done using it (note: I don't ever do that with actual newborn babies). When I get a new pair of shoes, I'll clean them every couple weeks, but then after a few months I'll literally never clean them again. 

Anyway, the point is not that I start neglecting stuff or abusing it. I don't. It's just, when I first acquire something, there's always this temporary period of elation and excitement that consists of me keeping it in immaculate condition.

I wonder if the plants-in-the-office experiment had a similar effect: a temporary high that would eventually fade away. The lighting experiment you mentioned would seem to corroborate that. In any event, I'm *extremely* skeptical of the idea that adding plants boosts productivity by *that* much. That's an enormous boost, and I refuse to believe it's permanent. ",,,4,0,reddit2

Edit: Having skimmed the paper, it looks like the causal inference is sound. They studied the effects of plants in three different offices.

Pre- and post-decoration measurements of all participants showed the beneficial effects of the plants.

Basically, scrounge around. See what people leave on curbs, it's crazy what you can find in nice neighborhoods the night before garbage pickup. You can also ask around on your local subreddit to find gardeners, craigslist and freecycle for free pots stuff, etc. You can also go to paint sections of big box stores to look for custom paint mixes that people decided that they didn't like after all, they'll be cheap. For the buckets to be used as pots you may need to puncture a few holes on the sides near the bottom, you can just hammer in a nail or melt with a heated screwdriver.

Adults don't stop developing socially and cognitively after childhood, so I don't see why adults would remain unaffected.

And there's a number of possible reasons for the benefits of greenery. Some of it may be physiological like better air quality, or cognitive like a stronger sense of empathy and meaning in the world. Being constantly exposed to a sanitized world that pours concrete and asphalt over most living things in an urban environment limits our experience empathizing with anything but humans.

The two methods are to make clones of the data across all nodes, or distribute the data across different nodes, having a few nodes keep copies of data and hope X amount of nodes storing file Z don't happen to go down in the same instant. 

The first method requires every machine to dedicate huge amounts of space, but is very safe.  The second method is more space efficient, but is more risky.  It could also suffer slow speeds if too many clients try to access a single file.  

It's safer to just have dedicated servers with periodic backups, which cost money for electricity and maintenance.

Try to avoid over-saturating the soil with too much water. Add enough water so that the roots are soaked, but only enough that the soil is able to hold.

Over watered plants show a lot of the same symptoms that under watered plants do. If your plant looks ""thirsty"" but the soil is wet, then it has been over watered. 

Pots with drainage also help prevent over watering, as excess water drains out of the soil. You use such pots in an in door setting so long as you have a dish underneath them to catch any runoff. ",felixjawesome,t2_4clp4,2,0,reddit2

People who want productive office workers?

It's not like it never happened. I had a private office as a system administrator in the 90s. Even before I had a private office, I shared a larger office with one other person. Office spaces were designed around...offices. That's why they were called office buildings.

Then, it became all cubicles with full height walls, then a few years later they made the walls half-height. Then they took the cubicle walls away completely. Then after that, they removed cubicles and just put as all in rows of desks in a giant open incredibly noisy space.

http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap

> In June, 1997, a large oil and gas company in western Canada asked a group of psychologists at the University of Calgary to monitor workers as they transitioned from a traditional office arrangement to an open one. The psychologists assessed the employees’ satisfaction with their surroundings, as well as their stress level, job performance, and interpersonal relationships before the transition, four weeks after the transition, and, finally, six months afterward. **The employees suffered according to every measure: the new space was disruptive, stressful, and cumbersome, and, instead of feeling closer, coworkers felt distant, dissatisfied, and resentful. Productivity fell.**

You don't have to store all of the data on each node, just make sure that there are a large handful of copies of each piece of data that are well distributed geographically.

If you use a peer-to-peer system and require users to allot say, 5GB minimum for ""seeding"" storage (the contents of which would be determined by the network's needs), you would have an enormously resilient and redundant worldwide network. Most of the journals I download are PDFs under 15MB. Assuming a peer chooses the minimum amount of storage, each node can hold thousands of issues. 5GB is nothing nowadays, I'd probably let it use at least 50GB, as would most other people with a semi-modern desktop, because external hard drives are essentially free right now.

If a technology like that pops up offering open access to research, then academia, the private sector, and a sizeable number of people from the general public would sign up in a heartbeat. You'd have millions of nodes storing hundreds of copies of each issue of each journal across petabytes of storage, distributed all around the world.

Browning of the tips can also be nutrient burn. If you are using too much fertilizer, it can actually burn the ends of leaves. Likewise, not enough fertilizer can cause spotting as well. See the link below for a chart of nutrient problem.

A rigid environment has drawbacks, like lack of creativity/innovation and a high employee turnover, but are usually very efficient and cost minimizing.

Workplaces that have a relaxed dress code usually have a more open/creative corporate culture. Being more comfortable helps with creativity and innovation/care for the corporation, but can be far less efficient and can be much slower paced.

How expensive was it 20 years ago? And 30 years ago, and 50 years ago? How expensive was going through existing offices and tearing down pre-existing walls, how expensive has it been to replace full-height cubicle walls with half-height ones, then to replace the half-height walls, then to replace the cubicles with desks? I can tell you that one actually because I know from my own company experience. They spend upwards of $60,000 on parts and labor to redesign the cubicles across two floors to lower cubicle walls from half-height to zero-height. With some additional loss of productivity from needing to make every worker relocate their desk twice over a three month period to accommodate reconstruction.

How expensive is more workers being sick? How expensive is more workers having low morale? How expensive is having more workers producing less work?

> Because if the reason is increased well-being of workers than that decreased productivity will just have to be accepted.

Where the heck do you get ""increased well being"" from? Did you even read the half-dozen research results mentioned in just that one NYT article?

> Compared with standard offices, employees experienced more uncontrolled interactions, higher levels of stress, and lower levels of concentration and motivation. 

> n a 2005 study that looked at organizations ranging from a Midwest auto supplier to a Southwest telecom firm, researchers found that the ability to control the environment had a significant effect on team cohesion and satisfaction. When workers couldn’t change the way that things looked, adjust the lighting and temperature, or choose how to conduct meetings, spirits plummeted.

> as the number of people working in a single room went up, the number of employees who took sick leave increased apace. Workers in two-person offices took an average of fifty per cent more sick leave than those in single offices, while those who worked in fully open offices were out an average of sixty-two per cent more.

> The psychologist Nick Perham, who studies the effect of sound on how we think, has found that office commotion impairs workers’ ability to recall information, and even to do basic arithmetic

> In a study by the Cornell University psychologists Gary Evans and Dana Johnson, clerical workers who were exposed to open-office noise for three hours had increased levels of epinephrine—a hormone that we often call adrenaline, associated with the so-called fight-or-flight response. What’s more, Evans and Johnson discovered that people in noisy environments made fewer ergonomic adjustments than they would in private, causing increased physical strain. 


It just goes on and on. There is no good research that finds open office environments to be beneficial to employees *or* businesses.

> Most open plans have noise dampening walls, though

*Walls*? In an open space the size of a warehouse? It takes a lot more than walls.

The whole ""open office"" concept was invented by Germans a few decades ago. It's not the way things have always been nor the way they have to be, and it is one of the worst examples of business executives being 100% resistant to actual evidence that counters their beliefs.

Are all sunscreens (assuming same SPF) equally effective?

As a smaller start-up CRO, does your company have its own vivarium facilities to perform in vivo studies in-house, or is that stage of drug development carried out by other larger CROs?

If you do, can you speak to the challenges of establishing a new live animal facility, IACUC, AAALAC certification, and approval by the various state and federal regulating agencies?

If not, how do you convince a client to contract their in vitro work with you and in vivo work with another CRO, vs. having all stages of development and testing done by a single CRO that is able to provide both?

* **Framing:**

    * There has been a lot in the popular press of late about how a new wave of general purpose robots (both hardware and software) able to learn and adapt will eliminate all kinds of jobs.  Of course one class of job that robots (without hard AI) can never eliminate is the Entrepreneur.  Further, an other consequence of the coming robot revolution that it may soon be much more possible for a single person to start up a company with few or no other employees, but rather rely upon robots for a number of ancillary functions (legal, benefits, physical plant maintenance etc).  Thus while robots may reduce the number of traditional jobs they may also increase the opportunities for entrepreneurship.

* **Questions:**

    * When you were starting out, how much value would you have received from not having to worry about all of the ancillary aspects of running a business and just focus upon developing your product and pitching it to customers?

Awhile back my dad got really, really bad poison oak. Like bad enough for him to have to go and get some heavy antihistamines and some kind of steroids to keep it contained from spreading and to eventually go away. 

The problem is, before he went and got the medication, he had run amuck through our entire onslaught of anti-poison oak/ivy stuff, and had essentially contaminated it all, not to my knowledge. 

So i end up using some tea tree oil that he contaminated, specifically near my nether regions to get rid of a lone chigger. So, by doing this, it being in my nether regions, and it, uhh, being so very sensitive and sweaty, spread like wildfire. So now its basically everywhere below my waist. The weird thing is though, is that its dormant. As in, it doesnt itch. At all. It only gets irritated after i get out of a shower. And even that is brief. 

Ive tried using tonnes of different at-home methods for getting rid of it but nothing seems to work. I just recently ordered phenolenated calamine lotion and i'm hoping that will do something.

The things I wish to ask you, is what do you know about the pathology of, and potential for treatment of chronic eczema? As someone who grew up with severe nut allergies, and asthma, I've found out first hand over the past couple years that it can trigger eczema as well. Since then I've been in a not so pleasant ride involving the eczema slowly spreading from my elbows to the entirety of my arms, causing itching and scarring, as well as some patches on my forehead, around the eyes, and around my mouth/chin area. Classically these types of skin problems are treated simply with a topical steroid, but that doesn't treat the pathological root of the disease: which seems to be sort of a perfect storm between autoimmune function and environmental factors; and such a treatment has many negative long term effects.

What can one do to identify and minimize exposure to the causes and triggers of eczema, and what kind of skin care products should we be looking at to help strengthen the skin and build a resistance in the interests of remission? What can be done to help heal the skin from the effects of previously suffered disease? Also, what do you think of using something like olive oil to condition the skin, scalp and hair?

In addition, I have several ideas I wish to begin pursuing with the potential of going into a high-tech based scientific products/services provider.

The lack of information or misinformation about the epidermis is pretty wild. Most dermatologists have gone to the lengths of prescribing anxiety and other medication related to mental health as a method of coping. Since there is very little they can do.

I had responded to this during the formal hour - but it seems with my internet issues, my response was not posted.
There is a rich diversity of botanical material that comprises molecular entities that might have beneficial effects, of one sort or another, on our skin. However, one of the issues that we wrestle with when considering such natural extracts is the intrinsic variability in the samples. The concentration of compound that is active in the extract (or compounds – in many cases there is a combination effect) will vary from one plant to another, from one harvest to another, from one processing and storage method to another. It is rare for a botanical extract to come with any assaying of the nature and concentrations of its active principles, at the discrete molecule species level. 
Hence we are not surprised when encouraging results with one sample are difficult to reproduce with another.
From your description, it sounds like this would be a drug product, subject to the rigors of the FDA approval process. Part of this entails demonstrating safety and efficacy, but part also entails demonstrating, under the chemistry manufacturing and controls “(CMC”) requirements, the reproducibility of the product.

The consensus in the scientific literature is that for a molecule to be able to permeate to a substantial degree through the skin, it must be small (less than some 450 Da in molecular weight) and slightly lipophilic (with the log of the octanol-water partition coefficient, logP, of around 2-3). If you look at all of the passive transdermal drug products on the market, the drugs within them conform reasonably with these criteria. We do work with molecules outside these traditional norms, and for at least some we have reasonable success, but these are at best peptides, <2k in molecular weight.

There are several reports describing the transdermal permeation of much larger molecules, even proteins. There is no consensus on how (or even if) this can happen. And, if such permeation is detectable, the ‘utilization’, that is the proportion of the compound in the formulation that is described as becoming bioavailable is small. 
For collagen with a molecular weight north of 100kDa, then, the odds are really stacked against being able to permeate the skin, intact, to any significant degree. Hence, until we see definitive data to the contrary, I remain unconvinced relative to transdermal collagen delivery. 

Our skin is intended to be a good barrier; if there were ready diffusion of molecules of that size, we would be leaking collagen all over the place.

Rather, there is an MPE, or much more typically, a combination of MPEs (which we term multiplexed MPEs, MMPEs) that works best for a given active. And that combination will usually not work nearly as well for a next active.

As we can't predict ahead of time which will work best, we need to make measurements, and we prefer to make lots of measurements, so that rather than trying a handful of formulation compositions, in our Cascaded Screening approach we might look at a few hundred formulation compositions.",AmerChemSocietyAMA,t2_ollxg,3,0,reddit3

I do now appreciate better how important the people aspect is. In any start up there will be tough times, times when you are away for long hours from family and personal interests. If you are not working with people that you trust, respect, and enjoy being around, it can make those hours considerably less enjoyable.

If we know that delivery of a given molecular agent into the dermis, or into the vasculature for systemic availability, will have a beneficial physiological effect, yet the intrinsic permeability is very low, then use of an approach like a derma-roller or a microneedle array might be suggested.
This argument, though, would not necessarily apply to a product that is intended for application to intact skin. If you apply such a product to abraded or punctured skin, how would you know which types of molecules in the product would now move in greater quantity into the skin?

However, there are many reports that describe delivery into and through the skin of very much larger molecules, even if the 'utilization', the proportion of the  molecule applied that becomes bioavailable is very small.

As chemists, we appreciate that different ingredients in formulation may react with each other and the rate of this reaction will almost always increase with temperature (about 2-fold for each 10 degree C temperature rise).

But that being said, as our societies continue to be bound, milked and raped by huge financial institutions, **scientists themselves need to make research more accessible to the average citizen**. Let’s look at some related scenarios.

NOTE: I use the term ""science"" liberally here to imply any field that involves fact-based, objective research.



**Average Joe’s first encounter with news about ground-breaking research**

Oh, some ground breaking article was published in some research journal today which conclusively proves that evolution is real *and* global warming is happening? If you’re an average Joe you won't know about it until the news hits the mainstream press (no, this does not apply to you, slightly above average Joe). The news will typically have a headline along the lines of ""Researchers claim to have solved ... mystery"" or ""Scientists finally crack ... code"" or ""More proof for …""
 
In all likeliness, your favourite news source, average Joe, will have only wanted to cover the news in the first place *not* because it’s important, but because *its competitors would be covering it*. See how cheesy the headline is? Who’d ever want to read that? No wonder your favourite news source’s editor had the good sense of pushing it as far away from the front page as possible. On top, s/he might have had a sneaking suspicion that her/his co-worker who wrote the news has no real clue what the news is about, because that co-worker isn’t really a science nut (plus it shows in said news). Hence, making a big fuss about this earth-shattering discovery could entirely backfire and end up being a source of embarrassment for the editor and the news source itself. Any enthusiasm expressed in the news is thus toned down for the sake of ""professionalism"" and ""avoiding sensationalism"".

Which is why if you do happen to read the news (most likely you’ll stop at the headline), you’ll have a fleeting good feeling knowing that some good research happened, but that’s about it because you won’t really get what the research is about.

Behind the scenes, since the research findings were actually published weeks ago, people whose self-interests are threatened by it – typically a wide range of social and financial institutions – will retaliate in their own kind. University scholarships will be quietly pulled. Department funds will be cut. Researchers hired or contracted by companies with contrasting interests will be under fire to publish papers which overturn or at least try to disprove the findings. Neighbors will be shunned by their local church. Professional and personal tensions will fluctuate throughout the world among a wide cross-section of people, seemingly at random. Thus rolls the world.



**Average Joe’s second encounter with news about the ground-breaking research**

Later on in the day talk shows and discussion panels and late night shows will all pick up the news and make a big fuss about it. Chaos breeds ratings, and here’s a gold rush for the taking: you get to make really funny jokes about right-wing nutjobs, or verbally bring those damn atheists to their knees, or simply bemoan the government because it’s not doing enough to bolster the moral/scientific fibre of society, depending on which side of the boat you’re on.    

While flipping channels, average Joe, you’ll pause and listen to your favourite ""expert"", because you suddenly remember that news you read in the morning and want to know more about it; or just because you remember having read the news but had actually only read the headline, but it makes you feel like you can relate to your favourite expert a tiny bit more and that delights you unconsciously.

Your expert tries his/her best, and by the time you finally flip channels you’ve taken his/her word as the Word on the matter, or simply forget about the ground-breaking research altogether, now that your thirst for infotainment has been quenched. That’s when you meet slightly above average Joe – typically a co-worker of yours. He’s always serious about being serious. He has copies of New Scientist on his desk, or is at least frequently seen surfing Yahoo! Science. You’ve met him in the elevator, so you have to talk to him about something. Just to be polite.

You mention the news you read. He immediately points out what a huge discovery this is, and how this is old news, and how this other research also proves this and that and that… By the time you step out of the door you haven’t taken in any of the information he spewed out. You’re exhausted. You promise yourself that the next time you see this guy you’re going to keep it curt, just to avoid a lecture. Thusly you eject the news of the ground-shattering research from your brain, until…   



**Average Joe’s third encounter with news about the ground-breaking research**

The scientists involved in the research get a Nobel Prize 20 years later. You’re older and have time to read this kind of news now. Maybe you vaguely remember the news from 20 years ago. Or slightly above average Joe making such a fuss about it. Maybe.



**End scientific bureaucracy. Make science accessible to the average Joe, both as a citizen and a potential independent researcher.**

As a society, we’re inclined to sideline scientists because very often research doesn’t bring in money. We humans are remarkably short-sighted, so it’s no surprise that we rarely celebrate anything that doesn’t have immediate implications. But scientists have a *huge* role in this mess – they largely continue to be enablers to the un-scienced, commercialized masses. Far too often, they don’t stand up for what’s right.  

The world is now dangerously overpopulated, and as a species we’re closer to the brink of destruction than ever before. How come there hasn’t been an Occupy-style movement led by scientists yet? No, I don’t mean human microphones and mandatory unanimous voting to decide headband colours, but the *spirit* of Occupy. That overwhelming belief that something needs to be done, and can be.

But even before a science-centric Occupy-style movement can happen, *science needs to be more relatable to the average Joe*. (Once again, by ""science"" I mean any field which employs and produces objective data.) It’s an open secret that independent research is generally scoffed at by the academia, anywhere in the world – if you don’t have some sort of academic training in the field, good luck getting a paper published. It gets worse. You must at least have a PhD or really good references to even be considered for publication by a top-notch journal. On top, every journal seems to follow a different citation style, and the slightest bibliographical blunder can push your paper back into the pipeline.



**How come we don’t have a global platform for publishing research online yet? Something that:**
 
•	The average Joe can access (as user-friendly as Wikipedia)

•	Is peer reviewed (think r/AskHistorians)
 
•	Has a simple citation style (which that doesn’t require more than 10 mins to learn)
  

Now, wouldn’t that be awesome?

The values selected for inputs are carefully chosen to skew results into something more attractive to the various VPs.  Also, what results they choose to show, as well.  Unfortunately, I don't have control over my work once it has left my desk, but I always write a very in-depth list of assumptions so people can understand in what way the results will be biased.

If an article is published is there any room for recourse from others who have performed similar studies?

If my article is published anyway is there a way for other researchers in the area to draw attention to this? Being a psychology student I'm particularly curious about drawing conclusions from the results, as I've already read a number of articles where the authors are somewhat overzealous in the applications of their results.

*Doctors and patients need good scientific evidence to make informed decisions. But instead, companies run bad trials on their own drugs, which distort and exaggerate the benefits by design. When these trials produce unflattering results, the data is simply buried. All of this is perfectly legal. In fact, even government regulators withhold vitally important data from the people who need it most. Doctors and patient groups have stood by too, and failed to protect us. Instead, they take money and favours, in a world so fractured that medics and nurses are now educated by the drugs industry.*

The reason it may not be a good idea for other fields of study is because most research works are more dynamic than clinical trials.  Imagine a scientist trying to make a lab-grown kidney function in vitro.  She can't make it work, until by a stroke of inspiration, she alters one minor culturing parameter. She then excitedly submits her manuscript to the publisher, but is turned down because the modification in her method isn't part of the original proposal on which her study's registration was based.  The example is simplistic and may be a little exaggerated, but the point is that this sort of policy, although originally well-meaning, can become stifling to research.  In such cases, the community may be better served by peer reviewed publication of null results.

Most stats courses drill it into you quite nicely, and grad-level methodology courses will make you feel as if you'll never discover anything that can't be conclusively disproven.

Publication bias is casually discussed. People are trying to figure out ways to correct for it, mathematically, by doing funky meta-analysis. Groups are starting up journals specifically for negative results, so as to reduce the bias towards positive results.

I think science is VERY good at self-correcting. It's kind of a two-steps forward, one step back situation - it gets there, but it does make mistakes along the way.

Unfortunately, the media doesn't deal with that very well at all. The media works with hype, factoids, and doesn't like to deal with uncertainty.

These 3 are used to promote the drug candidate to more advanced phases of clinical trials and eventually to release in the market. In this scenario, not publishing the null result is not only bad conduct of science, it is also criminal.

Great.  You can probably generate about 5,000 papers just by doing ""the effects of of low-frequency magnetic fields on <blank>"".  But honestly, nobody is going to care a whole lot until you find something that goes against the default expectation that LF magnetic fields do not interact with tissue.

Studies such as that *can* be interesting if there is something that at least suggests such a correlation.  Then, a negative result would actually disprove the proposed theory.  But in general, most null results are far less interesting than positive results.

Peer reviewing is good for a multitude of reasons. I am publishing myself, since I am a PhD student. It allows for people to be able to reproduce results, clarify any results, clarify any procedural elements, etc. The reason some people can get away with it is because the reviewers they use for the journals they publish to are rubbish.

Now, let me make this clear: there are people who publish wrong or incomplete results. The difference between academia and commercial industry, for example, tends to be with impact. You can publish trash and have it never have it be cited, or in other words, have it be effectively dead. If you have it published and people cite it, more people besides reviewers will be looking at your report, and will be open to much more scrutiny. In academia, if you are found to have fabricated results, you are screwed. No one will cite you anymore, no one will pay attention. You are effectively out of a job.

In medical science, the rules are a bit more flexible because a lot of experimental work is subject to bias. Using a different pig, or using a different excitation spot can change results. Chemicals work differently for each person, etc. That's why statistics are important.

Additionally, when studies try to eliminate variables that may skew results away from the direction they want the results to go, it's pretty obvious. Shoddy methodology can be seen in the abstract of the study and peer review helps discredit poorly executed studies.

It's almost like creating a bias, or goal to achieve those results which is why so many studies show even people that have no motivation one way or another still end up structuring the data to favor their hypothesis. It's somewhat like conspiracy theories... asking questions is perfectly fine... but so many of them say X is happening, then look for proof that X is happening, instead of just trying to actually figure out what is happening. You've created your bias and are looking for confirmation bias... in other words trying to create your own confirmation bias by attempting to create and demonstrate the facts. The way our brains work tend to favor that kind of methodology. 

That's not to say many many great discoveries in conspiracies and science don't come about that way. Most science starts with something anecdotal and then someone wanting to test to see if it's true. The other downfall is that it leads to a bit of corruption and is a very inefficient way to collect and analyze data... I see so many studies that come out that twist one tiny part of the information that is in favor or beneficial. This isn't a real example... but I've seen things structured in the exact same say, but, you get someone studying a food or chemical... and they will publish a report with the conclusion saying something like ""X increases absorbency of vitamins B, C, and Omega 3s"" then neglect to tell you that it ended up reducing liver function and even downplay or completely omit mentioning it unless you go look at the raw data.

Person A's defense does not have to prove his innocence, they just have to prove that he's *not* guilty. When a scientist gets a null result, he cannot prove his claim, and so logic says he must accept the status quo hypothesis. However, a null result does not *prove* the status quo either.

Example: Suppose the status quo scientific thought believes that the world is flat. You decide to conduct an experiment where you throw a rock as hard as you can, theorizing that if the world is round the rock will orbit around and hit you in the back. You throw the rock and your experiment flops when the rock only goes 30 ft. You can't conclude that the world is round. Your experiment doesn't prove the world is flat either (but you have to accept that it is, because you don't have any better results). You've produced a null result.

Which leads to my second point — nobody wants to go through the publishing process when there is no certainty in their results. It's long and takes effort. Also, many people are trying to publish their results (and they're actual results) but get rejected.

Lastly, if you can with certainty *disprove* your own theory, I would not call that a null result.

When I was taking a 3rd year statistics course as part of an engineering degree program. We had a semester project. You were to submit a proposal on a simple study to conduct some statistical analysis on. Once accepted you were then to gather the data and write up a report using Matlab and all that sort of thing (this was in the late 90s).  I proposed an experiment with several trials of rolling dice with various numbers of sides. I was going to have multiple people do the same set of dice rolling trials. Then I would have the same group redo the dice rolling in the same manner with the only change being the person was visualizing rolling high numbers. 

Of course my plan was to do all kinds of detailed analysis on a null result. Instead I get called into the professors office and threatened to be failed on the assignment for mocking the scientific method. His anger persisted even after I was discussing my interest in looking at null statistical results. He insisted I do a project that would a have clear ""winner"" or a strong correlation in the results. 

I did the project on ping times on 3 dial up ISPs at 3 different times of day. This was way less effort than rolling and recording dice rolls hundreds of times. I got an A on the report.",MyUserNameIsLongerTh,t2_8qukc,13,0,reddit4

Publishing results takes a long time, and cuts massively into your research.  No one I known would want to their publish null results, even though there are options (PloS One only requiers the science be correct, and doesn't care about impact).

Null results are also usually incomplete.  I might do a pilot experiment to see if an experiment looks promising.  If it fails, it may be for any number of reasons.  I likely not work as hard to characterize a negative result if I could be doing something more interesting with my time.

Reading null results would be the most dull series of papers this world has known.  Sure, a database of null results sounds interesting, but I don't want to spend my day reading about a lack of correlation between two genes.

Review already takes long enough, we don't want null results clogging the pipeline.  

Though it would be useful to know all negative results in your field, progress would grind to a pretty slow halt if everyone had to publish every result that they had.  Your lab knows your negative results, most people are willing to talk about them to pretty much anyone.

Yup, it's what I think it means.

Whenever you interpret data, you have to work around the reality that there is no one true answer for any scientific question, and your interpretation is going to be somewhat affected by personal biases.  It's really hard, for instance, to go into an experiment or study not having an idea of how it may play out, and there's a desire to see it play out the way you thought in the data, e.g. if you're doing a food science study and you, as an individual, believe that GMO foods are no more harmful than ""normal"" foods, you may downplay any difference as insignificant when looking at your data.  Perhaps the most common bias is wanting to see a simple explanation for a phenomenon that might not be so simple.  Scientists *want* their data to be linear or normal so that it's easier to write a formula to predict the phenomenon's behavior, and they may ignore some variability that could be explained by including other factors in order to write a simpler model.",,,1,0,reddit4

Actually, null results are great if you can find out about them. In each lab I have worked in, at least one conversation has come up bemoaning the fact that there is no ""Journal of the Null Hypothesis"" or the like. Not because we want to publish in it, but because after a while and reading enough papers and making no progress, you begin to get the impression that *someone, somewhere* must have already done what you are doing and it failed.

Knowing that in advance would save time, energy, and money, but the current issue is that there is that there is nowhere to publish a negative result.

That said, a null hypothesis is supposed to be tested against an actual hypothesis, so that is probably where your professor had a problem - he just wanted you to do a basic statistical analysis, and you were thinking a bit too far outside of what he wanted.

The Chinese academic community for example have a very, very bad reputation of shamelessly misreporting results and failing to peer review their studies.

Money factors into this problem too, but not in the way you'd immediately expect. The pharmaceutical industry is absolutely massive, and this depends greatly on the development of new drugs. Investing in research for a new application towards treating a disease costs literally billions of dollars. There is an incredible amount of pressure to clear the new drug through trials and move it into production as quickly as possible. 

This means that if one set of trial results isn't favourable the managers in charge of development will simply hire a new team of researchers and re run the tests under appropriately altered conditions again and again until a group comes back with something they want to hear. It rarely boils down to amoral biologists or chemists accepting bribes like you seem to be implying here. There are controls in place to ensure that there are no more disasters like that fiasco with thalidomide in the 70s.

As a side note, I'd like to add that one of the reasons there's a disproportionate amount of biology compared to physics students is likely due to the lack of theoretical maths.

The softness of a science isn't determined by the presence of math as if it were binary, because *every* science uses stats, even the social sciences which are amongst the softest (When I mentioned math as a hard science I was referring to the field of mathematics). I'll also let you know that I actually love biology because it seems so stuck in the middle of the soft and hard sciences. It makes interpretation of data very interesting, since generalizations aren't laws, but historical relics of evolution. I'm just contrasting this against Physics mostly, where everything (I presume) is reducible to basic principles without having to simulate the entirety of the Universe. 

Of course, this isn't black and white. You can't very well do any biochemistry without worrying about moles and stoichiometry and dilutions, all of which involves math. Similarly, you can model the effect of social factors in behavior in the social sciences in a mathematical way. I really think the 'hard' distinction has something more to do with law like generalizations, but there are also methodological differences. Dealing with diseases in biology is difficult because we are always so focused (or limited) on current paradigms that I think it represents a real methodological shortcoming compared to physics.

Sorry for my implication but I was thinking of scientists who work in the medical-adjacent fields because it's a job versus scientists who work in the fields because it's their dreams. Scientists who want to keep their jobs would do as you pointed out.. interpreting data in a sort of way because they know their company expects a certain result.

As for your last paragraph, I don't know how true this actually is. To be honest, it's not like we don't have a lot of interested students trying to get into physics. We also accept a fair amount of them. However, the truth is that there simply isn't much beyond academia for physicists (industry is more likely to hire us as engineers-with-a-different-approach and defense is.. well, it's not something that most physicists prefer) to have relevant careers in. On the other hand, biology and chemistry have tons of industry positions (relatively) because their research is closer to application than our research is. The same goes for condensed matter physicists (whose pigeonholing is probably going to be rewarded because of their close distance to application).

Basically, I just want to point out that it's not because of accessibility, but rather, a matter of weighing endgame percentages. People working for their physics phds without being super geniuses (ie. people like me) are just idiots chasing a dream, knowing that our post-phd careers will most likely be outside of physics research.

A good example would be a drug called Tamiflu.

To this day (as far as I know), no government agency or the company that produces Tamiflu, Roche, will say why they think this drug would prevent such a thing. This is billions of dollars being spent with a ""trust us"" attitude. On top of this, there is also the story of the EMA (UK's version of the FDA) refusing to give study data for years on two diet drugs called orlistat and rimonabant, because it wanted ""to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies"". Eventually, they said fine, we'll give you the studies, but we have to censor out the ""confidential patient information"". A link to what they sent can be found below. Also, the FDA's website for searching clinical trials is incredibly outdated and does not work, yet they say everything can be found online. This is not the case.

It allows for future scientists to build on the research without repeating experiments that are a waste of time and money.  Additionally, certain inferences can be drawn from null results.  If you find that a certain organism isn't responding to a blue stimulus, or responds at a level that does not produce a statistically significant result then you can possibly infer that either they do not possess the ability to see blue or that they might not even possess the ability to react to visual stimulus.  From there you can further expand by repeating with a red stimulus and then if that does not produce results you could move onto vibrations or other stimulus that are not visual.  That was a simplified example.  But if a scientist studying the same organism were to read your null result on blue stimulus he would know that it is not advisable to use a blue stimulus in his experiment.

My point was that while null results are important for building on research, there might be a better method to present them than the standard journal format.  An introduction section might be pointless as those researching the null results would likely be well acquainted with the subject.  Hence my suggestion to make supplemental information sections more important in null result papers.  I did kind of backpedal though because obviously it would need an abstract, then methods so it can be repeatable, and a discussion could also be important to interpret the findings...but the fact that there is a massive amount of experiments with null results (or that should have null results) would make large journal articles on them difficult even for scientists to read.

caj0lf1,t1_caj01vj,2013-06-14 20:28:12,science,"I also have a degree in physics, now working in cancer research. I absolutely disagree that the systems in physics are less complex than in biology.

Maybe if you compare the simplest parts of physics with common problems in biology, you have a point. But the simplest parts of physics are only pedagogically important, and have never comprised most actual research in physics. Even for transistors at the atomic level, decent models; ones that include temperature dependence, impurities, crystallographic defects, etc. etc.; are still miles more complex on both a conceptual mathematical level from anything Fisher or Haldane produced. It's just these aren't introduced at levels much lower than actual research.

Inseparable interactions between multiple scales without convenient simplifications aren't unique to biology, they're just introduced to biologists earlier than similarly complex systems are to physicists.

And this is completely ignoring phenomena involved in strongly interacting field theories and fully developed turbulence; at the end of the day, natural selection on its own reduces to a gradient flow problem, albeit one with a poorly known generating function. (Coming up with models that can include drift and hitchhiking is quite a different matter.)

My opinion is that there's the complexity of systems described on a research level is comparable, with much overlap, and it doesn't make any sense to generalise a subject as ""simple"" from what's introduced pedagogically.",,,3,0,reddit4
cajdf33,t1_cajcmy7,2013-06-15 12:20:50,science,"Well, to an extent, yes. But that all depends on how well you can quantify your experimental measurements. Most of biology is qualitative (e.g., x is greater than y by 3-fold under some condition). There's very few assays outside if physical chemistry (for example NMR can be used to solve protein structures) used in biology that will give you an absolute measurement of any biological system. When laws exist, they're pretty straightforward (ie, Mendelian genetics). It's really because the systems studied are so complex, and the technologies used to measure them are not yet quantitative enough, and we cannot account for the incredible amount of biological variability from experiment to experiment. Under such conditions, you don't need a lot of math to work in the field. ",WraithsOfWrath,t2_9g9uj,1,0,reddit4

caj273v,t1_caj0lf1,2013-06-14 21:45:00,science,"Firstly, I don't disagree with anything you said, I think there is some ambiguity in the discourse here due to how broadly applicable the concept of complexity is, so we are actually using it in slightly different ways. I largely mean it in the same way that a routine which is written/exists at the level of machine code is simpler than a script written in Python, even though the Python script is *much* easier to understand, because there are more levels of abstraction/organization between the thing itself and the smallest irreducible component it is made up of, 0's and 1's.

Likewise, fluid dynamics and models of transistors may largely be more mathematically complex than models of evolution, but the equivalent biological process to describe mathematically would not be evolution, but the mathematical modelling of interactions along an entire biological pathway, and we'd have to achieve the same level of reliability/predictability as we do with transistor models. I mean, those (transistor) models are complex, no doubt, but they work extremely well. On the other hand, what's the *best* accuracy we can get with any model for predicting whether a particular somatic mutation is likely to make a cell cancerous? We can look at mutations that have a function altering effect on TP53 and other related genes, but that merely describes the *context* in which somatic mutations happen in an individual. We have some power to predict whether a somatic mutation can lead to cancer, but we don't have models with nearly the level of confidence that we do with transistors, because the system itself consists of more layers of abstraction and organization, and so it is harder to reduce the complexity to a somewhat deterministic model. Fortunately, population genetics and bayesian machine learning programs are starting to make a top-down approach more viable, but those don't let us actually understand what's happening at the cellular level any more than macroscopic thermo equations help us understand what's going on at the molecular level when something is heated up.

1. FSOD: fat (>25%) and sodium (>0.3%)
2. FSUG: fat (>20%) and sugar (>20%)
3. CSOD: carbs (>40%) and sodium (>0.2%)

Here are the results:

**Tobacco company food brands**

Nabisco (RJ Reynolds): Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Teddy Grahams, Nilla, Nutter Butter, Ritz, Wheat Thins, Premium (saltines), Triscuit

Kraft (Phillip Morris): Philadelphia (cream cheese), Cool Whip, Miracle Whip, DiGiorno, Kraft dinner, Lunchables, Oscar Mayer

**Hyper-palatability in 1988**: ""tobacco companies... did not selectively acquire food products that were hyper-palatable.""

**Food formulation: 1988–2001**: ""tobacco company ownership was significantly associated with a higher likelihood that food items were HPF [FSOD and CSOD]""

**Hyper-palatability in 2018**: ""HPF among foods that were and were not previously tobacco-owned were consistently very high (75.2 versus 76.9%), regardless of ownership status""

Summary: In the '80s, tobacco companies acquired food brands. In the '90s, these brands added sodium to their products, making them hyper-palatable. As of 2018, most food brands do this.",potatoaster,t2_640xi,633,0,reddit1
jzwogtj,t3_16eooi6,2023-09-10 03:10:48,science,"From the paper

US tobacco companies owned leading US food companies from 1980 to 2001. We measured whether hyper-palatable foods (HPF) were disproportionately developed in tobacco-owned food companies, resulting in substantial tobacco-related influence on the US food system.

Tobacco-owned foods were 29% more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80% more likely to be classified as carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods that were not tobacco-owned between 1988 and 2001 (P-values = 0.005–0.009).

My editorial:

Companies who at the time were manipulating the addictive aspects of cigarettes also created addictive foods that other food companies later picked up and became the dominant kinds of food in the US food supply. 

Here the term addictive foods or HPF (highly palatable foods) are those that cause responses in the body that cause you to eat more than you planned. Increasing sales and profits and decreasing health.

jzznwmh,t1_jzx6ehs,2023-09-10 17:22:13,science,"""Basic nutrition"" is made intentionally hard with inconsistencies and companies marketing unhealthy foods as healthy.

Read the labels? Labels between different sizes of the exact same prduct are inconsistent. Take Two Good vanilla yogurt for example; marketed as low sugar healthy alternative to other flavored greek yogurt. Their 5.3oz (150g) single-serve cup of vanilla yogurt supposedly has only 2g of sugar, but when you buy a 32oz multi-serving container, the nutrition label says serving size is 170g with only 2g of sugar. So which is right? This is especially important distinction for diabetics. 

Then you have the FDA/USDA in the US, whose nutritional reccomendations are just that... reccomendations. There is no requirement or law that states a company has to follow the guidelines in their nutritional content. And even within the fda/usda reccomendations for healthy foods, there are holes. For example, if you want to find how much a serving of spinach is by WEIGHT instead of by VOLUME good luck! A cup of spinach is a serving? Is that spinach smashed in packed tight or loosely filled? There is a significant discrepancy between the amount of spinach between the two. This is especially important distinction when it comes to a product that says it provides a ""serving of vegetables.""",GreenMtCat,t2_un5m5,1,0,reddit1

Kinda.  We evolved on 60-600 calorie per pound plant foods with the occasional meat or seed/nut which was higher.

We didn’t evolve on 2,560 calorie per pound deep-fried vegetable/potato/tortilla chips.  

Our brain doesn’t tell us we like crispy foods because of rice cakes or celery, but because of our experience with these deep-fried options.

A. Lot.

Source: am autist who isn't very susceptible to the techniques those in power use to manipulate people at large. So much of what humans do is because psychology has been weaponized against them, and people *really* don't like it being pointed out when they've been manipulated. People *actively fight* to defend their manipulators, or dismiss that they've been manipulated at all.

Legislation has to be passed to curb manipulation by outside forces. But that can't happen because, well, the people that make the laws are often manipulated as well, and they in turn manipulate others.

Avoiding manipulation requires a bit of knowledge and lots of critical examination if your brain isn't already a rat's nest of crossed wires like mine is.",broniesnstuff,t2_at595,1,0,reddit1

And then told that the reason we are in distress is not because corporations have too much control over the system, but because some minority is to blame.

These days, so many people are drunk on blame because of this, they do this on purpose, because if someone is inflamed to blame something so strongly, they only see that one aspect of blame, they don't see the whole picture, that actually the issue with some certain minority is because of failings in another part of the system. The 99% of us need to sober up with understanding and not fall for the blame pushed out in every kind of media outlet.

Even people who blame trump supporters as one example, because blaming them causes us to not see where the system has failed them, and so we can't get through to them without understanding. If people are blaming each other then nothing ever gets solved, the anger and distress just gets perpetuated and reinforced.

Blame is only good for reacting to something in the moment out of necessity, it's a survival mechanism, but in a society if it's too much used as a way of being, it just stops problems being solved and anger and frustration to keep building up, which one day might be the death of all of us.

 It only works for the benefit of people who would rather have the 99% of us divided, but they are controlled by greed like an addict, justifying their harms to others based on letting their desires run rampant, they have contempt for us to justify the suffering they cause. But like any addict, there is never enough and eventually this could lead to the ruin of all of us.

We always have been. I consider it like this, business hasn't really changed in thousands of years on a basic level. You are smarter, more ruthless and willing to push harder than anyone else you generally manage to succeed provided you don't screw up. That means at any point in history, I'd imagine most of the people running the world aren't anywhere close to the most moral, or most intelligent people. They simply were the ones who were born into leadership positions/families. Nowadays it's still very similar, in that you can be extremely intelligent but still miss out over someone who has connections or is willing to lie/manipulate to win.

Just look at current companies history now, many of them are straight up warlords considering some of the horrible stuff they've done or still do. I wouldn't be surprised if we were largely lead/ran by people with little morals or respect for humanity in general.

I think no matter what, if someone is willing to break more rules, lie, steal, cheat, etc (and doesn't get caught), they have an advantage over anyone else playing by the rules.

The issue isn’t capitalism is bad, monopolies are bad, we live in a time where macroeconomic data allowed dynamics to be manipulated from within, corrupting natural (and good kinds of) autopoietic dynamics, where money sponsors bad practices to become part of the system, a monetary dysgenic that uses the  digital economy era as circulatory system.",fuck_your_diploma,t2_7f3ud,-1,0,reddit1

Socialism is more broadly defined by *collective ownership* rather than *individual ownership* of capital. Basically, if the tools required to make something is owned by an individual (or a group of people acting legally as an individual via a corporation) then it's capitalism of some flavor but if it is owned by the workers of the factory or the residents of a town collectively then it's some flavor of socialism.

There are *a lot* of variations on these themes and some of them (intentionally or not) misname themselves, so it's common for there to be confusion as to socialism and capitalism.

I just don't think that there's a lot of difference between a factory being owned by a distant, uncaring corporation and a distant, uncaring government (or communist party) for the workers on the ground.

Honestly, this reads like:""Do what you want, but only as long as you don't rock the boat.""

""Temporary"" meaning for just enough time to pass for enough people to see trough their stupor what's really going on, because it's starting to affect everyone's lives and it's hard NOT to notice.

We have to thank the nature of current system that it's unable to contain the greed it's based on, and it inevitably starts to eat itself, or saw the branch it sits on, basically. 

After that, pass the education reforms, with different metrics of grading success, curriculum changes that would teach children to think critically and avoid bias, and to teach kids that it's incredibly important to directly participate in politics of democratic society (understanding political system you live in, judging it accordingly, to stress the importance of voting, etc..., would be the basis).

The vanguardist types argue that other forms can't succeed, and maybe they're likely correct. I would like to think there could be a middle ground or alternative.

In any case, I believe the argument that there's nothing stopping people from starting co-ops etc. is missing the very problem we're discussing with the system reinforcing socially harmful behaviors and discouraging socially beneficial ones that require more long-term thinking and collective effort. (Not strictly so, but to some significant degree.)
Most people aren't trying to start worker-owned co-ops just as people aren't foregoing buying from companies that use unethical, monopolistic, or ultimately harmful practices.
If people have significant capital to own their own business, they have significant financial and other incentivize to not wish to share ownership with others while also being a worker themselves.
There are other issues, such as the greater difficulty of finding investors, if I recall correctly. I forget why exactly, though I could speculate.

But are our only realistic options really only self-destructive rule by capital and more or less tyrannical party vanguardism?

It's also at odds with history, because once one looks past their sometimes pro-working class rethoric (though always through a nationalistic and chauvinistic lens), 20th century fascist parties came down pretty hard on workers, unions, communists and socialist of all kinds, while they were pretty cozy with the industrialists and big capitalists who financed them",maplea_,t2_mfnc9wo,4,0,reddit1

Secondly, it is absolutely untrue that there needs to be a profit motive in order to spur innovation. That’s one of the biggest myths propagated by capitalism. Even in capitalist countries, there are researchers who create new inventions/products with no desire to profit off of it. Jonas Salk, for instance, invented the polio vaccine, but he extremely opposed to patenting it. He wanted it to be publicly available. He was not driven by profit. 

Likewise, the USSR was able to achieve massive amounts of technological innovation and progress within a relatively short time frame. Which is even more impressive given the fact that Russia was incredibly poor when the Bolsheviks took power, and the country was immediately thrust into a bloody civil war that was backed backed by foreign powers. All the major European countries, along with the US, sent troops into Russia in 1918 so they could “kill Bolshevism in its cradle.” And the USSR suffered the most casualties by far in WWII. Imagine the innovations the USSR could have accomplished without such foreign interference. In fact, a lot of Soviet planners were ahead of their time in terms of urban development, among other things, but they couldn’t fully get their plans off the ground because they had to deal with three major wars within the span of only three decades.

There’s a lot to critique about the Soviet Union and other actually existing socialist countries. But innovation is not one of them. And basing an economy around need rather than profit is guaranteed to help the most marginalized people of that society. That’s why there was hardly any homelessness is the USSR, and likewise with Cuba. Everyone was given a home. Whereas here, there are countless homes and apartments that remain empty—despite rampant homelessness—because rich people use them as an investment and sit on them. That’s one of the clearest examples of basing an economy on exchange value.
