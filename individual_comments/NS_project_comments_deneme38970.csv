Let's not pretend, however, that this isn't a significantly gendered issue.  Even in households where there's no kids, if there's one person at home not earning an income, it's over twice as likely to be a woman than a man.  Add in kids, and that ratio skyrockets in favour of women.  This is a luxury choice *women* get to make (and that white knights willingly hand them - no offense) that men largely do not have available to them. 

We all know the odd single Dad and the stigma that father faces, we know the fight in our legislatures and in the media over shared parenting, and we know that the overwhelming majority of spousal support is paid by men to women.  Our society is plenty pleased to let men financially support women at the moment, and that's not ""equality"" in any shape or form. Women love the earnings gap conversation, but they don't love the single biggest driver of it, because it would mean having to get off their collective asses. My province's earning's gap is double the national average, and that's because we have the oil patch paying men so well that their wives and girlfriends opt not to work at higher rates than the rest of Canada.

You have more patience than I do, clearly.  Once my kids have hit school full time, I'd be looking for her to contribute financially again because ""need"" will have transformed to ""want"" at that point.

Excuse me, that is a vile lie.       
1. Generally, it is women only who get that choice; as Farrell has said, women have the choice to work full-time, work part-time, or stay at home; men have the choice to work full-time, work full-time, or work full-time.      
2. That's obviously not equal rights, but will not change soon; female hypergamy will ensure men stay in their wage-slave place.

In recent years, the stress related illnesses men used to die from are now taking the lives of women in droves, and many feminists have suddenly ""discovered"" the idea that a woman working from home is now an acceptable role for a woman if she chooses it. 

I have a wonderful wife who has a Ph.D. and makes as much as I do at a local university. I'm very proud of her. However, for 1/2 a year I was the bread-earner. She wanted to go back home after the birth of our second son, and I agreed and worked under a load of stress that culminated in our discovering our child had a medical condition that would require over $170,000 in medical costs. The same week we found out, I got laid off. The stress was killing me and finding a job was our priority as a family. Luckily we both found something quickly, but the result was me being left with an emotional scar and a fear of being laid off that has followed me for a long time.

My wife has a lot of pressure from other women in her family who work from home to do things she just doesn't have time to do (parties, church stuff, vacations, etc.) I work from home a lot (developer and consultant), and she gets a lot of negative comments from her family and friend about my taking on the primary caretaker role for our kids.

In a good partnership, no one should be a parasite, but among the many, many passes women get in our society is the idea that a ""man should take care of his woman"" even if she doesn't do anything. My brother-in-law recently went through a divorce with a woman who had that attitude. She found someone else to be a bigger ""sugar-daddy"" for her.

Again it is a choice we made to see that our many children were well raised and got the best start in life. As the last one has been getting older she has started volunteering and working part time at various jobs. There are some positions where they hire volunteers and pay them as a way to compensate them for the hours they work free of charge. It's essentially a way to get back into the work force full time and start earning a decent salary; people seem to prefer to hire workers who are known qualities in the community. The youngest is in full time school now so she is heading back to work full time. It's really a matter of necessity as I am expecting to take a significant pay cut for medical reasons and have to leave my current job in the military in the next 2-4 years.

Modern feminism or 3rd/4th wave feminism is indeed, sadly, and poisonously so. The ideal of feminism is equal rights for men and women under the law, in the home and in the workplace. That's not totally crazy. Just because there are so few that live up to the ideal, doesn't make it as an idea completely invalid.

the reason this is the case is because women are born inferior to men. that's why they have never been able to compete evenly with men for the last 10000 years of human history. so before it was kinda ok because women were inferior and they knew it and men knew it. men accepted it and men trade their suppport for submission. now suddenly women are saying they're actually equal to men and the only reason they lose is because men are oppressive them. well pray tell, how does a group of people who have a 50% population ratio manage to oppress the other 50% if they were actually equals? 

so now it's fucking irritating what they're doing. they're gone way too far and try to set up laws that give them a competitive advantage ALL THE WHILE saying they are equals. then they step outside into the dating world and can only date up because they cant stand a man beneath them. if they have a college degree, all men without one is invisible to them. they sleep around and only get wet for alpha men leaving the rest to be supporters in their old age.

My wife was feminist, as were most of her friends and workmates.  So I got to see several feminist marriages from up close.  

I've had a few GFs who identified as feminist, and others were sympathetic to feminist ideas.  So I've been around a bunch of feminists over the last 35 years of my adult life.   

As for gender roles, when I was struggling in a job my wife repeatedly suggested that I stay home and look after our young son while she supported the household.  (When we got together with the intention of mating for life I was unemployed with no assets, I'd just graduated in my early 30s.  She had a career and a house.)  

Another small example.  The common complaint about paying for dates for women?   I've not paid for a single date or drink for a woman in my life.  It has never been expected.  And if you tried to pay for a date with the feminist women I've known I don't think many would let you, I've heard that described as ""creepy"".

Because the system doesn't allow him the agency he needs to get to a better place. He divorces her, and he loses half of his stuff (or more), risks having to pay her in the future with alimony (and failure to do so risks jail time), and overall has a higher chance of things getting much worse than better.

When /r/mensrights talk about women's agency within sexual assault and domestic violence cases, it comes with the package that there is a system that also allows them to exercise that agency. There are a plethora of help programs, both legal and support, for both sexual assault and domestic violence.

In AITA
A man is the asshole for dating a single mom and wanting alone time away from the child but a woman dating a single dad who doesn't want to move in with him because she isn't interested in having a child around is fine because they want different things in life.

In relationship advice
I saw people performing mental gymnastics again to defend a woman who would slam cupboard and room doors when upset.


In all subs
A man expressing boundaries is controlling and manipulative but a woman doing it is protecting her mental health.
A man clearly depressed is useless and needs to be kicked out and is a loser but woman with depression needs to see a therapist and needs help immediately.
A woman being abusive to a man needs help because she is obviously having mental issues but a woman who is receiving abuse needs to leave immediately.
Any couple with a toddler having issues and the woman has ppd regardless even if op says the she has seen professionals and hasn't been diagnosed with it

And post anything MRA and be prepared to get hell rained upon you

Edit:

There's a post on Relationships about a guy whose wife is constantly breaking or damaging stuff and he was fed up... Below is the top comment

>Ask her how this happens? Maybe she has an underlying medical issue that is making her lose control in her movements, or maybe she has attention deficit issues. These things can be worked out if you find out what is causing it and work on finding a solution.

Now reverse the genders, the man would be called abusive, dangerous, the guy is careless and needs to pay for the damage and she needs to leave him because he obviously doesn't respect her or her belongings.

Always remember that the surveys that women respond to about household divisions of labor are self-reported. One of feminists' favorite surveys reports the following:

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 47 minutes a day cooking.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 45 minutes a day cleaning.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 23 minutes a day shopping.

* SAHMs spend 1 hour and 8 minutes a day helping children with homework.

Their favourite is post partum depression. That woman can abuse her partner, her child, be lazy and negligent, but it isn't her fault!

They diagnose her like the medical experts we all know they are and absolve her from all responsibility.

By contrast, a man who is having a tough time adjusting to parenthood should just man up, have greater empathy for his partner, offer HER more support and stop complaining.

I know that there is growing sexlessness among young men but they are also marrying far less when they get older and do get into relationships (usually in their 30s). And I don't blame them for not wanting to take on these burdens when the expectation is they just labour for a lifestyle she wants, labour for the kids she primarily desires, and must labour even more so she *feels* like there is a proper split in domestic duties (that actually favour her).

There is no expectation placed on women in the same way and to suggest it is sexist.

On those subs a woman just has to cry unfairness and she gets support. A man must come in with multiple examples to show as evidence he is being slighted and still someone will try to make it seem like the woman is not to blame.",CentralAdmin,t2_5e4v852d,16,0,reddit4

Liberalism is different from leftism in that liberalism is a globalist pro-capitalist ideology, and leftism is a spectrum of a myriad of competing radical and moderate ideas (Most left-wing ideologies focus on economic issues such as labor unions, worker's rights, democratic workplaces, regulated economies, welfare and social programs, etc)

> Leftists swing to the totalitarian right when there stupid ideas don't work and people don't obey. 

Leftism can either be democratic, or authoritarian, just like rightism. Rightism can cover from Social Libertarianism and Constitutional Monarchism, to State Capitalism and Nazism. Similarly varied is leftism. From Social Democracy and Unionism to Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism.

> Genocide usually follows.

Not all left-wing countries have genocides, you're confusing them with communist ones. (USSR with Ukrainians and Germans, China with Uyghurs, Pol-Potism with intellectuals, etc)

> Look at how the Democrats and Hillary reacted to Trump winning they basically poisoned the pussy well. Started the Me2 blackmail movement. They falsely accuse their political opponents and attack their mental health.

American politics isn't everything, bud. Plus, the Democrats are just more moderate capitalists, not communists or socialists. They agree on almost everything except for notably their social policy (identity politics, feminism, gender issues, etc)

You are Protected in Law under **Section 27 of the Equality Act** - **Victimisation**. 

Raising any concern of bias is a ""Protected Act"" and any retaliation is Victimisation and actionable through both courts and employment tribunals. 

When raising any concern it is wise to state that you are Undertaking a ""**Protected Act - Section 27 The Equality Act 2010**"", as this serves notice to any party that they are obliged to protect you from any form of Retaliation, Harassment etc as they can find themselves being sued. 

**[27 Victimisation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/27)**

(1) A person (A) victimises another person (B) **if A subjects B to a detriment** because—

...   (a) **B does a protected act, or**

... (b) **A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.**

(2) **Each of the following is a protected act**—

...(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

...(b) giving evidence or information in connection with proceedings under this Act;

...(c) **doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection with this Act;**

...(d) **making an allegation (whether or not express) that A or another person has contravened this Act.**


(5) **The reference to contravening this Act includes a reference to committing a breach of an equality clause or rule.**

I get it, women are underrepresented in tech.  Boxing out boys is not the solution.  At least in my case I'll be able to teach my boys myself.  But if they won't be able to get into a university program for Computer Science or other STEM fields, what's the point?",boxsterguy,t2_6ap1t,57,0,reddit1

That being said, in both the UK and the US there is still a ton of gender bias in favor of one sex or the other, a gigantic amount. I doubt that there's a university that exists that doesn't offer some level of sponsorship for women going into STEM fields that are unavailable to men.

Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen. OP's situation is a case in point. Worse still, if he did try to press the issue legally, he's likely to fail. Those laws are institutionalized to protect *women* not men. Men are only included so that the law seems fair. The laws are rarely ever practiced that way. Don't believe me?

For example, the concept POSITIVE ACTION: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action

>In Europe, positive action, roughly synonymous with affirmative action, is the promotion of people based on belonging to non majority identity groups in the workplace, educational institutions and positions in society, purportedly without prejudicing the criteria of selection by merit. In the United Kingdom in Harriet Harman's Equality Act 2010 ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

Now, I'm not 100% sure whether this applies specifically to this situation. But people here went all in on complete blanket statements about discrimination (""it's the same for boys and girls""), and now suddenly you are completely certain that this particular section provides the only answer.

My father was a ladies man, a real vag slayer type. He told me that women are strongly receptive to the environment men create around them. I believe he has a point and that women, to some degree, can be molded to be less like other women and closer to what the ""ideal"" (I.e. not horrible) is. 

As a quick anecdote, in the past , almost a month or so, I had been talking to a girl that I met at work, not a coworker where I work but is dropping by semi regularly for a project that is being done.

Anyway, we really hit it off, she is cute and seemed like a girl I could really invest in.... yesterday I went out drinking with a buddy of mine. Turns out he met her sometime ago, he had pictures to prove it. Apparently she's a massive slut and he did her every way he could, in every place he could.... I looked into it and everything indicates that she was, and probably still is, incredibly slutty. 

I feel like an idiot for thinking I had found a unicorn; A cute, hard working, non-hyper entitled girl that could hold a conversation quite skillfully.... I legitimately don't know how I could have been so foolish as to believe and hope in something like that.... sigh.

You will have a considerably more difficult job DISPROVING something that is believed without any actual proof required for that belief. Make no mistake, it will be on YOUR shoulders to prove your innocense, not on her or HR's shoulders to attempt to prove your guilt. That's just how this shit works. It's not fair, it's not even reasonable, but it is what it is.

Further, the absence of photos in your picture gallery doesn't prove you never took a picture, it only proves that it's not readily visible there right now. Forensic analysis of your phone could provide exonerating evidence.

No offense, but you're probably not rich enough or well known enough for your employer to dig that deeply into the case - honest to God, I'm not breaking your balls, I'm just saying. People on the tier of famous athletes, or huge business magnates are rich/famous enough to have forensic examination of their devices done to sort out those kinds of accusations.If HR decies they like her story, there's nothing you can do. They may not fire you for this particular situation because they know they would open themselves up to a potential lawsuit, but they may fire you for some other reason, or present you with the ultimatum of resigning or being fired ""for cause"".

Even if HR drops the whole thing, unless they discipline the false accuser, you will face the stigma of this for the rest of your time at this company. That female who accused you will tell her bosses that she is uncomfortable working on projects with you, and they will tell your bosses, and the whole issue of keeping you two separated will be annoying. Meanwhile, that woman is telling other females her bullshit story, and they will say the same things to their bosses and so on and so forth.

So... best case for you is that they believe you, and discipline her and she leaves. Unless that happens, you probably need to get your resume out there.

I would complain that company policy mandates that HR harass you and investigate you when there is no evidence at all. 

When I say no evidence what I mean is the testimony given was the picture was taken of someone at work but all they saw was the back of a camera, they did not see the other side. They did not see the photo app up, they did not see him press the picture button. They couldn't if the camera was faced at them to take their picture.

All they have is someone holding a camera nearby and then putting it away.

So with conclusively no evidence HR then told him his job was at risk for doing something they have no evidence of. After that, they ignored my attempt to protect myself by providing actual evidence of the claimed event not happening.

It is the legal responsibility of the company to provide a safe and harassment-free workplace and that is going to be very difficult when HR is the one doing the harassment.

But one can also argue that it is a mens rights issue (although a small one) because it discusses gendered behaviour. When one gender performs an action it has a reaction on the other one. 

For example it used to be common place amongst men to use pretty aggressive language when talking to one another (""come on get that report done so we can do to the pub, you lazy shit""). Men do not mind and it is quite common. Of course this does not work well for  women in the workplace,who on average prefer more neutral language.

Similarly when women gossip and bully themselves but also form solidarity together in public effects the way men interact with them in teams. for example I had to sit through a painfully bad presentation presented by a female college in my team meeting, most of the team are female. When I or my other male team member showed any sign of constructive criticism we were shunned and all the female team members showered the presenter in compliments.

Maybe women, like men, need to adapt their most natural behaviour in the workplace in order to achieve a more functional team structure, or maybe i need to learn the ways of the queen bee and start validating and gossiping too. Who knows...

But as soon as they have a chance to speak to one another they first validate each other in order to demonstrate they are part of the same group, then through this validation a social status hierarchy is established and a queen bee emerges. These groups tend to agree on everything by consensus and tend not to fight amongst themselves publicly. Later the group splits off into small cliques and then a all bitch war begins where different women are covertly attacking or protecting the queen bee in a effort to establish themselves in the hierarchy.

The men built shelter, found food quickly, got along with each other, and it eventually looked like a tropical vacation by the end.

The women... Oh the women. They were so sure that they would beat the men out because girl power! We know how to work as a team and the men will all try to be independent and do their own thing. They said the men would start fighting with each other and nothing would be accomplished. Guess what happened when it came time to put up or shut up? 

They failed, miserably. They almost immediately started fighting with each other, calling each other names, and gossiping about their teammates. They never got a shelter built, and they never found any food. By the end of the second day, the women's team was reduced to blubbering, crying, and complaining about how unfair and hard it was. I believe they had to end the event early for them as they didn't ever get shelter or food and were a real safety risk to themselves.

dy2bi22,t1_dy21bbx,2018-04-27 15:23:39,MensRights,"There are some interesting paradoxes at play.   

Take a small-to-medium sized group of men and set them to some task and you'll find a degree of cooperation second to none.   They will naturally organize themselves into hierarchies of ability* without the need to create leaders/rulers, and an honor system will develop.   If disputes arise they will be solved quickly, sometimes (though not usually) with physical violence, after which the competing parties will [make up](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).   

Take a group of women and set them to some task and you will find a long, drawn out attempt to establish consensus about the most trivial of matters, combined with a great deal of passive-aggressiveness, malicious gossiping and repeated cycles of emotional turmoil.   Conflicts often take the form of Machiavellian social violence.

But what happens when you put the two sexes together?  

In the case of men, competition dramatically increases.  In the case of women, *solidarity* dramatically increases.   So the exact opposite effects for either sex.   If one woman is harmed it is viewed as an attack on ""all women"", whereas if one man is harmed it is viewed as an attack only on that individual man.   

Whereas men band together to protect women (sometimes at the expense of female autonomy), women band together in solidarity *against* men, evidently for safety and protection.   This would seem to be a protective evolutionary mechanism that, with the feminist movement, has now become profoundly dangerous.   

*Hierarchies of ability are different than institutional hierarchies.   The former are meritocratic and do not require coercion; different people are better at different things, so it makes sense for people to have different specialities.   Institutional hierarchies are usually based on violence and coercion, though may also include meritocratic elements.",Vwar,t2_15qoa077,20,0,reddit4

If you're somebody who has been targeted by these sorts of groups in your lifetime, you'll see what I'm talking immediately.

If you see people who don't hang out with others or interact with other people there's usually a reason for it. Some people just want their own space which is totally fine, but particularly with larger societies it can end up with people self-segregating to the point that they don't even realise what the rest of the world thinks of them and have little knowledge of the outside world.

Especially the last point,  I always see it in the subreddits about abusive relationships or women on women sexual assault. The majority of victims always say that they don't feel  as hurt or as violated as much as if the perpetrator were a man, so they either have sympathy for them and don't want to report them, or even they did, they feel guilty afterwards and drop the charges most of the time. Something you would almost never see if the perpetrator is a man. Hell, even the comments are different between the cases where the assailant is a male and where the assailant is a female.

No... Social hierarchy is exactly what they create.  It's just less visible from the outside (and kind of cloudy on the inside).  

Men tend to organize as a response to an issue, and it's fairly clear because you need to know who is above or below.  If you didn't, you wouldn't know where to go.  

Women are just as interested in social status, but the framework isn't clear.  ""who's at the top and bottom"" is going to change based on what the question is.

Now being integrated into greater society is great but in greater society non feminist positions are generally undervalued disallowed or simply shouted down.

Then the group designation is meaningless. if all feminists are only individuals with no ""memo"" or central ideology then the label is completely useless and serves no purpose because it conveys no useful information about the person or group. 

In order for the word to have meaning there have to be distinctions and ways of measuring what is and is not a feminist. A term that can mean anything, means nothing.

This is a rhetorical scam called a motte and bailey doctrine which feminists will attempt to pull all of the time. They will claim that feminism is not a hivemind or has no teachings/dogma/central ideas/etc as a means of deflecting criticism for the bad things done by their group (we'll call this proposition A). Then they will turn around and make claims about how feminism fought for the vote for the women, or how feminism is all about equality, or feminists don't hate men, etc. (Proposition B).

Note that both of these claims are contradictory. If there are no central ideas or tenets of feminism and it is all just individuals then feminism cannot be credited with women getting the vote, nor can they say that feminists don't hate men or anything else.

The reason they do this is because if feminism is portrayed as a group of individuals then the ideology cannot be held to any standard and it gives them a way out for any responsibility for the things that they do. The downside to this however is that, as I mentioned, it renders the entire concept and authority of feminism useless and irrelevant.

Which is why they will quickly switch to the other side when they need to speak with authority. That however opens them up to being disproved and held to standards. Which is then they quickly retreat back into ""Feminism is just about equality"" or ""There are many different ways of being a feminist"".

It's the typical behaviour or any cult or religion when it gets called out on it's doctrines or dogmas and their effects.

>There is no vanguard feminist organization.

There is, however, a central ideology and core tenets adopted by nearly all feminists. There are mountains of feminists texts and scholarly work one can read. You can look at the most supported and vaunted feminists and see what they say, advocate for and think, you can look at the organizations.

You can look at all of feminism and see VERY clearly what their goal is and what their ideology stands for and represents.

>There are no billionaires in the legislature you realize, but you'd have to really stretch to argue that this means they don't have power and only have ""Influence"". They control society through lobbying, and as the post notes, women have the second largest lobbying complex in the world devoted to their interests. This is the key part:  
>  
>Men do not have such a lobby. The interests lobbied for are stuff like war, oil, and so on. In the same way as we are oppressed by oligarchs abusing campaign finance and so on by those organizations forcing through their special interests at everyone elses expense, feminism oppresses men by forcing through womens interests at the expense of men.  
>  
>The trick you are pulling is to argue that because men fill the roles of ""Oil lobbyist"", that makes them balanced out with women holding the role of ""Lobbyist for women"", but that's simply not the case. The oil lobbyist cannot use the funds at their disposal to begin arguing for mens issues. They can use them to argue for the interests of the oil company, and that's pretty much it.  
>  
>I also think the actual sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists is largely irrelevant.

So. Men when they lobby act on behalf of their interest group, individuals of which are both men and women, at the expense of another group, individuals of which are both men and women. That is, men's lobbying isn't gendered. Women, however, can uniquely lobby in favour of women at the expense of men. That gives women, specifically, additional advocacy on their behalf. Thus, that's more power for them.

In other words it doesn't matter if the lobbyists for any given cause are all men so long as they represent the interests of a group that's comprised of both men and women at the expense of a group comprised of both men and women. Women aren't unrepresented nor are they uniquely targeted simply due to the lobbyists themselves being male. But men are most definitely not represented at all by feminist lobbying - in fact, the lobbying is done for the benefit of women at the expense of men. And men have no such male equivalent.

Anyway you're basically arguing from the perspective of what the lobbyists ultimately represent and how much power this ultimately affords each sex instead of the sex of the lobbyists themselves or the sex of the politicians who do the bidding of these lobbyists. Your interlocutor in that thread almost exclusively focuses on the sex of the lobbyists and the sex of the politicians without really considering what they stand for, which I think is a myopic take.

I think Karen Straughan noted this behaviour is something paralleled in chimpanzees, too - males form coalitions to enforce the interests of their entire group onto out-groups. Females form coalitions to enforce the interests of females on the group. Males have no such ""male coalition"" for males.",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,3,0,reddit1

Yup, what you should have done (*for the future or in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation*) is the following:

* Document everything, record every conversation that you can, print out every email & keep a written daily record (get a journal with number pages that can’t be removed & each day write the date & list every event which happened that day - it is actually admissible in court as supporting evidence).

* At least once a week, but preferably daily or as frequently as the occur, bring the subject up to your manager & schedule a meeting with HR to review each of the transgressions that you have documented in your notebook.

* Write a written summary account of every meeting or conversion that you are in which relates to any of the following: Any incidents of harassment you have experienced, your attempts to report said harassment, the managers or HR persons response & especially any conversations about your performance of your job duties - then email it to your manager, their manager & the HR dept & BCC a copy to an email address that you control & the company can’t access (because they will end up locking you out of your email account).

* Avoid using any terminology that could be perceived as hostility, frustration, sarcasm - remember a judge is going to be reading every single document which you bring to court in support of your claim & any document the company can find which will make you look bad. You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.

The goal here is to be the annoying as fuck squeaky wheel & make it obvious that you are documenting **everything** (*just for clarity & to prevent any misunderstandings of course - don’t ever actually say that you plan or intend to sue them,* **again** *You need to appear like a well intentioned employee who is trying to resolve the situation in good faith.*)

They **want** you to quit because they know how much harder it will be for you to get a lawyer to sue them if you quit.

So don’t let them win - make it a game of figuring out how much of a nuisance you can be (*innocently of course*) until the fire you.

Quite frankly, most companies will fire you not long after you start documenting everything - because their position in court can only get worse from there.

They are trying to harass you into quitting & the longer they let you document that fact, the bigger your settlement will be - so (*& I’ve witnessed legal counsel advise this exact thing*) it is better for them to trump up some bullshit reason for firing you than let you keep collecting more & more evidence of their wrongdoing.

gwa0dwa,t1_gw9ydbo,2021-04-29 09:35:08,MensRights,"Well there's a lot to respond to here, which is amusing.

- Yes, i'm office based. This isn't really a surprising thing, a huge amount of jobs are office based, including (based on interpretation and OPs history) his job in question. If it were manual work, it would be a different kettle of fish, as there are substantially less women in those areas.

- Studies do not generalise, this is misunderstanding how studies work, exactly the same way that most people misunderstand how statistics work. Actual scientific studies simply provide information, and a summary of information found. They are intended to inform you, not to tell you what to do. If a study finds that men are more likely to be in a car accident than women are (note, not an actual study, just pulling a scenario out of my head), it is not telling you that you should only be in cars where men drive, it's giving you the information so you can make an informed decision.

- Your lived in experience is a small sample size, as you yourself have stated. If you apply your lived in experience as a whole to an entire set of people, then you are applying a bias. Even if you have had prior experience with it, you are still applying a bias, and biases historically result in poor results. Apply your same bias to something like skin colour, and see how that works. ""Well i've worked with 3 black people in my life and they all worked less than me, so I refuse to work with black people now"". It doesn't sound good does it? It doesn't sound good because it's inherently incorrect. If instead you'd added in qualifying information, it becomes much less biased, and much more appropriate. ""X people who belong to Y location over the period of Z years have proven to me that {insert possible bias here}, I therefore aim to limit my interactions with X people, to reduce risk. I've also improved my ability to detect when people are {insert possible bias here}."". Qualifying information is incredibly key, and applying a bias, even if it's based only within your life and on your personal life experience, on a _single_ criteria is simply wrong.

- I have no idea what you're trying to say with attracting insane women 2 out of 3 times. I don't know where you've got the 3, I don't know how you're taking interpretation of data out of this, I pulled a scenario out of nowehere to show an example of incorrectly applied generalisation.

- Applying a generalisation is mostly applying a risk factor. I can take an example from my field, to simplify this matter. There are multiple published studies regarding working with third parties overseas, which explain the difference in working standards - particularly for indian overseas teams. I can use the information within this study to inform me that when i'm working with an indian offshore team, I need to have incredibly clear documentation, I need to ensure that anything I write has no assumptions in it, and no vernacular specific to my country, as this can introduce risk. This is not a generalisation, this is using the information within a study (and in some cases, from experience) to prevent risk, which is perfectly acceptable.

- You have not said that gender was your only data point, but in the context of the post, it was the only data point you provided.

- If you don't work well with female managers, there are two interpretations of this (without knowing any additional data points). Either there is something inherently wrong with the female gender, or there is somethign inherently wrong with you. If you provide additional data points (age, marital status, job description, role, location, company type, etc etc etc), then separate assessments can be made.


I do find it slightly funny that based on a very limited interaction, you determined that I need to work on interpretation, particularly because i'm in IT. 

Not only am I excellent at it, and have multiple commendations on data analysis (despite it not being my primary role), I've also taught a large amount of people and companies about accurately applying statistics within a work environment.",majestic_tapir,t2_1ckdoarz,1,0,reddit1

>Yes, i'm office based......If it were manual work, it would be a different kettle of fish, as there are substantially less women in those areas.

So you agree that there are qualifiers?

I'm both office and field based, thus the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualified to manage us.

>Studies do not generalise...

""Very simply, generalizability is a measure of how useful the results of a study are for a broader group of people or situations. If the results of a study are broadly applicable to many different types of people or situations, the study is said to have good generalizability.""

>Your lived in experience is a small sample size, as you yourself have stated.

And applicable to only myself, as stated by me.

>""Well i've worked with 3 black people in my life and they all worked less than me, so I refuse to work with black people now"". 

Application bias not withstanding, there's also a cultural bias to address in that scenario.

>It doesn't sound good does it? It doesn't sound good because it's inherently incorrect. 

Biases exist, applying them for your safety makes sense.

>If instead you'd added in qualifying information, it becomes much less biased, and much more appropriate.

Noting how little interaction you have with your future manager, there's not much qualifying data.

>....Either there is something inherently wrong with the female gender, or there is somethign inherently wrong with you.

I mentioned nothing of the female gender as a whole, why do you? Are you that biased, that you apply one to all?

Yet I specify female managers I've worked for, which is so small a percentage, it has zero bearing on anything, except me accepting a job.

- I never said there weren't qualifiers. I'm saying that in the context of this post, the only qualifier provided was gender, which is not an accurate qualifier when left on it's own, it's a bias. You've then doubled down and stated ""the vast majority of female managers aren't experienced or qualifed"", yada yada. This is actually a completely incorrect statement, there are no studies I can find that would suggest a woman is incapable of leading a group of engineers. There are less women in engineering, compared to men. You're more likely to find an incredibly competent man, because there are more qualified men. That does not mean that the vast majority of female managers are not experienced or qualified, just that there are less of them.

- Go and read the rest of the article that you copy pasted your generalisation definition from. In this case, you've copied it from a clinical study on hydrocephalus. In fact, the funny thing is, if you google generalisability, you'll find its application is prevalent for medical purposes - and much less so outside of anything medical related. There's a very good reason for that.

- I already agreed that you applied your lived in experience only to yourself, I also stated that you're therefore applying a bias.

- There is no cultural bias to address, because I have once again only provided an example to nail a point in, which is failing to get in for some reason. There is a large difference between applying a bias to a scenario vs applying a risk factor to a scenario.

- Applying a bias for your own safety is entirely incorrect. Take a racial one, as America seems to love racial things lately. You're more likely to be mugged by a black person than a white person - statistics confirm this. This does not mean that you should attribute the bias to all black people, because it fails to account for the _why_. And the why is simple - more black people in the US are in impoverished locations. Your bias therefore should not be against the race, it should be against a location. You're more likely to be mugged in Detroit than California, for example. And once more, i'll hammer this home in case it aims to derail - this is an EASY EXAMPLE TO GET A POINT ACROSS.

- Correct assertion that there are few qualifying bits of information about your future manager. But you yourself have said you've learned to identify that someone will be a poor manager due to decades of experience, so what are your qualifiers? So far, the _only_ qualifier you've ever provided is that they're female. What else?

- Again, regarding female gender as a whole, I will repeat again that this is within the context of your post. ""I will not work for female managers"" - the only qualifier you've provided is that they are female. If you like, I can add that a qualifier is that they're a manager, so now we're down to 3 commonalities: You, female gender and managers. So either you are the problem, the female gender is the problem, or managers are the problem. Yet you've already asserted you have no problem with male managers, therefore the problem is either you, or the female gender.ee",majestic_tapir,t2_1ckdoarz,1,0,reddit1

- leadership

- managerial style

And as I explained, it's not based in sexism, although their gender is a prime factor, it's simply maths. 

Less than 1% of people in my field are female. Of that percentage, about 20% are managerially qualified. Keeping with averages, about 30% of them are good managers.

Thus during the interview, if the future manager is NOT engineering qualified, I give that role a skip.

> Yes, there is a hard legal case to win, and no employer is going to sue an potential employee for not taking a job. Still within the legal statements for them to do so.

No, there isn't. There's absolutely NO legal basis. Employers have a legal requirement to not discriminate against employees, there's no legal requirement for prospective employees (or existing employees) to not discriminate against employers.

You can quit your job arguing that you don't want to work for a company owned by a white man (for example) and nobody can do absolutely anything, unless of course you violate your contract by not giving proper notice or whatever.

Great. That still changes absolutely nothing, the law does not protect employers from discrimination. If you're hiring an assistant and you don't hire them because of characteristics they can't change, that's illegal. If you're hiring an assistant and the assistant doesn't want to work for you because of characteristics you have, tough luck, it's perfectly legal.

e5jjbpf,t1_e5jfrtx,2018-09-07 06:09:33,MensRights,"As for the documents, from what I've been able to find, his rulings and the documents pertaining to them have all been released. The documents the Democrats are seeking to be released are confidential papers from the top level of the Bush administration when he was the staff secretary. Neither Republicans nor Democrats would willingly release confidential presidential documents this soon after the end of their respective administrations.


It isn't like Kavanaugh has been hiding either. Not like he could take part in halting the release of the documents anyway. He was made available to meet with anyone who wanted to meet with him, not a single Democrat did. Some of those confidential documents were made available in supervised setting open 24/7 to every single Democratic Senator, not one showed up. This was never about documents or wanting to learn more about him, the loudest Dem Senators had already gone on record opposing him, this was about delaying the hearing until after mid-terms when they think they have a better chance at shutting him down.


What perjury? Also, any evidence at all that Kavanaugh is totally in Trump's pocket?


The clown show has almost exclusively been coming from the Left. Booker literally used his Day 1 line of questioning to help fundraise immediately after the hearing ended. Harris insinuated that Kavanaugh has had conversations about the Mueller investigation with a lawyer who works for the firm that represents Trump. As far as we know that was totally fabricated. Booker ""broke the rules"" by releasing confidential documents that he knew were actually cleared to be released the night before, but acted like he didn't know they were cleared in an attempt to be censured. Afterwards he said it made him feel like Spartacus, since that's the whole point of this shitshow.


Kavanaugh is a milquetoast pick, a Constitutionalist through and through. There were many on the Right disappointed with the pick bc Trump could have easily gone with a more clear right wing judge and had them been a shoo in. Please save the histrionics for the actual controversial things Trump does, there is plenty of it. The problem is it becomes a Boy Who Cried Wolf scenario when you see a 5 alarm alert for a pretty bland SC pick.

I refer you to this section of the article linked below. 

Health is not only about disease prevention, but also about well-being and the avoidance of harm. How harmful is routine non-therapeutic circumcision? The overall rate of immediate and long-term complications arising from newborn circumcision is a matter of debate and in truth unknown. The estimated rate of complication worldwide has been reported as lying between the extremes of 0.1% and 35%.27 Minor complications such as bleeding, infection and prolonged hospitalization are thought to occur in less than 5% of cases. Tragic partial or complete penile amputation, urethral injury and even the rare death have been reported. Meatal stenosis requiring intervention occurs in 5%–10% of males circumcised in the newborn period.28 This is believed to be secondary to dermatitis of the unprotected glans exposed to wet diapers. Circumcision revision under anesthetic for penile concealment, skin bridges or an unacceptable cosmetic result is probably the most common long-term complication prompting a urological referral: in one survey, fully one-third of pediatric urologists in the United States reported experience as an expert witness in circumcision litigation cases.29

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five.

They consistently hire less qualified minorities over more qualified white people. It's gotten worse and worse. Right after the occupy Wall Street movement I was applying for finance jobs and all of these weird first generation immigrants were getting these corporate positions over me. Some of them are smart and deserved it but a lot of them were stupid as fuck. Like Haqqim who sells stolen iPhones with a 2.6 GPA gets a similar job I interview for and when I go in all I get asked is ""What is your greatest achievement?"" like six different ways and get sent home. This went on for 5 years of bullshit and finally I left NYC for a red state and in 1 interview I have a job. It sucked and didn't pay as well as corporate jobs but the point is it's definitely a blue state corporate thing to not hire white people. The whole time this was going on my parents are acting like I am somehow a failure. And now that I have been moving into more professional jobs there are all these minorities in positions of power who do not deserve them.

The thing that has me really pissed off is I have student loans that I have been unable to pay off largely because I was unable to find a job that I rightfully deserved for 5 years. Those loans are owed to the federal government who pushes these DEI policies. The federal government is literally sabotaging my ability to pay back the loans while these asshole fucking politicians keep rambling on about bootstraps. The federal loan is the sticking point simply because at this point this is literally usury and racketeering. I saw a lot of this shit happening back during Obama and people just laughed it off or acted like it was a conspiracy. Now articles like this are coming out and it's a combination of vindicating and infuriating. Is it really too much to ask for the government just to keep the playing field even?

The republicans just put out a statement about how the corporations should hire based on merit. It's sort of too little too late for me. My young professional adult life was basically ruined and sabotaged and the entire time I suspected I was being fucked over and it looks like I was right. The worst part about it is they made it seem like there was something wrong with me. And now you think I want to work with or for these people? You think I am going to respect any of them? Seriously. Fuck them.

Luckily for the democrats they have a whole new generation young people to sell their tolerance bullshit to. There's no tolerance every person wants the same thing. You're just putting these people on a. pedestal at the expense of the people who were here first. And a lot of them are not successful yet either.

The student loan thing has me pissed because in any other situation this would be tortious interference. It's why the government shouldn't be allowed to act as a business and loan people money. It's so fucked up. You can't tell me not to be racist and make policies that literally take from me on the basis of race. It's a zero sum game assholes.",RichLong77,t2_m50hswx7w,70,0,reddit3

The question is when does it change? At what point will we say “Okay, everyone is on equal footing now. We can go back to only considering merits.” I think never. The US is run by special interests, whether that be pharmaceutical, oil, etc. I see this as nothing more than an other special interest group that will claim discrimination for the sake of advancement. This is my biggest worry about the US long term. These institutions will not go down without a fight and it will be messy, but if a new government is formed people will no longer be able to claim this structural bias against them.

And I feel white men in general have not been allowed to really have the same influence on the propaganda that other groups have had. Hip hop has had basically a monopoly on machismo and what used to be rock n roll since the 90s. It's funny how the criticize the white influencers for toxic masculinity while hip hop has been the bastion of toxic masculinity since day 1. I have always recognized art as propaganda. And if you look at mainstream media you have basically hip hop on one side and cable network cop shows on the other. So women are basically looking for government employees or black criminals.

For awhile I was going to raves and it was awesome tons of hot european girls in fairy wings. And then sometime around dubstep that got sort of shitty. It stopped being as underground and cool and became mainstream. For a brief moment because of it's wierd status it was it's own unique culture. The day I stopped being interested was when some rapper came on one of my festival sets and said, ""Electronic music has finally arrived."" And I was just like I thought ""no one listened to techno"" . But as usual where there are hot european girls there is that hollywood crowd trying to liberate them in some way. There were black DJs in the scene that were cool and that's sort of the point I am trying to make. It's not just race its propaganda and culture.

There seems to be this group that just fucks everything up by taking whatever art you have and vandalizing it with their racial agenda. The reason I switched over to electronic music in the first place was because I just didn't want to listen to people bitchin' and talking shit anymore at my party. I definitely don't need some dude acting like he's hot shit on my stereo when a bullet goes through him just like everybody else.

A black person who shoots up the block and kills a bunch of innocent people he is a gangster and revolutionary. If a white boy shoots up a school hes mentally ill and crazy or you can work the government or be a retarded doctor. Those are the molds society has placed white men into and how women perceive them. TV is literally dominated by the same narratives. African and Muslim violence is excused while white violence is maligned. So you end up with a huge portion of the population who feels since their violence is justified they must be oppressed and vote in their favor to make it stop. Meanwhile a white kid shoots up a school and we need to do something about the guns and mental health hes crazy. They have taken the protective aspect from normal men and put it in the hands of black gangsters or cops/military.

What is produced by the American media establishment today is really not art but bullshit propaganda. Part of the reason the women believe what they believe is because hollywood and the music industry has conditioned them to believe it. All you have to do is look on reddit to see how many comments are practically MSNBC talking points rather than actual original opinions to realize how the vast majority of people are informed by media rather than experience. That's why as much fun as it is to talk shit about women you have to realize it's the men who are hiding behind them that are responsible for your problems.

There is literally a show on appletv that makes the outlaws of the wild west out to be serial killers. Great they found gangster white men from the 1800s and turned them into creepy serial killers as well. I guess only muslims and black people get to commit murder and be cool revolutionaries. But thats always been a thing for the people from those areas of the world. Vandalizing people's culture. What Joe Biden calls a history of white supremacy and domestic terrorism has largely been white self defense starting with the barbary wars and they attacked us. It's annoying because we have to constantly battle false equivalencies.

Maybe we've hit the continuity of continuous bullshit because of AI. The propaganda is so blatant and also so in your face it just like holy shit. Talk about no talent or creativity whatsoever.

Agreed.

And the people who benefited from discriminatory hiring practices during Jim Crow, much of whom are still alive and in the workforce. 

&#x200B;

I don't disagree with your points, I just think a lot of you have your heads up your ass if you think that what is happening now is only because of slavery. Jim Crow didn't end until 1964, which means that legal, race based segregation and discrimination, didn't end until 59 years ago. Many of the people who benefitted from those hiring practices just retired in the last 15 years. 

I work in construction, and there are companies in my city that were being sued into the late 90s because they were found to have been participating in race based discriminatory hiring practices. They were only sending white people to the biggest jobs, or keeping them on the payroll through the winter but laying everyone else off. One of those companies just had a case re-opened because someone that won a case in the 90s just retired, and now the court has to calculate how much pension they lost because the company was being racist when giving out jobs. 

That's not slavery, that's modern day racism, but y'all are crying on the internet about ""I wasn't a slave owner"" instead of figuring out a way to fix this shit ASAP so that you're no longer getting fucked by the decisions of someone's racist ass grandpa!",Red_Dwarf_42,t2_jbf6yns4h,-2,0,reddit3

k9828oi,t1_k97hn8f,2023-11-14 15:40:00,MensRights,"At this point why the fuck not. They always talk about WWII while ignoring the fact that WWI was basically the British drafting and brainwashing Irish and Italian immigrants to fight to defend their empire. WWI resulted in the holocaust because the Germans basically got revenge. And as usual the allies are just the poor victims and they can't believe it happened. After war usually food is in short supply so the women will literally prostitute themselves for it. So if you take out all the bullshit propaganda and all the ""good guys vs bad guys"" nonsense basically they killed a bunch of German men during WWI and then fucked their women. Then cried about it when in WWII the Germans did the literal equivalent of a ""call the cops bitch"". And pre nuclear age might made right and it applies to all European colonial powers.

My biggest issue is that I have read so much random history that I have heard all of the bullshit before. American propaganda has basically inversed Nazi propaganda by making the black people the victim of oppression when largely they are the oppressors and the most violent people in the community. I use the Hutu as an example. No one ever brings that up. Even when BLM says ""the struggle is real"" I laugh because they're the burden. Anyone who thinks that looting stores and rioting is a political revolution is definitely a burden on all of us. The shoplifting is so bad where I live they don't carry designer shoes at Nordstroms anymore. Yay for exporting American culture throughout the globe.

The same way I laugh when I see some of these people walking around with swastikas who look like they've been vacationing at Chernobyl. You would think if you were going to start an evil empire you would come up with something original. And a lot of them don't really meet the brand standard in terms of looks or intellect. If you want to take over a government and murder millions of people tattooing a swastika on your face doesn't exact scream strategic political brilliance.

My major concern always has been the preservation of my constitutional rights. It's not the governments job to insure ""racial equity"". It's their job to protect the constitution from all threats foreign and domestic. And forcing businesses to hire people based on race is violation of their rights to freedom of association. And quite frankly I feel they are essentially seizing peoples property without due process by denying people jobs while charging people interest on loans they issued. They are also unjustly killing them simply by destroying their potential and time while vilifying them which is a very british thing to do. The problem is most white Americans don't want to be seen as the oppressors and DEI initiatives pray mostly on white women the same way a Nigerian Peanut farm scam does.

[https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/)

The woke mob is basically using the same tactics Woodrow Wilson used to suppress people during World War I on white people in America today. It's funny to me because even in Ukraine they use a similar tactics. Where there are blondes there's some American Jew trying to liberate them from oppression. They are probably going to do the same thing they did to me in America virtue signal and put them in debt and enslave them once the war is over. I assure you living in America filled with all this middle eastern diversity ain't that great. And quite frankly their only export is bullshit Abrahamic shit religions and slavery.

It's funny simply because their argument is they are saving culture and spreading American ideals. What culture? America is nothing but a bunch of fast food chains and hip hop. It doesn't even live up to it's own bill of rights at home. And its slowly coming under control of a bunch of bitter resentful minorities who want to control 70% of the population.

The American government literally indebted the entire white middle class children and then sabotaged their ability to pay back the loans they gave them. Usury how interesting. Somehow I always end up drawing conclusions and going down paths that I specifically try not to go down. The concept of racial equity is nothing more than a power grab and is extremely intellectually dishonest and subsists on a victim narrative not an actual accounting. If they want to do some kind of racial discounted cash flow analysis to value the equity of each skin color in the human race I am down. DEI is literally reverse eugenics. And I reject it for the same reason I reject eugenics who the fuck thinks they have the right to make these decisions? White and black aren't even fucking races. They are colors. And if you want to get technical black is the absence of color.

Once the government or the media starts promoting behaviors of any kind it changes the nature of the objection. For instance do I care about interracial marriage not really. But considering the african american community has had the bully pulpit on American musical culture for 30 years and have been pushing violent propaganda that threatens emasculates American Europeans while pretending they are apart of some revolution. And its not because your music is that great. You just suffocate practically every other genre by bullying your way into it and taking advantage of the fact that most young white people are to stupid to know anything else. Then Prince Harry goes around with his interracial bride talking writing books about how much he loves America. AWESOME.

The confederate planters wanted nothing more than to blend with the British aristocracy. These are the same people who's major complaint was poor white immigrants were hard to enslave because they blended in with the free white people. These are the same people who would impregnate the black slaves because they felt mixed raced children were more ""docile and industrious."" So while you may think your on some next level shit with your mixed race child. In reality your just making it easier for these people to differentiate one class from another. Because similar to world peace as long as humanity exists they will have preferences and discrimination in some form or another will exist. So once the media or the government starts pushing agenda I stop listening and start thinking about all possible outcomes. It may be a beautiful car but just because the car salesman is telling you the car is reliable, cool and a great buy doesn't mean he cares whether you can make the payments or how what he is selling is going to affect your life in the long term.

 Why sales? Because even if it's a small company that wouldn't be interested in discriminating its employees as it might be privately owned, the pressure to comply is still very high. 

Why? Because bigger companies that would buy their products such as supermakets or any big brand owner and manufacturer are generally listed on the stocks markets.

h3xanp5,t3_ocxwrc,2021-07-03 14:45:17,MensRights,"The irony is women don't do emotional labor either.   Unless bitching and bullying and manipulating counts as labor.  If you count unproductive, anti-social and criminal behaviors as labor I guess maybe they have a point.  At best it's labor aimed at getting someone else to do something for you that you can't be bothered to do for yourself.

It's like a slave overseer complaining to slaves that they just don't understand what hard work it is having to whip them.

 ---------------------

What would legitimate ""emotional labor"" look like?

* Which sex commits suicide four times more often?  If women are supposed to be doing real emotional labor that feels like a fail to me.  Talking people off the ledge is hard work and emotional alright, but it feels like women are slacking on the job if that is to be considered their job.

* Emotional labor could mean romance and the small acts of love that keep a relationship together.  But it's men not women who do that stuff.  Saint Valentine's Day isn't about women giving men gifts.  Everyone knows Mother's Day is taken seriously and Father's Day is a joke.  Ladies are not as good as men at emotional labor is one conclusion from that.

* Men are constantly seeking to understand and mollify women.  That's why we have sayings like ""what do women want?"" but women's take on men is lazy and dismissive ""men only want one thing"" (something women are then encouraged to withhold as emotional manipulation). We say ""happy wife, happy life"" but nobody cares about the man's emotional needs.  People who would laugh at how awful a present for a wife a vacuum cleaner is would be just fine with buying tools for a man.

* When men get called to deal with a beetle or a spider isn't that emotional labor?

Against this stuff feminists argue women do emotional labor because they remember birthdays (do they?) and keep in touch with family friends.  That sounds a lot like they're just doing whatever they would have done anyway.  It's like arguing that playing video games is ""communications labor"".

Hypoagency. If you need help, it's your responsibility to ask for help.

There's a lot of thing in her post that she's choosing to do, then she got overwhelmed and is now angry that her husband didn't ride up to her on a white horse as soon as she crossed the border from 'Things I'm Taking On' to 'Things I Need Help With'.

Also,

>he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

The husband very clearly stated why he doesn't get involved.

It's pretty clear that HE is doing a lot of emotional labour as she takes on too much, wants it all done 'the right way' (i.e., her way), and then gets upset when it overwhelms her and uses him as an emotional punching bag because it's HIS fault for not providing exactly what was needed in HER unknown, unspoken plan of action. 

It must be tiring going through that cycle.

To be fair, they both need to communicate their needs to the other.

It sounds like he wants to help but he wants also agency. He gets to do his tasks the way he sees fit. This would allow him to be more proactive.

It sounds like she wants ~~everything she doesn't have but needs, at the right moment and in the right way~~ more of his active involvement but she'll have to relinquish control and let go of the idea of perfection.

Finally, some people are just passive and will let cede power to whomever takes it. She must have known this before marrying this man but was perhaps too focused on the benefits to consider the negatives. A control freak can't have both a partner with passive personality that will allow the control freak the full measure of their power *and* the misandrist idealized version of a husband, who is competent and confident in all things, completely attuned to her emotions at all times and who will always shield her from reality by doing everything that needs doing in order to protect her from being overwhelmed.

Translation: I have put it on myself to do all of these unnecessary tasks, and since he does not agree that they are a high priority, and since he has failed to read my mind and gauge my expectations, I am going to invent new feminist terminology to attribute what he did to men being useless.

The one woman I've known in person who actually used emotional labor unironically had henpecked her husband so bad that the poor guy was just frozen. He'd make a valiant effort to make her happy by doing something, but then he'd do it wrong in her eyes, or he'd fail to guess what she *actually* wanted him to do, so she would get mad at him for it. He would shut down after this because it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't type situation.

>He says that he doesn’t ask what he should do to help because I’m a control freak (fair comment, I can be)

Oh, a self-admitted control freak has *also* henpecked her husband into being frozen, not knowing what to do. So she goes onto a feminist subreddit so people can enable her instead of working on her problem with her S/O. You can't make this shit up.

Her constant whining just makes her look like an exhausting person. In an 8-hour work day, I could completely plan an entire year worth of vacations, buy every type of insurance we need, do our taxes, do all of the holiday season shopping, meal prep for an entire week, clean our entire house from top to bottom, call special pickup for any old garbage we need to throw away, and even have time to clean out the rain gutters. The reason why I chose an 8-hour work day is because that's the average amount of time full-time working men spend working over full-time working women a week. 

Like, she's complaining about writing and recording a fucking *song* for someone, because obviously any reasonable person would put that right at the top of their priority list. Then she whines about men being shit.

Instead, expect him to magically understand (although you knew he didn’t before you got into a relationship with him) what needs to be done even though everything suggests that he does not. 
3. If he actually tries to help - do not under any circumstances accept a learning curve. Additionally, do not accept any autonomy from him. You do things your way - and he should know what you mean by your way. You shouldn’t have to tell him what to do, even though you will yell at him if he does something wrong.
4. Don’t talk about any of this. Be passive aggressive instead. Blame “society” even though you’re fully aware that you did not vet for or prioritize the traits you’re now angry at him for lacking when you decided to be with him.

Then after which, she complains about him not just helping out instead of asking if and where she needs help. That is so stupid it's insane. Firstly: she says he's quite good at the chores around the house, and maintenance. This makes me assume, everytime theres been a maintenance problem or a physical labor job, it's been his ass out in the sun or standing on top of a rickety labor, meaning she sat on the couch scrolling reddit or just handing him tools. I'm sure the husband wouldn't appreciate if she climbed that same ladder with him on it to help out, without asking if and where he needed help. The important part about asking where someone needs help is it avoids further setbacks by avoiding misunderstandings. She's complaining about him not being able to detect what needs to be done, which is all in her mind. Also, mother's day doesnt entitle anyone to anything except saying ""happy mother's day"". Seriously, who else took part in the action of you becoming a mother aside from your immediate family, and who initially asked to make a child? More often than not, it's the mother herself.

I mean I've never had a woman agree trade places with me.  Like not even factoring in a hypothetical job switch.  Just trading mowing and home maintenance and things like that for their share of the inside work (I already do quite a bit of the cooking and cleaning as it is).

As for gifts on holidays I do have a few observations there, but they mostly revolve around a lot of women thinking that kind of stuff is more important than it actually is, and taking control and bossing around the man they're with instead of letting him do things the way he wants to.

If I want to get something simple like a gift card to a nice restaurant and tell my mom in person how much I love her, and that's my style of doing things, why is that not valid?  Why do you automatically assume the consumerist, wasteful, frilly gift wrapped trinkets thing that she was doing is the correct way to do it?  And if he's leaving it to her it's only because she won't let him do it the way he wants to do it and he's leaned that mistake from previous years being with her.

Trust me I've been there done that with that exact type of woman and she, and every other woman like her, needs to take several steps back and give her man room to breath so that he can do things the way he wants to. Including for his own fucking mom on mother's day.  If she wants to do the wasteful, consumerist gift wrap bullshit with her own mom then she's more than welcome to. But it's his mom and if he wants to do something different he should be allowed to.  What you're looking at is an abusive, controlling relationship, and you are defending the abuser.  This type of shaming behavior is often what traps men like this into this type of bullshit.  And part of dismantling gender norms should involve calling out women like this who control and shame their partners and don't let them live their lives the way they want to live them.",Oncefa2,t2_15it3r,66,0,reddit4

In the most basic definition, no, of course I don't personally approve of men ruling over women as a socially accepted policy. But that was rarely and never truly the case in any society in history. In strictly hierarchical societies, yes, you had that dynamic at work but it was just as bad for lower class men. And really, it's not any different than what exists today where the wife of the highest standing man is second only to him.

But here we can see what's happened with the transition away from a patriarchical society: Women get the vote and immediately start voting perks for themselves with very little concern for society as a whole. Kooky ideas become the norm as ""experiements"" just to see what happens and society more or less starts breaking down with drug use and over-indulgence. Everything we've built more or less gets cashed in and used up because women as a group are terrible at planning for the future at a societal level. So, I kind of have to agree that patriarchy is good if the alternative is a bunch of flakey ideas using a lot of big words because they ""resonate"" with women without actually saying anything.",Past-Difficulty6785,t2_92u6vm9j,7,0,reddit4

Normally, I don't use the term 'equality' – in regards to romantic relationships – to refer to the balance of authority, but to the value of the persons. What people conflate quite easily in these conversations, is these two different kinds of equality.  


>Authority inherently implies there is a more powerful and a less powerful party in the dynamic, whether that be on the workfloor or in a personal relationship.

What you say here is true, and that's exactly what is so important as far as I'm concerned.

The reason there is a power dynamic in a company, is because the company is incapable of functioning properly without it. If there is no one consistently calling the shots on (important) decisions, you can forget earning a profit. It also has to be the case that the persons in these functions are suited for their positions. Different people have different skillsets; some people can be excellent project planners to carpenters, while they are horrible carpenters themselves.

None of this makes the people on the workfloor any less valuable than the manager, and it is similar in a romantic relationship.

The beautiful differences between men and women are designed by God to be complementary, not to be neglected. It's like switching the places of different cogs and gears in a perfectly designed machine. When you misplace these items, the machine may run for a while, or even just as long as it did before, but you will never reach peak performance when you tamper with an already-optimal design.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,2,0,reddit4

What you say is true; there are always going to be societal stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, which change over time. They will often line up with proper ideals of the two, but when that happens, it's a symptom and not a changing of the actual principles. We shouldn't line up to the expectations of society, but to that which is *good*.

One such stereotype that I horribly dislike, is the idea that an authoritative man deals with his wife harshly, and punishes her physically or mentally in a harsh way. As far as I'm concerned, a good husband deals with his wife patiently, in love, *much* *more* so with his wife – who he has committed himself to for the rest of his life – than with anyone else.

A man who is authoritative does not have to rule harshly, it's a big misunderstanding. While they coincide sometimes, they are *far* from the same thing. A proper leader *serves* the people he leads. He ought to do it for them and not himself. The same is true for a man and his wife; a man ought to lead his wife, but do so by serving her. If a man has an unhappy wife because of the way he treats her, he's doing just as bad a job as a manager with depressed employees.

As far as I'm concerned, assertively serving (who is yet to be) your woman – that would be chivalry – is right in line with the core of the design; it's an absolutely beautiful thing.

Societal ideas often flow from complementarian principles, but they *aren't* the principles themselves.

Things like women doing the cooking and men going out to work, are, more than anything, side-effects or symptoms of keeping to complementarian principles. So, a man staying home or a woman going out to work, doesn't necessarily make either less masculine or feminine.

Leading by serving is actually the best way to lead, but it's not one many people know is even possible, because they've (almost) never experienced it.

The most important thing in leading properly, is to talk to people individually. If I see that there is a better way to handle something in my relationship with my girlfriend, and my girlfriend disagrees, I sit down and talk to her. After all, if I have chosen the most sensible option, I can make a case through arguments that this is actually the best way to go about things.

So we sit down, I listen to her disagreements, and we talk through them. If she is wrong, she'll gladly admit it (not always in the moment, but she always does), so we can move on in unison. The reason we constantly talk about things, is because I can be wrong too. If she can explain to me by making a case that I'm wrong, then I'll have to admit it and we can move on in the same way.

That's leading by serving. A leader is just as human as the people/person he leads; he makes mistakes.

By leading this way, there is no room left for harshness, except for rare situations where it is necessary. I don't ""keep my girlfriend in line"", she stays ""in line"" because she loves me. She *wants* to take my advice, she *wants* to let me lead and she *wants* me to correct her when she's in an emotional mood. Not because I force these things upon her, but because she's experienced all that as very helpful and positive.

A good leader is one that people *want* to follow, because they know he can lead them well. As a Christian, Jesus is the perfect example of leading through serving. It is because he loved people that people came to listen to Him and to follow Him.",blanck24,t2_108mvy52,1,0,reddit4

My recommendation is not to involve HR.  it has been my experience that hr comes down on the side of the company and regards boths sides of an employee social dispute as being in the wrong. 

Sometimes a sympathetic manager can and will respond to your appeal, but the Peter principal ensures a large number of supervisors are not going to be responsive, particularly if they are the same gender as the ones making the sexist remarks.

It sounds terribly depressing, but the best way I ever found to deal with sexism in the workplace during my many years on the job was to ignore the ones engaging in it as a group, and mention my displeasure only in a one-on-one setting if they made a sexist remark to my face.  Over time, everyone came to understand where my limits were in that subject.

When women passed male-bashing joke emails or cartoons to me, I trashed them.  I did not make a negative comment in public or in front of several of their group about it though, lest I become their target, because as you may know sometimes a gossipy group can push a good worker out the door for not having the "" good humor"" to play along.   However I made my thoughts known in response to private conversation with one of them at a time, such as if one of them inquired why I didn't pin the cartoon on my cube wall like others did.

I've spent a lot of my life trying to challenge people on their beliefs and lay out for them the logic and reasons why I think they'd be better off with different behavior.  Success?  Almost zero.  But lately I've been experimenting with consciously deciding to talk positively about certain things and it's had a lot of impact on affecting people around me in what I consider is a positive way.  

For example I think a raw diet is very healthy.  I've seen science to prove this.  I've shown people science to prove this.  I've reasoned it out so many times.  And nobody was interested.  

So I switched strategies.  

Now whenever someone asks how I'm doing I answer with something like ""well to be honest I feel better than I've ever felt in my life"".  If they ask why I say ""It's been this way consistently since I started the raw diet.  I don't think I'm ever going back to cooked food.""  

I never make it about them and how they're wrong.  I make it about me and how right it is for me.  

It may take some creativity to be able to speak well of men without it being obvious that you're actively trying to engineer opinion.  But here are some examples.  I don't mean use these directly, but think of things like them to say:  

* ""Hey did you hear there are groups of guys who decided to stay in the buildings in NYC when everyone else left, so they could take care of the elderly people on the top floors.  They have to hike up like 50 flights of stairs to bring these people water and food.""  
* ""You know my husband has a pretty good sense of this sort of thing.  The other night he said ... ""  
* ""I really like that guy Maurice who delivers on Wednesdays.  Have you noticed he's never late?""  

In short, be an example, not a critic.  It may not seem like it's working at first, but it will be slowly building an image in their minds and it will improve their thinking.  

Also remember that it's not just a problem because it's sexist.  If your co-workers like to while away the hours by complaining about stuff it's also a psychologically unhealthy activity.  Focusing and talking about positive things makes people happier and more effective, so you won't just be exemplifying respect for men but also positive thinking in general.

Yes, they do happen sometimes, and that's why duglock suggested the direct orders to cease the activities. Thus they are being fired for not following directions as opposed to the act of harassment. All in all, it's very thoughtful on all sides of the coin. I mean, they could definitely just fire the individual for the sexual harassment and have **that** on the person's record but instead choose to side with a non-permanently-defacing-employee option.

I have hosted foriegn exchange students who had no idea circumcision even existed and were mortified when the subject came up over something on tv, and we had to explain why people in the west do that.  Those conversations threw me smack up against realization of my own over- extended priviledge as a westerner and as a mom.  

Now, I actually feel like circumcision for non-Jews serves no purpose whatsoever than to conform to a religious standard that never applied to my family in the first place, we not being of the Jewish faith.  

Perhaps the presence of a majority of men having been circumcised lessens stigma for practicing Jews, but at the risk of sounding anti Semitic, why should an entire society conform to any minority's religious practice?  Many of these men are from protestant or agnostic perhaps even Catholic families.  How did this practice even come to be the societal norm in the first place?

To be honest, I hold the medical establishment partially accountable.  After giving birth, women who otherwise have not even considered circumcision as an option are quizzed by doctors "" do you want us to schedule a circumcision for your son?"". The idea is then planted, and the decision is often made after only a short conversation about historically inaccurate reasons why others have traditionally done it in the past.  This exerts a very subtle pressure for the parents to conform.  They are new at this parenting business, who are they not to take the advice of the older and wiser medical staff?  The decision is even easier if the parents already circumcised an older brother.  

Now I think  if men wantto appear Jewish (or whatever other religions may require circumcision, i am not an expert on religions) it ought to be an adult decision, like getting a body piercing or tattoo.

This is exactly the kind of crap the MRM needs to weed out. Equating women with whiny infants. Thanks to morons like you, feminists and other critics always have material to draw on when they claim the MRM is just a bunch of misogynists.

At the time I realized like everyone that the driver discriminated against him for his skin color. It didn't occur to me the driver discriminated against him for his sex too.

Here's the start of the New York Times article:

**Danny Glover Says Cabbies Discriminated Against Him**

By MONTE WILLIAMS
Published: November 4, 1999

The actor Danny Glover, of the ''Lethal Weapon'' series, ''Beloved,'' and other films, filed a complaint yesterday with the City Taxi and Limousine Commission, charging a cabdriver with discrimination on Oct. 9 for refusing to allow him to ride in the front passenger seat.

Mr. Glover, who is black, said he was already angry because several hours earlier five yellow cabs had failed to stop for him, his daughter and her roommate at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue.

At a news conference yesterday in the lobby of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Glover, with his daughter, Mandisa, a senior at New York University, at his side, said he had been visiting her from San Francisco. When those cabs passed them by, Mr. Glover said: ''I was so angry. The fact that my daughter's here to go to school, it really upsets me that if she's standing on the corner waiting to get a cab, she can't get a cab. It happens to her, it happens to countless people every single day. The fact that I'm a celebrity, the fact that I'm visible, allows me to draw attention to this.''

tells you more about the fact women simply don't want the jobs, as opposed to any myth there's a ""patriarchy"".

Yet another example of the fact the ""Wage Gap"" is nothing but a myth in all but the minds of the delusionally persecuted and ignorant.

The fact is men work the dirty and dangerous jobs, as well as the more prolific and well-paid jobs. Women who say they want equality have no idea that men work more hours, including overtime, and that's why men earn more.

While i support the idea of women venturing into the realms where men historically dominate the fields, i can't help but think this is somehow going to be spun as the women failed because the men.

there will be some nonsense about ""barrier to entry"" and ""hostile environment"" to work etc, because it would else require the women admit they simply can't hack it doing some men's jobs.

the fact is women don't want these boring, dangerous, underpaid jobs. yet most women are totally fine letting their fellow men take-up the slack by doing dirty and dangerous jobs, while simultaneously complaining men aren't helping women achieve ""equality"" enough.

Then when women try to address the balance, they fail to support themselves to make the balance happen, proving their lip-service to such ""equality"" really is secondary to having the convenience of letting the men do all the work.

for all the hate against men for supposedly treating women like ""princesses"", the women certainly like to play the part well enough, right down to the entitlement and spoiled attitude of letting ""lesser"" men do the dirty work for them.﻿",p3ngwin,t2_3aa2m,4,0,reddit2

Most of these 'needs' were expressed before the first week was finished. I can't imagine pushing that hard anywhere as a new-hire.

It almost became a policy to avoid hiring them due to the extra hassles involved.

cn8gidj,t1_cn7ddka,2014-12-29 17:55:29,MensRights,"Ofcourse the demand is there. Doesn't mean it's right. The vast majority of women wouldn't want to date/fuck a taxi driver, so as far as they would be concern that guy is worth less than dirt. Better have a woman because, as the stereotype goes, she's safe and fun too! She's just another ""girlfriend"" with whom she can gossip with. It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that women are all safe and friendly kindred-spirits, and men are misogynistic assholes and potential rapists for even having a sexuality.

And men? Why wouldn't they want a woman driver? They would be fine with fucking/dating a female taxi driver, if the opportunity was there. So, what's the benefit of having a male driver when all other relevant factors would be equal?  It's not like they haven't been living the last few decades being told that a woman can do everything a man can, and that they would be misogynistic assholes if they ever thought differently.

The problem isn't that the demand exists. The problem is the amount of sexism, ignorance and prejudice towards men to support that demand. If you went back a few decades in the US. There would most certainly have been a demand for ""whites-only"" taxi cabs, even if it was all rooted in prejudice, racism, ignorance.  Given that it is entirely socially acceptable to discriminate against men, the bigger money is with the majority that stands by that discrimination.

cn8fobl,t1_cn7loxt,2014-12-29 17:30:02,MensRights,"It's not that men and women are ""meant"" to follow strict gender roles. That's like saying that, because there are more Indian drivers, this is ""their roles in society"". Which is both wrong and pretty offensive. Men and women can do the same things, the problem is that we live in a world where women still behave and are treated like princesses. They still want special treatment and have very sexist ideals, but still want men to provide it for them. 

 Most women don't want to work those hours because that would mean losing out on all the other social opportunities that would be abundant to them because they are women. Most women don't want to work those extra hours because the money is not as necessity for them the way it would be for men(having money is not a crucial/mandatory aspect of their social/sexual value). Most women would prefer to be driven and have fun/no-care than have to drive and be responsible/accountable. Given the same opportunities and preferential treatment, men would want the same things too.

 This is not even anything new. There's a reason why, in virtually every family, the father/man tends to be the one who does most of the driving. Not only does society reinforce those roles but women favour/value men by those gender roles.  This is a very similar problem to the one you have in STEM fields, where you have a lot of opportunities for women to succeed in those fields but find that most women don't want to work those fields because they have so many other alternative opportunities and privileges available to them.",ExpendableOne,t2_4o06h,1,0,reddit2

Because unless that information is available to us, that's pure speculation. An equally credible theory/reason (which is also speculation) is that women don't feel confident and safe enough in New York (where this service is being launched at) to become drivers. A.k.a. they aren't willing to take the risk/burden. If we find out that SheTaxi is willing to pay anywhere between $10 to $25 per hour (lower and upper average payrates for different driving services), then it's less about ""bad business"" and more about females having different priorities & levels of risk than males.

Edit: my speculation is further strengthened when you look at the taxi industry as a whole -- ""Currently only 3% of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female"". Clearly being a driver isn't something that appeals to that many females, and I think it's more than just because of the pay & prices.",CyberToyger,t2_6t6hx,1,0,reddit2

I mean, heck, lets contrast and compare. 

If I step into a car with a driver, I know, the chances are roughly 30 %. 

30 % I am going to get a tweaker. You know, someone with obvious heroin scars, that tries to tell me about the one time he saw buddah in church, and he told him his highschool was ran over by welsh people. That is why he had to eat all those magic mushrooms, you know, divine need...The one that you can tell has just been off the needle for 2 weeks, and that tries to get his shit back together , and the only place willing to hire is the taxi. 

30 % I am going to get habib. Yes, I am using the stereotypical asia Minor / middle eastern name, because it's a stereotypical situation and allways the stereotypical guy. Nice guy, funny accent, name with more vowels then I have ever seen in a plate, but ALLWAYS with a smile. They will tell you, with an unflinching smile, how their wive hates them, their kids no longer want to be recognised as his race, his friends back home  in the old country think he is a sellout, and his little dog got run over by a drunk driver, but like a dolphin, he is smiling. Yea, he may smell weird, or listen to weird music, but generally, if it is too obnoxious, he will turn it down, and if the smell bothrs you he opens a window. 

30 % are road ragers / east block true man . You know,. stereotypical tough guys, who will be tatooed, silent, and if pressured, will tell you how they tortured a guy once and try to forget how good it felt to crush his windpipe with their fingers. ALL, with out exception, have seen all the rambo movies, and can do chilling impressions. Someone that's ""connected"" got them the job. They will know the speed limit by heart, because they are the guys all the GTA players wish they could be, as they use anything on the road to their advantage, telling you how this is nothing, back in 95 in bosnien herzogowina, he already drove 2 ton jeeps like this through a warzone full of snipers, untill those damn serbs blasted away his buddies head with a machine gun, and he had to run them over, and now he can hear the screams, but he is not going to a doctor, oh no, doctors are for women and injuries that require more then the tools in his toolbelt. 

The remaining 10 %? Normal, everyday guys. Of whom about 3 % happen to be female. 

Yea. I hold a taxi driving male to the same status that I hold a restaurant waitress. It's the kind of job that hires you with minimal qualifications. The kind of job you can do even if you have nothing else. 

So, I do not mouth off, I only complain if it is extra heavy, and I try to take it up with the driver rather then mouth off to the bosses and try to get them fired. And you know what? 

The wildest tweaker, the most turban wearing habib, and the true men respect that. They thank me profusely, because fuck yea, they need the job, and more writeups, and they would have gotten fired. 

So, that Female only service? I support free business, I really do, but if all you have to offer is women only drivers, then feck, think about the following: 

Taxi driving is the most diverse job on the planet. you meet people of all ages and races there, and most of them are dirt poor, and are getting treated worse then fast food workers. 

So, of course, if someone wants to not get into a normal taxi, how about we check them for systemic racism? 
Oh, yea, you know, in the papers, I read how black guys want to rape the white women, and how indians allways do group rape, and russian guys, the even use tools....

Of course, they are not racist, of course they are not priviledged beyond belief, they just prefer to be driven by, you know, acceptable women, you know, non scary people, preferrably of their own race. ",Meistermalkav,t2_5mn5y,34,0,reddit2

>In [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), the name *hackney carriage* today refers to a [taxicab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab) licensed by the [Public Carriage Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Hire) in [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) or by the local authority ([non-metropolitan district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-metropolitan_district) councils or [unitary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_authority)) in other parts of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain), or by the [Department of the Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_(Northern_Ireland\)) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland).

>In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the police department of the city of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts) has a Hackney Carriage Unit, analogous to taxicab regulators in other cities, that issues *Hackney Carriage* medallions to its taxi operators.

Not really seeing a problem with this.

Look, I'm not one of those utopian capitalists who slobs the market's knob, but sometimes market solutions work, and this is one of those times. The idea that companies will refuse to hire competent women in ~~2014~~ 2015 simply because they're women is absurd.

So: HeBrokerage is artificially limiting its ability to hire competent brokers and will have to compensate with above-market compensation to attract talent and pass those costs on to its customers. Now, either there's a real competitive advantage to hiring men, or there isn't; if there isn't, then customers will see that HeBrokerage costs more but doesn't deliver results, and HeBrokerage will fail.

The feminist angle on this is that HeBrokerage will have an unfair competitive advantage _because of sexism_, and that advantage has to be artificially removed, but there's not much evidence to support the feminist position.",guywithaccount,t2_cpl35,2,0,reddit2

A single firm can't realistically attract more drivers without also paying it's existing drivers more.  You seriously think that shrinking the profit margin on existing customers in order to shrink the overall pool of customers is a smart business decision?  Everything here depends on marginal cost and price elasticity.  Taxi service is an interchangeable good and there is no added utility in having a female driver.  It's nothing more than marketing.

You're confusing business strategy with profitability. The best business strategy will be the least unprofitable, yes, but that doesn't mean that it guarantees that they will get enough revenue from that to make up their costs and actually turn a profit. The piece of data you're missing is that they're not profitable on weekends at the moment because they have too many cars to run and not enough drivers to service their customers.

Raising prices will allow for improved supply and better enable them to match their supply to their customer's demand. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be able to service enough customers at that price to stay profitable as a business at that time. They might only have 5 cars on the road at the current price, and be able to get 10 cars on the road at the market clearing price, and that might still not be worth the cost of maintaining the fleet and support personnel during that time.

icxf3tz,t1_icx3eqq,2022-06-19 09:38:37,MensRights,"Oh I'm sorry, are we casting for worst case scenarios?

Then no. Mens fear with feminists is that they'll end up abused, assaulted, accused, and disbelieved that any of the above is possible. Probably in prison since incarceration rates are several times more than that for women.

Less fear of direct death, more fear of having the rest of your existence be a tortured Kafkaesque nightmare where everyone believes you're a monster by default. Kind of like what you apparently believe given your ""venomous snakes"" example.

Context: Have been in an abusive relationship. Yes that included physical abuse. No I'm not going to elaborate on the details to assuage your next dismissal (""how can a woman hurt a man, she's tiny compared to him"" was I believe what one said). It was bad. *Really* bad.

Of course, feminist theory maintains that such a thing isn't really possible doesn't it? At least not without it fundamentally still being the male's fault as instigator:

> DV is intimate authoritarianism & if people could begin to see abuse as that-- an expression of an ideology/values system rather than as a personal failure or tragic but inevitable deviance-- they would also see the dire necessity of survivor-centered approaches to challenging it.

> As Bell Hooks said, ""the more accurate term for domestic violence is patriarchal violence because it reminds us that violence in the home is directly connected to male domination""

That's from a thread on r/feminism by the way. And if you tell me that bell hooks isn't one of the most important figures in modern feminist theory and literature, I'd call you a liar. And it's not a mischaracterisation either, it's not exactly a surprise she was writing news articles condemning the Central Park 5 when everyone else was suspicious about what was going on (to her, it was innate to men. Racism couldn't possibly be a factor).

icxb15z,t1_icx91bq,2022-06-19 08:36:18,MensRights,"I'm guessing that's to the last point. So: 

If a couple have sex, and the woman doesn't want to be a parent, she has the following options (many of which can be done unilaterally without including the partner in the decision):
  
* caps or diaphragms
  
* combined pill
  
* condoms
  
* contraceptive implant
  
* contraceptive injection
  
* contraceptive patch
  
* female condoms
  
* IUD (intrauterine device or coil)
  
* IUS (intrauterine system or hormonal coil)
  
* natural family planning (fertility awareness)
  
* progestogen-only pill
  
* vaginal ring
  
If any of those fail, she (currently) has the right to abort up to a certain point in the pregnancy. If the doctors are anything like the ones in the UK, they'll remove the man from the room to make sure there's no undue influence on the decision when talking to the woman. 
  
If she forgoes the multiple contraceptive and abortion options, she is able to give the child up for adoption. In the US, she can even use ""safe haven abandonment"" laws  to abandon the child at a police or fire station, no questions asked. This can all be done without any consent of the father (who may want to be a parent). 
  
Now let's flip it: a couple have sex, and the man doesn't want to be a parent. His options are:
  
* condoms
  
* vasectomy
  
If either of those fail, he is on the hook for 18+ years of child support for a child he didn't want. [Even if the conception came about through statutory rape of the father](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/). 
  
If a man wants to be a parent (or not), he needs the woman's cooperation. If a woman wants a man to be a parent, she doesn't require his cooperation at all. That is what unequal reproductive rights looks like.",EmirikolWoker,t2_7ky1i,18,0,reddit3

Im a guy and this was a female cashier at the time. We didnt have any stores open for her to manage at the time so while she was being trained to be a manager she was going to be a assistant at some other store until one opened up for her to take over.  


At some point near the end of her training my boss came in and said we needed to talk. I was sort of excited at this point as i thought maybe i was getting a raise finally. We go into my office and she informs me that i had a sexual harassment complaint against me after asking me a bunch of questions about my new wife and I's relationship. I had very recently gotten married. This sorta blew my mind. I was young and recently married and my relationship was awesome. This chic for whatever reason thought i was hitting on her or what i think happened after quitting years later for a better job and getting more experience with shitty people is she thought she could get me fired and take over my store.   


Either way what happened is i had her transferred out of my store immediately. My boss even before talking to me knew it was highly unlikely and had met my wife who was going to school not very far from where i worked. Im not a ugly guy, wouldnt say im super attractive either mostly average, wife is a little more attractive than myself and the person i was training was straight up unattractive (only noting this as seen a comment here where someone said you may be ugly).

There are no rules for life. Using this as an example of why you wont be nice or tip or whatever because ... women ... is garbage.

Your post lacks any context to her reaction or your history with her. Something about your gesture was enough that she had to talk to someone about it.

The $10 tip was not the issue -- it was everything else that caused the situation to be misread in some way by her. You made an error in reading the social cues that she was (likely) trying to politely and indirectly give you in whatever quantity. Rather then coming off as generous or thoughtful, you came across as a creep. Certainly at some point she said ""no that's not necessary"" and you insisted she take it. Or maybe you have made advances to her in the past and she has ignored you because she is not interested.

You are not a bad person for making this error. You shouldn't feel sorry or be sorry for what you did. Your actions prior to the event and your reaction (post) is also normal. But you should learn from the mistake if you want a different outcome in the future.

From your post, I assume that you work at the same place she does. If so, then you know there is an appropriate time to ""tip-out"" your coworkers who share your shift (or whatever the normal tipping practice is for your workplace). You went to work on a day you normally had off so you could approach her and use this ""tip"" as an excuse to engage with her. It backfired badly. OR maybe I am way off and she is pure evil - to that I would ask why on earth would you have gone out of your way to give her $10.

My advise, think more about the cutes she was sending you that you missed. Learn from it. Find someplace else to work, she may gossip to others and you don't want to rehash this. You will likely be labeled ""creepy"" by your other coworkers and find it difficult to recover from that.

Lastly, I don't see how this post is a MensRights issue under Rule 1. or maybe I take reddit to seriously.",eric_in_cleveland,t2_z6eae,-2,0,reddit4

Then I got a message from the moderator of the forums ""DON'T TRY AND MEET UP WITH OUR FEMALE MEMBERS, SLIME!"" huh?? I was a shy, withdrawn, anxiety striken Autistic guy who even a quick ""Hello"" and a smile would be difficult for me and I was gonna beef up the courage to do that.. Nope..

This is the attitude of the ""counsellors"" on Mensline. They do not believe that the men that call are victims. 

""About half the men will hang up pretty quickly, says Sarah*, who coordinates the service run by No To Violence, the peak body working with men to end men's family violence in Australia.""

These men hanging up would be the men that are being blamed for the abuse they're facing.

Men need a service to call that will be believed. Not a service that already assumes they're the perpetrators.

I was speaking to the current situation where the majority party in the Australian government is no ally of men as they perpetuate toxic masculinity. Not to mention their extensive records of misogyny towards even female members of their own cabinet. 

Now I don't agree with policies which refuse the service of any one gender (and simply because of gender). If it is a capacity issue and the feminists can solely choose one gender or the other, I'm not surprised they'd choose females.

fpf966d,t1_fpf6tjc,2020-05-04 04:00:26,MensRights,"Okay, so firstly, toxic masculinity is a smear word and the whole concept of it is a broken one, just like toxic feminism.  When you conflate the actions of shitty or bigoted people with masculinity or femininity you are attacking an entire sex.    It does a disservice to the concept of masculinity and femininity, and also offloads individual responsibility to the responsibility of a ""class"", which is part of the reason why there are some satisfactory arguments to be made that Feminism is modeled off Marxism, but I digress.

Initially you argued that the ""centre right party that puts in place misogynist policies while still harming men?"".  Then when I challenged it, you shifted it to saying that the men themselves are misogynistic.  Whether the individuals are misogynistic (or misandric, as we have seen as well) or not I don't disagree with but it's secondary to the original topic for discussion which is the policies and systemic bias against men.  And for the record, I pretty much despise the entire government in Australia and have yet to see an example of any good and altruistic public servants.

So my first question stands unanswered, and I'll elaborate this time in brackets for further clarity; how is the current system (such as policies and laws and systemic bias) misogynistic?

In terms of (I'm paraphrasing here) the concept of justifying Feminism choosing women if there is a capacity issue then sure, that doesn't surprise me either.  Thus far I haven't seen any evidence that there is though, and even if there were, they are still misrepresenting themselves by claiming to advocate for Equality.

As for some feminists being misandric; there's a bit to consider here.  Who are the real feminists?  The regular people who believe that feminism is about equality and truly care about men and women equally, and call themselves feminists?  Or the one's who wrote and championed the Declaration of Sentiments (1848)?  Or the one's who write the policies and change laws?  Karen Straughan has a great write up on the ""Not All Feminists Are Like That"" defense (otherwise known as NAFALT), which is predicated on the No True Scotsman fallacy.  My personal belief is that if regular people who claimed to be feminists did their research on how/what the three waves of feminism said, believed, and accomplished... They wouldn't call themselves feminists.

I gather that your response to my second question can be summed up in a couple points:  they choose women in situations that are potentially restricted by capacity because they need to, and that doesn't disprove that they are not about equality, and also, the people who claim to be feminists who write men out of laws and policies or are misandric are not true feminists and shouldn't represent the movement.  If that is essentially what you're saying (and please correct me if I'm wrong in my summary as I don't want to accidentally strawman you or put words in your mouth) then I respectfully disagree and do not accept that as evidence that Feminism is about Equality.

You wrote about being a victim of Domestic Violence and facing discrimination by the police who refused to help and threatened to investigate you knowing you were a male victim.

Domestic violence under Australia law:

> What is family and domestic violence

> Any behaviour that’s violent, threatening, controlling or intended to make you or your family feel scared and unsafe can be considered family and domestic violence.

> https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-family-and-domestic-violence?context=60033

Discrimination against victims is unlawful:

> In Australia, it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a number of protected attributes including age, disability, race, sex, intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in certain areas of public life, including education and employment. Australia's federal anti-discrimination laws are contained in the following legislation:

> Complaints of unlawful discrimination can be lodged with the Australian Human Rights Commission and relevant state and territory agencies.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/australias-anti-discrimination-law

> Australia Human Rights Commission: Make a complaint

> https://humanrights.gov.au/complaints#main-content

> What is the scope of the right to an effective remedy?

> Both the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have stated that the right to an effective remedy encompasses an obligation to bring to justice perpetrators of human rights abuses, including discrimination, and also to provide appropriate reparation to victims. Reparation can involve measures including compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, public apologies, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices.

> https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-effective-remedy

> Duty of Care (Vic)

> A duty of care is a legal obligation to avoid acts or omissions that could foreseeably lead to harm to another person. A breach of a duty of care that leads to harm to someone amounts to the tort of negligence. In Victoria, the law of negligence is governed by the Wrongs Act 1958, and by the common law. While in some circumstances it is clear whether or not a person owes a duty of care to another, in other situations it can be difficult to establish.

> https://www.gotocourt.com.au/civil-law/vic/duty-of-care/

This may be general fraud, as well as commonwealth program fraud as local police receive federal money to provide police protection to domestic violence victims without discrimination.

Australia fraud laws:

> General Fraud

> Fraud can be committed in numerous ways and span the range of Commonwealth benefit programs and assistance available to the Australian community, as well as the Australian taxation system. Because of this, fraud prosecutions are diverse and fundamental to protecting Commonwealth resources so they benefit all Australians. 

> https://www.cdpp.gov.au/crimes-we-prosecute/fraud/general-fraud

Anyone may report crime to the Australia Federal Police:

> Emergency contact

> In an emergency, call Triple Zero ""000"" for attendance by police, fire or ambulance.

> Non-urgent police assistance

> For police assistance where there is no immediate danger or to report non-urgent crime call 131 444.

> https://www.afp.gov.au/contact-us

Australia anti-discrimination laws include Commonwealth Agencies:

> 26  Administration of Commonwealth laws and programs

> It is unlawful for a person who performs any function or exercises any power under a Commonwealth law or for the purposes of a Commonwealth program, or has any other responsibility for the administration of a Commonwealth law or the conduct of a Commonwealth program, to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person’s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, or breastfeeding, in the performance of that function, the exercise of that power or the fulfilment of that responsibility.
				   
> Sex Discrimination Act 1984

> https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2023C00003

These may be false accusations manufactured by police as part of an ongoing policy of harassment and discrimination against male victims of domestic violence causing loss or risk of loss including access to children, access to property, equal treatment under the law, etc to those crime vicims.

In Australia, false accusations are a crime. Here is one defense attorney firm offering services:

> False Accusations – s 314 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)

> Being accused of making a false accusation can be a devastating blow to your reputation and future.

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/offences/fraud-charges/false-accusations/

> General Dishonesty Causing a Loss is an offence under Section 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

> To establish the offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

> You caused a loss or created a risk of loss to another

> You did so dishonestly

> You knew or believed that a loss would occur, or that there was a substantial risk of a loss occurring, and

> The loss or risk of loss was against a commonwealth entity

> https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/criminal/legislation/criminal-code-act/general-dishonesty-causing-a-loss/

Loss includes suffering, including knowing your child is being abused as a consequence of fraud:

> Loss

> Loss is damage, detriment, or suffering flowing from the act or omission of another. It is once this loss occurs that an action for damages or compensation can be brought. A common example of loss is that arising in personal injury cases. If you have suffered an injury that prevents you from working, then you may have suffered a loss of income. If you win your case and prove that you have not received income for a certain time period, then you will be entitled to compensation for your loss.

> https://www.lawright.org.au/legal-information/personal-injuries/damages-and-loss/

These potentially illegal acts may be the basis of a class action lawsuit in Australia:

Australia class action:

> Class actions are firmly established as a means by which a large group or class of persons can bring a claim in Australia. The amounts claimed are often large, proceedings are procedurally complex, legal costs are significant and adverse publicity may be significant.

> https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/quickguide-class-actions-in-australia/

I wish you the best of luck in your search for justice.

These jobs are scarce for everyone, men included.

Men do not bully each other and fight to get these jobs; they use performance and merit to try to beat off their competition, they go for outperformance.

So the fact that even if we assume that patriarchy “somehow created the job scarcity” it doesn’t explain why women behave negatively in that environment because men do not do the same thing.

This is ignoring the fact there is zero evidence that somehow “more top jobs exist for men than do for women” because quotas for women exist whilst they don’t for men, so how is that even possible?

The fact more men occupy top positions is probably to do with more men setting up businesses and corporations than women, so they occupy the chief position of their own ventures.

I know, hand on heart, that I didn't cause or meaningfully contribute to any of this, in fact I've had a hell of a lot of shit and disadvantages to deal with myself, as a man, and I've never blamed women for it (even if I should've).

But the fact is, I'm not responsible for these supposed sexism-induced hardships that women complain about. I believe in the right person for the job, always. I've never been a handsy cigar-smoking 1960s CEO, I've never been a 19th century politician. It's not and will never be my responsibility to make up for that, even if *were* universally true that benevolent sexism is somehow negative discrimination (and not protection or benefit) or that women have always been oppressed, denied freedom, and kept as pets.

So I don't take kindly to suggestions that I should be blamed, punished, or further disadvantaged for it.

I'm a grown adult. I'm responsible for *my* actions. Not that I have a choice in the matter, because nobody listens even if I explain all of the ways I've had potential and decades of my life kicked out of me, that's still apparently exclusively on me to deal with. If I start a ruck at work and I get fired for it then *I* fucked up. I don't get a free pass because ""patriarchy made me do it"" (even if, by feminist logic, *it did*). That's what happens when you're granted a role: you also adopt the responsibilities which come with it, whether you like it or not. It comes as a package deal. You want paying? You want respect?

Don’t go and pretend like it’s women that are killing all these men. At the end of the day, it’s another man that’s killing all those men. How many times have you seen a women go shoot an assualt rifle into a crowd of people compared to a “man?” You could be lying for all I know about the men dying due to harder working conditions, but fine. Women have a higher mortality rate than men in all domestic violence and sexual assault cases. Girls under the age of 15 have a higher homicide rate than boys under the age of 15. Don’t lie and say more men are victims of sexual assault when that’s a blatant lie. I can 100% guarantee all the women you know have been victims of sexual assault or harassment: your mom, your sisters, cousins, aunts, grandma, any female relative you have. You can go ahead and ask them but do you honestly think they’re gonna tell YOU the truth. Nope, they’ll lie and tell you no, a man has never sexually assaulted them and just feed into this delusion that MEN are victims of sexual assault. If you wanted to say children and young boys(in their youth, meaning when they’re under the age of consent) are big victims of sexual assault then you’d be right. But again, it’s not just women who are sexually assaulting them. Men are pedophiles, just like women can be, too.

frgk6hw,t1_frgilco,2020-05-22 16:04:16,MensRights,"Just gonna leave this here. Not my own comment, so please don't bother replying:


So this is probably pointless but i'll try and articulate to this subs posters what the problem is by using two comparatives terms for the same phenomanae.

Toxic masculinity V Restrained masculinity.

Masculinity is viewed by men as an internal driving force, something akin to a soul though not particularly spiritual.

If a man cannot express emotions because of societal expectations, there's broad agreement this is a problem and bad. The objection people have to the term toxic masculinity to describe this is that it is ascribing the problem to the masculinity rather than the restrictions placed on it.

While the former term casts masculinity, even a subset of it, in a negative light, the latter places emphasis on the restrictions and casts masculinity in neutral or positive terms.

This is why people claim you are shittalking masculinity and/or men. Because that is in fact what you're doing by using the term.

It casts masculinity as something that has to be policed and changed rather than liberated.

&#x200B;

Comparing these two terms for the phenomena being discussed highlights the problems with the term toxic masculinity as well as why everyone other than members of your very particular movement finds it offensive and anti-male. Insisting people don't understand what you're discussing is missing the point, because you've clearly not understood their objection either, and that's because you're discussing masculinity differently. You're all viewing it as a set of gender norms, and they're viewing it as an internal driving force. This is where the ""And you're wrong"" comes in:

There is a wealth of literature for thousands of years on how masculinity is an internal driving force, and the mens movements of the past few decades adopt this view. It is not for a womens movement (feminism) to up and decide to use the term to describe this thing about men in a way that doesn't jive with mens understanding of it, and then expect men to conform to their new usage.

&#x200B;

So if you want to discuss toxic gender norms, use those words. But if you use the word ""Masculinity"", you're referring to an internal driving force, not gender norms. Everybody outside the feminist cult understands this. You're being misunderstood because you're divorced from the rest of the species on how this term is understood, and you're using it in a way that is alien to men. That in itself is pretty ridiculous and offensive, that you think you can just up and decide to change the meaning of a word quite important to men.The problem isn't that we don't know what you're saying. It's that YOU don't know what you're saying when you use the word ""Masculinity"".

As such, when you use the term ""toxic masculinity"", you are in fact referring to something internal to the man and how it causes their problems, not to societal expectations. You are in fact victim blaming. And it's a ridiculous and presumptuous kind of appropriation for you to think you can come along and redefine masculinity and what it means in order to cast it as societal rather than internal, despite almost no men liking your movement or how it behaves.The double standards have also been highlighted, as has how this term in effect demonizes masculinity (Again, rather than the restrictions on it).

All of this in conjunction convinces people you're a hate movement actively malicious against men. I don't take that view. I think you've behaved presumptuously, arrogantly, and with no self-awareness over the term masculinity, that you've not really grasped the nature of peoples objection to your usage of the word toxic in relation to it, and that you're convinced that people ""Aren't understanding"" and ""aren't listening"" rather than wondering ""Am I just being incoherent?"". If you'd wondered the latter, you might have looked into why and realized the problem.

&#x200B;

Again. If you wanted to discuss toxic gender norms, then you should have done that. If you wanted to discuss restrictions on masculinity, then you should have used terminology to reflect that. Instead we got this garbled mess. It's also worth noting (Again), that mens movements have discussed this for a while, so the arrogance and misandry involved in the terms history is there too. If you really gave a shit, you would have read up with mens movements before throwing this garbage around. As a comparison, it's like up and deciding you ""care about native americans"" and then running around spamming a bunch of ideas about them they disagree with and find objectionable, all while never having consulted any.

&#x200B;

But the ridiculous part about that is that most women do all of the thinking, planning, and worrying about the outcome of things because they want to be able to rigidly control everything in order to mitigate their anxiety or ensure that everything will be ""perfect"" according to their own personal opinion of how things should be.

They'll spend weeks meticulously planning what they're going to serve at Thanksgiving and mulling over each of their choices, comparing it to events that they've been to in the past or the tastes and preferences of all the guests that they've invited... 

If you want me to plan Thanksgiving I'll be able to hammer out a list in the next hour of the various dishes I'm going to serve and the ingredients I'm going to need. Although I might forget something and have to do a bit of last minute shopping... I'm not going to worry about it because it... doesn't... fucking... matter... that... much.

I can't speak to women's lived experiences growing up. I'm not sure whether this need for strict control over everything within their household is a function of personal pride (ie - Need to be better than friend/relative/mother), wish fulfillment (ie - Spent their adolescent lives dreaming about throwing lavish parties and being a social butterfly), or anxiety about the event.

That's what they mean when they talk about ""emotional labour"". They seem to believe that everything in their lives needs to be meticulously scheduled, planned, and itemized instead of just dealing with situations as they arise. Sometimes it can be helpful to have someone who's ""keeping track"" of what needs to get done, but it often ends up going completely out of control in a desperate need for control that ends up tiring them out... annnnd then they complain that they're doing ""all the emotional labour"" when in reality, they're doing work that didn't need to get done in the first place.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,84,0,reddit1

Being able to empathize, have sympathy, connect emotionally, be mindful of yourself and of others, have patience, manage emotions, communicate feelings, etc.  So doing emotional labour, is performing tasks related to emotional intelligence.    


This would mean that generally speaking *she* is more aware, considerate, and supportive of his *emotional* state than he is of hers.  *She* is patiently dealing with the fallout of *his* emotions.  *She* is the one who expresses more empathy.  *She* supports him in his emotions and feels like he doesn't support her.  She is mindful of his emotions when choosing what to say (which can often require patience, as emotions can be unreasonable).

If a woman suddenly is unattracted to her husband (e.g. he cries when his father dies) she may tell him ""I never loved you, I never orgasmed during sex it was all fake, I never found you attractive"". 

In the moment she will feel strongly that this is true, even if it really isnt. As a consequence she will feel angry for all the times she was nice to him or respectful towards him over the years. Suddenly there is a massive debt of emotional labour which appears out of nowhere seemingly, as history has been rewritten. 

All those times she was nice and feminine were a lie, and fake, and so emotional labour, since you the man were ""never truly masculine"", as she has seen you at your weakest moment.

A woman who is submissive to and in love with her man will never bring up emotional labour. She loves to feel useful to him, it feels incredible. She will want to bake cookies and be soft and sweet. If you try to stop her she will be hurt or insecure. You must allow her to feel valuable for her to feel loved and secure.

Its when she loses respect suddenly everything will be emotional labour. She will resent her husband and saying ""hello"" will be emotional labour as she hates him and is disgusted by him. Being in the same room as him will be enough to anger her.

More likely it's a combination of three different factors.

1) Their primary female role model (their mother) was a stay-at-home mom who was responsible for the management of the household and had ultimate authority over these types of decisions. She maintained a clean house, planned all the family's major events, and was ultimately ""in charge"" of everything. Since she's the person who they looked up to from an early age, this behaviour and these expectations have been firmly ingrained in their sense of ""what's right"".

2) Women's slightly higher propensity for neuroticism combined with their heightened sense of contentiousness causes them to experience elevated anxiety relating to unplanned changes to their schedule or a lack of self worth when things don't go according to plan.

3) They consciously want to be the person in control. It contributes to their self esteem to be the person making all of the decisions, and their self image of being a competent home maker who is taking care of their incompetent spouse makes them feel valued.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,2,0,reddit1
jwdrvlo,t1_jwd4hrj,2023-08-16 03:19:54,MensRights,"I'm glad that you and your husband have found a comfortable medium and that both of you have chosen to share the burden.

But this comic still fails to understand the fundamental point that a significant amount of this 'mental load' is garbage that women are allowing to live in their head rent free out of an instinctive desire for everything to be perfect.

To use the comic itself as a decent point of reference... there is absolutely no reason why she can't have the father cooking the food for the children and greet her friend at the door... all it would take is to say ""Honey, can you watch this while I'm..."" and a reasonable partner would do so. She's making a choice (though perhaps a subconscious one) to do multiple things at once for some reason. 

The man doesn't merely 'expect his partner to ask him', he sees the world in a fundamentally different way. The dishes don't have to get done immediately, the cotton buds can get scribbled onto a list that goes on the fridge and be forgotten, there doesn't need to be a fucking -schedule- for when you order vegetables, there doesn't need to be a post-it for paying for bills, or a calendar item for vaccinations, or a mental note that the kids are growing, or that something needs cleaning.

A significant amount of this ""mental load"" is irrational bullshit born out of a need for ironclad control. It's okay to want to carefully plan important things and when a partner feels that they're taking on too much and their needs aren't being met, they need to communicate and establish a consensus about which things need to be planned and which things are just unimportant crap (nobody needs to plan to buy the damn mustard, you just add it to the shopping list and then forget about it until you're going to the store, nobody needs neurotic hyper-vigilance about their selection of condiments, nobody is going to starve to death without mustard).

Spouses just need to work together to establish routines and to emphasize each other's strengths. From a statistical and psychological perspective women are sometimes more prone to negative emotion and far more conscientious than men. Whether this is nature or nurture is debatable (despite this comic's desperate insistence that it's entirely a learned behaviour) but in the end people need to work together as a team as you and your husband are doing... rather than growing to resent each other for perceived slights.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,4,0,reddit1

The women who routinely complain about the ""emotional work"" they're doing are people who insist that they need to keep track of everything and plan things in advance. They do this because that's how -they- would prefer to live their lives (for a number of reasons). 

It only becomes a problem when they insist that their way of doing things (meticulous planning) is the ""right"" way to do things, and then decide they're going to shoulder the emotional baggage of those plans without effectively communicating to their spouse.

The way to ensure your emotional needs are a priority is to communicate those needs to your family... but doing so means that you also have to be open to changing how things are being managed and let go when the rest of the family doesn't share your view. (Most women complaining about ""emotional work"" aren't willing to do so).

Regardless, your point's still valid. There are women who are legitimately doing this for their family, but in those instances they've likely communicated appropriately with their spouse about the work involved, **arrived at a consensus**, and aren't the ones complaining about emotional workload.",FiveMagicBeans,t2_4dan8,15,0,reddit1

jwfo71y,t1_jwflong,2023-08-16 14:29:06,MensRights,"Well, first of all.  *IM not the one saying it.*  I'm making the argument from the women's point of view for you.  The woman who feels she does the emotional labour.  

However, statistically speaking women do score marginally higher on measures of emotional intelligence than men.  But its hard to control for all factors, and is influenced by social environments or motivations.  The gap between the sexes is still small.  


>it doesn't mean we don't know how to interpret emotions

In particular, it means we don't know how to *Process* our emotions.  Generally speaking men have fewer tools because men are taught emotions are weakness.  We're taught ""men don't cry"" and displays of emotion are stoic failures.    


Of course, *not all men* are this way, because it depends how each individual was raised.  But *statistically speaking.*   these trends can be observed.",PrecisionGuessWerk,t2_avkzi56g,0,0,reddit1

Regardless of how *you* feel.  *most* people feel good when they dress well.
