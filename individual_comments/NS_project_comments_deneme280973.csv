Having been on both sides of the union fence(I prefer the union side) I can tell you that a unionized workforce does have a better attitude about safety and safe practices; to which some terms about safety and accountability are usually spelled out in the contracts.  Where as the non union side is more apt to gung ho it, get 'er done, in lieu of best safety practices, (for the most part depending on the industry) the non union side does not address it in the same manner and usually a bit more laxed in safety practices.


While people are people and do stupid stuff that get themselves and others killed having a contract in place that states you can be held responsible for your actions goes along ways towards making the work place a safer place to be.


But remember this folks to the employer you are just a hunk of meat to be wielded to make them money.  If you do get hurt or killed, no big deal to them, they will just get another hunk of meat.

I commented on a paragraph sized article that apparently is the Bible on occupational safety and why unions are the cause. Meanwhile it’s written in the U.K. where only 26% of the work force is unionized. Which means 74% is not. So many more people are not union the metrics are different. Of course more people are hurt there is a ton more. If the population was 50/50 union/non union and 90% of the union folks are not getting injured while 90% of the non unions guys are then yeah! We need more unions they are doing something right.

e1nhi1v,t1_e1myo1v,2018-07-02 12:06:39,science,"Opioid overdoses have been linked to high risk industries, such as [construction](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/11/opioid_overdose_deaths_which_j.html) and another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23143851) showed that 57% of individuals who overdosed from opioids also had at least one work-related injury. Maybe somehow a study could connect the Zoorob study and the studies linking work-related injuries to opioid overdoses. I don't do study design, but would love to use the results. Below are some limitations I can think of.

a) Non-fatal workplace injuries are difficult to measure as there is limited record keeping enforcement (which has recently been weakened - longer post) and limitations to the aggregation of injury data. BLS estimates that their non-fatal injury and illness records are an underestimate. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16607189) shows Michigan injury and illness data didn't capture up to 68% of injuries and this [older national study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14724473) shows BLS data didn't capture 33-69% of injuries. 

b) Injury reporting, OSHA, and workers compensation systems are different depending on the state. That makes it difficult to get a national perspective and get a true handle on the scope of the problem. On top of that - workers comp (an information source that has historically been used with BLS data) is becoming less reliable as [workers comp laws change](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation) to increase the burden of proof for the worker and reduces compensation.

c) OSHA standards have not become weaker. However, fewer OSHA standards have been created or updated since the agency was established and funding for the agency (standard setting and enforcement) has decreased. The AFL-CIO does a [comprehensive report](https://aflcio.org/reports/death-job-toll-neglect-2018) around these issues.

This is absolutely the norm in the humanities and not a red flag at all in those fields (indeed, the opposite is more likely to be the probably-unfair assumption: that having the advisor as a co-author really means that the advisor did the work). This is in contrast to disciplines in which lab resources (and thus grant money) are employed in producing grad student research, where the norm is to list the advisor as a co-author and where the lack of inclusion of the advisor *might* indicate disagreement over some aspect of the work.

""Government"" is a weird category, of course, in that ""Government"" departments often combine theory and more statistically- or empirically-driven investigation (this is true at Harvard). My knowledge here is pretty limited to people who focus on theory, and it would be unusual for them to co-author with their advisors.  I don't know a whole lot about the authorship practices of the more statistically-driven side\*, which this article seems to fall into, so I can't speak to how weird it is in this particular case, but it's research with no funding source and no ""lab"" work broadly-construed and so could easily be done without any sort of tangible intervention from an advisor. Given that neither particularities or broader disciplinary norms seem to require it, I don't think we should expect it. 

All-in-all, this seems like a *really* bad reason to discount this sort of study.

One example: Dutch work-related deaths showed a **20\% increase in 2013, and a 30\% increase in 2016**. When looking at a longer period, the number of **work-related deaths from 2012 to 2016 doubled!** There must be something terrible going on!

That doesn’t mean I don’t have a lot of serious criticism of police unions. The biggest problem with police unions is that they’re usually lead by police officers while most other unions are lead by professional union organizers or attorneys. When there are accusations of police misconduct, the cop union bosses usually go in television with an angry press conference and throw gasoline on the fire by getting very defensive and hostile toward their critics, ratcheting up the tension and animosity at a time when diplomacy and restraint would be better. Sometimes the inflammatory statements by the cop union bosses are even technically correct - after all, not every accusation of police misconduct is credible - but they don’t help anybody and only make the situation worse. And most of the time, their inflammatory comments aren’t correct at all. Either way, it would be better for everybody involved if they didn’t fight their battles in the press and hurl verbal grenades at BLM activists and other critics. I really think it would serve everybody’s interests - including the police - if police unions were run by union professionals instead of cops.

The union was a neccessity 100-120 years ago when there were unsafe working conditions and wages were meesly. Today, there are plenty of laws that ensure workplaxe safety. Plus, companies know that if they do have unsafe working conditions, then they will either close because people will stop working there. Or to stay open, they will have to pay more. 
For the union itself, its the physical manifestation of what the American Forefathers fought against. Its an organization (form of government) with a central figure who holds a lot of power(king), and said individual and organization forces everyone within the company(land) to pay either a union due to join and be a member of, or ""service fee"" (see taxation without representation)[you vote to become unionized, not to dictate rates and services.

If anything a lack of unions allows an unsafe work place to continue being unsafe. Think about it. Its like a business that can't function if it actually paid its taxes and you're saying the only businesses that should be in business are the ones that will pay their taxes if nobody is checking over their shoulder that they are. Its contradictory really. You also presume that unions play no role in retaining standards. The real reason unions exist is because they empower employees who have no power otherwise to challenge management. Its like if the court rights an injustice and you say ""well now we don't need courts"" like there'll never be a new injustice, or a reversal.",monsantobreath,t2_zjhot,12,0,reddit2

Part of the agreement between union and employer is that the union will pay for certain things, drug testing was probably part of an agreement between the two entities, and historically drug testing was used to keep the union White. This is because most drugs used by white people are water soluble and easy to flush from the body whereas cannabis is fat soluble and at the time was primarily used by Hispanics, Puerto Ricans, and African-Americans.

People aren't generally concerned about people Unionising, people are concerned about the rights it takes away from individuals.

The two of us should be able to negotiate that at our discretion, without having to get involved with a Union I have no interest in being in.  

The problem with many policies when unions get involved a worker loses his ability to negotiate his own worth.  The Unions don't want it voluntary, they want the most people possible forced to pay and they want the power to determine your fate.  That's horseshit.

The companies get to make the choice in who works for them, especially now that affirmative action is finally on the chopping block and companies are getting sued for discriminating against men, caucasians, and asians. 

>Government can't come down and tell company X to hire you, that'd be a gross overstep of rights.... unless a union is involved, then people stop caring about rights.

Maybe you don't know what right to work is, because this is a little backwards, but it doesn't matter. With the SC decision, non government institution can't decide whether or not you get and keep a job. 

>If a worker doesn't agree with the goals of a union he can get work somewhere else

Before, false. Unions aren't specific to a company, they're specific to an industry, like a grocer union, which by the by is a perfect example of a union that takes everyone's money, forces them to go on strike and then accomplishes basically nothing over the course of a comically long strike and negotiation process. 

Presently, you don't have to pay an incompetent union to work in an industry they claim to represent. You can choose to support your union if it is competent and you support its goals. 

If it was a government institution, this would be a 'taxation::representation'-esque situation. 

>Free market, go find a competitor.

You must not know what a free market is. If a lobby institution controls who a company can hire based on mandatory tax (aka forced speech and association, violates the first amendment twice over) to employees who can't opt out of the tax, that is not a company operating in a free market.

You're being dense. This is a constitutional issue, that's why it went to the SC. Unless you can explain how it's not, you got nothing.

Allowing people to negotiate individually has its own problems. As I said earlier, any divisions in the workgroup can be exploited by management.

Or nothing at all now if you are in the public sector and don't want to join. But you retain the right of representation from the union that still bargains for you.

Every time a company successfully negotiates an employee below their worth, or doesn't grant them a raise, it decreases the average salary in the position. It works both ways.

Unions seem to be an artifact of industrial revolution, weak federal government. Even most anti-union people acknowledge their past necessity and that they are responsible for uncountable deaths and injuries prevented.

We do not have a weak federal government now. Regardless of what you think about current policy trends, the fed can and has severely regulated industry. Unions are a second, *private* layer of regulatory bureaucracy. This allows much more variability of conditions even within the same industry. Also, the spotty oversight is what allows all the union horror stories of bloat and corruption that get brought up every time in this debate.

Take the Amazon warehouse working situation. One side keeps insisting that there should be a union for Amazon. If there are abuses happening, then don't *all* warehouse workers need more protection? We have an entire arm of the federal government that is supposed to be looking out for worker rights. Why advocate pro-union legislation instead of directly pushing for universal improvement of regulation?

This isn't the 1920s. If workers are being taken advantage of, we should look to the federal government. Unions seem like a wasteful stop-gap solution to a problem, not a fundamental solution. They are an unneeded layer just like the medical insurance industry. If people cannot afford to get medical care directly, the system is fundamentally broken, and society as a whole should fix it (government). If workers cannot secure fair practices from employers directly, then society as a whole should fix it. ",Orwellian1,t2_7lmcs,2,0,reddit2

If no states had RTW over these years, the model implied counterfactual is that about 131,436 occupational deaths would have occurred instead of the observed 138,736 occupational deaths.

EXACTLY. Hypothetical scenario:

There’s a collective bargaining agreement saying all new employees who join the union start at $20/hr. The company, seeking to undermine the union, tells a new hire, “if you don’t join the union, we’ll pay you $22/hr.”

The new worker, seeking short term gain, doesn’t join the union and pats himself on the back for being smart enough to get himself an extra $2/hr. 

Over time, union membership plummets. Eventually, the union collapses and essentially ceases to exist. 

Now that the union is effectively destroyed, management holds a company-wide meeting on Friday at 4:00pm. There’s a big announcement: everybody is getting a pay cut to $15/hr.",gotham77,t2_161pde,2,0,reddit2

On the contrary, they would be subject to legal liability if they do not represent someone in the bargaining unit, even if they are not a member of the union.

That's not true at all. The union has great leeway in defining bargaining units. In some cases they can even redefine them retroactively after an election is held. 

Unions are absolutely allowed to form members-only unions. They refuse to do this, because they want to pretend they're ""forced"" to represent everyone and collect fees from them, but there is nothing preventing them from representing only members, except their own stubbornness.

Most of my cases dealt with management targeting employees and harassment. Dealing with the government as a public sector worker is like dealing with management anywhere else, especially at lower levels. A lot of public agencies have significant amounts of budget and policy latitude at lower levels. 

Further, in the last contract bargaining round I was involved with, the union uncovered nearly $2 Billion being stashed in an outside account and not being properly audited/accounted for, while the management side cried that they had no funds. Public sector unions can provide a public service in that regard - they have the power to request information that government management may otherwise try to hide and help to uncover mismanagement and misuse. They also are run by government employees who have “inside” knowledge of budgets, government workings, etc. 

In a way, I do agree with the notion that someone shouldn’t be forced to join. My biggest issue is the free rider problem. Abood tried to balance this with fair share fees and I think that was reasonable. It was clearly stated in my job offer that I would have to pay such fees.

There is also something to be said of creating a 'just cause' contract that wouldn't be possible to negotiate individually.

However you feel about the contract that comes out of it, all of the benefits of it are paid for by members and enjoyed by members and non-members alike.

We have a MUST ( managment and unions serving together) safety program as does most of the labor unions in Michigan. It is part of the collective contract. As a labor union we need to supply the contractors with workers who aren't on drugs. So that's where the must program comes In. Its our way if assuring the contractors we aren't all on drugs. In said program, you have an annual drug test and randoms. Literally got a random in the mail last week and I'm a bad ass journeyman union electrician, haha. It come with paperwork to get reimbursed for your time. The thinking behind this is, technically you are doing something for work hence you should be compensated or PAID. 50$ a drug test If you complete it within the allotted time. Any drug test out side of this program is paid for by the contractors. 


In no way, shape or form are you to contact your employer and ask to be put on a certain job or left off another. This is called soliciting your own work and is very frowned upon in the IBEW. Things may be different in different unions so ymmv",TheNetDetective101,t2_42ztuss,1,0,reddit2

And the government unions is extremely necessary. In the private sector, they're there for safety and working conditions. In government, they're there for wages and accountability. No one wants to pay taxes. But those taxes pay gov employees. There's a reason government jobs pay like shit. With weak unions, they're even worse. No one wants to work for 30% under market pay which is what some gov jobs with weak unions make. And if no one wants to work for that, then the gov sucks. My department is having such a bad retention problem because of this and a big retirement boom is happening right now. If it doesn't get fixed then the public is going to suffer in 5-10 years because it's a very important public facing department. So gov unions are not only important for the employees, but for the general public as well.

Regardless, the SC ruling sucks not because you were forced into the union, but because by law the union is required to represent you. The ruling means that you don't have to pay but the union is still forced to represent you.

If you put it into stock, then it is used to grease the gears of that corporation. The corporation then aims to repay you in increased value for the shares you now own.

In the past, this was done through spending on innovation and marketing to grow the consumer base.

When I *lodged* a complaint, I was told I did not appreciate how hard my job had worked to take care of me during the  3 month furlough period and subsequent mandatory redeployment.


*I forgot to mention, the furlough took place from Sept-Dec which means just after the extra $600 a month (week?) for unemployment ended but before the extra money from Biden started...*

h540mgq,t3_ojfdae,2021-07-14 02:37:04,science," The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element, tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons, which gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called morons.

Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with. According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a second.

Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.

Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.

Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.",Thewhiteguyyouhate,t2_584ne26d,25,0,reddit4

I knew from the way I was being treated there I would never get a raise so I never bothered to ask for one. The manager said to me during the review that my performance needed work because I wasn't staying back after my shift and there was an incident where a customer wanted to order something but there were no staff members to serve them. 

The reason why I stopped staying back after my shift was because the person who was meant to takeover after my shift ended would clock in and deliberately avoid the cafe area for half an hour or sometimes more forcing me to pick up the slack. I would constantly have to chase up management to get those minutes paid so in the end I stopped staying back. 

What annoyed me during the review was that my manager emphasized the fact that I would be getting paid for those minutes when the whole reason I stopped staying back was because I wasn't (unless I chased them up about it).

The second factor suggested by literature on bullshit concerns the communi- cation behavior of high-status individuals in organizations. Since leaders are likely to be the most important and influential bullshitters in organizations (McCarthy et al., 2020, Spicer, 2017),

third factor, concerning bullshit language. This factor reflects how bullshit transpires in the workplace. As noted earlier, bullshit involves communicative acts that have no regard for the truth, and that are typically made with the bullshitter’s agenda in mind (Spicer, 2013).


The results confirmed the three distinct factors of the OBPS. The first factor, named ‘regard for truth’, includes all items that relate to the use of evidence- based decision-making supported by the incorporation of data sources. The second factor, named ‘the boss’, includes all items that pertain to an evaluation of the actions of one’s superior. The third factor, named ‘bullshit language’ includes items that relate to typical characteristics of the language of bullshit communications, namely excessive use of acronyms and jargon (McCarthy et al., 2020).",anddowe,t2_149lt7,124,0,reddit4

You percieve whatsever is in your mind, which is a result of the inputs from your senses, that are subsequently processed before you're aware of it. so the only thing anyone can observe, are actually perceptions and not truely reality itself.

While this might sound as a ""technically correct"" argument, for me it actually had profound insight in how I treat peoples view; namely as (for them) the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I might disagree, (like i do with you now), but i'm conviced the other person is speaking the(ir) truth, which is indistinguishable (for them)  from ""objective reality"" (cause we can't actually see such thing).

Because no human has access, or a clear view, of ""objective reality"", the percieved reality becomes the gold-standard or ""most objective reality"" a person can deal in. So  when we're dealing with people, the percieved reality substitutes the presumed ""objective reality"" we use to describe the world.

The annoying thing is that most of the time that he's wrong, it has no repercussions because of various reasons.

Had the auditor even followed up on just a few of the processes, he'd find quite a few majors.

Another is about grammar or wording/terms on things he thinks is ""unknown"" to the public and is industry specific (e.g. he thinks that most people don't know what willcall is, and while it may be true, I actually know what it is but he just assumes I don't because I've never worked in the industry before).

good point. I think it is fair to say that the whole scientific method is constructed solely to solve exactly this problem. Let's use Neil deGrasses definition as given in cosmos (from [here](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1334957-to-make-this-journey-we-ll-need-imagination-but-imagination-alone)):""Test ideas by experiment and observation. Build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail, follow the evidence where ever it leads and question everything.”

\>Does science not create something more objective than the subjective perception of the researcher?

Yes! through several means. First the subjectivities of the researcher are tested, basically asking the universe if you're idea is correct, allowing you to find the subjectivities that came from your head and not from reality. Also questioning everything is a great way for a singular researcher to distinguish internal subjectivities from external objectivities; don't believe yourself and investigate even what you hold for true.

But there's more. Since we (likely) share some objective reality with other humans, the things that everybody can observe are either caused by the underlying reality, OR are caused by some internal mechanism that would be the same for all reserachers. This thus gives us another way to distinguish objective from subjective reality; if everybody sees it like that, it's probably real.

\>How could the researcher know objective truth from their own subjective perspective?I'd say it doesn't really matter philosofically. If we see science as a way to understand the world around us in order to manipulate it more effectivly, and we can use it to make a good descriptive model that alligns with our observations, then we're done. we substitute investigating ""objective reality"" by investigating ""that what happends consistently"" and we can make an effective science based on our observations, without the need for an clear view of an ""objective reality"".

Less philosophical, the "" if everybody sees it like that, it's probably real. "" still applies though.

\>I accept what your saying about the constructed nature of reality but surely scientific knowledge is somehow distinct and better?We try. We try to make observations about the world that would also be made in the same way by other researchers if they looked at it using the same method, which we thus explain in (usually unfortunately to little) detail.

If you try real hard and look at things in different ways, you can do better than mindless observing and presuming you're observing reality. And then if other people, preferably totally different (so subjectivies don't align) independently agree, you have a good indication that the thing you're looking at did not originate from the subjective brain, but from the input that brain got.

Think about something like a group of doctors trying to decide the best treatment for a particular kind of cancer -- the empirical facts are things like rates of cure, rates of side effects, types of side effects, rates and extent of improvement in particular bodily functions, cost, availability of drugs or medical equipment and training to use them correctly, etc.  All of those facts are empirical, but none of them alone tells us what is the best treatment -- is a 5% increase in life expectancy worth a 20% chance of immediate death?

The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

....maybe. I tend to think so too, I especially think our methods are very effective at finding a descriptions of reality that allign with a lot of observations. But on the other hand, we have literal 0 opportunity to check that against any external observation. Maybe there's a 4th dimension of space , but we can't see in because there's little happening that our biological system needs to know about, so we never evolved 4d space perception/travel. Maybe we make a machine someday, who knows. We've discovered insane things about the universe before; like that light is massless, yet effected by gravity, or that fundamental particles behave differently wether or not you're looking. Or that the passage of time depends on your speed (making that, according to the photons, they travelfrom the sun to earth in 0 seconds).

For me the main consequence of the fact ""that objective reality is fundamentally unknowable"" is that everyones view on reality is just an opinion, but it should be treated as the reality, because, for them it is the reality, because there's no such thing as ""objective reality"".

They're not insofar as they're practitioners of professions. While doctors and engineers are often *also* scientists, or may approach the practice of their profession scientifically, they're not scientists *sensu stricto*. Science is not practice, and doesn't answer normative questions, which only arise in practice.

>I suppose you could argue that if you define science as only the most ""pure"" and unapplied research.

It fundamentally comes down to the question above, rather than the question of application of research. Take a very applied piece of research - deciding on what explosive is to be used for a missile warhead. Scientific research does not decide what's ""best"" in this case, because that's not a scientific question but a political one  - again, political in the widest possible sense, which is to say determined by competing interests and intended outcomes. Once the ""best"" has been decided on, science can determine which explosive is the closest match to that.

Or, to take another example, science can determine that the climate *is* changing, and determine *why* it's changing, and can be applied to determine *how* to avoid or mitigate that change - but it cannot be used to decide *whether* to do so.

To put it more broadly, science cannot of itself provide *intended* outcomes. That is a matter for human desires and, once more than one person is involved, politics.

> I know a lot of engineers and doctors who will take issue with the idea that they are politicians.

All humans are politicians. We all know that we need to balance various interests, win support, overcome opposition, etc, which is the art of politics:
>Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.

October 17, 2018

Along with obscuring the wearer’s peripheral vision, Wear Space (weirdly Office Face is still unclaimed), also sports noise-canceling headphones to really get the job done.

“As open offices and digital nomads are on the rise, workers are finding it ever more important to have personal space where they can focus,” the company told Dezeen. “Wear Space instantly creates this kind of personal space – it’s as simple as putting on an article of clothing.”

h6lrsdt,t3_orrnev,2021-07-26 16:49:13,science,"So, essentially an office manager here and I’m probably going against the grain. 

Myself and my team leads cannot possibly identify every way, task, or question that arises. We need our fellow team mates, who do most of the “real” work, to help us find better ways to do the job, deficiencies in the training, datasets that are unusual, etc. these situations happen dozens of times per week and cannot possibly be addressed by more meetings. 

In an open floor plan folks roll over and ask their coworker a question, that helps transfer knowledge. It the boss/trainer hears and sees a deficiency in the training material. It also allows these things to rise up more effectively. 

I have worked on a good team where every member contributed ideas, not just hours, and it was the fastest developing team I have ever seen (an outside agency said it was similar to Google/Apple, fwtw).  Now, I have employees with two years of experience and I cannot yet trust them with advanced tasks, because their needs are not communicated. 

When we put folks in cubicles they, and their ideas, stay in the cubicles. And even good digital methods (chat, forums, etc) pale in comparison. 

But maybe I’m different too. I’m buying my folks Samsung G8s, razor keyboards, razor mice, etc so they can have the best (trying a 55” oled too). I don’t get upset over YouTube being up, nor music or headphones. I don’t mind “sports” conversations provided it isn’t excessive. 

To me an open floor plan is also open discussion and ideas. It is not perfect, but as a whole the team functions better then a bunch of cubicles. Although open has a limit, 4-6 seats full open, these divided by a short (4’) barrier, and only a handful of these between 8’ walls.

For example, an open workspace facilitates communication, but it doesn't _cause_ people to suddenly feel comfortable communicating with one another. The Expert in Earshot pattern works when the people with information feel open to share that information with others. What creates that openness remains largely mysterious.

Open workspaces similarly exacerbate bad relationships at the office. I don't think they _create_ them. As many have reported here, an open workspace makes it harder to sweep a low-trust environment under the carpet. That can be a good thing if it pushes change and a terrible thing if it doesn't. Sadly, it mostly doesn't.

As usual, the tendency of those in authority to preserve the systems that helped them gain that authority likely lies near the center of the problem, and issues like the one in this study might mostly be symptoms.

I've actually been involved in reconfiguring offices into a new spaces so I've seen the entire process play out a few different times and it's nothing like the claims people make it out to be.

>all you need to know is the boss will always have a desk at the end of a row... as isolated as possible, if not their own office room.

At one company we debated putting managers into cubicles with their employees.  It was actually HR that brought up the concern that managers often had to have 'private' conversations about sensitive topics with their employees that drove us to put in offices that they either occupied full time or part time when they had to discuss these matters with their staff.  In addition, at one company it was the managers that took phone calls the vast majority of the time and having them out in the cubicle space yapping away all day would be distracting. That was it.  There was no conspiracy involved.

>""open office"" is just code for... saving money on cubicles/office spaces for workers.

This is equally ridiculous.  For one thing, these reconfigurations were almost always prompted by some lectures about all the 'collaboration benefits' of the open office plan these executives saw at various 'business leadership' conferences.  They actually spent money to implement this stuff thinking there would be a return on their investment.  It wasn't like the existing furniture was dated or they needed to make more space, they just thought it was a really good idea.

In addition to all of these, I was also a proponent of open offices that I myself would work in because on the surface it actually sounds like a great idea.  After implementing this kind of office space, the whole place felt brighter and more refreshed with window views from every corner.  Prior to that, there was squabbling over 'seniority' every time a window cubicle opened up.  It wasn't until after that I along with many others realized the drawbacks listed in this study.  It wasn't some nefarious attempt to screw everyone for a penny, it was simply a misguided idea that ended up backfiring.  That happens all the time.",iushciuweiush,t2_o6z81,1,0,reddit1

h6m5nk9,t1_h6lh2y7,2021-07-26 18:28:54,science,"This study is new, but is just one of many that show that open offices are awful for everything except cramming workers into a space efficiently. Workers in open office layouts use more sick days, report higher psychological stress, and even collaborate less than their counterparts. This is mostly because humans need to feel control over their surroundings to feel safe, and spontaneous, unplanned interactions which denizens of open offices can't escape are terrible for their mental health.

Architecture and architects are generally ignorant of the psychology of the spaces they create; this is just one of them. Another great example is the ""tiny / van house"" phenomenon, which of course looks great on instagram when lived in by models but is phychologically damaging to its inhabitants. This is because, in a tiny / van house, in order to do anything (say, cooking) one must move like 6 pieces of adjustable furniture to clear up space for the desired activity. As a result, even the smallest chore becomes psychologically daunting because doing anything now comprises ten steps just to begin the activity. And yet, you won't see any architects or architecture magazines talking about this - they're just obsessed with the pretty pictures.",albacore_futures,t2_4yj0m,6,0,reddit1

There are endless factors that go into why an open office can be stressful for someone and I doubt it's just because it's an open space. 

Perhaps it's the reservation system specifically making it harder to find a spot that is yours? 

Perhaps people once had an individual space but now everything is public and they can't add their own spice of personality anymore.

Maybe someone is working in a place where they hate their co-workers so seeing them all is stressful.

Maybe it's a space that was designed for cubicles but the plan switched and now it's forcing the space to be something that it isn't designed for.

I work in an open space office which is also a co-working space. My boss doesn't have a private office, she is out here with us. I'm typing to you from a large sofa and a mini desk that I dragged over sitting next to two of my favorite people. When I need privacy I can either book myself a private room or I can use one of the small nooks in the staircase or I can go to the quiet room. It's all about what your office does to accommodate you.

 Having worked in cubicles I could see how my introverted nature may find it attractive but when you have the open environment and the right people in a navigable space it's way way way way better than a boring cubicle isolated from society with 0 options of choosing where you want to work.

At our office, people played nonstop, from the time people began to arrive until the office closed in the evening. It never stopped. That sound will drill a hole between your productivity and sanity. It will haunt your dreams.  
Our desks were set up in a big L-shape, with the boss’s desk at the top of the L, of course at the farthest point away from the ping-pong table. My desk was at the end of the bottom L, at the closest spot to the ping-pong table. At that proximity, noise-canceling headphones are useless against the pernicious sound of ping-pong ball striking paddle.

I complained about the sound and suggested the ping-pong table be moved to the other side of the building where no one sat where no one would be bothered with the incessant sounds. The boss told I was overreacting and the sound wasn't that bad.

I spent the next 2-3 months nudging the ping-pong table each day when I got to the office, and little by little I moved the table farther from me and closer and closer to the boss's desk without anyone noticing.

HR won't let them give you anything more than the maximum 5-7% raise, often force through the 3% COL unless you are promoted a grade. Those grade promotions are both a combination of merit but also have a hard cap related to the length of time of your most recent grade promotion. 

Here's my career path as an example: 
Hired in at an Engineer II. Three years in, promoted to Engineer III. now leading projects and taking a leadership role in the dept. My next two years, my projects were $260K above margin, and $760K above margin. (IE under budget by that amount so extra money for the company.) Got the 5% each year for that. 
Asked about Engineer IV, gotta be at my current grade for 3 more years. (that's an extra 7.5 - 10% pay bump.) But was told if I move to Engineering Manager if I found an opening. After being jerked around on that for almost a year, I left to another company, started at Engineer IV and since I didn't go through a promotion with that company, was an Engineer V within 9 months. Now I'm at the top of the pay grade so bonuses are nicer, but yearly pay bumps are capped at 3%. 

HR and HR policies are why people are job hopping. Once you are on board you are seen as replaceable, and yet they are willing to pay out the nose for your replacement. They view the more ridged the compensation structure the better as some sort of lawsuit risk mitigation tactic. From what I understand in the 70s-80s you could show up, show your worth/value at these larger firms and expect some sort of compensation adjustment. Now a days even if you ask for a raise most companies won't even consider it out of the annual compensation adjustment date, and at most you are getting 2% over COL.",EngineerDave,t2_7asov,43,0,reddit1

Of course, I'm an old bastard, but I suspect things as I describe are still happening.

I recall our human resources folks having documented standards for how many square feet of office space each pay grade should be allotted, as well as what titles and grades were to have private offices, who got window offices, who got dedicated parking spaces, and such.

That sends a message in my view.

Looking back it's hard for me to grasp just how that could be justified financially.  I believe it part of some twisted idea about retention, but any decent manager knows that high turnover among those folks who actually do the work to keep the place running day to day is far more detrimental than swapping out many upper managers.",oldbastardbob,t2_14vjx5,2,0,reddit1

Plus their internal batteries are excessively difficult to change out, making the lifespan limited by design.

I played in the dirt as a daily activity. I grew up in Appalachia, so The Woods was the default. If you ever saw the post of the imprint of a kid's hand on a petri dish, and the stuff that grows from it, that's me head to toe.

The times I got sick as a kid, I was almost never given medication. Fever reducers were it. Our medicine cabinet had 1 lonely bottle of Tylenol and some band-aids/gauze, etc. My body fought off everything on its own.

I was fed a strong diet of the staples (meat/pasta/veg) and no cookies, candy, cakes, or whatever else like that was ever in the house. It was 100% real food, every time.

&nbsp;

I fully attribute it to the three things above. One of my friends gets sick every single time someone walks by him it seems, and I think he and many others I know get it often because they had/have 5,000 things in their medicine cabinet, and the second anything happens, they get loaded up with the contents.

Having worked for a big tech company, the other reason is that HR & facilities management departments like to copy what other trailblazing companies are doing because they think that leads to success. Silicon Valley pioneered the open office, and other companies thought mirroring that might lead to more success. It’s also a failure on those departments for not recognizing that open offices don’t benefit every job type. I think open offices are fine for highly collaborative jobs (marketing, product dev, etc.) But many people don’t need to collaborate so frequently.

Most headphones are too heavy and cause strain on my neck and shoulders, plus the pressure on the ears gets painful after 8 hours a day. I used to wear earplugs (I really prefer using those) to block environmental sounds, but then I'd have colleagues talking to me for a while before they noticed I can't hear them as they can't see I'm wearing earplugs.

Noise cancelling is limited with earbuds within my budget. With all the wear and tear, I'd go through a pair every two months or so. I've switched to wireless, but without a visible wire, they still get overlooked by colleagues.

You do have to share footrests, and they're first come first served and stored in a specific area, so you're supposed to drag them out from under your desk and put them back into storage each day. Ugh. The shared chairs. Eugh. Do not miss in office work. Best part of covid was avoiding that. Company refuses to buy us home equipment though. I see a lot of claims for workplace safety coming when we return to the building.

Hilariously they reduced our previous 3m square cubicles with 6ft linear desk space with the desk bank behind you being less than 6 feet apart. You can't lean back at the same time as the person behind you. And again, not assigned. Early birds get desks, latecomers get the lounges (there's enough space for everyone, but they don't promise a desk).

What a disaster.

Effective Tax Rate is a shaky proxy for aggressive tax planning, and underemployment doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not investing in people.

For example, let’s take Real Estate Investment as an industry.  That industry has a lot of tax breaks specifically for them that are well-established, and I think it would be disingenuous to call basic industry-standard tax breaks “aggressive tax planning”.  I have no idea what the barriers to entry are for being hired by a real estate investment firm, but I’d assume it’s something on the higher side.  That industry may have trouble getting people to work for them because it’s hard to meet the minimum requirements, not because they’re treating their workers poorly.

On the flip side, retailers doesn’t have as many industry loopholes, and may have fewer hiring shortages because the barriers to entry are low.

Not at all. For one, there's no meaningful distinction between taxes on individuals and taxes on corporations. A tax on corporations is a tax on shareholders, and when those shareholders actually realize the profits as personal income via dividends or capital gains, they get taxed again. The combined tax rate from corporate income taxes and personal taxes on dividends and capital gains is higher than the rates that almost anyone pays on wages: (1 - 0.21) * (1 - 23.8) = 0.60, so the total tax rate is about 40%, just shy of the top marginal federal tax on wages of 37% + 3.8% Medicare = 40.8%.

That aside, the naive intuition that labor income should be taxed at a lower rate than investment income gets it completely backwards: There's a fairly strong consensus among economists who study tax theory that investment income should be taxed at a lower rate, or not at all. The reasoning behind this is a bit complicated, but there's a good introduction to thinking about the issue [here](https://www.thebigquestions.com/2010/09/14/getting-it-right/). 

The corporate income tax is especially bad due to the fact that it discourages investment in the country levying the tax. If a corporation is otherwise indifferent between investing in the US and China, taxes are going to be the tiebreaker. Yes, obviously there are some investments where China is the obvious choice and others where the US is the obvious choice, but there are also some in the middle that can be influenced by taxes, and the bigger the difference in tax rates, the more it affects investment decisions.",SerialStateLineXer,t2_gnwo83gf,2,0,reddit2

Firstly, they’re explaining how net tax value impacts a company’s effective tax rate.

Second, tax avoidance =/= tax evasion. You use the terms interchangeably. The former’s legal, the latter’s illegal. 

> Fifty-five of the nation’s largest corporations paid no federal income tax on more than $40 billion in profits last year, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank.
In fact, they received a combined federal rebate of more than $3 billion, **for an effective tax rate of about negative 9 percent**.

> “Their total corporate tax breaks for 2020, including $8.5 billion in tax avoidance and $3.5 billion in rebates, comes to $12 billion,” according to the study’s authors, Matthew Gardner and Steve Wamhoff.

> The findings also underscore the favorable tax environment for big businesses in the wake of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. 


> Twenty-six corporations have paid no federal income taxes since 2017, according to the report, including such household names as Nike, FedEx and Dish Network. Combined, the 26 companies have booked more than $77 billion in profits since 2018, while receiving nearly $5 billion in rebates, **for an effective three-year tax rate of negative 6 percent**.

… 

> “By all appearances, the companies described in this report appear to be using entirely legal means to reduce their tax bills,” Gardner, the study’s lead author, said via email. But that doesn’t mean the companies are “blameless,” he added. “Many of the tax provisions these companies are using exist because they themselves have lobbied heavily for their creation.”


> Those provisions include tax breaks for stock options given to chief executives as part of their pay packages, credits for research and experimentation, and write-offs for renewable energy and capital investments. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s dramatic cut to the corporate income tax rate, **from 35 to 21 percent**, also plays a role in the limited tax liabilities facing many major corporations.

It is taxed AGAIN as it is passed to the shareholders as dividends... So there are two different opportunities to tax it.  If you add them together, how does it compare to individual tax rates?  

The argument that corporations don't need profits to survive is interesting.  Profits are used for future investments, and some companies definitely need to invest to survive, but survival is undeniably metaphorical here.  It's more interesting to me to talk about the people who need the dividends from the corporation to survive, and those dividends are taxed, and come out of the corporation's profits, which are taxed.  Ergo, taxing the corporation's profits is double taxation on money people need to survive.  Taxing money people need to survive is moral if it is an equittable and fair burden. 

Corporate money eventually flows into the hands of actual people, and I think the outcome is moral if taxation is equittable at that point.  I'm not yet seeing the logic in focusing on the taxes on corporation's profits as a moral issue.

The morally repugnant thing is considering corporations to be people.  Taxing them as people might be a fair trade for treating them as people, but it's doing MORE of an immoral thing... it's a moral compromise, not a moral imperative.

The true moral outcome would be to roll back citizens united, contain the power of majority shareholders to abuse the voices of the minorities, and to make sure actual people are taxed fairly.

Other, more sensible companies have two or more promotion tracks. One as the above, in which the worker moves into managing people, and another that promotes from ""doing the job"", to ""doing the job *very well*"", to ""doing the job **perfectly**"", so that you continue doing it, but are recognized for, and paid more, the better you actually do it.

Because the amounts being worked with here are *huge*. The effective tax rate for many corporate entities can be cut in half or more if they squeeze every deduction, exemption, and write-off they can.

And thats how tax law works, too. When the rates go down, they eliminate deductions so the companies end up paying roughly the same. When the rates go back up, new deductions are put into place so the companies end up paying roughly the same. The people who get shafted by this are the middle class and those below the poverty line.

So a few companies decided to have their home domicile be DE to take advantage. Then more cases.  Then more companies. So on and so forth.

There’s also a deduction called FDII for companies that sell goods abroad. Instead of being taxed at 21%, it’s taxed at 13.125% instead, or whatever foreign rate might apply also.

So the boss decided to put a camera in the office, and we could see it occasionally move. Destroyed our productivity. We got a speech about how it’s not fair for him to pay us to goof off. That pretty much transformed the workplace from fun to menial factory work.

I work in a medical staffing office for a maximum security prison. Roughly a year ago we switched to a fully digital charting system. 98% of work in the prison now goes through a computer.

Now for those of you who have never worked in a prison let me tell you that it is like working retail but the ""irate customers"" come back every day, several times a day and are likely to throw their shit at you when you don't bend over backwards for them (or they'll throw it at you when someone else didn't and that person isn't there right now) . It is not a pleasant place to work.

Now our internet was always limited. No sports, no social media and obviously no porn. As soon as the training was done for the new digital system they blocked everyone from the internet. Everything that isn't a state website is blocked. And I don't mean ANY state website; I mean our state in particular. As my job has quite a bit of downtime I've checked. No federal, no local municipalities, just state.

Morale has tanked, sick days have gone up (thus involuntary overtime which further hurts morale). I was fine for about 6 months but nearly had a full emotional breakdown because I was going through a rough spot and had nothing to distract myself from my own thoughts.

In the industrial revolution we quickly discovered that you can't expect people to think for 8 hours a day. That's how you wind up with people getting their fingers chopped off by a tool die. So tasks had to be made braindead simple.

The same thing applies to people working in an office. You can't expect more than a few hours of quality work before metaphorical fingers start getting chopped off. However, unlike a production line, we can't simply the task very much. It can be automated some, sure, but a lot of ""knowledge"" work is unstructured.

For example, I know someone who works in the engine room of a boat.

(Tend to be 36-48 hour weeks, with OT.) He always brings a book. Occasionally, they’ll have ~~office~~ engine room potlucks. It’s possible he will literally do nothing for his entire shift. Or he could prevent it from going down. If he had to “keep himself busy” people could die. 

This is similarly true, to a lesser extent, for plenty of jobs. Sales associates, executive assistants, receptionists, security guards - just to name a few.

dza33ek,t1_dza2dpj,2018-05-20 12:19:22,science,"I'd say underload is a normal phenomenon in a work place with a well balanced work load. Sometimes things line up in such a way that there's just not much to do during the time you are at work and sometimes there's more to do, than you can get done in that time. And sometimes you're under underload, then you get a phone call and suddenly there's a lot of work to do.

There are few occupation, where you are constantly under the ""perfect"" load. Now employers could in essence send people home, when there's nothing to do and call them in for more time, when there's a bunch of stuff to do, but then you could never have regulated schedule for your personal life as an employee. And if you tied the pay to the actual time worked, you wouldn't have a reliable salary. So boredom is the price workers and employers pay to have reasonable schedules.

I think it's a fallacy to believe that workers always could be doing something and that forbidding anything not work related makes them more productive. And this study supports that. ",fireball64000,t2_tvqi4,142,0,reddit3

The trick is to be very deliberate about limiting the break time to a specific amount so you don't end up wasting all day.

Another trick is to structure your day so i do the boring work first thing in the morning and answer emails later in the day. This is because I focus better in the morning. One challenge with this approach is that people expect you to respond to emails first thing and will often start interrupting me around 10am if they haven't got a response.",yoordoengitrong,t2_3t7a9,33,0,reddit3

Even *really* simple things, like making and putting out salad, became an ordeal because he wanted people moving so fast that they always forgot something, didn't have enough bowls, spilled salad all over the ground, got the wrong kind of lettuce, started it too early/too late, forgot to check if there was a place to store it in the cooler, forgot to check if someone had *already made the salad.*

I worked at like half the speed of everyone there and got twice as much work done, (demonstrably, I tracked it in case I needed a defense) just because I was not constantly having to redo stuff or make extra trips across the kitchen just to grab a utensil I had forgotten.

It was insane. I actually got yelled at for not looking rushed enough, because I wwould take literally 30 seconds to think about my tasks and how to do them efficiently.

Luckily the supervisor who worked alternating shifts with the boss was a more organized induvidual, and so he ended up just requesting to constantly work with me. Since the boss thought I was lazy and slow he agreed wholeheartedly. After that I would spend half my time doing my actual job, and half of it cleaning up messes the other shift had left the day before.",Caelinus,t2_emecd,18,0,reddit3

When the nacho fries came in they asked me to switch to a new position, a fryer/prep person. Before whoever needed something fried did it themselves or asked someone, like a cashier, to do it if they weren't busy. The job started out easy enough, but then they thought ""he does this so fast he's doing dishes in between. Things are always getting caught up when he's on shift. He must need more work!"" so it became my job to constantly make sure everyone was caught up on their fries, rather than being told as they were getting half way or less.

It became my job to restock the stuff like plates, bags, cups, etc. that used to be cashiers' job. It even became my job to work the food line whenever someone left for a break.

dzav164,t1_dzary5n,2018-05-20 21:32:32,science,"Your #1 option is the combination of meditation, routine exercise, and a solid diet. 

I sat here and tried to think of how to convey the significance of the improvement those 3 can make, in order for it to sound worth the investment. I've been meditating regularly since I started my career, but it was originally a lackadaisical habit without any understanding. I've since put some time into reading guides, and all I can really say to sum it up is *wow*. 

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/8ja02l/it_has_been_claimed_that_meditation_and_ancient/dz35mbr/) comment thread I explain a little bit more about my experience with that. In the past I'd tried nootropics of various types, as well as 'just grit and bear it' style will-power. Both of those burn you out pretty quickly, which isn't acceptable if you're really looking to reach the limits of what you're capable of on a daily basis. 

The long-term impact of meditation, for me at least, has been a serious shift in how my motivation functions. Historically my motivation would have been something like 'I will do this work, because X is the result of that effort, and I value X more than leisure time.' At the heart of that evaluation is the idea that the act of doing the work is unpleasant. At some point without my realizing it, I began to value focus in and of itself. The subject of that focus wasn't important, because the focus itself became fundamentally rewarding. If you read my linked post you'll see what I mean by rewarding, physically and emotionally, on a level that I worry no description really conveys.

Diet and exercise are important as well, but only in order to support your biology. As long as you're getting your nutrition, sleep and your blood moving daily then that's as far as it needs to be taken. Without those boxes checked though, you can start to lose sight of happiness and wellbeing entirely.",bewalsh,t2_3jl0e,1,0,reddit3

My expected rate of touching accounts is 40/day, and my daily wage is $96, so each time I touch an account is worth (at least) $2.40. The authorizations I obtain probably net the company, on average, $60-$100 per month the patient actually get supplies.



If they switched to task based hours and paids me $3 an authorization (which would be a raise for me because I exceed production minimums) I would be more motivated to get an authorization than now, when as long as I touch 40 accounts a day there's no benefit to getting more for the company.


Seems like they'd just be paying me more for getting slightly more work done, right? However, if the patient doesn't have an authorization for their equipment while they rent it, we do not pick the machine up but we cannot bill for that time span (3 months) not retroactively get an authorization. So the company loses money because orders aren't processed quickly enough.

But managing finances is a task.

And your example only works if the company has no interest of bettering the work/expense ratio. Maybe they're paying way too much? The employee could be getting the work done in 15 hours per week. Then it only seems fair that the company should pay less or add tasks for the employee to do.

All that gets harder to monitor when the employee isn't sitting in his office. You argue that the company should be happy as long as they have their finances managed but the company wants to get as much value for their money as possible. ",Anrza,t2_bdqjz,3,0,reddit3

Straight out either more full time jobs, or even something as simple as more part time work alongside better support networks.

Companies were hiring anyone who said they had any IT skills no questions asked for the most part.  It was harder to find them because the pool of tech savvy people in general was smaller, and online job hunting wasn't really a thing yet. I got my first job via a job fair at my college.  When the bubble burst the good IT people still had jobs for the most part but the people that probably should have never gone into the field in the first place lost out.

While it's very true someone in an IT related job can work anywhere these day I don't think that applies to people like you just graduating now at all.  It only applies for people with solid experience of at least 5-10 years. Nothing you've done on your own counts and college certainly doesn't prepare you for a real world IT job in any meaningful way.  It's a completely different market now.  Back then companies were setting up webpages/email and other simple tasks, now they want people familiar with managing thousands of systems across the world and a devops background.. there's really very little room to teach someone new how to do that.  

The best advice I can give IT college grads now is don't aim for the job now, aim for the job 2 jobs from now.  Take whatever job you can get if it offers sale-able experience and use that to move on after ~2 years.

While this is true to an extent, many other people are within the same market space. The entry-level and low-level IT job market is absolutely saturated and has been for years across the board. Much of the work is also contracted out to IT hiring firms (Robert Half, AppleOne, and many others) as opposed to being direct hires. It's very rare these days in IT to be direct hired by a company simply from a job posting on their site. You really have to stand out, have the experience, the work ethic, the resourcefulness, the cleverness, and the drive to get a job paying more than $15/hr starting in IT.

Unrealistic deadlines, everything needs to be done yesterday at least, all about cutting those costs, so what does the business manager managing IT do?  Bring in the contractors, the plague of the industry.  It takes money away from the people that are doing the actual work and pads middle men/women's pockets for ""finding us"", everyone I have worked with has 0 clue about anything IT/computer-wise.  Fake promises of contract to hire, the kickbacks to the contract companies last for YEARS, sometimes around 25-33% of your actual wage.  

If you are lucky enough to find a job willing to pay for it that is.  Most say thanks for the 6 months, out the door with ya.

Then there is the high turn-over rate managers get to deal with.  Constant lack of experience, training and knowledge gaps all to save a few pennies and keep the head count low.  This gets passed on to the end users, the people we are hired to SUPPORT.  Crap service, long turn around times on tickets due to no one actually knowing how to do it because we've all been with the company less then a year.

The most depressing thing I've seen are the people that spent thousands and thousands of dollars for a degree (myself included) to be working maybe $15/hr jobs, that only last 3-6 months.  I'm fortunate right now to have an indefinite contract that pays much better then $15/hr, but it took 3-4 years of grinding through the muck.  

Then there's the downtime between jobs, the relocating constantly, having to deal with the contractors themselves, many are very pushy and I've had a few ladies with Robert Half get REALLY upset with me for turning down crap 11-12 dollar positions, when my skills should pay at least double that.

- The US Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles information about salaries and which jobs are projected to grow in the future.

- Find a mentor in a field you're interested in. Use them to get information about new trends and skills to develop.

- Apply for a co-op with a company (co-ops are admittedly unpopular in the US, but there seems to be some interest in reviving them).

- Find outside projects or competitions to participate in. For example, the US government and many organizations sponsor design competitions for building apps, websites, and innovative products. Many art communities have competitions as well.

- Join a local professional organization. Attend their events, learn what skills may be valuable to develop, develop a list of contacts.

Cause I've found anecdotally that to be the opposite for companies that working tech/software but more true for other compn. Helpdesk/IT pays decently, had good promotion paths, and is usually a super small team (I've never seen more than 5, and 5 was stretching it anyway).

At least at my company, we've got 2 helpdesk guys, and an office manager that helps out sometimes with basic shit.

That's supporting 160-ish employees, of which I'd say about 2/3 are 'builders' (design/eng/product) and 1/3 are support (hr/legal/accounting).

I think the difference is if you're working IT for an IT company vs a non-IT company. Not only are more people tech literate, the management also understands the value since they understand building software. You're dealing with tech people all day, even the normally non-technical depts are technical by osmosis.

Basically all I'm saying is that you may be right, or you may not be. If you are correct, then all of us should borrow tons of money and buy houses as quickly as possible. But all economic markets, including real estate, are in fact very difficult to predict.",realbarack,t2_5lxbf,0,0,reddit4

No it won't. People will urbanize more (that's the trend), and we'll have more residential in urban areas (that's the trend). Millennials want to live in cities and aren't buying in suburbs.

Furthermore, buying property with a long time horizon for a child's future is stupid. If you'd done that 40 years ago you'd be sitting on worthless property in Detroit.

If you're a student: 

1. Reach out to professors (at your college) who teach in or around the field you like. They have a network that most students don't know about. Send him/her an email to meet during or outside of office hours. Ask them how they reached their position and what they like or do not like about it. Ask them if they can give you advice to where you want to go. Hell, you might not even know where to go... ask them that.

2. Once you get to know them more, ask if they have any opportunities you can help with (a) for research, (b) for experience, (c) to obtain supplemental understanding of the field. If they say they don't, ask if they know anyone or can connect you to another professor who might have some opportunities for students. If that fails, ask if they know anyone and would be willing to connect you with 'outside of the college setting.'

**This can be accomplished within 2 months given consistent contact but don't overdue it. That is, at least meet your professor(s) once or twice a month.

You just can't do it - but selecting jobs that involve a heavy amount of English Literature is much more straightforward and concrete. Same with mathematics. Same with scientific research.

Find out your friend's parents occupations. Odds are, these are your first resources. Keep expanding out your list of people. If nobody seems to do what you do, expand out to aunts and uncles. You don't want contacts per say - you want information and understanding of what the field is actually about. Shadow them if you can.

When you go to college, meet your TAs and Professors. Office Hours are there for help, and odds are you could always use it. But, at the same time, you're forming a relationship with a TA or professor - these people also know other people. Likely they can put you in contact with people in the field or point you to resources to get involved.

Join professional groups, as soon as you know roughly what you want to do. A lot of colleges and universities have student groups for it. They tend to be another networking conduit.

On top of all this, when in high school, make an effort to know older kids. Just like parents, this is an important resource. Ask about internships they're looking at.

Computer engineering is a really cool combination of computer science and electrical engineering. You are building the glue that holds software's bits and hardware's electrons together. Since the technology is constantly evolving, you get to learn and play with some of the latest stuff rather than learn about the same stuff other majors have been teaching the past 40 years. Plus there's a wide range of topics you can focus on from the lowest level of chip design all the way up to higher level stuff like robotics. While you'll still need to learn the basics like logic, programming, and circuits, you get to quickly jump into the fun stuff like microcontrollers and digital design. This isn't your grandpa's analog hardware. 

Just like most engineering majors, you'll have to put in the effort to get through it. But you've got to have a passion for CPE, you've got to enjoy what you're doing compared to other majors where you're doing it because it's a safe and tried field. I'm sure some ME out there has a passion for HVAC systems but I can't imagine there are many. All the CPEs I know really like what they do and know the parts they enjoy the most.

Engineering/software firms and IT departments often use internships to try out potential candidates and then give them an offer after university, often getting a great candidate that will also often end up staying with the company for a few years.  These are also fields where even busywork is productive work (all those desktops that need reimaging...).

Some other fields (like hard sciences), you're there to do all the work a proper full-time employee would do (maintaining cultures, running the PCR machine, and sticking things in a chromatograph is work a trained monkey could do), but with no job security, no benefits/obligations, and a much lower salary.  This is a large part of the reason science degrees are virtually worthless if you want to work in your field of study.

Still many others, you're there to basically fetch coffee and shred documents.  These are also the fields you need a 3.5+ GPA and several internships to have a realistic chance of landing a job.  No-one is denying engineering and comp sci grads often have firms lining up to recruit them if they've got some co-op terms.  These are also fields where no-one tends to look at GPA.

When I joined, I calculated that I could've done a math degree (apparently one of the hardest majors at my school, which I believe has one of the best math programs in the world) in about two years.  Most of the smart people I knew in college hadn't fully decided what they were doing until at _least_ the end of freshman year.  When you think about this, it's sort of inevitable because high school students are woefully ill-prepared to understand the hundreds of potential fields that are only tangentially related to the courses you're familiar with in HS.  Someone who has firmly decided what they want to study by the time they start college is either making an ill-informed decision or extremely lucky (in that they happened upon a career path they were very passionate about very early on in their life and didn't gain anything from the incredible opportunities for academic exploration that college offers).

The wiggle-room is so forgiving that I was actually able to get two degrees covering three different fields (roughly 2.5-3 majors' worth of coursework).  I wouldn't necessary advise people to do that (my last year wasn't very fun...) but there's more than enough breathing room to spend your freshman year exploring different curricula and researching career paths and deciding what you want to focus on studying (and still have time for things like study abroad, if you're so inclined).",wutcnbrowndo4u,t2_4izh8,2,0,reddit4

What matters is padding your resume and getting actual experience. If you can't get that through a part time job or paid internship then do it for free. That will increase the likelihood of landing a paid position later down the road.

It requires a completely different skillset (i.e. coding, math, knowledge of algorithms and programming languages) than IT (making sure shit works and fixing it when it doesn't).

No-one will hire a sysadmin or DBA straight out of school without experience - they require hands-on experience, not things you can easily teach.  On the other hand, it's pretty easy to move into both roles with no school whatsoever.

It's about making relationships with peers, potential mentors and employers, younger students or professional you can help, etc.  It's about building network of people who can be mutually helpful to each other, not just about job hunting.  This includes forming social and/or professional groups with others in your class or field so that you can help each other improve your skills.  Anyone who sees networking as nothing but a job search is missing out on the biggest benefits of the endeavor.

That's not to say that networking with the intent to find a job is bad; that's how most of us learn how to network.  But bear in mind that it takes time.  You're very unlikely to find someone who can boost your career or has the authority to hire you after one or two low-key mixers at your university.  What you will find are 1) employees of companies who might be looking for people like you, 2) people using your degree to do something you've never considered before, 3) people who can tell you about other networking opportunities that could be more helpful or open more doors, 4) opportunities to gain confidence in speaking to strangers and putting yourself out there.

I would also like to say that while there is nothing wrong with doing what you love for free, and it can even be commendable, someone who prefers to get paid for their work is not somehow less interested or invested in their chosen work.

Finally, we write _code_, not _programs_.

There's a huge difference.  A sysadmin is a fancy mechanic that can put together a car from spare parts.  A developer is an engineer who designs one or several such parts.

If they don't take your resume, then talk to the person behind the table and get their card.  You'll make your face familiar and you'll have an acquaintance at the company.  It can go a long way depending on how they do hiring and how you interact with staff as you're going through the process.  

More lately I've seen the companies that ask you to apply online have tablets set up at the table and you can ""check-in"" at the tablet so that you'll have your name on a list that the people working the table will be able to reference.  They meet a ton of people, so it's helpful for them to remember who they've spoken with.

Anything you can do to make yourself familiar with the company and them familiar with you.  The hiring process isn't all application blanks and resumes, and you'll see organized companies doing what they can to remember who they had met.  They do it for a reason.

it1yobl,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 10:54:46,science,"The more hours someone works each week in a stressful job, the more their risk of depression rises, a study in new doctors finds. 

Working 90 or more hours a week was associated with changes in depression symptom scores three times larger than the change in depression symptoms among those working 40 to 45 hours a week.

What’s more, a higher percentage of those who worked a large number of hours had scores high enough to qualify for a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression -- serious enough to warrant treatment – compared with those working fewer hours.

The research team, based at the University of Michigan, used advanced statistical methods to emulate a randomized clinical trial, accounting for many other factors in the doctors’ personal and professional lives.

They found a “dose response” effect between hours worked and depression symptoms, with an average symptom increase of 1.8 points on a standard scale for those working 40 to 45 hours, ranging up to 5.2 points for those working more than 90 hours. They conclude that, among all the stressors affecting physicians, working a large number of hours is a major contributor to depression.

I'd then work over the weekend but not as many hours. Even on absolute maximum 16 hours per day during the week for the entire week, which never actually happened, then say max 16 hours total over the weekend, that is 96 hours working week.

And I can confidently say I never hit that number.

And during those periods I worked in an investment bank, harder than anyone else around me and harder than anyone I have come across before or since.

People are desperate, which causes them to both NEED to work 90+ hours, and to be depressed.  That is the work hours are the MEASURE not the cause of the underlying cause of depression.  

Note I say that the desperation causes the long work hours, but hat desperation does not need to be strictly financial.  One could imagine any of the following as forms of desperation that might lead to both long hours and also depression:

* A youth is desperate to demonstrate his productivity in a family business.  His father is also his boss, and his land-lord, and his home is also their place of business, and thus he never has ""time off"" as such.  He is desperate to prove himself and also to have the slightest sense of autonomy.  The closest he gets to privacy is the bathroom.  

* A soldier is stationed on the front lines where his unit has been dug in for months with little movement and constant low-intensity fighting.  In theory his unit has 30 men and one officer, but at any given moment the number of effectives is closer to 15.  As a result there are no days off and everybody is pulling double-shifts to maintain watch and protect their mates.  He is desperate to not be the next one to eat a bullet, and must be constantly on watch every minute of the day.  

* A female lawyer in Japan, is trying to prove herself in a male-dominated society and a male dominated field.  All the lawyers in her firm are desperately competing to make partner, but she must work harder just to stand still in the rankings of the young up and coming lawyers.  As a well educated professional, she is unlikely to starve even if fired tomorrow, but she is desperate for *social and professional* recognition; that's why she works 90+ hours.

More scenarios could be constructed, but I think you get the point.  90+ hours a week is not something that almost anybody CHOOSES to do if they feel that they have any kind of reasonable alternative.  I argue that it therefore is a reliable marker for people who do not feel that they have such alternatives, and that it is really the lack of alternatives that drives depression... not the work hours themselves.  Astronauts on the space station routinely work 90+ hours, but they are doing what they love, their time on the space station will end in very short order, and have they have aggressively competed for the opportunity to be there.  Their 90+hour work week is a result not of desperation and a lack of options, but rather is a result of them intensively exercising their options.

I don’t mind 60hr weeks, it’s needed to keep up with consumer demands. That’s the only thing people don’t realize often is that production of consumer goods is directly related to employee hours. Healthcare is another ball game because we die without it. But for me to keep up with the 3M gauze pad or syringe packaging and related means at least 60hrs a week to meet their 90hr a week demand. Same with food packaging. Doctors have it worse because of legal obligation, but manufacturing is a similar Boat. The more people, the more hours needed.

I worked with one company full time and then 3 more that were per diem through that job. Then I had two personal pay clients that were scheduled weekly plus an at home side hustle. Luckily I was able to sleep about 4 hours at the one job. The human body can adapt quite amazingly to situations you’re in. I slept twice a day, 3-4 hours each, so about 6-8 hours like normal people. I never had a day off. So if I had to guess, out of a 24 hour day, I was working or driving to work 20 out of 24 hours a day. So like actual working time about 100 hours a week. It was absolutely not sustainable, I had never been more depressed, more manic, more lonely or more broke in my life. It was so difficult. Most people can’t imagine working 50 hours a week, let alone 100. But it just became normal. Then I had the breakdown, broke my back, met my husband and now live - not like that.

it37sfd,t3_y8uzil,2022-10-20 16:37:29,science,"Dropping my response to another commenter in the main thread. I regularly do this for extended periods, with 1 day off/week, though those sometimes gets skipped. Prior to a couple years ago, I had one day off every two weeks, though sometimes those would also be skipped.

I've done two and a half months with no days off in the past. My typical days now are 12 to 14 hours, but heavier days are 16 to 18, somewhat regularly. As of a couple years ago the heavier days were more the norm, but things have been tweaked for the better more recently.

I am generally able to take breaks for bodily functions and meals, but often times I'm eating/on the toilet while working through emails or responding to work messages and such. It is very easy to commingle work and break times if one is not vigilant in the setting time aside to step away from work.

The article is certainly accurate, this amount of overwork leads to deep crashes when projects or cycles are finally ended. What it doesn't mention is the tendency toward weight gain, I tend to put on 50 to 75 lb over the course of a cycle. If I'm lucky, I'll lose the majority of it during our seasonal off time, before getting into another cycle.

The flip side of this job is that sometimes a cycle will only be seven or nine months out of a year, so the work is very intense, but then I have a quarter or so off. On the other hand, sometimes cycles conjoin and I might work for 20 or 24 months pretty much straight through.

My days off tend to be spent asleep. What I consider my ""real life"" pretty much goes on pause while I am engaged in my ""work life"". There is little to no time for months on end for hobbies, or visiting friends, even if I'm in the same state temporarily that they are, or family interactions and obligations.

This kind of workload becomes a lifestyle rather than an occupation. It is not a healthy one and has many drawbacks. In my case, the reason I do my work is because I think the sacrifice is worth it, and I've had the opportunity to help shape, in some fashion, the future of many states and of the country as a whole.

But I realized after working through the entirety of the pandemic, that I was having increasing difficulty when the bill came due for putting my ""real life"" on pause for most of a year or sometimes a couple of years. It impacted my ability to handle my non-work-related obligations, which deteriorated even further when the rest of the world was in lockdown, as the isolation's effect was magnified.

Many, perhaps most, people in my line of work or similar industries rely heavily on prescription or illicit drugs to regulate their sleep schedules and energize themselves to handle this kind of workload. There's a lot of nicotine and alcohol addiction, to go along with stimulants and depressants of other types.

I'm a bit of an exception in that regard, since I rarely engage in recreational drug use and don't smoke or really drink. But my other coping mechanisms are no more healthy, including the aforementioned weight gain from poor diet, binge eating in short periods to prioritize work, and an inconsistent sleep schedule, all of which mess with my hormones.

That's why I've made it to priority to attempt to address work-life balance and suggest other folks do the same in whatever capacity suits them. Making sure to take off my days off as they are earned, rather than the sacrificing them for project needs, using vacation time to attend important personal and family events, even at the expense of project needs, etc.",Iron_Baron,t2_tg55r,1,0,reddit1

IME, theres a point during every production where it gets hectic and everyones working through the day off. Sundays are paid double, but it still means more hours and ultimately two weeks of work without pause. 

That's a week of at least 84 hours. Since I'm part of the crew needed on set, I have to stick around to wrap up or prepare for the next day, so I expect to put in overtime on top of the 12hrs.

This particular production has had certain scheduling issues that have me entering way before the general crew call but STILL leaving at wrap, instead of the end of my 'shift', which would fall around halfway through filming. 

Earlier this year, during another project, stress and dehydration made me faint in the hotel I was housed in during filming, miles from home. I hit my head and got a two hairline fractures behind my right ear, which I was also deaf out of for two months after the fall.

I got to the warehouse at midnight, separated my load into orders by store, then loaded the truck. This usually took 2-3 hours. I’d be at my first stop my 3:30-4am.

it377ry,t1_it2qqfc,2022-10-20 16:33:47,science,"Depends on your industry. I regularly do this for extended periods, with 1 day off/week, though those sometimes gets skipped. Prior to a couple years ago, I had one day off every two weeks, though sometimes those would also be skipped.

I've done two and a half months with no days off in the past. My typical days now are 12 to 14 hours, but heavier days are 16 to 18, somewhat regularly. As of a couple years ago the heavier days were more the norm, but things have been tweaked for the better more recently.

I am generally able to take breaks for bodily functions and meals as you mentioned, but often times I'm eating/on the toilet while working through emails or responding to work messages and such. It is very easy to commingle work and break times if one is not vigilant in the setting time aside to step away from work.

The article is certainly accurate, this amount of overwork leads to deep crashes when projects or cycles are finally ended. What it doesn't mention is the tendency toward weight gain, I tend to put on 50 to 75 lb over the course of a cycle. If I'm lucky, I'll lose the majority of it during our seasonal off time, before getting into another cycle.

The flip side of this job is that sometimes a cycle will only be seven or nine months out of a year, so the work is very intense, but then I have a quarter or so off. On the other hand, sometimes cycles conjoin and I might work for 20 or 24 months pretty much straight through.

My days off tend to be spent asleep. What I consider my ""real life"" pretty much goes on pause while I am engaged in my ""work life"". There is little to no time for months on end for hobbies, or visiting friends, even if I'm in the same state temporarily that they are, or family interactions and obligations.

This kind of workload becomes a lifestyle rather than an occupation. It is not a healthy one and has many drawbacks. In my case, the reason I do my work is because I think the sacrifice is worth it, and I've had the opportunity to help shape, in some fashion, the future of many states and of the country as a whole.

But I realized after working through the entirety of the pandemic, that I was having increasing difficulty when the bill came due for putting my ""real life"" on pause for most of a year or sometimes a couple of years. It impacted my ability to handle my non-work-related obligations, which deteriorated even further when the rest of the world was in lockdown, as the isolation's effect was magnified.

Many, perhaps most, people in my line of work or similar industries rely heavily on prescription or illicit drugs to regulate their sleep schedules and energize themselves to handle this kind of workload. There's a lot of nicotine and alcohol addiction, to go along with stimulants and depressants of other types.

I'm a bit of an exception in that regard, since I rarely engage in recreational drug use and don't smoke or really drink, But my other coping mechanisms are no more healthy, including the aforementioned weight gain from poor diet, binge eating in short periods to prioritize work, and an inconsistent sleep schedule, all of which mess with my hormones.

That's why I've made it to priority to attempt to address work-life balance and suggest other folks do the same in whatever capacity suits them. Making sure to take off my days off as they are earned, rather than the sacrificing them for project needs, using vacation time to attend important personal and family events, even at the expense of project needs, etc.",Iron_Baron,t2_tg55r,3,0,reddit1

It's one thing if your family is rich and you aren't going in debt to go to med school. But for everyone else, let's use our hospital's associated university as an example. 

-$30k per semester = $240k in tuition alone

-Unless you are attending locally and can live at your parent's house, you're also having to take loans to pay for housing, food, transportation, clothes, and any other cost of living. So add another $50k+. 

-This $300k in total loans is accruing interest at 6 to 7 percent at a minimum. You don't make much more money than the US average household income as a resident or fellow, so you have anywhere from 5 to 9 more years (this would be 4 years of residency plus 1 to 5 years of fellowship depending on specialty with surgery being on the longest end of that) where you're not really able to make sizeable loan payments and that $300k continues to grow at 6 to 7 percent interest 

-By the time you're done with all this and making a real doctor salary, you're probably between $350-400k in debt

-That doctor pay of say $250-350k a year starting out is going to be cut nearly in half by federal and state taxes. Then, you have to pay another couple tens of thousands a year to cover malpractice insurance. So that $300k is now more like $130k in take home pay after accounting for all this. And you're staring down the barrel of $2k-4k monthly loan payments unless you want to be in debt forever.

Speaking from experience, and to repeat similar comments every time this is mentioned: this is not the way.  4 10-hour days means you can get nothing non-work related accomplished and have virtually no free time during your working days.  You end up spending that extra day off catching up on all the things you could have done throughout the week if you weren't working those extra 2 hours.  All of your doctor appointments, trips to the bank, home maintenance, vehicle maintenance, and all other incidental tasks get pushed to that extra day, and if you miss them one week there is nothing you can do but wait for your chance to come around again 7 days later.  Your weekends still go by in a flash and you're left with even more dread starting Sunday afternoon as you anticipate the coming 4 day slog.

4 8-hour days needs to be the standard.  You can work 7-330 and still have enough time left in the day to take care of other personal tasks so you can actually take those three days at the end to unwind and decompress.",Fantastic_Engine_623,t2_q1r4yn4o,3,0,reddit1

Although the one about seven days in a week is kind of broken, because it depends on what your job considers a work week.

one is the age of statement of “it’s takes 10,000 hours to master a skill” it takes a long time, and a lot of hours to become a good doctor, and if I’m ganna spend 3 years at 80 hours or 6 years at 40 hours a week, I know what I’d choose, and 3 years is already a short rotation, surgical ones can be 5 years already

Second, who is ganna cover me? There are barely enough physicians as it is, and the hospital doesn’t shut down, someone’s always got to be here

Three, handoff is the most critical time for complications, im there for the full day, and I hand off to one person for nights, who then hands my patients back in the morning

One of the surgery programs I know added a whole new hospital (hundreds of patients) that residents had to cover without adding more residents to their program. 

This can be because the hospital is too cheap to hire extra attendings which cost more than residents, a culture of disregard for residents, just too damn disorganized to figure it out or how to make changes due to the bureaucracy, inability for the program director to obtain more residents, or a culture of disregard for high level of care for patients although community programs are more likely to have attendings on staff on call than academic ones.

My residency and fellowship programs were among the most call heavy ones in my specialty and even then, we tried to have as many shift changes as possible.

To add for those unaware, 

First the culture of how most residents and fellows deal with when it comes this means the higher ups expect their residents to go through the same stuff they did. It’s a pretty awful cycle as not only are the residents expected to do their rounds, be on call and such, they also do additional work outside as well for additional qualifications (especially for research.) it’s shocking how I see some of the residents I work with end up completely exhausted. 

It’s also that hospitals are just happy to keep everything understaffed. Not enough doctors, not enough Nurses etc. the entire healthcare system in the US is based on “how little can we pay to get the most out of it” so you get basically situations where not only that residents get other doctors on their case for not pulling crazy hours but that they can’t comfortably do so without risking harming patients. 

It’s wild. It was really bad during COVID cause people where flung head first into things, it hasn’t really gotten better. And it’s ignoring the normal compensation residents get. The university hospital I worked for in my undergrad (I’m a BME for direct surgical devices and guide manufacturing so I get to work with the surgeons one on one really often) had residents make $50k/year.

That was the concluding sentence of my comment so I'm confused how you interpreted that as a criticism of doctors as a whole. No. It was a financial warning and really if a criticism of anything, one of the fact that we as a society have paywalled a critical profession behind an absolutely enormous financial burden and have really made it only accessible to those already coming from well off households, because otherwise it is nearly impossible to afford. Likewise, med schools do not communicate the actual financial reality of it to prospective students and society tells teenagers ""doctors are rich"" and that is not a good reason to want to be one.

More to the point though yes increasing wages increases costs for business owners and to a certain extent will increase prices. It however isn't the majority of operating costs for most businesses. Lets say 30% of your expenses are labor, not an uncommon goal for restaurants. If you have to increase wages from $15-$18 for example, a fairly large pay bump, you have increased your labor costs by 20%, but have only increased overall costs by 6%. If you passed all of those costs along to the customer a $10 meal is now $10.6.

That vastly oversimplifies things but the point is more that increasing wages does not cause the 50-100% increase in costs that you are describing.

* A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 4 additional hours for continuity of care and education;

Yes, I am very well aware. Having standards for wages and working hours applied to large corporations doesn't mean that every small business has to figure out how to pay exorbitant annual salaries to employees who only work during the summer. You're complaining about how rules that need to apply to massive international companies - which, if applied properly, would improve competition between large and small companies - would somehow drive every mom and pop out of business, despite me repeatedly reminding you that rules can be applied however we like and the same rules should not apply to a local sweater shop as they apply to Wal Mart.

hjc99dy,t3_qmnder,2021-11-04 22:11:24,science,"Obesity absolutely is preventable and curable. And worth preventing and curing.

But there are a few big challenges that make it really hard for a lot of people to do it on their own, unless a significant change occurs in their day to day life.

The first problem is that in a 21st century western society it is incredibly easy to get fat and stay fat, particularly if you're lower middle class. Lack of free time, road or rail transport, office jobs, cheap, readily available junk food, screen based entertainment and a drinking culture all contribute in a way that is incredibly hard for an average person to dodge. Simply put, we've built a society where the easiest ways of travelling, the standard 9-5 jobs, the easiest meals to buy and the most common forms of leisure activity are all really bad for us. You need either more money and time, a healthier career, or above average willpower and self discipline to avoid those traps.

The second problem is that being fat is now so common that it gets normalised in families. Obese parents are way more likely to have obese kids, because your food and activity options almost always become your kids options. And if you grow up fat it is so hard to change habits you learn as a kid.

It strikes me that if governments pumped as much money and effort into fighting obesity as they have to suppressing covid, the long term public health benefits and lives saved would be equally dramatic. 
And really there is a moral imperative. If a teenager is already morbidly obese, in practical terms they have a chronic, treatable, terminal illness that will hugely limit their quality of life and almost certainly make them die decades earlier than they should. That should absolutely be a public health priority.",juddshanks,t2_kght1,1019,0,reddit2

I think the tough love crowd (of which I've been a part of in the past) is wrong in their approach. My guess is 99% of overweight people want to lose weight. Same ask any smoker, most want to quit. Drugs addicts, alcoholics, whatever most want to change. At the same time, the only reason I was able to quit smoking was because I built up enough negative associations that I started avoiding it.

There are studies that posit that obesity, especially morbid, or extreme obesity have not only psychological components, but ties to the immune system in the gut. As the patients’ weight increases, so does inflammation, which can directly contribute to further weight gain.
Societal obesity can be addressed by decreasing (or eliminating) poverty so that all people can have nutritious food. However, there is marketing everywhere for unhealthy food, and corporations will do anything possible to keep you purchasing their unhealthy products, including adding ingredients that almost seem addictive!

If you see obese people who dont look after themself your moral will drop and some will express that by bullying.

Not talking about people with conditions or people whos not at their fault to be how they are. Most obese people inherit that or have medical conditions. Thats another thing.

There's also increasing evidence that food environments, appetite signaling and satiety signaling are *huge* components in obesity risk. Telling people, for whom it is literally harder to stick to an appropriate caloric intake for reasons outside of their control, to just eat less is not helpful, as is further evidenced by the current obesity epidemic.

Also, fish is a lot more popular, which provides similar nutritious value to other meats while being healthier. They also don't eat something different every day. They will have something like rice and vegetables most days and go on with their day.
In the west, you need to watch out for what you eat in order to avoid weigh gain, the path of least resistance will not be healthy.

I am a dock worker and often my obese coworkers slack at their work and I have to pick up the work for them which makes me angry at them. They constantly complain about their weight but make no effort to change it as they slurp down Dr.Peppers.
I try my best to be sympathetic. 
But sometimes these ideas “let’s just stop hating/ bullying people” are more complicated than people think through.
These hateful thoughts and actions are not through. In contrast they are spontaneous and unexplainable and to recognize them you have to be really introspective which is harder than you think. 
You can also see why some people might be logically annoyed by an obese person.
If they act lazy at work and you have to work harder to compensate I’m sure you would be annoyed as well. 
I am not saying that we should not condemn bullies rather I think to get to the root of this phenomenon we need to also understand that the bully has less control of their thoughts than you would think.

What? Who's saying that? I'm not gonna say that it's easy for a guy that's 6-5 800lbs to get to a healthy BMI but it's absolutely not impossible nor incurable. Sure, there are changes in the body that make it easier to add more fat once you've gotten obese like larger sized Adipose cells but again that doesn't make it incurable.

hjepx17,t1_hjeca7h,2021-11-05 12:48:15,science,"Oh wow, your wife and daughter found a way to defy the laws of conservation of energy?  
  
I promise you, your wife eats fewer calories than she burns, your daughter eats more. You can calculate their metabolism nicely within about ~200 calories a day, just online with a total daily energy expenditure calculator. Your wife might feel like she eats a lot, but she eats smaller portions or less frequently than she thinks. And your daughter might eat healthy food, but just more often or bigger portions than she needs.  
  
Exercise is also much less of a factor in your weight than people think. An hour of jogging barely even burns the calories of one full size candy bar, for example. So if you work out, and think ""wow, that workout really got me hungry!"" and then eat a meal, you probably put back all the calories you just burned and then some. It's really not intuitive.  
  
Either way, weight is not magic. Even people with metabolic disorders only need around 300 calories less or more a day than someone else their height, weight and activity levels.  
  
Calorie restriction works. It really does. Calories in < calories out and you WILL lose weight. It's just hard to get it right. It's hard to count every single calorie. It feels unfair when even a tablespoon of oil you use for cooking is almost 100 calories, or 1/15 of your total daily calorie allowance.",WeReAllMadHereAlice,t2_15l93i,3,0,reddit2

Nope. It requires complete denial of of the founding of American liberty and capitalism.

One of the core principle of American culture is liberty, especially negative liberty: that people are free to do what they want without barriers or constraint. And one of such constraint is government intervention. It is why America is a ""united states"", that it is formed into a coalition and disfavors a strong central government.

But to implement a nation wide policy, such as deciding that all states must follow a guideline of fast food content to avoid obesity, will inevitably strengthen the federal government's power. Then the possibility of the US becoming a totalitarian country which the federal government dwarfs state government increases, closer to that of China.

If you leave only the state government to decide, some state will relax the rules, so as to attract US fast food corporation to establish there to produce fast food in order to bring taxes to the government. The fast food will then export cross stateline and made other states' citizens obese.

If someone chooses to eat more calories than their body burns, it's because they're either making poor choices of what they eat so they arent satiated enough by normal portions or they're just plain overeating. If you eat too many calories you need to burn them off, if you're too lazy to exercise then eat less.

There is truly no excuse, I've been broker than broke and I've worked consistent 90 hour weeks in the oilfield for months and never had an issue with eating healthy or exercising. It's all about people's priorities, and if you're overweight then being healthy isn't one which is fine, but don't blame the world for your own shortcomings.",InjuredmanRS,t2_13q9h5,-2,0,reddit2

This left the lay world, which is essentially ignorant of even the basics of genetics (trust me I taught intro to undergrads, smart kids, for the past 5 years and many had no idea what was going on) to ascribe some people's weight issues to personal choices, which makes sense at a glance.

What?! Let's remember that obesity is higher in lower education and income groups.

First, people need education on how to exercise and eat healthy. There are tons of people who literally don't know how to do these things.

Then there's structural issues like food deserts and unsafe neighborhoods. Sure, ""just go for a walk everyday"" is great advice to get people moving, but not everyone lives in an area where it is safe to do so. And loads of people live in areas with no access to fresh produce or other healthy foods.

And none of this even touches the mental health component. Most Americans, especially the working class, do not have access to good mental health services. If someone is self medicating with food, taking away that outlet can cause mental health problems to worsen and people will either fall off the wagon or turn to other unhealthy coping mechanisms, like drugs and alcohol.

What this person is saying is that clinicians need to consider these other factors when treating obesity. Programs targeting obesity need to educate and provide means to change to the people who need them. I have worked in many clinics, and I have never seen a doc refer someone to counseling when they are having trouble losing weight.

hjdy4ba,t1_hjdqlyo,2021-11-05 06:53:10,science,"Ding, Ding, Ding!  Obesity is VERY often exacerbated and sustained by anxiety.  Often anxiety triggered by a lifetime of bullying and judgement by those around the obese person.  It often starts as a child when hounded and hyper-monitored by its skinny parents and caregivers like its an alien zoo creature.  To be fair, those thin parents truly can't figure out why their chubby kid is big and their skinny kids are thin when all are eating the same foods. (Usually ~ages 2-4). Next step (~ages 5-11):  Siblings of said chubby kid learn from the adults to judge, comment on, and 'other-ize' their sibling while also self-segregating from the larger kid.  Being left out of the 'reindeer games' begins a cycle of lesser activity, embarrassment, and hiding from others to prevent more of the same.  Isolation becomes the safe zone where people can't see you and gather amunition to further tease and judge you.  Isolation tends to involve more sedentary ways of passing one's time.  Thus begins the usually life-long habit of inactivity, self-soothing by comfort foods, and anxiety of going out for activity.  Everything becomes a who's judging me here or there event.  It's emotionally easier to stay in and away.  Oddly enough these folks are often very happy-go-lucky at work when life is busy, purposed, and focused.  But once the time clock is punched, it's an anxiety driven bee-line to the safety, comfort, and anonymity of home.  Inactivity awaits and the pounds pile on.

There’s a range of rates of cellular metabolism yes, but it’s closer to 10% variance than 50%+ some diet guru like to claim.

It’s why olympic athletes can eat enough for several normal adults: they have a lot of expensive muscle to keep fueled.

What does happen is that the body changes the hunger/satiation signaling pathways so that they’ll encourage you to eat in a way that will cause you to get back to slightly above your previous weight.

hjdkwo7,t1_hjdhydo,2021-11-05 04:15:02,science,"Why does polycystic ovary syndrome cause weight gain?

PCOS makes it more difficult for the body to use the hormone insulin, which normally helps convert sugars and starches from foods into energy. This condition -- called insulin resistance -- can cause insulin and sugar -- glucose -- to build up in the bloodstream.

High insulin levels increase the production of male hormones called androgens. High androgen levels lead to symptoms such as body hair growth, acne, irregular periods -- and weight gain. Because the weight gain is triggered by male hormones, it is typically in the abdomen. That is where men tend to carry weight. So, instead of having a pear shape, women with PCOS have more of an apple shape.

hjeemk7,t1_hjcy6nm,2021-11-05 10:52:53,science,"First of all, It's already been debunked that high fat diets are the sole reason for obesity. Simple carbohydrates (like sugar) and poliunsaturated fats (contained by most oils used in the food industry), have a much bigger role in obesity. Coincidentally they are present in most processed foods nowadays.


Secondly, the biggest cause for obesity is overating. You can't get fat if you don't eat more than your body needs. It's true that some people may have some health problems which causes them to have a lower caloric need that someone very similar to them but without that same problem. But at the end of the day, easily available high density foods and overeating are the cause.


Obesity rates began to climb at the same rate that sugar consumption began to climb. The sugar industry has spend billions trying to convince people that saturated fats are the problem, instead of sugar, and they have succeeded. Luckily people are starting to see the lies and changing their dietary habits.


Saying that genetics and/or epigenetics are the main cause of obesity is antiscience and dangerous. Yes, genetics may make it easier for some people to become overweight than for other people. But that doesn't mean that genetics are making them fat.


Obesity is a real problem which could very easily be preventable if governments started listening to contemporary science and stopped giving the fast food industry so much power.


But hey, I guess it's easier for governments and people alike to blame genetics, instead of acknowledging that under current guidelines, pizza with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce, counts as a vegetable in the US.",RealAstroTimeYT,t2_9cu7xwnm,3,0,reddit2

hjdne9s,t1_hjdl02n,2021-11-05 04:40:27,science,"That is true, it is better than candy. Processed foods, not necessarily. I mean, pasta is a processed food. The strained tomato sauce that I used to buy (and can't find anymore, possibly due to the Xinjiang thing) was also processed. Processed doesn't mean bad, or unhealthy, it just means it isn't raw, and some company did something to it, before selling it to you. Cans of beans, frozen vegetables, both are processed and sugar quantity dependent, pretty healthy, and can help make you feel full.

But none of those 3 aforementioned products (rice, pasta, potatoes) will make you feel full or satiated for any significant length of time. You may feel full after 20-30min, and not be hungry again even after an hour, but not much longer than that, you will start to feel hungry again. That is because these are high calorie foods, that have high glycemic indices, and when that index drops again, which will happen not long after eating, you start to feel hungry again.

Obviously, that isn't necessarily how they would always be eaten. If you throw in a high fiber low glycemic food like green vegetables, things work out better. But it's when you start getting into those fresh vegetables that prices start to go up, and I'm not even talking about organic.

I'm also talking from experience, even though it is anecdotal. For the last, a little over 2 years, I've had ~$65-$75CAD/month for groceries, that's about $52-$60USD/m to spend on food. It isn't easy to buy sufficient food of the right variety, quality, and quantity.",adaminc,t2_1z28h,-1,0,reddit2

hjf91et,t1_hjf3t1c,2021-11-05 15:07:55,science,"All of the things you mention affect obesity, but do not demonstrate free will. It's still done by a biological organ that functions in an environment.  Binge eating is not the best example to pull out to demonstrate free will. It's defined as a sense of loss of control over eating.

Survival of the fittest (coined by Spencer, not Darwin), actually favors obesigenic traits. Humans evolved in an environment with limited food and the threat of starvation. So characteristics like gorging, hyper-responsiveness to high calorie and palatable foods, storing fat easily, resistance to burning fat (thermogenesis), etc. would be selected for because the prevented our ancestors from starving. Extreme examples of this are the Pima Indians who survived in a desert with sparse food for generations and then all became obese and diabetic when they started eating out of supermarkets. The obesity trends follow the over-abundance of foods engineered to be highly palatable, cheap, and highly processed. With the genetic predispositions of people who survived countless generations under conditions of food scarcity, only an environmental change (food type, availability, and other cultural factors) could have produced the rapid and recent increase in obesity, and morbid obesity as you point out. 

There are mechanisms in the body and brain that regulate all of this and our very ability to choose what, when , and how much we eat are based on systems that are biologically integrated in our anatomy and physiology. 

A moralistic model, based on 100% free will lack explanatory power and more importantly has failed to produce positive results. If blaming people (including people blaming themselves) worked, obesity would not exist. Dieters tend to have enormous amounts of self-blame when they fail or regain the wait. It doesn't make sense to think that everyone kept their act together for the first 250,000 years and then suddenly let it all go in the last 50 years. A combination of biological, evolutionary, and environmental influences provides the most coherent explanation so far. The same has already been proven with addiction models: the biopsychosocial model (multicausality) is the most useful. Moralistic blame models (people are just selfish, lazy, weak) are circular explanations that neither helped us understand it or discover more effective treatments.",Papancasudani,t2_4fh90xgw,2,0,reddit2

But moreover those biochemical messages (insulin, ghrelin, leptin, cortisol, adrenaline) tie directly or indirectly into the brain systems that guide decision making (hypothalamus, limbic system, reward system, prefrontal cortex).

Abstract

The pursuit of passion in one’s work is touted in contemporary discourse. Although passion may indeed be beneficial in many ways, we suggest that the modern cultural emphasis may also serve to facilitate the legitimization of unfair and demeaning management practices—a phenomenon we term the legitimization of passion exploitation. Across 7 studies and a meta-analysis, we show that people do in fact deem poor worker treatment (e.g., asking employees to do demeaning tasks that are irrelevant to their job description, asking employees to work extra hours without pay) as more legitimate when workers are presumed to be “passionate” about their work. Of importance, we demonstrate 2 mediating mechanisms by which this process of legitimization occurs: (a) assumptions that passionate workers would have volunteered for this work if given the chance (Studies 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8), and (b) beliefs that, for passionate workers, work itself is its own reward (Studies 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8). We also find support for the reverse direction of the legitimization process, in which people attribute passion to an exploited (vs. nonexploited) worker (Study 7). Finally, and consistent with the notion that this process is connected to justice motives, a test of moderated mediation shows this is most pronounced for participants high in belief in a just world (Study 8). Taken together, these studies suggest that although passion may seem like a positive attribute to assume in others, it can also license poor and exploitative worker treatment.",mvea,t2_6hji,33,0,reddit3

enhw5cx,t1_enh4mv8,2019-05-14 18:19:46,science,"It's very true in the PhD system, unfortunately. But that is also somewhat biased; to go after a PhD in anything and dedicate 5+ years of your life to a small set of questions, you have to have some passion for that. 

In this case, the devil is in the details. When compared to their peers, individuals who are exploited can be seen as more enthusiastic, passionate, or ""go-getters"". Speaking as someone near the end of this path, I feel like I've found just how rampant this sort of scenario is in the PhD field, both from internal and external sources. Personally, while I have an excellent advisor, I feel that my own studies have been exploited and it just seems like this is something that is very easy to do in academia. It has left me unmotivated to the point where I can't see myself taking another job in the field, despite the interest.

I guess I just want to take the moment to highlight a notion: It is a true privilege to be able to go after a graduate degree, and to additionally have people pay you to explore your ideas; but this can come at a high cost for the student. Whether you are in a grad school program or know someone who is, it is important to keep in mind that this is a population that is at risk for a lot of abuse / exploitation; they need protection and support! 


If anyone wants to talk about it more, I am happy to, although I may be somewhat slow in getting back to you at the moment. But for those interested in the mental health crisis that is affecting grad students, here is a good article that sums up a lot of it: [The Emotional Toll of Graduate School](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/) In particular, the passage 

>Even for students who are lucky enough to produce results, frustratingly, individual professors have their own standards for what constitutes “enough research” to graduate. Is it four first-author research articles? What about one review paper and a few conference presentations? The answers you hear will vary widely, and ultimately, a student’s supervising professor usually has sole power in determining when a student graduates. At best, this creates a confusing system where students perform substantially different amounts of work for the same degree. At worst, it fosters a perverse power dynamic where students feel powerless to speak out against professors who create toxic working conditions, even resulting in cases of sexual exploitation.

is something particularly relevant that I talk about with others. In my case, the student before me had 1 paper in the process of being published, got their PhD, and is currently revising a 2nd related to the work. The impact factors were average (I only say this since 1 Nature paper could have the work of 2-3 other papers, etc). I am at 5 papers / reviews, and require a 6th to graduate. The current grad school system needs substantial overhaul, and, to get back to your point, it seems like those who become competent in that high stress environment and who are lucky enough to generate interesting results can easily get shouldered with more, as that feeds the grant cycle system.

For other articles as well, people can google something like ""Nature grad school""; they frequently have articles which discuss the issues that are affecting grad students.",I_just_made,t2_iy73q,175,0,reddit3

engxko7,t1_engev55,2019-05-14 14:08:57,science,"Some people are perfectly content being in the same career for life. Back in the 90s I worked at a large company that does credit checks, guess one of the 3 names. Anyhow I was running a small support desk and hired a guy named Don. I was a young buck and he was 10 years my senior but he was a good guy and did excellent work. 

Fast forward to 2014, and I've been to 70 countries by now, lived in 4 different ones, and run a global sales division for a major IT firm. There is a sales opportunity at this company I haven't stepped foot inside since around 1996. I'm pretty excited just to walk back into a place that in reality helped form the career I have and set my base so I could launch.

I'm walking to the CIOs office on the IT floor and look at that, it's Don sitting in a cube. I backtrack as soon as I see the name and say ""Don?? Wow dude! It's been awhile."" Don was doing the exact same job I hired him to do in 1994. Twenty years of sitting in a cubicle making Windows accounts and managing emails and backups. Hey, whatever. He's a worker bee. Not everyone can be the queen bee and many have no desire to do so.

I've had a salary since I was 22 so hourly isn't a thing I understand much and now that I'm in my 40s I'm out of touch completely. However, working my ass off has paid large dividends and at that company I would come in at 3am when no else wanted to and do software loads and updates so the business could hum by 8am. I was the guy the CIO at the time called to fix his email, his PC, pick out his son's laptop, and the guy the director counted on to run this 25 person org as a 22 year old.

Now I'm semi-retired and fart around on some conference calls. I'm not done yet. There is hunger there still even though I could sit on my ass and Reddit all day every day or go fishing. Nope. I have a really good opportunity coming up that I think I'll take to run a global business channel, the hunger never stops. It's why Warren Buffet is still doing his thing. My good friend owns a restaurant, the guy was CEO of two major companies, and he still can't sit down and rest. 

You either have this or you don't and I can't explain it. People who give the most ARE promoted because they're the hungry ones who fight to get it and it's not even always about being on top. I don't want to be on top, but I absolutely want to create something huge, own something great, and build a stellar business. 

It's not even about the money and people might be surprised by that but the money is a trailer. If you do everything you need to do to make the business the best business it can be the money will absolutely follow.",xynix_ie,t2_8m8rm,41,0,reddit3

several years ago I worked at a place that forced employees to do extra hard work as a condition for continued employment, because they were ""downsizing""  The losers didn't offer any kind of severance deal.  I signed up to do technical support. I ended up doing customer service, billing, sales, and technical support, just to keep my job!   I fooled myself into thinking they would pull themselves out of the rut they were in.  I thought I could somehow switch into another IT dept within the company.

Looking back, I regret working there!  Some of the work was actually demeaning.  I accepted the job because I was sick of unemployment and the company seemed solvent at that time, on an upward spiral.  Long story short: the CEO left a year after me.

To be fair, this and associated abuse/exploitation can and does vary greatly. 

My graduate program is mostly filled with grouchy older guys who are willing to work for and towards given goals, but wont take abuse from anyone. which being said for us I think the median Masters student age is around 32-35 and phd candidates are 40 somethings... most are old army guys too who are out to get the doctorates for purely career needs related things and not necessarily willing, nor able to deal with nonsense of any sort. Hell, this bit may also tie in to where the money for said education comes from and how desperate a program is to keep certain populations in the system.(Gibill funds and all)

And ironically, I'm pretty sure I a have been experiencing the target end of that assumption for the last few years at my job.

And the reasons I put up with it include good pay, high job security, and even better prospects in the event the company grows as fast as it seems likely to. I like my job but I'm not passionate about it (although sometimes for certain elements, sure).  


And yet people still mention my long hours as if they are personal choice. They are not per se; only my tolerance of them is, for the time being. If I had a normal amount of work assigned, I would work normal hours. But because I have so much assigned, and so much of it is stuff that a) only I in the company can do currently, and b) stuff that is on a short deadline, it's not practical to neglect it.

It’s cool that you know who you are and actually live it. I have that hunger as well, but it just happens to be in areas that have nothing to do with business or making money, at least not directly 🤣. So for me, and Don I assume, working extra hours and seeking promotions isn’t profitable (in a quality of life sense) and actually hinders me in my passions. It’s hard for me to explain to people that I’ve got a good job already, I’m paid well enough for my lifestyle, and have no financial worries, so I just don’t desire a bigger work load at all. I’m responsibly funding my personal passions and while I’m at work, I do my job well. Ahh perfect, that’s the end of that transaction for me. But don’t you want to grow?! Go to more meetings?! Have more responsibility?! No because I’m excited about a personal project or pursuit I have going on at home! I want to hang with my wife and dogs! Ahhh perfect.

You articulated something that many people don’t understand, because it is counterintuitive unless someone explicitly teaches you the concept. It’s a wisdom that allows you to appreciate Don even though he doesn’t seem as successful in the conventional sense. You said it’s not about the money, money is a trailer. Yes! You pursued a path that was true to you and you did it with passion and self honesty! That in itself is the goal, don’t you think? Material rewards did follow, but those were just secondary. Your path just happened to be materially profitable in this time and place, but that’s only a cherry on top because your joy comes from how you are living. And Don is doing the same thing but in his way! Our culture desires those secondary trappings and make them the goal, which makes people miserable.

There's a vast spectrum of people in between and beyond these two types who have varying levels of motivation and passion about their work. Everyone has different goals and a different work ethic, and all of that is beside the point.

The underlying issue here is compensation, not ambition. Self-improvement, career advancement, or even just enjoying what you do are actually pretty decent compensation (at least in my view).

At the moment I'm working extra hours because I indeed don't want to get fired, but I'm also doing it to make sure I get the experience I need to qualify for my visa (this right here is a whole new world of being taken advantage of) or I would leave at the end of my shift. After about half a year of it I noticed my boss doesn't really appreciate any of the extra work I do and promoted both of my coworkers who work less hours than me and don't do any of the extra work. After multiple warnings and one being put on probation they both got fed up and quit leaving me alone in a terrible situation so I'm looking for a new job too. 

All I've noticed is that it makes the management more likely to dump work on you, it doesn't actually help you get ahead at work you'll just be labelled as the guy who works really hard but will never get promoted. I've had other jobs where I did stay to make sure things got done properly and I was definitely compensated/rewarded for it but that is rare.

One way to help this along is to have an odd number on the committee so you can’t get a stalemate decision; in my case, I think this will help me. One of many pieces I didn’t mention includes things like public criticism and an almost unspoken notion that students “bend the knee” to the established, regardless of whether they know anything of the field / project.

I can work really long hours but they're not bad hours. Just last week I flew to Vegas which I'm not a fan of because I don't gamble and don't go to strip clubs but I had an interview with a couple VPs for this possible job I might take.

I fly first class as the upgrade was almost nothing compared to the ticket price. Get on the plane from this paradise I live in, sit down, and get a Chardonnay. The guy sitting next to me in 2C and I chatted for awhile and I watched a movie and read some. Land in Atlanta to connect, meander to the gate while stopping off to get a meal at TGI Fs. Board the next plane and spend 4 or so hours in first class sipping wine and watching movies and reading. Landed in Vegas and got an uber, checked into the hotel and met a few old friends downstairs at the Venetian. We drank until god knows how long, probably midnight. I'm old now, 2am doesn't work for me haha. Wake up and go meet these guys I'm talking to for this job, and then I go back to my hotel room at 5 and lay in bed and read and watch movies. I wasn't up for a night of partying or whatever. It was a nice couple days. 

This is my life now. I did all the work to get here and now what I do is hop on a plane and take people to dinner and then sit in my hotel room and read books. It's a great life and people pay me assloads of money to do this. It took work to get here though, a lot of work, and a marriage burned. The ex couldn't handle my travel, my wife now met me when I did and it's just fine.

Of course there is pressure building the business and managing people, conference calls, firing people sucks, hiring people isn't all that fun to me because I don't trust people inherently, but it works usually. My pain points at this point because I spent 25 years building my personal brand have allowed me to live on the ocean and have toys I can play with like an airplane, boat, buncha cars, blah blah. However that isn't a definition of me. It's more a result of being bored that I bought an airplane and got a license to fly it.

I much prefer to stay home and hang out with my wife and kids BUT that constant hunger compels me to go out into the field and work, to put ""time in."" I don't have a running tally of financial metrics as if I do this work those things happen anyway. My end result now is a product of working my ass off for 10 years and then coasting on knowledge and efficiency while gaining small bits of knowledge constantly and monetizing that knowledge. I can close a $4,000,000 deal by answering a single question and then calling a person who can handle the logistics, a person I've known for 20 years that can accelerate the delivery. That's the networking side of the house. Knowing how to answer, and who to call.

I'm a travelling salesman. I can make $400k a year by flying around in first class and taking people to dinner and to many people all my travel sounds brutal. However I'm in Paris having a lunch at a small cafe and people watching while sipping Pernod. It's not a bad life.

That's what people don't get. I learned it very early on when I was 18 and working at a small computer shop in say 1992 maybe 1993, and some guy paid us $40 to install a memory card (SIMM) into his computer. It took me less than a minute. He was paying me for my knowledge and not for the physical effort of installing more memory into his computer. This whole concept of ""I don't want to work in an office"" has always baffled me. I don't work in an office, I work at a cafe in Buenos Aires until a meeting time slot hits, or a bar in Rome.

I could have stayed at that place like Don stayed at his company and done that my entire life but .. big but, that spark was lit. I knew at that point that if I continue doing this type of activity that people will constantly pay me for my knowledge. That is why I get payed. 

As I tell my son who is about to graduate and go to college, ""If you put the time in now, the payment will come."" And I've prefaced this by saying that money isn't always the reward. Sometimes it's just the satisfaction of knowing, as a teacher for instance, that you sent a kid off to college. Financials don't define a person, the acts they do with the short life they have certainly does. For me now it's charity events and I suppose I'll start working again, 6 months out isn't working for me anymore.

By the way, my son's aunt is an amazing artist who has bounced all over the world just making art and now owns a small gallery in Australia. It's her thing and she's excellent at it. Is she making good money? Who cares..",xynix_ie,t2_8m8rm,4,0,reddit3

He didn't put nearly as many hours in or sacrifices but is his life less happy than mine? I seriously doubt it. I don't look at it as squandered opportunity anymore, I could have dragged him along unwillingly and may have failed. He's exactly where he loves to be and wants to be. 

This culture of looking at people that are happy and yet don't have X or Y as a job is a problem in this country. What if a person is a manager at McDonalds?

enlmtoc,t1_enifw6c,2019-05-15 11:35:00,science,"Currently a postdoc, and still feeling like cheap labor. I had not wanted to do a postdoc originally, but it’s difficult to get a job interview in industry without it on your resume due to the abundance of postdoc applications. 

There’s several things I hadn’t expected which I’ll note because they add to the discouragement. 

1. I still feel trapped. Grad school is usually 5-6 years of being “stuck” in a lab with few [good] options to leave or transfer. In my field, it usually takes a few years to get out a paper, and a postdoc position held less than three years is generally dismissed on a resume. So I feel it would be a waste of my time if I left my current position. Thus, stuck again. 

2. Future career options are confusing from a career trajectory perspective. I’m doing a postdoc similar to what I did for grad school. I’ve learned so much more even in the first year so no complaints there. But looking at “next steps”, I would likely be doing something much different in nature. So, am I really getting trained for a career in science or am I just cheap labor? 

3. Attitudes towards postdocs. Despite my own feelings of needing to stay a few years, many postdocs at my center use it as a temporary stepping stone and start the applications for “real jobs” nearly immediately leading to high turnover. I’m not at an academic institution so (a) I’m essentially a contractor and don’t get any benefits i.e. health insurance, retirement, maternity leave and (b) there are no grad students or technicians so I’m back to being the lowest rung on the ladder. Anyhow, we are viewed as disposable and easily replaceable. I worked super hard to specialize in a field but there’s little credit given to postdocs relative to how hard they work (until you land that full time position). Most postdocs are in their 30s and it’s discouraging to be viewed as “not having a real job yet”.",MiddleFroggy,t2_uc20d07,1,0,reddit3

eo30lpi,t1_eniwqwn,2019-05-19 02:27:09,science,"Hello, sorry for the late response!

So, I can give a few tips that I give to new students, but a lot really depends on the program, etc...

1. You are doing exactly what you need to be; research the professors, find out what they are doing. Does it interest you? Do you think you could learn skills that would help you advance your career in the way you want? If you can, sit down, chat with them! It doesn't have to be anything serious; short talks about what they are doing, where they think the research is going, if they had a spot open and you were taken in, what types of projects exist, etc.

2. If your program has you do rotations before joining a lab, try to find labs with very different atmospheres. One of the best things I did, though not on purpose, was to try out a very small lab where it was literally just me and the PI, as well as a larger one with a few postdocs and students. What I found was that I did much better in the larger lab, as I had more opportunity to get hands-on training from the post docs, as well as daily conversations about science.

3. As others mentioned, talk to the students if you get the chance! You always have to put their critiques and comments into perspective though. But one of the senior students when I joined talked with me a lot, we had similar interests, and he told me that the lab he was in would be an excellent fit. I tried a rotation through there, and from that point on knew that was the lab I should be a part of. I had also crossed out a few labs by talking to others, there experiences, etc.
Along these lines, you should pay close attention to these professors and the kinds of questions they ask in seminars. Are the respectful? Do they ask engaging questions that show interest? Or can they be arrogant / a haughty? How they handle themselves in seminars is them at their best!

4. If things don't seem to be going well, try to find help. Go to a mentor, or the grad student manager, but get help before things get worse.

Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to know before you are in the thick of it. Find friends to talk to, and if possible, find a few friends outside of the lab you can chat with as well; ones that have nothing to do with the university / science. As much as I have felt I have harped on this in recent posts, ensure you watch your mental health as well. Watch for signs, sometimes they start showing themselves before you even realize it. It always seems negative to say this, but it is one of the most important things a grad student can do. For instance, I thought everything was great; 3rd year in, my mentality was ""I constantly heard of people hating this, but I'm enjoying it! Things aren't too stressful... etc etc."" Meanwhile, I had gradually started coming in later, started shying away from a lot of outside social engagements. In year 5, I had been dealt a ""blow"" when I got my first author publication and thought I was on my way to closing up and getting done (our requirements according to the department are 1 primary/ 1 co-author), only to find out that they wanted more. They rules had changed during my time, and they decided to include me in it. From that point, those feelings I had been repressing came to the forefront and I realized just how deep I had been for so long, without even knowing. I lost most of my interest in my work, I stopped putting a lot of effort into my presentations, I started coming in even later. Unfortunately, that was only the start, as I began to have conversations about where to go after; low pay in academia postdocs, yet that is where everyone wants me to go... With little to no support in terms of advising in transitioning to industry.


So, I am sorry for sounding grim and foreboding, but I say all of that because I think that mentally / physically, I could be in a much better state if I had paid attention earlier and sought help.


You'll be fine, take it all one day at a time; study hard, treat your classes and your research like a job. Choose your friend circles carefully, and try to surround yourself with people who you can learn from and who are professional. I have a colleague who didn't do this, and grad school seems to be a continuation of undergrad life for them; that's fine if you like that lifestyle, but it shows in the quality of their work. They haven't taken it seriously, they haven't master the material, and it has led to very limited opportunities for them. Nice individual, but that is something to learn from them.


Anyways, I hope that helps. If you ever need someone to talk to, or want to mull over an idea, feel free to send a PM! You should look forward to it; overall, I learned so much about myself during my PhD, through both the good and the bad. It'll change the way you think, but you'll gain a lot of confidence and the ability to tackle large problems on your own. That is invaluable!",I_just_made,t2_iy73q,1,0,reddit3

Wow, you hit the nail on the head when it comes to what I'm dealing with at the moment. The committee keeps pushing me towards academia; but I developed a skillset that is in high demand, both inside/outside of science. The difference is that academia postdocs get crazy hours, massive stress, low pay, poor protections.... Compared with decent pay, maybe not as bad of hours... I don't know how people can go through 5-6 years of this, then look at the Postdoc system and feel that it is the next best step / moving forward. It's terrible, the postdoc system seems extremely exploitative, and as much as I enjoy running ideas down, I can't sell my soul and sanity to a broken system like that.

Thanks for sharing all of your thoughts, putting these things out in the open can help others to know they are not alone, and that there are things that need to change!",I_just_made,t2_iy73q,1,0,reddit3

We spend billions and billions of dollars trying to abate the current problems using only the demand side of the equation. What would happen if we applied the same amount of effort and money facing this economic problem using the supply side of the formula.

There have been fewer if any studies or programs to consider increasing the supply of doctors, and nurses and other than efforts with AI I fail to see how we are progressing towards efficiency in the healthcare supply side of the equation , focusing rather on patients and their needs , rather than the societally economic need to create more scientists of the body.",guerochuleta,t2_di3ff,1,0,reddit4

For example, while I'm off the suboxone now, I still am a patient because the doctor there said something about how many adults with adhd or depression and so on self medicate. So he gave me a little questionnaire after that meeting and then said I have adhd and before I could finish asking how to go about starting a new doctor for that purpose with my history he said he had sent the prescription for adderall in. I was told about 20% of the others are in a similar situation. There's the very rare few on benzos and suboxone too from what some have shared.

Point being, they it plays a part in the addiction issues anyway and some places will link it and cover various medications and whatever if they can prescribe and it's still covered.

I had one doctor explain to me that it is ridiculous the abuse of ADHD medication right now and he said (at least in his area/state or whatever) that the level of ADHD medication abuse was currently worse then opioids and drugs like Xanax etc. He said that is why so many doctors shut it down if you try to mention a concern of having ADHD etc, especially if you are already older and never had any prior diagnosis of ADHD from childhood, etc. If you have any medical records from within the years to request and take with you, that at least can show a lot of doctors that you are serious and with a serious diagnosis and that you have a track record of constantly checking in with the doctor and not constantly having your doses boosted, etc. But if you’ve never been diagnosed and you’re an adult then hopefully you have a PCP doctor that you’ve been with for a while and have established a relationship who will at least be willing listen to you and recommend you to a Psychiatrist for further evaluation. It’s weird, because according to doctors and reports and claims, so many people have or believe they have ADHD and thus the increase of the use and abuse of these medications, but then lot of reports and such claim that the ADHD symptoms that so many claim today are a side effect of technology and the internet and something always grabbing our attention and being able to bounce around so much that those of us that grew up with the internet etc almost had it “trained” into us to not be able to pay attention etc. Who knows.

Medicaid is entirely voluntary, so if the rates are a net loss, many doctors' offices simply refuse to participate in the program. 

As a side note, this is also why many reasonable people are hesitant about single-payer.

f2ld00f,t1_f2kcm4q,2019-10-05 16:43:51,science,"There are a few reasons people are opposed to things like Medicare for all:

-Any increase in the social safety net shifts power away from employers to employees, which means employers either have to treat their employees like people or else pay them more, and the latter costs customers money. 

-There is a belief among many that the government can’t do anything right, that it is slow, inefficient, and full of people who are greedy, lazy, incompetent, and who can’t be easily fired (and not just in congress!) and one with this belief would further believe that anything the private sector can do, the public sector shouldn’t. 

-The government providing services costs money, and while it generally only does so for things that either the private sector can’t or won’t do (e.g., military, servicing the poor, etc.), people are rightly wary of where their tax dollars go. There is a logical fallacy that people seem to look at a potential tax increase without looking at what is saved by not spending on private insurance (with further complications like employers subsidizing health insurance so that employees are oblivious to the true costs, although it isn’t clear that employers would provide other compensation if they were no longer subsidizing private insurance)

-There is a pervasive belief that the world unfolds according to God’s plan, that successful people are good, smart, and hard working, while the poor are dumb, bad, or lazy, and that both groups are deserving of their lot in life. Any evidence to the contrary is dismissed as god working in mysterious ways. Because of this, redistributive policies are seen as an immoral theft from the good to benefit the undeserving.


So to these people, Medicare for all is robbing deserving to help the undeserving, increasing taxes and the size of an incompetent government, giving people the lazy more freedom to leach off the work of other, increasing prices, and who knows what else. 

These are not terribly good arguments, and there are not only direct counter arguments but also convincing arguments that even if all of these things were true, this (and other social programs, even expensive ones) are still worthwhile not just for the people they help, not just for society at large, but even for the people at the top who pay more and don’t get a direct benefit.

An example  is water. If you have anything for living expenses related  to  housing, you pay for everyone near you having 
clean and safe municipal water. And even if you have well water someone had to pay some cost to have the well dug and maintained.

Clean air isn't free either. No one tells you that you have to pay for it, but everyone understands the costs. Here's an example, if you live next to a steel mill your house and lungs will most definitely suffer. So if your poor and live next to a dirty plant and can't afford to move then you can't  afford clean air. And if you say 'Tell the government' they know.

f2oairj,t1_f2npx1a,2019-10-06 01:27:11,science,"Funny you should ask.

Here is what happened (while the figures I'm using may not be exact, the concept is):

With the Medicaid Expansion under Obamacare, the income level needed to apply for Medicaid was raised from 100% poverty level to 133%. Thus, if you made over the 133% poverty level, you were eligible for Obamacare subsidies, meaning that some or all of your insurance would be paid by the Federal government. The higher your income, the fewer subsidies you would receive and the more of your insurance bill you would pay yourself.

Well, Republican-controlled states were allowed to refuse the Medicaid Expansion by the Republican-controlled Supreme Court for purely political reasons, not the financial reasons claimed by Republican Governors because the Medicaid Expansion had the Federal government paying 100% of the extra costs for the first couple years then 90% after that and the only thing the states had to do was spend a little bit more money in administrative costs.

So the poverty level for Medicaid remained at 100% in those states.

However, the Republican-controlled Congress never went back to fix Obamacare levels, which means that Obamacare subsidies still only kick in for those above the 133% poverty level.

This means if your income puts you anywhere from 101-132% of the poverty level, you get ZERO help with insurance. You make too much money for Medicaid and not enough for Obamacare subsidies.

All because of Republican evil.",evilkumquat,t2_27ywmr2,1,0,reddit4

f2of3lh,t1_f2mc56f,2019-10-06 02:01:04,science,Thanks! I haven’t heard of that one- usually any controlled substance for adhd isn’t covered by the stuff like that. I can’t see any low cost or affordable psych (like at a student health clinic) or even a general practitioner (that my insurance would cover) because they won’t write prescriptions for it or can’t depending on the state since there is an increased stringency from the opioid crisis and controlled meds. Things like antidepressants are pretty easy to get and I think some telemed apps like doctor on demand do affordable “psych” visits for things like antidepressants. Good option for some.,,,1,0,reddit4

I’ve never qualified for Medicaid, so I’m not familiar with that but I have found in my most of my research across a few states usually clinics like that tend to have a disclaimer that won’t write for adhd meds. The wait times aren’t bad at all in psych when you are paying as much as I do. The doctor and her team that I go to bend over backwards for me, but I do pay for that. I have noticed in an increase in psychiatrists that specialize in adult adhd and it’s gotta be a sweet gig.

I think people are just afraid of it getting worse so they're reluctant to embrace a wholly different system. There is so much propaganda about how if it's government-related it will necessarily mean longer, waits, more red tape, uncaring bureaucrats, etc, but those impressions are reinforced by movie stereotypes and politicians who use that for their own purposes. Sure, it happens, but it's not like capitalistic companies all put much into customer service. (Many do, but you can't count on that.) But with catastrophic medical bills being the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy, I can't imagine there aren't millions of families out there wishing for a better, simpler, fairer system. The whole idea of insurance was supposed to be that we share risks so reduce the costs to everyone. The more people in the pool, the better it works. One bureaucracy and billing department instead of dozens or hundreds of different ones means one set of rules. And there would definitely be a need for ombudsmen and people in the system dedicated to improvement and increased efficiency. Insurance companies squeeze out every last dollar so their CEOS can take home tens of millions of dollars. That money is being taken from Average Joe and Judy.

Sure single payer is ""free"" but you pay for it in income tax withholdings and your employer matches the same amount.  I believe it is somewhere between 10-12% on both ends in Canada.

Liberals and conservatives have a number of root values on each side of a spectrum that account for their feelings on most issues, and I’m elucidating one of those values: personal responsibility versus fairness. 

In this debate, liberals are fighting for fairness when they want to expand Medicare to all (or whatever they call the expansion of health benefits). No matter how you slice it, though, this expansion WILL cost taxpayers more money, which is where conservatives’ instinct towards personal responsibility kicks in. They think that people aren’t taking enough personal responsibility in providing themselves with healthcare. 

I understand there are lots of data on either side of the argument and efficiencies in the healthcare system that could lower costs for all, and I understand that not everyone starts with equal opportunity to access healthcare which is why the system exists in the first place...all I’m trying to explain is that that is the moral root of conservatives’ argument.

Conservatives DO NOT REJECT medicaid.  Again, it's a spectrum.  Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, which is why they are skeptical when expansions of medicaid are put on the table.  No one wants to go back to living in caves, that's just a stupid comment frankly.  It's an argument of how much we should expand medicaid.  I bet liberals would be much more careful with their calls for medicaid expansion if they were the ones who had to pay for it, but instead they just say to tax the rich, absolving them of any dog in the pony (not all of the time, but that's the narrative among current candidates).

Your comment is the problem with US politics today.  Neither side is stupid, it's just a matter of values.

1. Those ridiculous prices you keep talking about? Those are inflated by WAY too much, it's almost criminal. Bulk billing would ensure that the prices of medical things are kept reasonable.

2. What about the big procedures? Those would be covered under health insurance. Just because bulk billing exists, doesn't mean it can cover everything. But small things, like visits to the GP? That would be covered under bulk billing?

3. What even is bulk billing? It's essentially an additional tax, just a few dollars, that splits the medical bill for common things, e.g. a GP visit, between the entire country. Which, essentially makes it free for those without insurance. If you do have insurance, you still need to present it and they can cover the things they cover. But it has major benefits for those without insurance.

4. Who even has bulk billing? You would be surprised how many countries have it. Finland and Australia are just two of many.

Those are just the main points, any more questions, I probably won't be able to answer because I'm not an expert.

TL;DR, bulk billing is good and should be applied in America.",mimi_reading,t2_499n4zo0,9,0,reddit4

Examples of frequently employed roadblocks are:

Last minute changes to voting areas

Voter eligibility purges

Not enough voting booths resulting in extremely long lines

Straight up closing or moving voting areas out of low income neighborhoods requiring sometimes significant travel time to reach the nearest booth

The second thing was to prevent discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and offer subsidies to the poor. This meant that people who were more likely to need expensive medical care were throw into the pool with others, and since insurance prices are roughly proportional to the amount of healthcare of the insured, this raised the average cost of care per insured person.

I think the other big impact was that ACA stopped them from using many of the signals that they had been using to assign risk and price policies and forced pricing to just depend on age and zip or something. That might have triggered some people who were getting lower than average rates to come up and higher than average to come down.

There was also, independent of the ACA, a long term trend of health care costs rising at like 10-15% y/y ...

Only Bernie Sanders has repeatedly insisted on a government monopoly to care. Warren has not committed to any specific policy proposal, Harris has embraced everything at various times and walked it back. Buttigieg, Biden, and others have proposed a public option. A public option is essentially establishes a baseline insurance plan, something private insurance needs to beat either with services not covered or a better network of healthcare providers. They have sometimes termed this “Medicare for all who want it”, or “improving the ACA” or whatever. 

ACA was supposed to include this public option, but it was removed because Joe Lieberman threw a one man filibuster to block it. The consequence is there isn’t a not-for-profit, public insurance plan available to all to establish any kind of anchor relative to what the more higher end, premium plans should charge. This public plan would also draw the sickest people, who need the most care, leaving private plans with fewer expenses. Private insurance does not want chronically sick people. They are expenses. But the public option was removed and instead anyone who makes more than poverty level is tossed into this marketplace.

It is expected by many that many Doctors will not take patients using the public option plan, as they do now with Medicaid, because the compensation prices are well below private insurance. If they competed with private insurance for paying providers, the program would be far more expensive and (rightly) criticized as a waste of tax dollars.

This wouldn’t work so easily with five times as many states, but if we expanded a Medicaid-like to everyone and redirected just some of the money we waste to funding it, we could have higher reimbursement rates than current  Medicaid does.

You immediately doubted my actual paper that had actual data of merely comparing reimbursement rates

Furthermore, even if you read your article it says some stand to lose up to 40% by some estimates. It also says the physician who estimated 16% said it would have disastrous results and ""I have no time for all the politicians who use the health care system as a crash-test dummy for their election goals,”. Maybe you didn't actually read it, but even that generous estimate would have catastrophic results

So yeah, at the bare minimum, using a bunch of assumptions I doubt come true, the minimum they lose is 16% which will result in many going out of business. You're also not considering many physicians, even that work in hospitals, are private contractors and not employees of the hospital.

f30qw9e,t1_f2zpe8h,2019-10-08 18:47:14,science,"Your original paper (the CBO study sourced by the article) said that some procedures are about 150-300% higher than Medicare, particularly brain/abdominal MRIs, knee arthroscopy, and radiation therapy. The same paper said that some services, including the usual pedestrian patient visit, are roughly the same. It also said that the prices of service varies due to factors such as industry consolidation.  
&nbsp;  
Many of these rates that are picked are set by hospitals, not private practice, and I do know that hospitals charge private insurance a hell of a lot more than they do Medicare.  For example, the ER can't turn anyone way, regardless of ability to pay. This means a lot of money spent on people who won't be able to pay it back, which means lost money, the hospital surcharging the private insurance industry to recoup losses and the patient possibly filing for medical bankruptcy. Everybody loses. Under M4A, these people who are skipping the bill are reimbursed by Medicare, and they may not have such a severe emergency if found and treated earlier. These losses are no longer driving up the prices the hospitals charge to everybody else (e.g. private insurers.)   
&nbsp;  
Fiscally, insurance is a concept where a monopoly is beneficial. The point of insurance is to spread risk around a large pool of people. The people in the pool are, essentially, the product. The rates for each individual are less for each healthy member of the pool contributing payments but not making claims for service. This is why there's so many concerns about ""death spirals"" surrounding the mandate of ACA; an insurance pool dominated by people who need expensive care will have skyrocketing costs.  
&nbsp;  
We are basically left with two choices to solve our current dilemma of hospitals treating people who can't afford to pay: let ERs deny service and people die from preventable illness due to lack of money, or extending coverage to everyone. Most polling shows much larger support for the latter. If we're going to extend coverage to everyone, the most efficient insurance pool *is everyone*. Most of the population is healthy and not drawing a lot from the insurance pool. Most people are contributors. Having multiple pools just leads down a road for healthy people to make exclusive pools for themselves, as we saw before ACA, and having multiple pools regulated to not exclude anyone just causes outrage over increased costs, as we saw with the market after ACA.    
&nbsp;    
The most effective solution is to simply end the market. Health insurance is not a concept that is compatible with free market ideology, because free markets only get in the way when something is mandatory like healthcare. Property insurance remains competitive because there's an alternative to being insured. You could just risk your house burning down and save money on payments. Car insurance is often mandatory with driving, but you can opt not to drive. There really isn't any good structure for allowing anyone to opt out of health insurance. If you have a body and are alive, you need coverage, because anyone of any means can get cancer and society is unwilling to let people die for lack of funds.",FullMotionVideo,t2_rtsc4,1,0,reddit4

> Many of these rates that are picked are set by hospitals, not private practice, and I do know that hospitals charge private insurance a hell of a lot more than they do Medicare.

This is not true at all. The way it works is a physician sets certain codes that they bill for, either procedures or diagnosis and then send it to the insurance company who pays a certain rate. Medicare is the same way. The hospital can charge whatever it wants but what it receives it what the insurance or Medicare pays for that code which changes over time but is pretty set

You're completely incorrect on this likely because you've never been involved in hospital billing

In regards to ER, you are referring to EMTALA. If the person does not have insurance and does not pay this comes out of charity care which basically means is tax deductible. They do not make money on these though and make the money back through people paying with insurance and tax write-offs. 

If you have insurance you essentially are already subsidizing medical care for people who don't pay or people who have Medicare and Medicaid

Insurance is not a method that is better as a monopoly. No business is better as a monopoly. It is the insurance companies job to appropriately rate risk. The better job they do of this, the more accurately they can book people for services and have enough money to pay people out. If they do this incorrectly either they charge people too much and people go elsewhere or they run out of money and go bankrupt. If it is government run, there is no incentive to reach this balance. That is why the amount needed always goes up and Medicare expenditures will continue to rise. There is also no competition to go to so if people start paying more, there is no alternative. It's hidden through taxes though, so what really winds up happening is there programs start going bankrupt and middle and lower class taxes are raised. See Portugual, Sweden, pretty much any country will always say ""NHS or Medicare or whatever is underfunded""

You are grossly mistaken in thinking that a monopoly of a business helps anyone but those in the monopoly. In this case, it helps the people who run Medicare

What you're describing with EMTALA is not insurance, it's charity. It's also a very small portion of actual expenditures. Which is fine but there are alternatives to this that don't involve creating a mandatory monopoly of the insurance system


So, for people without any income, we could create a service like Medicare that aids people. We could call it Medicaid

Ending the market is the dumbest solution possible unless you want to exponentially increase the cost of healthcare

Also, I like how you've just given up arguing that Medicare reimburses the same because you realize you're way off. It actually does reimburse 40-60% less depending on the state. Medicare for all would lead to less Heath care for all and more expensive at the same time

It's definitely dangerous that you don't even understand how the current system works but you know how it should be fixed so you go to ""www.imright.com"" to look for things that already reaffirm what you wanted affirmed when you don't really understand the way it works and it's problems.

jw8grap,t3_15r7nvn,2023-08-15 02:58:14,science,"These paragraphs from the discussion of the original research paper may help shed some light:

>Using survey data from the US, this article tests Graeber’s (2018) argument that socially useless jobs are primarily found in specific occupations. Doing so, it finds that working in one of Graeber’s occupations significantly increases the probability that workers perceive their job as socially useless (compared with all others). This is true for administrative support occupations, sales occupations, business and finance occupations, and managers. Only legal occupations did not show a significant effect as predicted by Graeber’s theory. More detailed analyses even reveal that, of all 21 occupations, Graeber’s occupations are the ones that are most strongly associated with socially useless jobs when other factors are controlled for. This article is therefore the first to find quantitative evidence supporting Graeber’s argument. In addition, this article also confirms existing evidence on various other factors that can explain why people consider their jobs socially useless, including alienation, social interaction and public service motivation.  
>  
>These findings may seem somewhat contradictory to the results of Soffia et al. (2022) who find that Graeber’s theory is not supported by their data. This can be explained by several differences between their study and this one. First, Soffia et al. ask people whether they ‘have the feeling of doing useful work’, while this study asks them whether they think they are making a ‘positive impact on \[their\] community and society’. These differently worded questions may elicit different responses. However, additional analyses show that results do not differ much between these questions (see online supplementary appendix C). Second, Soffia et al. examine data from Europe, while this study uses data from the US. This supports the notion that Graeber’s theory may only apply to heavily financialized Anglo-Saxon countries. Third, the results of Soffia et al. are based on raw distributions over occupations, while the findings presented here are mainly based on regression models that control for various other factors. If only raw distributions are analysed, however, this article also finds only limited support for Graeber’s theory.  
>  
>This article therefore agrees with Soffia et al. (2022) that Graeber’s theory alone cannot explain why people perceive their jobs as socially useless. Instead of rejecting the theory altogether, however, the findings presented here suggest that it merely needs a slight modification. Thus, Graeber claims that people are usually correct in assessing the usefulness of their own jobs. This seems somewhat overstated, as results show that people’s perception is also affected by various factors unrelated to actual usefulness. People may therefore not only consider their jobs to be socially useless because they truly are (Graeber), but also because unfavourable working conditions can sometimes ‘make meaningful work look meaningless’ (Dur and van Lent, 2019: 11). Work perceived as socially useless is therefore a complex phenomenon and should be treated accordingly. By giving up the assumption that people are usually right in their assessment, however, all other aspects of Graeber’s theory can be upheld. Thus, some jobs may in fact be useless to society, even if this is only one reason among others why people perceive them as such.  
>  
>If jobs can be perceived as socially useless for different reasons, this means that different measures can be taken to address the problem. Thus, some workers may benefit from improving working conditions, for example by reducing factors leading to alienation or by increasing social interaction at work. If one considers the possibility that some types of work are inherently useless to society, however, this has entirely different implications. To alleviate this problem, one would have to make adjustments in the economic system and restrict activities with little or no use to society. Graeber himself, for example, proposes a universal basic income that would allow people to decline working in a job that they consider socially useless. Alternatively, policymakers may regulate certain useless or harmful activities and attempt to align them more closely with socially desirable purposes. Frequently discussed examples are a stricter regulation of the financial sector or setting limits to sales strategies (e.g. by banning ads from public spaces) (Inderst and Ottaviani, 2012).",Homme-au-doigt,t2_9ixiwwb3g,39,0,reddit1

It got me wondering, why are so many supposedly smart people spending so much of their valuable time on a conversation with no social value? Or, to the contrary, does their consuming their time in this enterprise tell us that this Reddit conversation is indeed of great social value  ... at least to them?  

For that matter, does Reddit or any other social media have any real value? Obviously, people are spending tens of millions of hours on social media, so it has some value to them.  But think about it ... it doesn't provide anyone with food, clothing, or shelter.  So it has no inherent social value.

The Dallas Cowboys are valued at $6.05 billion.  Really?  Why? What's its social value? The Hope Diamond is worth $250 million? Really? Why?  It's just a hunk of crystallized carbon. My stock broker helped me earn $250,000 in 2018.  Wow! He's really valuable to me. I then gave away all my profits to charity, so he created a great deal of social value. But he lost just as much for me in 2019. Does that mean he had enormous social value one year but none the next?

Or how about all the great inventions of humankind? What was the social value of inventing quantum mechanics, using quantum mechanics to invent the transistor, and using the transistor to build life-saving medical equipment.  Keep in mind though that quantum mechanics was also used to build the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.   

If you can't decide if there's social value in science and inventing, how about art and literature?  What was the social value of writing the Bill of Rights vs. the anti-social value of writing Mein Kampf?

Any economist will tell you that a good or service is only worth whatever people are willing to pay for it.  In that vein, the only real way to know whether a job has any social value is to ascertain whether society sufficiently values it to pay for that job.  If your job doesn't create such value, you'll quickly be laid off or fired.",Nbg2,t2_a6y48sz,-1,0,reddit1

&#x200B;

Here is the actual question people answered to get to this result:

>To measure how workers perceive the social usefulness of their jobs, the AWCS offers two variables. One of them asks respondents how often their work provides them with ‘the feeling of making a positive impact on \[their\] community and society’, the other one how often it provides them with ‘the feeling of doing useful work’. Answers are given on a five-point scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘always’. These two items correspond closely to the variables used in previous studies.

Later its said that any Answer from 1-2 is Useless and 3-5 as Useful for the purpose of this binary answer. So 20% of people answered never or rarely to how often their job makes them feel to have a positive impact on community or society. 

&#x200B;

The study Graeber used to get his 34% figure had a similar question, as in ""Do you think your job makes a meaningful contribution to society"" or something similar. 

&#x200B;

'Socially Useless' is not the same as 'Useless' even if they are related. And I'm not entirely convinced this isn't a case where the question creates its own answer, and not the other way around. 

I can see why people in sales have a really high rating for their uselessness. The job itself is probably not terrible, but the bar to ""Am I making meaningful contributions to the Community here?"" seems quite high.",Daihatschi,t2_o6nqm,1,0,reddit1

jwagtl9,t1_jw8byxw,2023-08-15 14:38:05,science,"Per the methodology, the authors used two responses to questions in a larger survey which asked ""how often their work provides them with ‘the feeling of making a positive impact on [their] community and society’, the other one how often it provides them with ‘the feeling of doing useful work’.""

""Positive impact"" and ""usefulness"" are subjective, of course, and people are going to consider that through a lot of different frames. It could be the most useless job in the world, but if the paycheck lets the person keep paying off their home and afford summer camp for their kids, they may see it as making a positive, useful difference on those grounds. 

Or, maybe something makes them answer negatively when society at large would expect a positive answer. As a personal example, I wouldn't have answered the questions with satisfactory marks for my current position even though my bosses, our clients, and people generally see it as highly meaningful. But from my perspective, I have to advocate too often for solutions that align with my company's and our client's economic incentives and not (necessarily) for the best solutions. To me, that makes it ""bullshit"" even though from the outside most see it as important.

what WILL we do though, realistically? we can't go back to a society based on religion, because all superstition and stories we've told ourselves about the world have been wiped away by the scientific method. 

we now know we are a teensy little speck of dust floating in a seemingly infinite darkness, and that all the evidence points in the direction of life at it's core being completely meaningless, and just fading into nothingness after death. how do you find something to really live for, that you can get behind with your entire being, in a climate like that? 

i don't think it's possible really, not without willingly remaining ignorant, and completely closing yourself off from the rest of the world. 

we'll likely keep consuming entertainment, and now and then some good piece of art will be made, that distracts us from the emptiness for a while. however, i don't think we'll ever really develop another, modern set of religious beliefs. the established ones will continue to provide meaning to those who aren't progressive enough to realize it makes no sense to have faith anymore. 

in a way you could argue that sports events and large concerts and festivals are the new 'religion', but they lack the rituals and spiritual depth that are usually associated with religion. they are ways to bring people together, and to give people that social 'high' from all doing the same thing at the same time, but they can't go beyond that anymore. 

you could argue that those emotions in themselves are enough, and that we should simply worship the inherent mystery of life, now free from the magical component it has had for so many centuries, for it's own sake, and the immense scale of the cosmos that we'll never be able to fully explore.

Even if we're only at the dawn of true technological explosion, this is a turning point in humanity akin to only a few other moments in human history, and none other has occurred so quickly. It's been barely 200 years since the first mechanical computer was invented. Less than that for cars. 120 years since the first plane. 70 since the first supercomputer. We use componets in computers now that are so small that they run the risk of the particles tunnelling to other parts of the component and causing errors.

It's been 50 since Voyager 1 launched and 10 since *all known life* sent an object out of the solar system. That was achieved by humans. Just individual people, with normal lives, working to something great together. Evolutionarily almost identical to a Cave-man throwing a rock, and we learned to throw something so far, it left the solar system. That is beyond words. 

No matter how insightful the people of the past were, no one could have predicted the sheer entirety of such a diverse world and how it developed.

jw8vxv5,t1_jw8hpwe,2023-08-15 05:13:12,science,"I used to be like that when I was younger, but then I educated myself more and stopped caring. The thing is, there's a scientific fact that completely destroys this mindset:
With the way our brains work, we don't have to feel negative emotions when we recognize the fact that life is meaningless. Seriously. A piece of information and emotions attached to it are separate things. That's why the same thing can cause different reactions in two different people. It's not inherent for us to feel negative emotions when we start understanding that life has no meaning.

You might've felt emptiness because there was no emotion associated with the fact that life is meaningless at first, so every time you recalled it, the emptiness overrided whatever you felt before. This thing might've made you think about it too much and you might've even attached negative feelings to it, which lead to you having existential crisis. 

The best course of action is to recognize that life being meaningless is not inherently bad, to stop caring about it and to do some useful stuff. It will be hard to stop caring at first, because your brain will randomly recall this thing. But if you won't pay attention to it, it will eventually go away.

1. Only around 2% of instructions from our client ended in repossession. The majority of the time the borrower had buried their head in the sand and a stern letter from a solicitor was enough to resolve things. For most of the rest, we would help them find an affordable repayment plan.

2. For those where repossession did happen, it's a necessary 'evil' to keep mortgage rates down.

jw92gcz,t1_jw8quuy,2023-08-15 06:26:14,science,"Plus basically every tech company is doing the same thing

It’s all about subscriptions and recurring revenue now. Every single company is getting on that train: Nvidia has GeForce Now, Apple has Apple One, Google has YouTube Premium, Adobe has CC, Amazon has a bunch but the Kindle Unlimited thing is the most interesting ~ they’ve turned reading into a subscription, etc.

We’re in the midst of this wave now & many more companies will hop on board

I think one of the next major ones is video games themselves. Not internal microtransactions but rather the game itself is a subscription. Not for all games, but for some. EA is a huge candidate. Imagine if the Sims was just $30 per month but it included all DLC. Now you’re capturing your rabid fanbase that always purchased every little pack, probably dropping $500-$1000 on the game overall. They’re now going to seemingly pay a bit less, but they’ll end up paying the same if not more *and* they only make up a tiny percentage of the player base. Tons of people play the Sims without many expansions, meaning they’re spending probably $30-$60 on average (sales) & that’s it. Then there’s a huge contingent of people who just don’t play but would if they could have the DLC. A subscription maximizes profit from these two groups, by far and away. People who normally would just pirate the game or ignore it altogether may end up dropping $30 or $60 to play it for a month or two. All this could apply to Madden etc.

Subscriptions are the future for all of tech, and imo a big reason is just that it’s a bit easier to grow a subscription. People don’t really care when Spotify increases their price by $1 per month, even though they’ve basically doubled their price over 5 years. So these companies can grow, and growth is unfortunately viewed as the best indicator of how well a company is performing ~ stagnation is bad

Another benefit are that people just don’t view subscriptions the same as they view one time purchases. $60 game feels worse than $10 subscription for 6 months",relefos,t2_120ode,6,0,reddit1

Evolutionary changes take thousands of years, while our technology is absolutely exploding in speed of development.

This is echoed later by G.K. Chesterton's ""Fence"" which is the about unintended/unaccounted for second order effects.

jwb5jhi,t1_jwazvtf,2023-08-15 17:07:56,science,"I understand the historical influence of calculus on economics, but relying solely on mathematical models can itself be narrow-minded. Calculus is a critical tool to examine insights like marginal analysis, but the core logic of supply, demand, incentives, etc. can be grasped without it.

Calculus based models introduce limitations, assumptions, and simplifications. Oversimplifying human psychology led to flaws in Freudian theory. Likewise, more rigorous math doesn't always mean better economic modeling. Key insights still emerge through verbal and graphical reasoning.

Casting non-calculus perspectives as ignorant or obsolete is dogmatic. Calculus can aid precision, but it also runs the risk of reducing economics to abstract equations detached from human realities. Economic reasoning requires judgment and logical reasoning, not just math skills.

Calculus is a valuable tool but it shouldn't be made an exclusive entry barrier for economic theories. A diversity of perspectives and methodological tools is important. Behavioral economics is one example where calculus is used, but is certainly not foundational in formulating and testing theories.

It's exactly the same process for approval of time off as before. I submit the dates/times I want off to my manager, and he reviewes. I've never had him turn it down.

I'm client facing, so I still need to make sure someone is available to cover me for any emergency that might arise while I'm out. We have a very large department, so this is never a problem. I can easily not schedule meetings when I plan to be out, so my backup essentially has to do nothing unless a client's website explodes, which doesn't really happen.

I've always been salaried, so that's not a meaningful variable. We have scheduled ""core hours"" that we're supposed to mark as when we're available during the work week. This is exactly the same as back when we had PTO. The biggest change is that i no longer have to wait for PTO hours to accrue in order to take time off.  It was a major pain in the ass to budget PTO. I don't have to do that anymore. Before, I had something like 3 weeks of vacation. I'm easily on track to surpass that. I don't care about getting no longer getting paid out on PTO, because I was always always going to use all of it anyway. So long as I take more than 21 days off this year, it was a win.",AbeRego,t2_6xz07,2,0,reddit1

jwdmany,t1_jwdbjsp,2023-08-16 02:36:36,science,"This is so American it's painful. 

Sounds like you didn't really have access to your PTO previously. I know lots of jobs do that, and that sucks.

But It's straight up not unlimited at all. It's whatever your boss feels like allowing. And you have to do extra work to get any time off. If that counts, I just got an 8 day vacation without even using any PTO. If you count doing extra work before and after I can get 17 days off with just 2 PTO days. I've taken several 6 to 8 day long trips already this year.

Sounds decent for you specifically, but that's having a nice boss and a job that's not particularly demanding. Plenty of salaried jobs have workloads that prevent ever getting a week or two ahead. And you can't be unaware that plenty of managers out there won't just approve every request.

Not remotely comparable to the places where you get 4-6 weeks vacation where you just leave and your work duties aren't your problem when you're gone.

I'm just an hourly hospital employee in the US, but I have enough PTO left this year to take a three week trip. Unlimited PTO sounds like a scam to me.",couldbemage,t2_yuibp,1,0,reddit1

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the hospitality industry lost nearly 8 million hospitality jobs were lost, making it the hardest-hit industry in the U.S. by the pandemic in terms of workforce reduction. 

“I don’t think any industry was prepared, but the hospitality industry really wasn’t prepared,” said Juan Madera, the Curtis L. Carlson endowed professor at Hilton College. “Their solution to cutting costs and saving the business was to let people go and then try to rehire them when it was over.”

Charging you extra for daily room cleaning would be consistent with trying to discourage you from asking for all your sheets and towels to be replaced every day, which wastes hundreds of gallons of water and a ton of electricity on a daily basis if most guests in the hotel are opting for it. It also encourages guests to clean their own messes/limit the amount of mess they generate in the first place, which hopefully makes it easier on cleaning staff.

j1s4jrm,t1_j1rnfyr,2022-12-26 23:39:30,science,"I disagree to an extent.

Currently tips are not seen as optional in US culture.  They are seen as an expected part of the cost when dining at a restaurant with service. Most places even include recommended tipping amounts. Some will even auto include tips for larger parties and have tricky invoices making it confusing that this is occuring hoping you give an additional tip.

Nobody I know feels tipping is optional and will always give at latest 15% tip unless service was atrocious.

Servers get paid at least minimum wage.  This is accomplished but the restaurant paying a minimum of 2.13 dollars an hour and the rest of the minimum wage is covered by tips. If tips fail to hit minimum wage of 7.25, then restaurant must cover the rest.

https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped

If a state has a higher minimum wage then that applies.

This is why they can keep the server for a bit extra if enough tips come in. It's also why restaurants like to pool tips because it helps reduce costs for the restaurant.

Tipping is part of a real salary subsidized by patrons.

The reason why servers have it rough is because their income can be higher during peak times or working at places that have patrons willing to tip more.  I could work a weekday shift for 10 hours and get paid far less compared to a weekend shift working 10 hours. However the cooks don't get any tips and as a patron I can't give them a tip for a great meal that had horrible service. Likewise, the server gets screwed off the cook messes up the order because the patron only tips the server.

I think what you mean to say it's that everyone should be paid a living wage and tipping should be ended. Keep in mind not everyone likes the idea of tipping ending because it allows them to get incredible hourly rates of they work at peak times or in areas where people tip well. Restaurants don't like it because they rather have lower prices on food and subsidize employee wages with tips.

The other ""fear"" is losing some power over the wait staff with the lure of a good tip. Personally I think tipping should end, prices should increase to compensate and wait staff shouod be paid appropriately (at least a livable wage).",Adventurous-Text-680,t2_ebbrnpsx,4,0,reddit2

You can go to any major metro and ordering hundreds of dollars of food might be a basic meal for four people.  The demands could be swapping out some sides and making requests to refill drinks.

The same meal at a restaurant with cheaper food results in a cheaper tip with the exact same work being done by the wait staff.  Even at the same restaurant. The group ordering mixed drinks and expensive steak and seafood will pay a higher tip compared to the same group ordering the chicken fingers with water.

You can have a different experience depending on how crowded the restaurant is.  I have been to empty restaurants where I waited upwards of 30 minutes after being seated before someone came by to take my order.  The reason? The wait staff was chatting and didn't realize we had been seated.  On crowded days I have had great experiences but also sometimes got cold food because not enough staff was working due to an unexpected surge.  It's a very rough industry. These types of bad experiences dont always affect my tipping because I understand the difficulty. Technically when I get bad service a should not give any tip regardless if it's due to being crowded or not. However I still tip because of social conditioning.

I feel tipping should actually be only for when you get excellent service. Currently I can't do this because it is unfair to the wait staff.  I really wish the rules for restaurants would change so they would be forced to pay proper wages, but I think it won't happen because it helps restaurants by letting customers subsidize pay.

Sure for me, it's a moral quandary because legally we don't need to tip but society pushes the mantra ""tips insure proper service"".

However overall nobody is being paid less than minimum wage. The problem is that minimum wage is not a livable wage in most places.  Further complications come with people working harder shifts doing more work but their pay (tips) gets shared with people working ""easier"" shifts with less customers.

Working extra hours after the restaurant is closed eats into your pay greatly. It's almost like reverse overtime and it's horrible.  However my main point was that the main issue is that all servers are being paid at least minimum wage. Not saying that it's fair or correct, and certainly don't agree it's a livable wage.  The only thing that bothers me is that people saying they are being paid 2 dollars an hour. They are not, and if they are not earning minimum wage based on pay over hours then they need to find a lawyer and file a closing complaint with the department of labor. It's illegal.

I fully support going towards a tipless based rate for servers. It's better for everyone.  Customers have a better idea of the real cost and servers will have a better idea of the pay.

j1t38nt,t1_j1suus0,2022-12-27 04:26:32,science,"I never said that servers were paid below minimum wage. 

I used to be a server, I made the $2.13 - $2.65 that servers in WV make. My paychecks either were nothing because I’d made so much in tips my hourly wage from the restaurant of $2.13 went towards taxes, or my paycheck was at most around $20. 

The restaurant is required to ensure that servers make at least minimum wage but they are allowed to pay servers less than minimum wage - the $2.13-65 so long as the server is making the difference in tips tho it’s not on an hourly basis. 

There were plenty of times when I opened or closed and worked for an hour without taking a table but the restaurant itself doesn’t have to actually pay me more than $2.13-65 so long as I make enough in tips during the rest of my shift. 

In this example the first shift I open and work an hour with no tables, the second hour I have a few tables and make $12 then the restaurant is going to average that and only pay me $2.13-65 for both hours. Yes my tips have made up the difference but the restaurant is able to technically pay me below the state minimum wage of $8.75 for the hour I spent opening without a table. 

I could have an entire shift where I don’t have a single table, but if during a different shift I have an hour where I get a big tip the restaurant can use that money to average out the previous shift and still pay me the lower wage.

j1ujv2u,t1_j1t2hef,2022-12-27 14:41:44,science,"Many states have a “server’s minimum wage”,  which is less than the minimum wage. Either way, I have never heard of a restaurant that didn’t pay their servers more than the minimum wage, which is why tips are so crucial to waiters’ incomes.  

It’s common for waiters to get paid their minimum wage or servers minimum check that amounts to $0.00, with 100% taken out for payroll of course, this amount may total $20 or $40 in withholdings so there’s still a lot of taxes to be world. 

As unpleasant a reality may be that people get paid minimum wage or less through servers loopholes, it the way it is.  Your insistence that they’re not only reflects your lack of experience in the industry. It’s legal, and even if it wasn’t, waiters aren’t in a class that has labor lawyers retained to sue their employers.  Working as a waiter is sometimes one of the few options someone might have in getting a chance at decent money, but it’s also why workers are leaving the industry in droves.  It’s not that people don’t want to work, it’s that they’re fed up with working under those conditions.

EDIT-my spouse has bartended at a music venue for years, it’s sporadic and varies in intensity from events of a few hundred in attendance to kore than a thousand. When she works the big events, it’s grueling, hard labor and the higher tip threshold makes it more worthwhile. Management has just announced they want a tip-free space, but the wage they have set would be equivalent to the income from smaller, quiet events, and the bigger, grueling events won’t be rewarded with better money.  Management’s stated intent is that the non-service people, like security and maintenance, are paid unfairly because they aren’t tipped as well. But rather than the venue giving these workers a raise, they’re just putting a ceiling on how much bartenders can make. The crowd, by the way, is usually affluent, and are not required to tip at the bar, but they do. So the venue is posturing an equality stance on labor, but are actually taking away pay from the bartenders (which as at no cost to the venue) instead of raising the pay of the other employees, which would be at their expense. But as the venue makes a $10+ markup on every beer sold, they could easily afford it. 

No tipping establishments sound good, but they usually just put a low ceiling on what servers can make. Restaurants are used to paying virtually nothing for their waitstaff, paying them a base of above the minimum wage, but still allowing tips, is the way to go. But as restaurants will even deduct a few bucks a week for family meal (staff meal before the beginning of the service that’s usually something rudimentary baked on a sheetpan), they are already of the attitude of being cheap with their staff. And so the exodus away from the service industry continues.",CanineAnaconda,t2_ahywpw4m,1,0,reddit2
j1vfda1,t1_j1ujv2u,2022-12-27 18:18:55,science,"I agree, it's a raw deal however federally you must earn at least 7.25 per hour no matter what the wait staff hourly rate is.  Tips are used to subsidize this. Legally employees should be talking with the department of labor and a lawyer because employers love to take advantage of people. 

An example.  Let's say you are working an hourly job and they have you clock out before doing some cleaning.  That's illegal.  The job makes you sit in the parking lot for an hour because you are ""on call"" add that aren't sure if they need you? That's illegal.

The problem is that most people don't want to rock the boat because they are afraid of losing the job to someone willing to be abused. Most states are at will do you can be fired for no reason and it's unfortunate when being abused.

I have seen hourly employees in media companies clock out for lunch and then work through lunch.  I have seen salaried employees working after hours multiple days a week, sometimes as late as 1AM (usually because an issue happened at 10pm) but expected to sell show up at 9AM to the office. However the consultants were explicitly told not work such hours because it cost extra.  

Eventually the team decided as a group to no longer take those calls anymore and forced management to address the root cause by prioritizing fixing the bugs in the software. This was successful because you can't just hire anyone to do the job the team was doing and the issues were eventually fixed so no need to have late night after hours calls. Practically speaking hourly employees were pushed to do work off the clock and salaried were pushed to work after hours so hourly folks weren't waiting during core hours.  

I no longer work there because it was crazy, but not everyone has the freedom to switch away from a toxic work environment.  This is especially true for ""low skill"" jobs like the service industry where plenty of people are desperate and willing to take abuse for a paycheck because they see the job as a temporary pain until something better comes along.

The reality is that either well paid service workers will be taking a pay cut to give better pay to their coworkers or some people will simply be paid the minimum wage.  You simply can't have it both ways because revenue isn't really changing for the restaurant unless you have surge pricing with surge pay.  Though that would effectively cause customers to go elsewhere.

It's a very complex problem because you can't make everyone happy. Either the people working crappy shifts get crap pay while hard shifts get better pay or everyone gets similar pay hurting those who work hard shifts.",Adventurous-Text-680,t2_ebbrnpsx,1,0,reddit2

When someone interrupts her, remind them that she was talking and that you want to hear the conclusion. All it takes is for one man to do this. It also works almost as well when another woman with clout does it to.

He also watches out for things that can marginalize women, such as people expecting the woman on the team to schedule meetings or take notes, or interrupting them, or being more harsh to a woman who is assertive than they would with a man.

He encourages us to push back on that ourselves and not always say 'yes' to that kind of stuff, especially when it starts to become a habit. I never feel like I'm anything but an equal member of our team, and he's a big reason for that.

For example, is it fair that someone from a wealthy family has more opportunities than someone from a poor family? Your instinct is probably to say ""no that isn't fair"". But equally, if someone has worked hard to provide for their family and give their children as much opporuntiy as possible, is it fair to take that away because someone elses family didn't or couldn't?  


Basically, it's way more nuanced than it seems to make things as fair as possible because everyone will have a different idea of what is fair and how to make it more fair.

Everyone is absolutely correct that a statement like this, delivered randomly and robotically, would be off-putting. However, do people not chat with their coworkers? Do people not have the ability to casually interact with each other in a natural manner? 

I'm a woman working in tech, and in my experience this post is absolutely correct. I know I can trust and respect a dude when they make a joke that indicates they are feminist, or make a comment that implies gender equality is important to them, or that toxic masculinity is funny to them.  

One example was a guy who made a joke about an old creepy guy who used to work there who made gross comments to young women (the joke was derogatory towards the creepy guy, not minimizing his behavior.) I immediately felt more comfortable with him. Later on I had an issue with a different guy saying to me ""hopefully you will get naked"" at an upcoming company retreat that involved a beach, totally unprompted, I had just asked if he planned on going. He was on the same team as the guy who ""revealed"" himself to be an ally, so I asked the ally guy to have a talk with harassment guy. He did, and I never had a single issue with harassment guy again, even though we worked together for years after that. Didn't involve HR or anything. Male allies are useful.

Edit: Definitely don't force this in to conversations if it doesn't feel natural. But if you're a dude and you notice someone being sexist in a meeting, maybe make a comment about it later, ask a female coworker something like ""was that weird/creepy/inappropriate or is it just me?""

h8yqcua,t1_h8ye7yg,2021-08-14 22:40:29,science,"I wanna try and address this ""treat me normal"" vs. ""unique"" issue. I'm going to use a metaphor I once saw in a comic. This boils down to equality vs. equity.

Say you want to watch a baseball game but a fence is in your way (let's ignore the whole ticket/admission aspect, we're just focusing on how to watch the game by solving the fence problem). **Equality** would be handing everyone the same size step stool. However, not everyone is the same height. While the given step stool may be enough for some, it might only be just enough for others, and in the worst case not enough at all.

Now, using the metaphor to compare to any slice of inequality in the world (such as employment opportunities), there is of course always going to be some level of disparity in opportunities, ones that are completely fair and valid. There are, however, certain inequalities that arise systemically which is what the height gap in this Fence Metaphor represents.

So, if we're looking to address the baked-in inequalities (the height differences)...well turns out we need to give everyone different sized step stools. This is equity and the part that looks like wanting special treatment or to be ""treated uniquely."" If you're looking purely at the tool/accommodation being requested, yes, different treatment is being requested. However, that's only looking one layer deep at the problem; the real problem being solved is how to get everyone able to watch the game. 

The Equality that is desired is equal viewing height. To counteract existing inequalities (height difference), a ""counter-inequality"" in the size of the step stool is necessary to create that equal outcome. Equity.",EffortlessFury,t2_64d9n,-1,0,reddit3

h90fnue,t1_h8ygxof,2021-08-15 09:01:05,science,"Agreed. In fact, I didn't even noticed that I was a feminist myself until a girl I met pointed it out.

When I met this girl, she was talking about feminism with a random group of people (it was a MUN conference, so that was pretty common). I agreed with some things and disagreed with some, but made sure to listen to all of her arguments and didn't try to argue that they were wrong nor that she was wrong. If my female friends' feminism hadn't been able to change my mind, then of course I wouldn't be able to change hers. 

When the group eventually dissipated and we ended up alone, I told her I thought that maybe I was somewhat sexist because I didn't agree with most of the mainstream ideas of feminism.

However, she told me that I was acting the way she imagined a man should act. Listening to what she had to say, arguing respectfully and simply treating her as an equal. That day I noticed how simple gender equality (and all equality, honestly) really is, and completely changed my concept of what being ""inclusive"" meant.

This may be uncomfortable for some people to hear or understand but wherever there is a winner there has to be a loser. You or I or whoever have nice things because other people somewhere don't.  


And by that I don't mean that someone *needs* to be exploited for my gain (though that is often the case somewhere along the line) and it doesn't mean they are necessarily unhappy either, but more that wherever there is a luxury or a limited resource, relative economic strength is what separates the haves from the have nots in most cases.   


This is true for material possessions like your car, the latest smart phone, designer clothes, or even things less tangible like education and social technology, or even something as simple as having more family time.  


Looking at it from an individualistic point of view, it makes sense to ask why children are treated as extensions of their families but what parent would not want their children to have a better chance of success?  


That's not to say that I think people should suffer due to poverty, sexism, racism but returning to my original point, if you disconnect something like familial wealth/advancement from a child, then while it may give a more equal footing for each child in general who gets to say that it is or when it is fair?

h8yw4iv,t1_h8yq9ux,2021-08-14 23:28:04,science,"The reason why saying ""I don't see XYZ"" is bad is because it ignores the existing and past issues that effect people.

Let's like the Blizzard lawsuit for example. 

One of the big reasons why the Blizzard situation came about was due to gender disparities and a sexist work culture that was further perpetuated by all male leadership. Literal cube crawls where male Co workers would go cubicle to cubicle harassing female employees. As well as denying female employees from raises or promotions based on gender. 

If post lawsuit the new administration came in and fired all the bad actors that previously worked there but did nothing else to improve the company culture other than stating that hiring will now be ""genderless"" that would be an example of ignoring previous and present issues, ie. ""I don't see gender"". 

Men are still far more likely to look for employment at gaming companies like Blizzard, and the gender disparity was one of the root problems. Even if they removed the names from resumes during the hiring process this problem would persist. 

However, if Blizzard made an effort to recruit more women and create a more balanced workforce, that would go a long way to mend company culture. There are plenty of women who have similar qualifications as men, and they will certainly do better than their drunk male co-workers. (Men at Blizzard have a history of showing up to work drunk, probably explains all their new games.)

They could also hire women into positions of power due to their history of not promoting women based on gender, as well as appoint HR that will actually take complaints seriously. 

Basically, there are many situations in life where you have to take people's inherit traits into account. Simply saying ""I don't see XYZ"" doesn't fix the problem, it pretends the problem no longer exists.

h8z4zm3,t1_h8yqcua,2021-08-15 00:43:13,science,"The best simple analogy for equity/equality I've heard is this:

A city government wants to encourage people to be healthier and clean up the environment, so they ban cars from the city streets, but provide every citizen with a bicycle to encourage exercise and reduce pollution.

In an ""equal"" city, they will take the average height and build of every citizen and build the perfectly average bike. Everyone gets that bike. For people who are close to average and able-bodies, they get a bike they can ride. For people who are shorter or taller than average, they can make simple modifications to ride their bike, but for a lot of people, that bike just doesn't help them. The person with an amputated leg can't use a standard bike, for example, and children get an adult's bike that doesn't fit them. And for others, there is a bigger burden to using the bike. Maybe they never learned and they need to spend the time and effort to learn how to ride. Or maybe they have a back problem and they can't bike for very long, or doing so causes them pain. This is an ""equal solution"" to the problem. The same amount of time and energy and money was spent on each person. The average person says ""this is fair"", but most people are unhappy.

Equity would be this: Each person gets a bike they can ride safely and happily and exceptions are made for those who cannot ride a bike. This means the children get a child-size bike, the person with a bad back might get a recumbent bike or an exception to drive a car or a free bus pass, the city holds free bike-riding classes for those who don't know how to ride, etc. The average person goes ""wait, this isn't fair, I just got a normal bike, why does the amputee get a special bike? Why is the city spending more money on other people and not me?"", but the majority of people get a solution that works for them.

The sticking point is that it's very true that governments just don't have the time and resources to make every situation perfectly equitable for every single person, which is an easy argument for people to use to say equity is impossible and we shouldn't try.

The main issue I see is that it doesn’t seem to tackle the root causes of these “height” gaps and assumes that these groups can’t “grow”. Simply providing a higher starting point is never gonna solve the root issues like lack of educational funding, prison-industrial complexes, societal perceptions, and on and on and instead pushes the burden of higher barriers on groups that are currently succeeding (which is also composed of many minority groups). 

This line of thinking also tends to push overly empathetic approaches to a competitive endeavor (career progression) instead of fundamental changes at the social, political, and educational level.  We can recognize the danger of advantaging certain underrepresented groups extremely well in some areas of society like athletics. It wouldn’t make sense for Asian or Hispanic men to have an easier draft into the NBA or NFL simply because of their lack of representation. And yet we push policies of race or gender based admissions to school or work all the time with no thought of the social consequence of these policies. 

Lowering the bar for disadvantaged groups naturally leads to resentment, particularly within those from “taller” groups yet horribly impoverished backgrounds.

""*Actually* have something to fear,"" is an interesting qualifier, in that it means you are actually referring to a level of statistical risk, not a level of emotional fear - after all, a person can be legitimately terrified of something that poses no *actual* threat to them, right?

So really, what your first sentence is saying, is that if you are accused of sexual assault/harassment, it's about 49x more likely that the accusation is legit, than that it's fabricated (using the 2% false acc rate from something you linked somewhere else).

However, in making the logical jump from there to your third sentence, you equate the *emotion* of fear with the *statistical state* of ""actually having something to fear"".

Point is at least some men saying, ""I won't work with women because they could say I was inappropriate,"" are afraid because our culture/media/whatever blows the odds of being falsely accused of being inappropriate entirely out of proportion, not because they are *actually* at risk of being accused.

It doesn’t really apply to other races but the law was needed to help protect a specific group of people.

You can categorize human beings according to hundreds of features. Eye color, favorite sports team, hairiness, propensity to like Brussel sprouts.

The present question is how important certain categories are.

I suppose when it comes to an occupation like engineer, people perhaps really shouldn't care that much about skin tone or what makes the person horny.

But who knows. The counter argument of the religious left-leaning team suggests that there might be a problem if the team of engineers who are designing your railway aren't equal proportions black/white/asian and ""likes vagina"" / ""likes penis"" / ""likes both"" according to the precise proportion found in the general population.

So there is a hint of absurdity in wondering - between the meetings about physics, and building materials, and contracts and such - about which genitalia that your team of mathematically proficient analysts prefer to put in their mouths, if any. And that we are urged to do such an accounting as a moral imperative. Not that it's too absurd but that it just might be a little absurd. That perhaps we should just focus on the business of making sure the buildings don't collapse.

Sure, there could be discrimination lingering based on those silly features that mean relatively little. But, this can be addressed by that same common sense imperative. That we simply focus on the business of making sure the buildings don't collapse.

However in 2021 this sentiment might get you exiled as heretic. Hence the current prevalence of clueless and frightened managers foreswearing their allegiance the proper God by saying, out of nowhere, relevant to nothing ""Golly it sure is GREAT to see so many EMPOWERED FEMALE engineers around here!"" to the surprise cringe of all engineers in the room, male and female, who are simply there for the business of making sure the building's don't collapse.

Yes, you can observe that your coworker has boobs, and is Hispanic. But this typically doesn't matter all that much in the professional sense. UNLESS there is some war in which we must make sure that the boobiness of the employees are equal to the boobiness of the general population. (And so on and so forth).

Have you ever seen a product that passed through a company all the way to being released and somehow no one noticed the really glaring problem with it?  Having everyone in the company be the same racially, sexuality-wise, gender-wise, etc, with “the best” skill set, means you get products like that, because they all saw it the same way.  When you have a diverse group, even if it’s at a slight disadvantage in skill set (which isn’t even always a thing, but we’re talking as if for whatever reason only cishet white men were the best skill set wise), you don’t run into nearly as many problems where the finished product just completely misses the mark entirely.  


For a quick example, it’s really obvious that facebook doesn’t have any blind developers because they force pushed out a feature to groups awhile back where it reformatted posts automatically into being “question” posts.  And for whatever reason, the question posts just completely broke with every screen reader I heard about.  So for awhile, anyone blind on facebook just couldn’t really exist in groups because these posts just didn’t work at all, and they were being made without people setting their post to be a question post, and they didn’t even have good logic as to what posts became a “question”.  Sometimes posts without a single ? were still made question posts for some reason even.  If their dev team or testers had blind workers, or even just, people who tested with screen readers, they would have absolutely never pushed that update because it completely just, broke everything.  As it stands now, the question posts still break with screen readers, they just have made it possible to turn off the automatic question posts.",TGotAReddit,t2_10goi9wo,1,0,reddit3

Let's look at this passage

>For instance, one study analyzed 31 separate two-part conversations, 10 of which were between two men, 10 of which were between two women, and 11 of which were between a man and a woman.  The researchers identified seven interruptions overall in the two same-sex groups combined; in themale-female groups, however, the researchers found 48 total interruptions—and 46 of them were instigated by the man.

I made the miniscule effort to actually click on the link and read the study. It says that interruptions happened in 3 of the 20 same-sex segments, and 2 out of the 7 interruptions were done by women, but in 10 of the 11 mixed-sex segments somebody was interrupted, and as the quote states, 46 out of those 48 interruptions were done by men. Let's do the maths

* 55 interruptions
* 46 done by men targeted at women
* 5 done by men targeted at men
* 2 done by women targeted at women
* 2 done by women targeted at men

And you say women are the problem? That's ... almost cute.

In this study, women treated men and women the same, while men, for some reason I cannot *fully* fathom, decided to interrupt women about 9 times as much as they interrupted men; or rather almost all of them did it, while only one or two interrupted another man. And going from the content of the conversations they clearly did understand the flow of the conversation and its turn-taking behaviour; it just was that they were unhappy with where it was going, so they interrupted.

And as the other person wrote, there's copious research on how women are treated if they object to these interruptions.",hanikamiya,t2_jzdih,1,0,reddit3

It’s always not always necessarily a negative thing, although it can be. It depends on a case by case basis. We also don’t need to necessarily make normative statements about whether gender disparities are good or bad, but we can acknowledge they exist and any inquisitive mind would be interested to investigate why those disparities exist and if perhaps there are things we can improve to create more equality of opportunity for everyone. 

You’ll find that even in Nordic countries, you’ll still have large gaps in for example the representation of women in leading positions and women far more frequently working in far less profitable fields than men. Again, these are interesting areas for questions and research. What are the causes of that? What are the implications for the fact that “female labor” is generally undervalued on the market compared to “male labor”? We can ask and investigate questions like these without turning it into a ridiculous reactionary “men vs women” thing that these kinds of comment sections always devolve into.

Yeah, that's absolutely a bad hiring pratice. No one needs a hard-working genius, who can't accept authorities or their team members. No one needs a very capable and sociable person, who sits around all day. A good manager would always hire someone who is mediocre in all of those aspects over someone who only excels in specific situations. In fact, many people who climbed very high up a company ladder have massive problems when trying to find another job, because they are absolutely overqualified, simply bc it's much harder to integrate these people, without them getting frustrated. Even if they are really good, sociable and work a lot.

My uncle owns a hospital and while they have a very diverse group of doctors, it's extremely hard to even find male nurses and the ones who get hired have very big problems, integrating themselves in a group, only consisting of women and usually end up quitting within the same year. My gpa is a engineering professor with like 60%-70% women in his classes, with very similar grades as the men. We had 10% tops in physics, a couple of years ago who were all extremely capable. I don't think a single woman failed the first semester, while 40% of men did. You have to take these things into account, in the hiring process.

Because we don't need them if there are general programs available, which I'm sure there are given the side-step with that response.

The general programs are our programs, by and large. The goals of those tend to be more individualistic in nature than the ones you're taking issue with. The group-specific programs are meant to address wider and well documented trends (through individual advancement) as they relate to hiring and advancing historically marginalized groups. It contains a wider goal. We (white men) don't have a history of being ignored for any and all programs, promotions, raises, etc. due to our race or gender because we've *always* been the default in the US, hence the extremely minor correction like development programs specific to historically marginalized groups. We have exactly zero need for a program that's specific to us for that reason. Ideally, all groups will get to this point eventually.

Focusing solely on your specific job ignores the very real reasons why programs like that exist in the first place even if you're a ""minority"" in the small context of the job you currently work. 

I understand the gut reaction of thinking this is somehow an affront to us because of race, but if you dive into the history of prejudice and problematic thinking that has made the response of programs like those largely helpful it's hard to take issue with.

On the other hand, these studies seem to only be counting when an individual comes forward to the *police* and makes a false statement. This feels quite disingenuous when you are also trying to point out how few sexual assaults get reported to the police. If you want to count that statistic, you also need to account for how many false rumors get spread about sexual assaults having occurred, how many false accusations are only ever reported to college administrations and handled internally under Title IX, and how many false accusations are made exclusively to internal corporate HR departments. Those are rarely ever investigated thoroughly, and they are the things that lead to job loss, academic expulsion, and becoming a social pariah. Their chances of happening have absolutely no bearing on whether or not the allegation was ever reported to the police.

I think you are owed the same respect as women in your workplace get.  And I also think you deserve to be treated with human decency which is basically all this study is talking about.

As a business owner I would want all my employees to feel comfortable in their workplace without fear of harassment or isolation and this information would probably make me want to encourage my supervisors to reach out to all new hires to explain that equality is a core value of the company since it actually can improve the well being of someone.",rougecrayon,t2_eigyw,0,0,reddit3

> Second, **this study cannot account for causal relationships between gratitude reception, satisfaction with
care, and physical health.** While other studies have
examined the temporal precedence between trait gratitude and psychology well-being (e.g. Wood, Maltby,
Gillett, Linley, & Joseph, 2008) as well as subjective wellbeing and health (Feist, Bodner, Jacobs, Miles, & Tan,
1995), we based our hypotheses on theory and empirical evidence suggesting the current directional model
within the context of nursing.

The reason seems to be because the only thing they actually did was send out surveys. I'm not too familiar with psych jargon, but it looks like they consider how individual participants results vary over the time of the survey, but it's hard for me to point what actually speaks to that.

They also describe how more in depth their survey *could* be, which would give better results (and they didn't do this, because of the risk ""participant fatigue"", especially since the surveys were administered over 3 months).

So other obvious questions: When a nurse writes in they they were thanked during a shift, what does that mean to individuals? Does the genuine nature of the thanks matter? Often when I ""thank"" service-people, it feels forced on my behalf and unnatural. I think people are smart enough to pick on the difference between ""yeah thanks"" being said in a situation where it is mandated or expected vs a genuine ""thank you!"" from someone who really feels like you excelled or went beyond for. I think is tied in with what you said, where being a bad mood might also make you more cynical of the ""thanks"" you get and might affect reporting. This is likely covered in other literature about gratitude, however.",zenthr,t2_98hqw,1,0,reddit4

It may well be that the effect of patient appreciation is much different from the effect of appreciation from management.

First of all, it's ~350 undergraduates from the school that were studied. Selection bias possibly uncorrelated with working populations.

Second the task on which ""productivity"" was measured was a scavenger hunt style game where the team follows clues and can split up to go find landmarks. Not sure how representative of a task this is in terms of normal workplace tasks and the skills involved. Not to mention that this sort of effect is probably highly task dependent and only one type of task is measured. And on that same note, video games were used as a team building activity, but they are not compared against other types of team building activities.

Thirdly, PRODUCTIVITY is not measured - only absolute performance on the task is reported as increased AFTER, BUT NOT INCLUDING the 45 min video game playing time. They had some control groups that just did unrelated homework for 45 min prior to the task, and a group that was told to plan for the task for 45 min before doing it, but they had no groups that were allowed to work on the task for the full time period including this 45 min. It's severely disingenuous to talk about games increasing productivity without counting the time playing games... And even further - there is no attempt to study how long or short lived this ""productivity"" boost lasts.

And lastly, in this study making claims about workplace application, they openly admit they are using a bad sample population. In the workplace, teams will be familiar with each other for a majority of their work. While this study has teams of people where no one knows each other and they come together for one brief task. This ""study"" is better suited to making claims about college ice breakers than it is about workplace productivity - and it doesn't even do a particularly good job at that.

They also mentioned the Findamine task as a potential limitation of the study, as it might not correlate to tasks in all office environments.

Did the other works actually measure some type of actual productivity, or other poor proxies for office productivity? My guess is their proxies overemphasize the effect of team cohesion, at least in respect to office work. Office work is 10% meeting, 90% sitting in your own cubicle. Yes, you absolutely have to coordinate with everyone else on the team - but you do almost all of the actual work on your own.

We don't run a ton of fire but we do participate in training and PT in our gear every shift. Numerous studies have confirmed firefighters are diagnosed with cancer (substantially) more than the general population. (Forgive my lack of sources to cite). 

This article is now bringing new concerns that contributing factors may not be just the carcinogenic byproducts of fire like hydrogen cyanide and phosgene, or the fumes from running the trucks and equipment, but from components of the gear itself. 

We all take great pride in washing our gear after fires (running it through commercial extractors designed for gear), as well as swapping our hood since it hangs out over the sensitive skin right in front of your thyroid. We also wash our gear every few shifts when it gets rank and nasty from sweating in it. If these chemical components to the gear are contributing to cancer washing won't help. 

I know your time is valuable but I'd love to hear your thoughts on both this article and this issue. I'm a 38 year old mom to three daughters and want to live a long time. I'm usually not terribly worried about the hazards we face but this one is really bothering me. Thanks!

dg4awli,t3_64qgqe,2017-04-11 14:13:08,science,"Let me ask a question that's been bothering me for months. When I was living in my last apartment, I got sick. Cloudy headed, confused, a bit dizzy, internal swelling, and high anxiety. It got so bad that I went to the ER at one point, and another doctor for a full physical. Both told me at the time that there was no medical reason for me to be there, and per all the tests that they ran, I was just fine. 

I did feel better for awhile after that. Then, about a month later the feeling returned; less intense, but longer lasting. I stayed in bed for another couple weeks. In the midst of all this, I came to discover that the apartment I was staying in had massive amounts of water damage behind the ceiling and walls. I began to research autoimmune disorders associated with toxic mold exposure, theorized that my neurological and autoimmune symptoms may be caused by this and moved out.

I left everything I owned behind and started from scratch. I moved into the newest, nicest building in my city, and started a regimen of supplements including: Turmeric, Magnesium, and Fish Oil. I also stuck to the Paleo-diet for awhile, and after a few weeks of this, my symptoms started to disappear.

First, the vertigo went away. Then, the confusion and anxiety got much better. Fast forward to now, two months later, and I'm ultimately feeling much better than I was. I still don't quite feel %100, but I theorize that it's mostly in my head now. 

So, my question is, how likely is it that I hit the nail on the head here and self-diagnosed appropriately? I know that this might not be your main study in your field but I don't know where else to turn. Other than the occasional cold and flu, (and even those sparingly) I've never been sick in my life. I feel like the slight brain-fog I still feel may be brought on by the stress of not knowing for sure. I felt so bad for awhile, I started to wonder if I didn't have a terminal illness, and it didn't make any sense to me that the doctors I visited always told me there was nothing wrong. So, yeah, what do you think? This might be the only chance I have to speak with someone who may know anything about this even remotely. Did I get it right?

A maintenance worker was there and I asked if they had a lot of precautions to reduce the risk of cancer, he got a serious look on his face and asked to talk to me later.

He came by the lab, said he didn't want to talk in front of my boss. He asked if it sounded strange that 3 people in the same department all died from liver cancer within a year of each other. Being a diligent chemist in my 1st job I researched it and found out they were using carbon tetrachloride and training people not to use gloves when removing parts as it took longer. When I presented this to my boss he told me that the company pays my check and I needed to drop it.

Of course, that didn't happen. I contacted the lead toxicologist from corporate who flew in the next day and took care of things. I also quit my job, couldn't deal with that mentality. Just wanted to say, I'm very happy for people like you.",Slammy1,t2_aj0h1,8,0,reddit2

dg4bpcb,t3_64qgqe,2017-04-11 14:29:25,science,"Greetings! Thank you for doing an AMA.

I do some limited work with my job (with a major museum) vetting cleaning chemicals for use in our facilities, and one of the biggest issues I find I have to repeatedly explain to people is that while ""green"" might mean ""not harmful to the environment"", it doesn't mean ""not harmful to people,"" and many certified green products are still carcinogens, sensitizers, or otherwise associated with human health hazards. In particular, I often reference the EPA's ""Safer Choice"" program, in which amongst the fragrances (for example), only 5 certified Safer Choice chemicals were listed as low concern, while 117 were listed as hazardous, but included because they were still better than other things in their class.

Has there been any sort of push mirroring the ""Green"" programs or the ""Safer Choice"" program that fully focuses on danger to humans? Some sort of program or certification where only products assessed fully as low risk are certified, as opposed to those which might be dangerous but are just slightly less dangerous than even worse things? With millions of visitors per year, and millions of artifacts in the building, we have to do a careful dance to find things that we feel are acceptable for use.

As a follow on, with the significant current political threat to the EPA's ongoing function and existence, is there a third party organization of sufficient size and clout that, in your opinion, is a viable alternative for things like Safer Choice testing, and which can push the household chemical industry in a human-safe direction? What do you foresee as the near future of chemical safety regulation in the US? Do you know if OSHA is facing similar attacks as EPA, endangering the safety regulations that protect workers from chemical hazards in their places of employment?

Thank you again for sharing your knowledge with us!",keplar,t2_5vat7,3,0,reddit2

dg4aklv,t3_64qgqe,2017-04-11 14:06:01,science,"I work in healthcare and was wondering what the current thinking is around certain medical waste exposures.  
It is common practice where I work for patients recovering in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) to wear a standard simple oxygen mask while awakening after surgery.  The mask has side-vents for exhalation out of the mask and into the room air, and a plastic oxygen tube connected to a wall O2 supply, usually running at 8 or more liters/min.  Many of these patients are still exhaling potent anesthetic molecules (desflurane, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, isoflurane) into the room, where doctors, nurses, and other personnel can inhale them.  



- Have any studies been done on long-term low dose exposure to these substances?  
- Are health care workers or their offspring (via affects on sperm and ova) affected by such chronic exposure, and if so, how?  
- Should hospitals be doing anything to prevent incidental exposure?  



Another question - it is also common practice when wasting unused medications (partial doses of medications) to either spray the medication from the syringe into a garbage can or into a sink (down the drain).  I imagine these substances must eventually end up in the environment and back in the water supply, where animals and humans can be exposed to them incidentally.  


- Should something different be done with these medications?  
- Municipal water supplies in the US are routinely tested for lead, arsenic, etc.  Are they / should they / can they be tested for pharmaceutical agents as well?

We live by a bunch of now closed iron mines, which you can literally walk up to the edge of. We would go hiking and play near them as kids, even though they're either flooded or closed off. It's in New Jersey, but I don't want to get too much more specific. The mines have been closed since before I was born. I'm not sure our town took really any precaution when closing them, as the caps they'd put over the mine shafts cave in all over town. They've just started putting rent a fences around them.

Now, a good chunk of people in my town that I grew up with have developed autoimmine issues (rheumatoid arthritis, for instance), a kid in my elementary school classes and I were both diagnosed with very rare illnesses (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular for her, classical for me). Another friend and some of hers have reproductive issues that have yet to be diagnosed. I should mention my graduating class in elementary school was only about 30 people. For such a small amount of people, this is pretty strange to me.

Some other conditions that seem common with my family and friends nearby are fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, OCD, migraines, reproductive conditions, and a lot that has yet to be diagnosed. It's just strange that my friends and I are using canes and having this many problems in our early 20s.

We live in Jersey, so superfund sites are not unfamiliar to us. There are a couple by my houss, but I dont remember spending much time at them.

I finished my B.Sc. in Chemistry in 2014 and am planning to finish an M.S. in Chemistry by the fall of this year (2017) with the hopes of landing a job somewhere between organic and inorganic chemical industry (I'm in a city where there's a lot of oil & gas, plastics, pharmaceutical and possibly food industry?).

My question is, with Earth day coming up and my views on environmentalism posing a sense of ambivalence, is there any chemical industry that an aspiring chemist should pay special attention to in regards to spills and disposal? I know you probably cannot list them by name or brand, but I'm almost certain that pharmaceuticals and oil & gas, because of their necessity and popularity, will probably have the most documented accidents. I guess my question boils down to if there's a database for the ""greenest"" chemical industries according to field or specialty. 

I'm already worried about finding a job due to my limited lab work not matching well with my division and the applications of the theories I've studied seem to all point to industries that may not be as ""green"" as I would hope them to be--despite their potential payout. Don't get me wrong, if I was lucky to receive a job, I know that the training would be strenuous and the on-site hazard specialist would probably be the best of the best, but if I can find an industry that probably wouldn't pose such an environmental or occupational risk, I would love to know.

Thank you for doing ge AMA!

I live very near an airport and was informed that, due to glycol(?) I evels in the soil (presumably from deicing) that I should not grow any food for human consumption.  My questions are:
Are there any other implications of having high levels in the soil on human health (or from living so close to an airport...airborne?)?
Are the levels likely due to old practices that have lingered or is this because glycol is still being used and maintaining high levels?
Is it safe to use planters with new soil and if so should I replace it every year?

I am interested in the direct injection of cyclophosphamide (an anti-neoplastic nitrogen mustard), the drug is one of the major global anti-cancer drugs and has been in use since the 1950s (i.e., it is very well characterized toxicologically). Would a drug with a profile such as cyclophosphamide require significant regulatory review if it was to be used in a new method of treatment (assuming rodent and human trials confirm efficacy)?

The most toxic materials are both man-made (such as dioxins) and natural products (venoms natural pesticides such as pyrethrins) but they tend to be present in minute quantities.  Basically their inherent hazard (independent of exposure) is very high but once you take into account the amount of exposure they don't tend to pose a significant risk.  One nalogy getting bit by a rattlesnake has significant toxic effects but (generally) the probability of getting bit is extremely especially for the usual suburbanite.  More common chemicals although not quite as toxic are present in much higher doses/exposure levels and actually may be the biggest source of chemical risk.  Flamebroiling /BBQ meat would be one (controversial) example especially when you burn it to a crisp.  Some components of gasoline are not the greatest which is why using it as a cleaning agent is not recommended!  If you pump your own gas in urban areas vapor recovery technology gets the vapors away from you.

This is something I am actively involved in:  ECHA has taken this the furthest: if you have no animal data you first have to compare your chemical to other chemicals that ""look"" the same to see if you can get any information.  You can then try to make the case that the data is insufficient and only then will you be given permission to start new animal studies.  Most of the new data submitted to ECHA falls in this category: new chemicals will have limited data and extra/interpolation from other chemicals is the norm.

EPA under the new TSCA is supposed to minimize animal testing and develop alternatives, which they already have been busy with the last couple of years. All of these alternatives carry a certain amount of uncertainty 60-70% reliability is the norm for good comparisons.  Unfortunately animal testing is not 100% correct either so the two methods have similar uncertainties when done right.

dg4jbrk,t1_dg46v6c,2017-04-11 16:51:16,science,"Formaldehyde toxicity is very controversial, especially the carcinogenicity aspect.  At fairly high doses formaldehyde causes cancer inside the noses of rats ONLY after inhalation. Feeding studies were negative in good studies.  Noses of rats contain different tissue types than humans, so the question has been is this applicable to humans.  All green vegetables and fruits contain formaldehyde naturally up to concentrations of approximately 100 parts per million.  No this is not applied: it is natural byproduct of photosynthesis (oversimplified).  Even people naturally contain formaldehyde in their cells.  So concerns over low levels of formaldehyde especially non inhalation may be overestimated.  This is where risk vs hazard comes in: formaldehyde may have a relatively high hazard at concentrated/ high exposure levels, but its risk at (very) low concentrations may be minimal. I am not sure this debate will ever get settled but people get unduly worked up over tiny amounts of formaldehyde.

Having said that tissue preservation can occur in moderate to high levels of formaldehyde (yes smelling it is an indicator but even low levels ""smell"").  Working in fume hoods or other local ventilation can help reduce that substantially.  Face mask ie the white dust masks don't do much if anything to reduce exposure.  Reproductive studies on formaldehyde have not been positive, although some may be ""inconclusive"".  Most of the mutagenicity (the effect on genes) have been negative in bacteria and such.  

Skin effects do occur again gloves especially nitrile ones will help, nitrile ones are thicker and sturdier and don't allow chemical penetration of organic solvents.  I can't give medical advice so talk to your obstetrician for the latest advice.   -- HP",AmerChemSocietyAMA,t2_ollxg,26,0,reddit2

Sections 2 and 8 are probably the most important for you.  Section 8.1 outlines exposure limits (what I think OP specializes in).  The lowest OSHA regulated exposure limit is 0.75 ppm, so you can not legally be exposed to more than that amount.  The NIOSH recommended maximum exposure is 0.016 ppm, but that is not a legal requirement.  
You also have a right to view industrial hygiene testing and your company is required to perform that testing to determine what your exposure is (i.e. they must test to see what the ppm exposure is).

The studies included both full-shift samples and STEL evaluations taken in 15-minute increments during tasks with suspected high exposure (grossing of larger specimens such as colon and breast).

I sampled probably 5-6 different hospitals across the system each multiple times. I wish I still had the reports so I could give the exact numbers, but in general the exposure levels were very low; most exposures did not exceed the ACGIH recommendations. Even at that level (0.3ppm) the known adverse effects are chronic bronchitis and emphezema. The highest exposures were typically seen during bulk disposal of specimens. Please do this in a fume hood.

Unfortunately, there are no federal regulations in regards to mold in occupied buildings.  The EPA does have guidelines, but they are not enforceable.

There are some states where there are mold regulations in place.  For example, DC has fairly strict regulations that were put unto place last year that force owners of tenant-occupied buildings to have an assessment performed by a licensed assessor within 10 days of receiving a tenant complaint.

However, in the four states our firm primarily works in (DC, MD, VA, WV), DC is the only area with such regulations in place, and as stated above, they only went into effect less than a year ago.

Your best course of action, in my opinion, would be to gather some of your peers, particularly those who believe their health has been adversely affected by the suspect mold problem, and jointly request that they retain an environmental health & safety firm or an industrial hygienist to perform a survey of the building and deternine the extent of the issue and outline what corrective actions can be taken.

An assessment, with microbial sampling, will likely cost several thousand dollars.  If a firm is not including thermographic imaging, moisture content testing, and both viable and non-viable microbial sampling on their proposal, they should be disregarded.

This link has some useful information. Detecting asbestos fibres in vermiculite can be very tricky as they can be small fibres and randomly distributed throughout the vermiculite, vermiculite can also have thin needle like fibres present which although not classed as asbestos can be equally as dangerous when breathed in. As it says in the link it is better to assume the vermiculite is contaminated. The day to day risk is low if the vermiculite is not moved or disturbed to create any airborne dust that could be breathed in. If you were going to remove it i would recommend you get a licensed asbestos removal company to carry out the work as they would carry out air tests and fibre counting tests to make sure the background airborne levels are safe.

The causal direction of effects could also be debated. These are the items.

> People see me as a natural leader.

> I have a unique talent for persuading people.

> Group activities tend to be dull without me.

> I know that I am special because people keep telling me so.

> I have some exceptional qualities. 

> I'm likely to become a future star in some area.

> I like to show off every now and then

High responses on some items could be caused by observed life success, or observing others complimenting oneself, rather than by narcissism. I think they were overly restrictive by only modeling narcissism -> work outcome.

Jobs that required workers to identify complex problems, review related information to develop and evaluate options, and implement solutions were associated with better self-perceived memory among women and men and better episodic memory and executive functioning among women. Jobs with higher frequency of exposure to hazardous conditions and/or uncomfortable environmental conditions were associated with poorer episodic memory and executive functioning.

d4cu07f,t1_d4cozct,2016-06-17 09:39:45,science,"Wow, you were allowed to watch TV? Try working in IT. I burned out hard after being in the most boring job for almost a year, I started having literal (and I know how silly this sounds) panic attacks before work because I couldn't stand the boredom. 

I was good at my job, which meant I worked faster and more efficiently than my colleagues. I would regularly finish my daily work within an hour, and was then waiting for incoming calls. Sometimes I'd wait for a hour to receive a call that I'd resolve within 5 minutes. During that hour of downtime I was not allowed to do anything that was not work related, but by 10am I had literally nothing to do but wait for something to break so I could fix it. Our screens all faced the boss so they could make sure we were doing work. If we had no work to do, we were told to read doco, which is basically instruction manuals for fixing certain issues. Guess what? I wrote 70% of them. I knew all the doco back to front.

But still I had to look like I was busy, and this became the most stressful part of my day: How to look busy when you aren't.

Step 1 - Click aimlessly around the screen.

Step 2 - Occasionally type something meaningless into a notepad, then delete it.

Step 3 - Repeat step 1 and 2 for 6-8 hours depending on work load.

As I said, I started having panic attacks, both before work and during work. I was a 25 year old man crying in the shower before work because I couldn't muster up the courage to go. Again, I know how pathetic this sounds. While I was at work I would get this sudden crawling feeling all over my body, and would have to fight an impulse to jump to my feet or shout something out loud. I'd suddenly get visions of tearing my skin off my bones, and I'd struggle to sit still. When I got home I just wanted to sleep, somehow being so bored all day made me unbelievably tired.

I know this has had a lasting effect of me, and it was 3 years ago that I quit. Wearing a suit for a wedding makes my stomach turn, I hate fluorescent lighting, even seeing offices on TV makes me uncomfortable. I could not sit through watching Office Space. I will never be able to work in an office again.

Which, of course on some level we do want, it's nice to have access to medicine, clean water, temperature controlled rooms and such. But at a certain point it becomes damaging. 

Snap Chat for example is very interesting since it limits technology. Obviously we have a the capability to build something that can hold all our pictures and videos indefinitely, but tons of people choose to use a service with limits. It's ephemeral, which people seem to like, it's more life-like.

d4cugo1,t1_d4crqgg,2016-06-17 10:06:52,science,"I think technology is so cool and it can only get cooler. But I think the future of it could be dangerous. In a way, it would be great to not be able to have to work. Especially for jobs people don't like. For example, I work at a shipping center, so much parcel dust everywhere. It seems like a lot of people are just living to work there. There is a center that's fully automated I believe, so it can be done. Without people needing to do this job, it would allow them to have more time to do other things. The the downside is that we need money. I've tried imagining what it could be like with technology so advanced that it can do many of our jobs. Many people wouldn't know what to do. There's so much to improve on ourselves whether it's building a better healthier body, growing spiritually, or learning new things, but then what is the ultimate goal? Why do this stuff? I guess we could say that if everyone tried to be the best version of themselves they can be without having to worry about financial needs, the world would be a better nicer place. Everyone lives happily doing fun things hangin out. Then there's the other possibility. What of so many people take advantage of this free time and do bad things with it and just party? What if whoever owns the new robotic workers gets all the money, leaving the elite with everything, and everyone else without jobs. It would be possible to share everything we need equally, but it won't happen because we won't have money to pay for it. I've thought about a having base income, but that could just raise the prices of goods as we ""have more money to spend"" I think it's crazy that one day people that run this place would have to actually think about how they'll make it work.",Obese_Homing_Pigeon,t2_ws4vk,1,0,reddit4

The fact it might not be the ability to put in effort that matters the most anymore, but instead the ability to see opportunity. So that you can grasp strings of luck others walk past. The fact that putting in effort, without looking around and gaining perspective, will only help you to a certain degree, at which any further attempts at progress becomes the concept of digging through a mountain to get to the other side, without realizing that you could have walked around it in much less than 1/10th the time.

Besides that I'd argue humans don't do things meaninglessly. If you are playing games and feeling guilty doing so, perhaps you should try finding out why and do something about it.

I was simply pointing out that the phrasing above (""Men only **feel** like it has improved."") implies that men are somehow overestimating their own cognitive capabilities. There seemed to be some implicit value judgments in that statement, which I was pushing back against by suggesting a more neutral phrasing for the hypothesis. 

And, more to the point you raise, the study seems to show the opposite. Men seemingly can have a subjective self-perception of poorer cognitive capabilities in harsh environments despite objectively not displaying poorer cognitive capabilities. So they think they feel like shit, as you put it, but aren't performing like shit. 

If the study was simply about self-reported wellness measures in harsh working conditions, the results would be obvious and trivial. Of course people in harsher environments would be more likely to think they were feeling badly, which, as you point out, means that they do feel badly, practically as a tautology.",stult,t2_43rkt,2,0,reddit4

gwlng6d,t1_gwj9t5g,2021-05-01 23:32:52,science,"Interestingly of you look at minority owned vs non minority owned companies vs demographics in the US you end up with it following somewhat closely. However if you look at men vs women owned companies there is a clear lopsidedness.  This does not take into account the success of companies or size. This clearly is disparate.

https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219

This could also be easily explained by gender roles because more often women will sacrifice career for the family while men sacrifice family for the career.

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/

As long as people believe men can't be stay at home parents who let the women be the primary income bringer you will continue to see this disparity.  It was only recently that men got leave for having a child and this empowers women to continue their careers and let men sacrifice for family.

We need to encourage men becoming stay at home dads and pushing for it becoming more socially acceptable for men to become house husbands.  

Women need to be ok with dating men with lower incomes and men not feeling that they need to make more money than their wives.

Look at this poll:

https://blogs.chapman.edu/crean/2015/09/29/new-research-analyzes-height-weight-income-and-more-in-regards-to-sex-and-dating/

Basically women place more emphasis on income then men when seeking a mate. This in turn further entrenches the idea that men need to sacrifice for the career.  They feel they need to make that cash and work the extra hours while women don't feel that same pressure.  This also means they may take breaks (ie stay home a few years to care for a child) or even turn down more demanding roles to have more family time.

I agree forced diversity is not helpful because it forces hiring less talented candidates. It is silly to create a bias to literally discriminate against a better candidate just because you need to fill some quota.

STEM is a big thing being push for women to join. One of the larger, overarching issues with this push is that there not actually many women interested in that field. Compound this with the data showing that not only are more men interested but many more are willing to pursue it.

So this begs the question: why aren't women interested in higher positions? We know that qualifications aren't an issue. It could really be all chalked up to societal norms. Women aren't expected to be breadwinners. Young girls are just now being encouraged  into these fields and to pursue careers.

gwjdba5,t1_gwjb83n,2021-05-01 13:21:38,science,"The main reasons are because on average:

1. Women do not seek social status through material wealth like men do
2. Womens sexual value does not come from social status and wealth, it comes from attractiveness and youth
3. Women show less obsessive / workaholic traits than men do
4. In fact, women are more sensitive to burn out and stress
5. Women are more social and less interested in things
6. Women are less aggressive
7. Women are more agreeable
8. Women are less competitive
9. Women give up sooner (yes there is data on this) and easier discouraged
10. Women are more risk adverse
11. Women become mothers and chose to leave their job
12. Women are less dominant

Yes, there is data on all of this. Those traits differences on average are not very big. But average people do not become CEO of the worlds biggest companies. Only people with extreme traits get there. And while those sex differences on average are small, at the end tails of the distribution they maximize.

Thats why men are on average a bit more aggressive then women, but the most extreme people are 9 to 1 men... hence 9 out of 10 murders in jail are men. Because you do not end up in prison for being somewhat more aggressive than the average, you end up in jail for being extremely agressive

Thats why men on average are a bit less risk adverse than women, but the most serious sport accidents happen to men because the least risk adverse crazy sports types are 9 out of 10...men

Thats why on average men are more drawn to things and tend to be obsessed with tasks, but the most, almost autistic work addicted people are men

The reason highly successful women on their way to CEO quit their jobs and dont come back after having a kid is because unlike men, highly successful women only date/marry men as successful as them or UP, so they never **need** work another day again because they only marry highly sucesfull, millionaire type of guys.

Men and women are simply different and there are simply way less women who fit the CEO type. Just like social jobs have a hard time to find men. On average men are simply not drawn to social jobs, on average women are not drawn to become CEOs",johnboycutter,t2_wnxtr,6,0,reddit1

Also in my own anecdotal experience, women are far more concerned with a males recourses and status than vice-versa whereas men tend to be more concerned with a woman's physique. This would make men more motivated to achieve those positions.

I would also concede that this is socially encouraged, not due to an ideology of how men should or shouldn't be but again, from an evolutionary perspective, it would make sense that parents recognise that resources and status are more important to their sons romantic success and will push them in that direction more so than their daughters.

Women are very, *very* attuned to babies/small children (in fact, I think it's likely that the way humans have evolved into the creatures we are today has a lot to do with the dynamic between mother's and infants) in a way that men aren't. (At least, the vast majority of men, but human males are also one of the most maternal creatures if you take the whole animal kingdom into account)

Now people are going to assume that I am saying that women can't use their brains because they are merely maternal creatures, but that's really not a fair assessment. As far as I'm aware, there is no difference that has been observed between the intelligence of men and women, along with traits that are often correlated with being a high achieving employee (having the discipline it takes to be a CEO of a large company). The main difference comes when women start getting to the age where they must make decisions about their family life, which I think is fine really. I know it's become a sort of cliche, but mother's really have one of the more important jobs in society, and we have no idea how to monetize it. It basically takes 25ish years for a human to become an adult, so we don't see any economic benefits/deficits of motherhood until 25 years later. Not really the case of a CEO, but perhaps the benefits we get from competent CEOs has more to do with their mothers than it does anything else, it's difficult to measure.

gwjp2f6,t1_gwjnszy,2021-05-01 15:00:03,science,"Humans are are sex dimorph species. The whole point we are different is so that we can do different things and specialize in them.

Yes, there is a reason why men on average are taller, faster and stronger then women with a much higher bone density. This is not by accident. Men are build for strength tasks, hunting and to lead, and in order to lead you (back in the day) had to win beat your opponent.

Women on the other hand had different roles. OBVIOUSLY

This all makes evolutionary perfect sense. I suggest you read up on it.",johnboycutter,t2_wnxtr,6,0,reddit1
gwjntl5,t1_gwj9re8,2021-05-01 14:50:39,science,"aggressiveness, persistence, stress resistance, confidence, dominance, risk taking, profit mindset etc etc... those are all traits that men score higher on compared to women on average. Thats on average!, if you go to the extremes (which all CEOs have because only the most extreme people become fortune 500 CEOs) men outweight women up to 90% at those traits.

Not to mention that women do not need social status, wealth and power to maximize their dating success. It makes virtually no difference for a men how much a woman makes or if she is successful. This is not true for women, women do seek successful men. Every dating study confirms this. There is a reason why marriage stats show women usually marry taller, older, more successful, higher earning, equal or more educated men",johnboycutter,t2_wnxtr,2,0,reddit1

gwq1rkm,t1_gwjr2fg,2021-05-02 23:33:27,science,"Probably, if you wait like 100 thousand years. Evolution found this is the best way, divide animals into two parts so one can safely create life and continue to live while the other goes hunting and risking his life to provide food. We can see this on most animals, and even on us back in the day. In 100 thousand years evolution might give up giving the traits men used a long time ago and simply switch it with something else, highly unlikely tho since from an evolutionary standpoint we are thriving and there is no reason to remove those traits",Vsauce113,t2_cnz4gun,2,0,reddit1
