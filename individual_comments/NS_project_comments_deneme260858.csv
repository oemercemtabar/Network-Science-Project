h2z6hwg,t3_o7k1ee,2021-06-25 09:10:15,science,"A year-long Australian population study has found that full time workers employed by organisations that fail to prioritise their employees' mental health have a threefold increased risk of being diagnosed with depression.

And while working long hours is a risk factor for dying from cardiovascular disease or having a stroke, poor management practices pose a greater risk for depression, the researchers found.

The University of South Australia study, published in the British Medical Journal today, is led by UniSA's Psychosocial Safety Climate Observatory, the world's first research platform exploring workplace psychological health and safety.

Psychosocial safety climate (PSC) is the term used to describe management practices and communication and participation systems that protect workers' mental health and safety.

Lead author, Dr Amy Zadow, says that poor workplace mental health can be traced back to poor management practices, priorities and values, which then flows through to high job demands and low resources.

""Evidence shows that companies who fail to reward or acknowledge their employees for hard work, impose unreasonable demands on workers, and do not give them autonomy, are placing their staff at a much greater risk of depression,"" says Dr Zadow

A career is not a personality trait like so many people make it. So many people envelope all of their self worth into how hard they work or what they do for a living. That cant be healthy. Unless you work on commission or doing something truly impactful (first responders, doctors, nurses ect.) there is zero reason to burn yourself into the ground. Most employment contracts are basically work x amount for y amount of dollars. If your effort level doesnt determine your compensation why push yourself 100%? Those deadlines dont effect youre bottom line. Thats the owners/shareholders/customers problem. The days of seeking a promotion are over. Its way less stressful and easier to just work somewhere else if you want to increase your cost of living.

 If management gets on you it shouldnt bring you down, it should be empowering that youre not letting yourself get taken advantage of. Its not like you cant just find a new job in this economy.  They need you way more than you need them.

I have bipolar disorder. In the last couple of months I have hit new emotional lows I never felt before. Struggled very heavily with suicidal ideation and even wrote a suicide note. I never made any attempt, but I was at rock bottom and wanted to die.

I asked for one day off. One day. I told my boss that I needed a day for my mental health. That I had been depressed and needed a day to refocus myself. Huge mistake. 

The next day I had a call where I was told that, basically, my job performance was being affected and it had to stop. My boss proceeded to tell me about all the people in her life who were sick. All the bad things that had happened to her as a young adult. And how she has managed to work through it all and stay happy. It was never said outright, but the message was clear: everyone has problems, but don't look to your workplace for sympathy. Keep it to yourself. 

Her ultimate suggestion was that I should throw myself at my work and focus all of my attention there so I don't think about the depression. She also let me know I had one week to get back on track.

There isn't a single quantifiable criterion mentioned in the article.  Even worse, they acknowledge elevated depression globally regardless of work circumstances.  This is interesting, however:

> ""Sometimes stress is a trigger for bullying and in the worst cases it can set an 'acceptable' level of behaviour for other members of the team. But above all bullying can be predicted from a company's commitment to mental health, so it can be prevented,""

So it's a self-perpetuating problem, quite possibly caused by depression from factors *outside* of work?

Links to any of the referenced studies would be nice to see how they were conducted, because I suspect these are just polls of worker drones.  Who doesn't think they work too hard or too long?

Toxic workplaces can be open to interpretation.  I have also seen burnout and depression for people who may not be a traditionally toxic workplace, but they don't like their role, or the hours are rougher than they can typically handle, which varies a lot depending on what you want.  

If you want to work for a Morgan Stanley as an investment banker what this means may be different than someone working as help desk or a more traditional 9-5 office job.  A bad fit or just misaligned goals or just doing something you don't like can easily make you depressed even if the company isn't toxic for others.

This gives the developers a mean to actively work toward a goal that they themselves set up, instead of simply executing orders.

I’m a recent retiree from a high pressure job.  Depression was rampant there.  This is anecdotal, of course, but it seemed to me that people were pretty happy until management began to assert control over day to day decisions that workers had traditionally made on their own.  That’s when the mental health problems started.  

The model used to be to hire smart people, train them well, start them with projects they were capable of handling, let them use their training and creativity to get the job done, and increase their authority as they gained experience and demonstrated their competence.

The new model is to hire smart people (that part hasn’t changed), give them minimal training, impose a set of cookie cutter best practices, audit their work relentlessly for adherence, and require them to go to a committee to request authority to take actions that they would have been allowed to make on their own under the old model.  Everyone was on a tight leash.

The new model affected units I worked with, but hadn’t fully reached mine, so it wasn’t that bad for me personally.  I was glad I got out when I did though.  I felt like I caught the last plane out of Casablanca.",silviazbitch,t2_mza4l,272,0,reddit2

The big questions are:

1. How did the researchers define ""toxic"" (shocker, it looks like they didn't and instead looked at PSC and WE, and even this article didn't explain exactly how those are measured)

2. ""Toxic workplaces increase risk of..."" is a causal statement - how did they demonstrate that causal relationship? (Hint, they didn't)

3. What are the P values or adjusted R-squared? (Not provided)

4. How controlled was the sample selection? They removed a LOT of people that would have been interesting to see in the data.

5. Apparently working 49-54 hours had the least amount of Depression? That would be the fascinating follow up study- is that a natural ""optimum utilization rate"" for the human mood?

>Results Long working hours were not significantly related to new cases of major depression symptoms; however, when mild cases were removed, the 41–48 and ≥55 long working hour categories were positively related to major depression symptoms. Low PSC was associated with a threefold increase in risk for new major depression symptoms. PSC was not related to long working hours, and long working hours did not mediate the relationship between PSC and new cases of major depression symptoms. The inverse relationship between PSC and major depression symptoms was stronger for males than females. Additional analyses identified that WE was positively related to long working hours. Long working hours (41–48 and ≥55 hours) mediated a positive relationship between WE and major depression symptoms when mild cases of major depression were removed.

>Conclusion The results suggest that low workplace PSC and potentially long working hours (41–48; ≥55 hours/week) increase the risk of new major depression symptoms. Furthermore, high WE may increase long working hours and subsequent major depression symptoms.",funforyourlife,t2_wo0t5,15,0,reddit2

So, he thinks that teaching really isn’t hard, he gets sooo much time off and his pay is fine for the amount of time he works.  What he doesn’t like is his students are poor, hungry, neglected, abused and troubled.  Teachers file a lot of CPS reports, they are mandated reporters.  He has a lot of stress in that he worries about his students.  Secretly, we provide clothing, food, Christmas and Easter presents to his students.  His principal wouldn’t like it if she knew this but he can’t stand seeing a 9 year old in the dirty shirt for three days so we just buy the kid new clothes and the social worker drops them off as a donation.  I don’t think teachers are that articulate in describing what the problem in teaching is - neglectful parents (at all income levels really) and not enough social programs to help poor kids.  Yes, they get free lunch at school, but they don’t have glasses.  Yes, it’s the parents’ fault but the kid still can’t see the board.",ifihadmoretime_74,t2_20hd8zl4,22,0,reddit2

The most prominent hypothesis to explain the effect is that it's a result of elevated cortisol levels as a result of stress, but there are potentially very large confounders that have not been ruled out. For example, being lower in the hierarchy also means being paid less, and I think it's pretty easy to imagine that could also play a role in a person's overall stress levels. Moreover, it isn't even clear if this effect is entirely a result of stress, or if there are other factors, too.

That's called ""micromanagement"", and it is *very* bad for mental health. In addition to that, it is based on a kind of power play (psychological dynamics like a toxic parent), so it is impossible to address that or meta-communicate about it (unless the top job of the organization is against this behaviors and can be asked for help). Often, it trickles down from the boss.  In almost all cases, the best thing one can do is to quit as fast as possible. 

It's also quite recommendable to get professional psychological help, as these organizations and bosses will mess with your weak spots.

This philosophy doesn't work in the work place. Not well, at least.

Something he missed is the desire to be rewarded for doing something well. It's Pavlovian thought, basically. If I'm not getting rewarded to do my thing well in some way, I'm not going to do it well or I'm going to look to get rewarded for it. That reward can take shape in a lot of different ways. 

In a toxic work environment, you're likely not getting positive reinforcement for a job well done. You're not going to love what you're doing, and you're not going to do what you're doing well.

Humans who can't maintain interest in any hobbies are usually referred for psych evaluation as that's literally partial criteria for depression. It's normal human function to want to contribute and produce, anything else is evidence of a disorder.

EDIT: I think a better summary of what I'm trying to say might be; 'Most people will want to paint a painting or clean their surroundings or otherwise be productive frequently in their life. Most people don't want to be in a position where they spend the first 40 hours of their week cleaning just so they can afford to spend the next 4 painting. That's not healthy.

This redneck could have chosen to listen to science, or tried to back up these ludicrous conspiracy theories with an ounce of fact, but he chose not to. So why should he get to have just as much of a say as I do? You don’t get to vote if you choose not to go cast your vote, which means that while everyone has the opportunity to vote, your choices can lead to you not taking advantage of that. We need to work out some reasonable way to make it so that you don’t get to vote if you’re not willing to accept reality and make your judgements based off of that. Then, everyone still has the opportunity to vote, but as with refusing to drive to the polls, their choices can lead to them not being able to cast a vote.

When she got a new job finally she broke down in the break room on her lunch because on her first day her boss toured her around the facility, introduced her to people, and then sat down with her and her direct manager to have coffee and discuss her goals and interests so they could guide her to projects where she could thrive.

His parents were from China. They pushed him as hard as they could to be a doctor. While my parents were dirt poor living in a trailer and were to busy partying to care what I did. I scrapped by in high school and  almost didn’t pass. I did vocational school and learned how to weld. Didn’t pursue it any further then entry level. 2008 hit got laid off and did utility locating. They wouldn’t give me a raise so I got a commercial driving license to drive semi trucks. 

Welding entry level paid about 35-40k, locating was 45-55k depending on over time. The locating was way too long of hours. it was taking a mental toll on me to something I’ve never experienced before. Quit took a 6 month vacation then got a cdl which paid me my first year 60k then 2nd year 2nd job bumped me up to 90k.

Reason I never got a degree was money and to me it felt like no point. I could make as much or more doing semi entry level jobs. Yeah they are considered blue collar, but I’ve never had a problem doing that. I leaned towards that my entire life.

Job was so surprised that I would even ask for a training guide or standards like it had never even occurred to them that those things were a normal (and smart!) part of a job. Wrote my own manuals and training materials, turned out that I accidentally squeezed out the person above me because upper management realized that this person did nothing but ""manage"" her employees by offloading all of her work onto the people below her. That's why there were no manuals, she wanted people to not know what their jobs were so she could make them do her job. Learned a REAL hard lesson that bad actors benefit in chaotic environments so that should always be a giant red flag, and the even harder lesson that you might see the red flags but still have to take the job anyway because of your life circumstances.

Law of large numbers implies within 50-100 million years or so another one will hit, long before the sun will die. You said the achievements of humanity will be wiped out but any evolved races will either outdo humanity if they keep up the progress or undo them if they don’t. The only way the progress will persist is if for some odd reason this evolved race not only stagnates but maintains the previous technology created. Assuming the last 100k years of history stay consistent, whatever race evolves will outdo humans and replace whatever antiquated humans created. So there will be no human progress to wipe out even in a million years. 

We would only need to create cryogenics and terraforming technology. We might even be able to move all conscious beings to computers in the event that’s not possible. With advanced cryogenics and terraforming humans can take however long to travel to random rocky planets and make them new homes.

There are theoretical frameworks that allow for warp travel where we may not even need cyrogenics.  8 billion years is more than enough time figure it all out given the exponential rate of progress thus far.

He carried a lot of institutional knowledge, so they often had him train new employees. But a lot of the changes they implemented for efficiency made it harder on my dad. He fixed hospital equipment and fostered some close relationships with his customers over decades (many of them attended his funeral earlier this year), but his company implemented a policy wherein he had to complete repairs in a specific amount of time pre-determined by algorithms based on what the customer reported. The problem was that the customers often don't know the equipment as well as the engineers, so my dad would arrive and need to take time to diagnose the problem. Even though he had the best average completion times of anyone on his team due to his experience alone, he was docked due to lack of efficiency because younger employees had the excuse of being new. They also didn't factor in repeat visits, in fact they wanted customers to pay for multiple visits if a problem wasn't fixed, but my dad cared too much about customer service and wanted to get the job done the first time.

jebf8mc,t3_126kfwg,2023-03-30 20:04:29,science,"We have an employee at my office job who is in her 60s/70s. One of my direct reports.

When I arrived about a year and a half ago, she had a profound reputation as a poor, sloppy worker and was on a PIP. I heard “on the side” that she was only kept around to avoid an age discrimination lawsuit.

Well, inevitably I started getting the emails about her work, “hey, just so you know, -name- did this yesterday, please look into this and report back and we’ll need to decide what to do,” or “we got an email in the inbox that says they’ve been waiting two months for a reply, why hasn’t -name- replied?” These correspondences were all marred with implied assumptions about her culpability and lacked her side of the story.

So, I actually put in the time to thoroughly investigate each of these instances. Sometimes this meant spending an agonizing hour or more using Outlook search to piece together timelines of past correspondences. Sometimes this meant digging up version 17.25B of the relevant SOP from the Staff folder on the S drive and comparing it with version 17.5Z from the Opps folder on the L drive to pinpoint any points of legitimate confusion. Sometimes this meant me going into our outdated database and retracing steps of a process to understand where mistakes could happen.

I found that 9/10 times, she either made a totally understandable mistake that anyone would have made, due to unclear instructions or buggy tools, or, did not make a mistake at all and bore 0 culpability. I also found that my company’s software system is at least 10 years out of date and in a state of perpetual failure, the business continuity and documentation was nonexistent at a time when around a third of critical staff was turning over, and some ridiculous demands were being made of this person, e.g. “you should answer chat inquiries while you’re also on the phone answering a phone inquiry.”

Her PIP quietly disappeared and isn’t talked about anymore, since I’ve been here.

Now I don’t have all the details of what things were like before I arrived, maybe she had genuine performance issues at one time, and I’m not necessarily lauding her by saying “quite the contrary, she’s an exemplary employee.” But I saw much more evidence of a perception of her incompetence than I actually saw evidence of her incompetence. 

This really struck me as a textbook example of the failings of a business in disarray being pawned off on an easy target who was unlikely to aggressively defend herself. I wonder a) how much of what led to her PIP was legitimate and how much was just falsely perceived and b) what would’ve happened if someone like me who actually audits these accusations of poor performance hadn’t stepped in as her boss.",,,100,0,reddit3

jedetcz,t3_126kfwg,2023-03-31 05:09:25,science,"I think the biggest driver of this stereotype is the ""technological illiteracy.""  And it is rather true, IMO.  As more and more work moves to computerized systems, production from older individuals certainly drops.  As a younger person who grew up with computers and software, there really is no contest that I am better than the older generation at these tasks.  I can do the same work in significantly less time.  In this dimension, I have to say that the stereotype is true.

When it comes to non-technological instances, I generally see older workers as more efficient.  They have many more tricks and adaptations that give them an edge over newer, less experienced workers.  There really is no substitute for experience.  

In fields where physical activity is prominent, older people certainly struggle with the ridiculous demands of labor-intensive jobs.  I've worked some jobs where you are dripping sweat, and it is undeniable that the older workers cannot work as fast as me in my advantageous physical condition.

The entire situation is depressing, though.  As companies demand more and more work from employees, and as it becomes increasingly difficult to retire, there's going to be a significant number of older workers who simply cannot get jobs to get them through to retirement.  I don't think capitalism has an answer to this, and it will require some sort of intervention.

tl;dr: Younger workers are just better with computers and software.  Older workers are generally more efficient unless the work is labor-intensive.",Yokuz116,t2_9nuzn,2,0,reddit3

Understand that at this point Mellenials are the last existing large American generation, and as the workforce shrinks the culture that pushes senior workers out is going to be under tremendous pressure to change that or simply be left understaffed: even with AI augmentation.

The last bias is against age. The undiscussed bias that so many have is against the elderly workers and older people in general. In the future, there will be tremendous pressure to change this as workforce levels drop and retaining older talent becomes paramount.

I used to work for those old fashion offices where everyone was there for 20+ years and the only time they hire fresh meat is when someone retires. Here is my anecdotal experience with working with older office workers:

-I tried to electronically freshen up our work process. For example we often handled documents spanning 100s of pages. I told them since we were handling such large documents it would be much easier to save directly to pdf rather than scanning to pdf, making the document searchable. I took the time to teach them how to do this, but most I got was ""I'm used to doing it this way""

-had a co worker not know how to add/move tabs on Excel. Therefore she, each time she needed a new tab she saved a new workbook.

-I have more stories similar to the above two examples when dealing with older coworkers. So in conclusion, my problem with older coworkers is not ageism or that they earn more, but it's their inability to want to learn and improve.

The first thing we did was stick him with a younger guy. He might not have been as strong or seen as he once did, but he was not scared to share his knowledge. It was nice watching him help form the next generation. In 3 months, he took a guy who was not confident in his skills to a guy you could lay out and walk away from. You knew it was getting done right. As we got to know the older fallow, we learned his wife had passed away. He came back to work to stay busy to keep his mind off it. The workforce seems to have turned their backs to older people, and we don't need to. We need to soak up the knowledge and build it. Sadly, the guy had 95% blockage in his heart, and we had to lay him off. 

The whole time we had him, I had upper management wanting to get rid of him. They saw him as a liability but we saw him as an asset. A wealth of knowledge and passion. We need people to teach. We don't need people who learn from a book. Not all predicaments can be taught that way.

I'm a young choir conductor for a men's choir with a median age a bit over 70. My previous choir was a student choir aged 20-25, and what my current task is in my choir is radically different from the student choir.
When I've discussed this with other music academy colleagues I usually boil it down to ""older people have worn out their muscles in their lifetime, and the voice is a muscle, they can't handle any piece of music I might wish they would preform.""
And these restrictions hinder a lot of musical development which was the purpose of my previous choir, but that's not really why they are there. They wish to continue singing, as they have most of their lives. I do consider my work to be more of a healthboosting activity.

I’ve also worked for a few companies where the guys at the top were probably mid-tier quality employees in their prime, and they kind of grandfathered their way to the top and started hiring their peers from other companies as they were edged out (not because they were old, but because they were never great employees and became less relevant as new technology came along and they refused to adapt). 

The end result in each case was a company propped up by legacy brand cache that had no idea how to operate in the modem business world, and when a young whipper snapper (I was 36 and 40, in the two I am referring to) was brought on they’d condescendingly say I didn’t know how things “really worked” in the industry, ignore the most fundamental strategies to help them regain market share.

My youngest colleagues actually did the least amount of work though they worked as long and as hard as everyone else. By the end of a week they were exhausted. They produced the least due to the amount of time it takes to master the job, typically five to ten years. The job was so demanding that it was not unusual for new employees to quit during their probationary period (the first year). Termination was rare, but aggrieves transgressions could eventually lead to it. Typically people in that situation were given the opportunity to resign. A lack of meeting criteria could and did lead to a lack of wage increase. We had 20 pay steps and climbing them typically was a very good carrot for productivity. The idea of doing the least was not tolerated and would lead to close supervision and monitoring, along with detailed plans to address the problems. I believe the keys to why it worked were twofold, first we were paid more than anyone else in our field in our area, second we were expected to work until the needed tasks were completed. No overtime. However we did have two weeks of accumulating sick leave each year, two weeks of paid holiday time each year, also accumulating and not expiring for two years and convertible into cash if not used, and increasing in time to five weeks each year eventually, two personal days per year, ten paid official holidays plus the week starting on Boxing Day running to New Years off. Oh, and if one did work over there was instead of overtime compensatory time which accumulated and could be used to take time off, within a year of it occurring, though preferably sooner. The system of time off was complex, but it meant that if the tasks required a 60 hour week, we could work it and take time off later, plus the total amount of hours worked over the course of a year was not excessive. If one learned the job, did it well and planned, one could and more than one colleague did routinely take a full months off every year or a couple of months off every other year.

It sucks, but the kids coming out of college are all versed in some level of computer science, and data analytics is just expected. With our generation, it was not expected. The degrees were mostly infosys, and that’s not the future. In the 2000s, a spreadsheet was good enough, and if you could do pivot tables you were fancy. We have moved past that at an exponential pace. I should be able to finish all of this education by the time I’m 50. I hope that it ensures I am highly employable until I decide not to be.

I don’t even plan to do much with data analytics, but I need to manage those who are going to do it. I’m also trying to set myself up to move out of infrastructure and into platform, because I see that as the future.

jebidvi,t1_je9ro66,2023-03-30 20:24:18,science,"Well, this is the risk you take with having a STEM career and deciding not to progress to management. Basically, yeah. It's tough for anyone to want to hire a crusty engineer when young engineers exist who can learn to do the job for a fraction of the asking price, eventually becoming the SME you were.

This is why I caution my fellow engineers to not shy away from people-leader roles. Some of them say ""I really have no interest in that. I just want to code and code well."" And that's a *choice* one makes... to risk becoming expendable and without a great fit for you anywhere in the company.

Engineers are expected to progress every 3-5 years to the next seniority and management level. Those who don't are relegated to ""SME"" roles, where they are a senior engineer with ""18384 years of experience"" doing the thing they don't really need you to be doing after 10 years or so, because that's how long it takes to totally master that thing. And those roles pay well, but are on borrowed time, especially when any budget cuts come along. The first to go are always the senior engineers with fat salaries and no management responsibilities.

Basically, the only route for non management senior engineers is to become a contractor or a consultant in some way. Contractors make a FUCKLOAD of money, but the work is few and far between sometimes. But it makes since that this is the way- if you need to temporarily hire an SME, a crusty outsider with expertise is *the* guy/gal you want. Perhaps the ONLY guy/gal that can save your project. But then it's over, you cut em', and out the door they go.

My specific anecdotal example of this is my uncle, who is a 30 year SIS engineer for nukes. He is the *textbook* definition of a senior engineer who didn't want to manage anyone or anything but himself. He was jobless for almost 3 years but started working recently as a contractor/consultant for about $95/hr on a 2 year contract. After that, well.

When you are cheap, you can do innovation projects and take risks that mostly cost time. Plus, trying and failing is seen as a key part of your development. Once you are older and a manager, you are not given as much leeway to develop through try and fail, if any at all. Innovation projects are not really allowed for you anymore as your time is expected to constantly be spent on directly productive activities. When I was younger, I never had to do a business value and risk analysis with a link to corporate strategic goals for, well, anything (because someone else was doing that).

Now, as an older worker who manages, everything I do has to be roadmapped at 3 levels with a value analysis, risk analysis, and a specific link to a division strategic item. It is not impossible to do that with an innovation project, but much more difficult compared to what younger team members can do.

Also, a younger employee is allowed to move backwards. Move up into management, fail, drop down to individual contributor and develop back up into management. Older workers do not get this. If you move up into management and fail, you get fired or take a huge salary cut to move back to individual contributor and will never move up again. This goes back to the flexibility to try and fail when you are earlier in your career that disappears later in your career.

This is why I no longer help my mother with different tech stuff. I wouldn't mind if I had to just show her once and she played with the feature herself in order to learn more about it. Nope. She just expects me to do it, doesn't pay any attention when I'm explaining it to her, and then as soon as the issue comes up again I'm the one having to show her all over again. And I know this isn't all old people, as my dad is completely different, I only have to show him once, maybe twice. Plus he's like 8 years older than my mom.

My wife taught a college class a couple of years back where half her students couldn’t figure out how to send a pdf or word file because they literally only knew how to use Macs and pages files and the default settings for word processing.

Someone may think they are more productive than they used to be, but that's not a good measure of productivity. Perhaps you got more code done because they were doing other tasks instead. Perhaps more pressure is put on more junior members of the team to write more lines of code than you, who is senior. 

People can't accurately assess their own productivity, that's the job of management, who as you state didn't see as a problem:

> technical debt that the management didn't choose to see.

Certainly a lot of my work is disregarded by older people in charge because older people share their point of view. Obviously this isn't true in programming, where a big is inarguably a big, but most people aren't programmers.

I suspect in your case, the management preferred more code over code with less errors for whatever reason, and that's why they didn't see it as a problem.

It's cheap and relatively easy to hire a replacement forklift driver or assembler every year and pay them just above minimum wage. High skilled workers would be paid well, and it was popular at the time to settle in to a company and never leave. The managers were in a similar age bracket, so by the time the high skill workers retired and crippled the company, the managers would retire too and not have to deal with the fallout.

Additionally, it's worth noting that if it's a young person, they might be embarrassed to ask again, whereas someone who is older is less inclined to do so.

If you're not doing that then it could actually be you who is causing the problem, by expecting someone to understand calculus when they're math foundation isn't fluent in algebra.

If a lack of a certain level of computer knowledge is really that big of an issue then the problem lies with the hiring process. Maybe they need to make a certain level of knowledge a requirement.

Which is something I see as bad business. Ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, all have no place in the hiring process (unless they are absolutely essential for the job, such as hiring a Japanese actor to play a Japanese character). I think it's very beneficial to hire people from very different backgrounds, as it lends different points of view to the team, but hiring a token black guy just so you can check the box on the team diversity report is just another form of racism.

>No, you shouldn't hire a person to lift 60 pounds who can't lift 60 pounds, but older people can certainly do many of the jobs they're turned down for for no reason but ""culture fit"" worries by sheltered young people.

Sure, they can do them if they can do them. You don't disqualify someone for being old. I've had the misfortune of having a bunch of aged employees who like to sit around during work hours cracking racist jokes about ""squinty Asians that can't see well enough to drive"" and ""guys so dark they must be looking for a TV to steal"". I get that they were raised in a culture and time when those jokes were cool. But they aren't anymore, and the fact that they refuse to adjust their behavior is just a symptom of their overwhelming entitlement. They don't fit the culture, and that creates a toxic work environment where no one wants to work with them. And this isn't just a few occurrences, it's literally all of them.

>So many of the comments here are about work speed, flexibility, etc. A thing I've learned from working with people of all different ages is that one has to be really closed minded to not see that older workers can bring tons of value, though it usually takes a little more life experience on the part of hiring managers to recognize this.

Again, if it's a regular task at the job, and they can't do it, it doesn't matter what else they bring to the table. I really do appreciate people who have experience, but morso I appreciate people who want to learn.

jecnzho,t1_jeac12i,2023-03-31 01:14:30,science,"I think it's more complex than that. 

That senior employee doesn't exist in a vacuum. For that role to exist usually there needs to be multiple junior or intermediate positions. A big part of the responsibility for senior employees is mentorship, leadership, and making higher level decisions. I'll trust a senior employee to design a system, help set standards for the organization, be the person that anchors the team, takes on the most complex work, or rescues the more junior people when they get in over their heads. If a senior employee is applying to a junior position then either that is their skill cap or they're just taking it until a better opportunity comes along. One is an employee without potential, the other is a hassle.

Then there are social dynamics too. A lot of team leads and managers are threatened by people older than them. It sucks but it's true. Sometimes that's just in their heads but other times it can genuinely be an issue and undermine team cohesion. Alternatively if the team is mostly young people a single older worker is going to have a harder time fitting in than the reverse situation.

And then there's the way organizations make decisions. Think about all that talk about ""what happens if you get hit by a bus"", standardized processes, and so forth. The logical extension of that thinking is that if a position can't be eliminated through tools, automation, or processes then it needs to be reduced in complexity so that the person in that position becomes interchangeable. In other words every decision is made to embed the experience into the systems and processes so that you no longer need the experienced human. If you believe you've done that then why do you need to hire someone with a ton of experience. You want someone with enough experience that you can drop them in and they'll be productive. 

It's not just an evil management conspiracy either. It's the cumulative effect of everything we do at all levels. Why do we follow agile or scrum? Someone translated the experience of some highly experienced experts and translated it into a process so that people without that experience can benefit without needing the experienced people. Why do we follow coding standards? Same reason.

You simply cannot perform as well as a programmer in old age as you can when you're younger.

jeaqnm5,t1_jeadwxu,2023-03-30 17:28:07,science,"Frankly, in my professional experience, older folks do struggle a bit more on the tech and ""new things"" side of work. However, the difference between them and younger folks is negligible. With younger folks, you trade some of that general savviness and willingness to learn for less professional skills (and perhaps the sort of undisciplined approach to work that comes with being in your 20s)

To me, the thing that is noticeably different is how people of different ages respond to it. In my personal experience, some older folks seem to get genuinely upset, frustrated, or blame the tech, when they can't complete a task. Younger folks seem much more open to  learning without throwing temper tantrums or blaming some external factor. Of course, I think most of us would expect that, given that younger folks are still aware that they are learning new things, and older folks expect that they have enough professional skills to accomplish any task they are given (within reason). I imagine it can be damaging to one's self-esteem to have an illustrious career and not know how to do a basic excel formula. 

As a younger person, I am often the impromptu tech support guy for the older staff, and I always tell them the same thing ""I will go through this with you as many times as you need to understand as long as you are willing to ask me, and keep a cool head as I explain things.""

The only advice I have for this is to try to find documentation for the machines and the work process and compare that with what the workers are telling you.

Often you will have a line/machine that has been running for 20+ years but all of the employees working with it have only been there for 2-3 years. It's really hard for them to have the experience and knowledge to know why they are doing things or if it is the intended way for the machine to be used.

When I worked in a factory making IV bags, I often would just sit and watch the machines and see what they were trying to do, what they were doing while they were jammed, what they were trying to do when they went down, and then I would compare that with a spec sheet I found from when the device was installed and see that we were running it at +100% of it's intended speed, feeding in material that wasn't the right size, overstuffing the feeders, etc.

Turned down the speed by about 10% on one of my machines and it went from being down every 5 min to being up for 6 hours at a time. My numbers went up, overall workload went down, the full shebang.  But god help me if my manager ever saw me not having to run around like a chicken with my head cut off.

We still have age floors on things like being President and voting, so discriminating against someone on the basis of age is legal and in fact *the law*.  Age isn't ""just a number;' unlike most demographic categories, it's deterministic and everyone sees all of it if they don't die first.  Like most social issues, the conversation around it is full of feel-good initiatives which abstract away material realities.  **Of course** age has effects on output; newborns can't drive trucks and need for vision correction rises to nearly 100% at the ages of 65-75.  Any ability to gate a position by ""years of experience"" is inherently ageist.  There is no good answer because *age does not operate on an axis of justice*.  It is not and cannot be ""fair.""

Of course, there are plenty of great examples of things that anti-age-discrimination policies can stop, and by and large they help.  But we live in an unjust material world.  Acknowledging the reality of aging and its statistical effects isn't discriminatory.",Phyltre,t2_4clr4,6,0,reddit3

Turns out that it's usually faster/cheaper to just get the old guys to do it their way and then go back and fix all the errors they created.

Some industries are more straightforward, like producing x units/hour. But the fastest person might have the most sick time, or some other issues that level things out, so there are always tradeoffs.

If companies want to have a variety of experience, and people who handle different situations and have different strengths and skills, then they need to support one kind of training/jobs for younger workers who might have speed but no experience, and a different kind of training/jobs for older workers that might have experience but less speed.

h059aoz,t3_npipsf,2021-06-01 01:41:19,science,"Abstract:

Political scientists have increasingly begun to study how citizen characteristics shape whether—and how—they interact with the police. Less is known about how officer characteristics shape these interactions. In this article, we examine how one officer characteristic—officer sex—shapes the nature of police-initiated contact with citizens. Drawing on literature from multiple fields, we develop and test a set of competing expectations. Using over four million traffic stops made by the Florida State Highway Patrol and Charlotte (North Carolina) Police Department, we find that female officers are less likely to search drivers than men on the force. Despite these lower search rates, when female officers do conduct a search, they are more likely to find contraband and they confiscate the same net amount of contraband as male officers. These results indicate that female officers are able to minimize the number of negative interactions with citizens without losses in effectiveness.",Psychnews,t2_1kpk6luj,743,0,reddit4

h067pei,t3_npipsf,2021-06-01 08:26:00,science,"So this is fairly interesting. Lots of possible causes here, and questions, if you know anything about stop/search from the police perspective. Not sure what they've controlled for. 

- Men more likely to compete? (Stats-driven departments produce stats-driven staff?) 
- Women less confrontational? 
- It says drivers specifically. In a mixed-gender police crew, do men tend to search drivers and women passengers? Is this because men are more likely to assume the driver role? 
- Low female officer numbers mean they are often in demand to search women, even when they're stopped by men. They will be called to stops. Do women search less because they spend more time going from search to search?
- Do men search women more often on cursory stops, but make the effort to find a female to search if they think it's going to court or a complaint is likely to follow? 
- Are they just more thorough searchers? Are the men rushing it?
- If so, why? Do they encounter more confrontation?
- Some studies show that men have a greater inclination towards rules and fairness (and therefore anger) than women - does this lead to more 'it's the law' justification than 'it's harmful' (Eg small amounts of cannabis?)? 
- Greater proportion of women in proactive/investigation units (better working hours - good for kids) - more likely to conduct Intel-led rather than random stops?
- Common misconception from non-police is that the only reason searches are done is to find stuff. Are the same people being searched over and over as a form of targeted disruption?

h06xxm4,t3_npipsf,2021-06-01 13:46:14,science,"I have no interest in making police more effective. Hiring more women officers may give legitimacy to a morally bankrupt institution. Scientifically, anything we do with policing should answer a fundamental hypothesis - that a dollar spent on police would not be better spent on crime reduction. Such methods could be basic income (reducing poverty and wealth inequality), free college and trade school as an alternative to crime, reducing access to guns, using trained unarmed de-escalation professionals to respond to public health crises, free physical and mental health care, and so on.

Some argue that the prison industrial complex is a [public health crisis](https://www.towardsabolition.com/). I wonder if it wasn't so ingrained in our society if it would be seen that way. The very institution of police and prisons are relatively recent - only 200 years or so, and they evolved from slave patrols designed to keep Black people subservient to white interests.

On a very basic level, police officers who putatively ""protect and serve"" might have seen fit to do a voluntary drawdown [during COVID](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/covid-19-turning-prison-terms-death-sentences) since most crimes are not punishable by death.

I was accurate in my assumptions of when it was worth searching MOST of the time. Not from stereotyping people- but from TALKING to people.

In ""Why do endocrine profiles in elite athletes differ between sports"" (Sönksen et al., 2018), the endocrine profiles were measured for 689 elite athletes. In swimming, rowing, handball, and track and field, there are women with testosterone levels near or above 10 nmol/L, and men with levels well below that threshold.

Yes, and if you can do 3 unsuccessful searches in the time one successful search is done it is a *ratio* and not a sheer number. A ratio - just like *percentages* are ratios.

The chance for someone having 30 unsuccessful searches vs someone else having 10 successful searches depends on the chance of a search being successful in the first place. 

Now - yes, it could be a)that the 'selector', deciding which searches are done - influence the chance. But it is as likely the test group the searches are done in have an influence.

edit: I misread the paper.  On re-reading, table 4, model 3 in the paper indicates that women find less contraband per 100 stops, and this difference is statistically significant.  The paper then uses the relatively low rate of search by the Florida Highway Patrol (0.4% of stops on average) to argue that in subjective terms, the total amount of contraband per stop is similar in absolute terms between male and female officers (pretty close to zero).

In fact, the paper says this exactly: ""Male officers are expected to find contraband approximately 0.08 more times per 100 stops than female officers. If rounded, this becomes zero times per 100 stops.""

Imagine for every person you have a percentage of hit. You know this guy is 40%. Men might go for it as they don’t feel afraid. Nothing to lose, 40% chance of success. A woman might be afraid and say 40% isn’t high enough to be worth it. They wait for the 60% person to search.

Im trying to get you to give me you're actual thoughts on something.

Look, I was in a STEM degree and thought that the idea of published and peer reviewed knowledge was incredible! It meant that in any argument or discussion I could ask for a reference and then if they couldnt produce one I would somehow be the victor.

Im doing a Masters now and I realise that alot of what we do in science is using that peer reviewed work as a basis for new ideas.

We see some work and think ""hmmm i wonder if this is the same/different in this scenario"" then we test it and find out. Discussion between people sometimes isnt about being right or wrong but rather an exercise on stretching out beyond what we know to be true and using our different pools of knowledge to arrive at new ideas and questions.

So I personally believe from what I have read that on average men are more aggressive, given this I would generally believe that they are more likely to conduct searches as a way to exert control more so than female officers. That is one way in which i am rationalising the results from this study.

Would you like to use what you know/believe to be true to counter that statement? I think theres an interesting conversation to be had here, im sure you'll agree if you enjoy science as curiousty is the biggest common feature among people like us.

Do you think otherwise ?

Thatd be cool.

Ill your point about cops being more aggressive because that would make sense given the role.

So I suppose then what do you think is the difference between male and female cops here ?

Because like you said if cops in general are more aggresive then my point would make less senss as the gap between male and female aggression should be mitigated by the profession selecting for more aggressive people.

Another idea I had is that maybe women are better at reading people so the male officers read someone incorrectly more often and the female officers are more confident in their ability to pick out people with something to hide.",,,4,0,reddit4

>“How we type on our keyboard and move our mouse seems to be a better predictor of how stressed we feel in an office environment than our heart rate,” explains study author Mara Nägelin, a mathematician who conducts research at the Chair of Technology Marketing and the Mobiliar Lab for Analytics at ETH Zurich. 

>Applied correctly, these findings could be used in future to prevent increased stress in the workplace early on.

>Using new data and machine learning, [ETH Zurich researchers] have developed a model that can tell how stressed we are just from the way we type and use our mouse.

>“People who are stressed move the mouse pointer more often and less precisely and cover longer distances on the screen. Relaxed people, on the other hand, take shorter, more direct routes to reach their destination and take more time doing so,” Nägelin says.

>What’s more, people who feel stressed in the office make more mistakes when typing. They write in fits and starts with many brief pauses. Relaxed people take fewer but longer pauses when typing on a keyboard.

Accuracy in mouse movement is dependent on your muscular response. When you are totally relaxed, your muscles (which for skeletal muscle are always in opposing pairs) are relaxed and any input you give has the fully dynamic range of the system. 

When you are stressed, your muscular tension is high, paired muscles are already tense (but pulling against each other equally) and the dynamic range is low, so accuracy is low (Signal to noise ratio is higher). 

At one end of the spectrum you have Zen and the Art of Archery, or Samurai sword training, where reaction speed is built up by learning to let go and relax muscle tension, and the other is easy to emulate, just tense up and try a reaction test compared to doing the same thing after a minute of box breathing.",kingpubcrisps,t2_62agckxm,6,0,reddit1

It gets stickier with employment or anything that is tied to surviving/thriving, so it's great that this is being studied.  That they respond with anger, for narcissists, makes sense.  That can lead to actions which violate policies as well, depending on their self control.  Either they'll do petty, messy things, or maybe they'll hold back and it festers until they do something more explosive.  It's nicer when things don't come to that, but bullies are bullies.

The study tested a model of negative withdrawal behavior (counterproductive work behavior) to test the role of narcissism as a personality variable (no clinical measure was used). They found a very small (r = .15) relationship with anger, but a nonsignificant and almost zero (r = .03) relationship with behavior. Although one can get good fit to a model where a variable has essentially a zero correlation to something down the causal chain, it is not very strong evidence considering the size of the correlations, not to mention the cross-sectional design. This paper shows that people who score high on narcissism might be inclined to experience more anger (not a trivial finding). The anger finding is consistent with [Penney & Spector 2002](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2389.00199) who found that narcissistic personality is related to anger (as a trait) and to interpersonal counterproductive work behavior.",Readypsyc,t2_8k3o7hd8,1,0,reddit2

I saw your comment and it was like a warm person was gently patting me on the back. I know that's not necessarily healthy and I'm not fond of parasocial relationships on the internet but just thought you should know. 

What I've described happening to me at several facilities has been called toxic by others to whom I describe the conditions. I certainly realize I have bias and cannot accurately assess the situation but there have been more than a few occasions at work where I have literally wondered if I'm crazy, usually when called into a manager's office and they begin by saying ""remember when you were counseled about x y or z?"" And I truly have no memory of being counseled, at any time, about anything.

 I found out over the last few years that this is gaslighting, and although the term is overused it accurately describes how at least three managers I've dealt with operate. The last time it happened  I called her on it and had my union rep with me at the meeting. She was trying to write me up for peeing, in the bathroom, while not on break. 

I'm not even kidding. I was going to get a written warning that day, over peeing, in the bathroom, at work. I told her that I am not going to stop going to the bathroom when I have to go to the bathroom and this has nothing whatsoever to do with whatever she supposedly talked to me about and I am taking this up the chain to a grievance and will fight it until they figure out how to fire me some other way. 

I then promptly got another job. 

This had me feeling like my unmitigated rage was *my fault* because I must have a cluster b personality disorder. I'm literally almost crying writing this all out.

The ethical leadership condition was developed by [Bhal and Dadhich (2011)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-22734-008). The condition read as follows:

*Consider the following individual as your direct supervisor in the workplace:*

*You are working with your supervisor. Your supervisor is a person who can be trusted, makes fair and balanced decisions, and conducts personal life in an ethical manner. Your supervisor defines success not just by results but also by emphasizing the process. Your supervisor also takes the opinions of others before making any decision. Your supervisor listens to employees and disciplines those who violate ethical standards. Your supervisor sets an example of how to do things the right way in terms of ethics. Your supervisor has the best interest of employees in mind and discusses business ethics and values with employees.*

The non-ethical leadership condition read as follows:

*Consider the following individual as your direct supervisor in the workplace:*

*You are working with your supervisor. Your supervisor is a person who cannot be trusted, does not make fair and balanced decisions, and does not conduct personal life in an ethical manner. Your supervisor defines success only in terms of results without any concern for how the results are achieved. Your supervisor also does not take into account the opinions of others before making decisions. Your supervisor does not listen to employees and does not discipline those who violate ethical standards. Your supervisor does not care about employees and never talks about business ethics or values with employees.*

jb1bfbl,t1_jb0wmm2,2023-03-05 18:00:46,science,"This thread is about the self-righteous vs. the self-interested. Often those who are forced to play by the rules will complain bitterly when someone else appears not to be held to the same standards, particularly if they are perceived to be getting ahead, having more, or receiving recognition.

What exactly those standards are (ie.  what is ethical?) actually varies by the group that you are in.

Essentially the fact that you're asking for a universal principal indicates you are looking for a metric you can self-measure against, which is not how this works. Therein lies the fallacy. You can only know by asking the person making the assertion in real-time; at worst, they want you to beg for their approval, which they will grant conditionally day-to-day according to how slighted they feel. At best, it's a type of group-think, or decision by committee. You would periodically conduct your own 1:1 to gather 360 feedback, and modulate your behavior according to the lowest denominator.

The power in that type of organization stems from the idea that some individual or group of individuals is ethically infallible, and a perfectly honorable and fair judge. Or that a system is perfectly fair, such that an imperfect judge would be sufficiently mitigated.

Both systems are equally exploitable, and power rests in the hands of either: the person who defines the principles, or the person who judges the ethical behavior.

If you meant to ask about the traits of NPD, this is well-documented, but I'd advise you to seek a professional diagnosis, not an armchair review by the Internet.

Particularly because the term has become a pejorative label, a convenient political device, and those who attribute overwhelming negativity to it have often experienced an outsized trauma in their life, which has colored the term's most common uses in ways that are highly subjective; meaning it varies by person you ask.",JohnBuxly3487,t2_5uxfzft9,1,0,reddit2

What drives their strategies is a deeper, analytical subject, which I touched on because it is relevant in the one-on-one personal relationship setting, where shame is often revealed in the narcissist's vulnerable moments. In the group setting of a workplace, the narcissist will act differently, withdrawing to avoid conflict and regulate their anger and shame. Not only do they fear consequences of their anger but narcissists are also more sensitive to public perception than individual perceptions.  From the article:

>When employees experience anger due to workplace circumstances, it can lead to withdrawal behaviors that can affect their peers and overall productivity. Withdrawal can look like more absences, longer breaks, or a slowdown in responsiveness. This response is known as an “avoidant” anger response and is more common in the workplace than an “approach” response to anger. If individuals use the approach response, they are more likely to get into conflicts bringing their behavior to the attention of leadership and leaving them vulnerable to discipline or termination. Research has found that when narcissists and those with narcissistic personality traits perceive self-threats, they respond by psychologically avoiding or distancing themselves, hoping to reduce the resulting emotional impact.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,3,0,reddit2

The pathology develops in childhood, even if childhood abuse isnt the only cause. They are shame-sensitive in all cases. If it appears otherwise, then it is because there are two known facets of narcissism- the grandiosity facet and the vulnerability facet. And, each case weights those two strategies differently. This excerpt from the study clarifies:

>The grandiosity facet of narcissism is defined through enhanced self-esteem, extreme perceptions of self-importance, and entitlement, whereas the vulnerability facet of narcissism is commonly studied through the lens of ego threat, hypersensitivity to criticism, and avoidant self-regulatory tendencies (Miller et al., 2011).

The respondent can't be trusted to predict how they would in future respond to an actual ethnical dilemma if they don't even have a foundation in ethics--both because written scenarios don't accurately capture reality (one of the big reasons history is so hard), and because predicting your behaviors is a function of self-knowledge and forethought which a person without a background in ethics is unlikely to have performed.

I’m sure we can all relate to having had, at one point, a narcissist in our friend group who, after enduring their abuse, were outed from the group.

It’s a fairly well documented phenomenon that, in the early stages of their life, the narcissist will attract a lot of friends and short-term relationships. But, as they get older, that number dwindles, either from their own withdrawl, or by forceful expulsion of the group. The end result being that, the older the narcissist gets, the less friends they have and the more they are surrounded by those who are either too weak (either by constitution or life circumstances - re: a wife, husband, children) to stand up to them, those who enable them, or those who themselves are manipulating them. Narcissists, by their very nature, and the nature of non narcissists, build for themselves a life of illusion and lie - of deception, of having no real friends. They truly live live in a world wherein the power struggle is everything, ala Foucault, et. Al. 

It’s incredibly, incredibly destructive. In the past when Kings and Queens were the norm a single narcissist with too much power could single handedly destroy an entire society.

jb55eco,t1_jb1fybd,2023-03-06 14:49:40,science,"First, a narcissist at work will also be an even greater narcissist at home. So, instead of focusing on work specific clues, you should consider the clues about how you treat a partner at home. If you have none, then look at how you treat friends or other members of the public.

The problem with self-diagnosis of narcissism is subjectivity, even if you are educated about narcissism. Not knowing you at all, we cannot say if you are narcissistic, either. So, the advice given by the previous commenter- to seek a professional diagnosis- is good advice. Even if it doesnt give you the fast and easy answer you were looking for, it is the *right* answer. 

Nearly every narcissist will subjectively deny the known traits, even if their behavior meets the definition. This is because anything which makes a narcissist look bad will result in their denial. The only known trait which you might be able to see in yourself objectively is episodic anger when *you think* someone has insulted you. But you see, this is exactly where subjectivity become the problem. You can easily defend that you should be angry when insulted and how sensitive should one be to insults- an entirely subjective matter. 

Probably the best clue is the opinion of people who know you. A narcissist isn't likely to ask friends to give them a negative review but if you dare, then take it as a strong clue that you need further professional diagnosis if your friends all report that you are sensitive to criticism and react strongly with anger. Even your friends might miss other clues. 

Professionals are educated and trained at fitting the observable clues to the diagnostic criteria. While anyone can look up the diagnostic criteria, it is tricky to know that each sign is or isnt due to another issue. If you had an electrical problem with your car's electronics, you would be equally well advised not to try to start tracking it down with a meter and no knowledge other than how to connect the battery.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,1,0,reddit2

jayy194,t1_jaytarq,2023-03-05 03:39:46,science,"Narcissism is about a lot more than attention seeking. That is their ideal but adverse circumstances of any kind typically result in avoidant anger:

>The grandiosity facet of narcissism is defined through enhanced self-esteem, extreme perceptions of self-importance, and entitlement, whereas the vulnerability facet of narcissism is commonly studied through the lens of ego threat, hypersensitivity to criticism, and **avoidant self-regulatory tendencies** (Miller et al., 2011). 

The phrase in bold describes the withdrawal, in clinical terms. Narcissists withdraw when necessary to regulate the emotional impact of perceived threats. The study is making the distinction between the *avoidant angry scenario* and the *approaching angry scenario*. Healthy personalities will use the approaching style and direct anger with the intent to resolve conflict. 

As for the nature of the insults and their subsequent anger, this passage from the study describes their reason for reacting:

>Anger is an emotion that involves feelings of indignation and occurs when one perceives wrongdoing by another person (Gibson & Callister, 2010; Haidt, 2003). Because narcissists view behaviors that impede their goals as a wrongdoing (Konrath, Bushman, & Campbell, 2006), **ethical leaders, which elevate the group and morality over self-gain, are likely to be viewed as infringing upon the narcissist's self-goals.**

That's because narcissistic strategies are quite unethical- deceit, manipulation, callousness. It isnt about not getting a raise.

Many clinicians will use the circumplex by locating a position for the patient *within the wheel,* to indicate a healthy balance of traits. Designing a list of traits and arranging them on a circular chart helps clinicians better understand how personalities found on opposing positions of the wheel interact and/or conflict.

What is most interesting is that narcissists will seek out those who appear to them initially as having traits from the opposite side of the circumplex, indicating an agreeable and submissive personality that is easily exploited. To those who are so exploitable, the consequences are very destructive to the personality of the abused victim. For those who arent exploitable, there is more conflict but the victim can emerge with their personalities more or less intact, if they handle the conflict wisely. 

To locate the positions of each: psychopathy, machiavellianism and narcissism on the circumplex, I can refer you to [this source](https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~dpaulhus/research/CIRCUMPLEX/chapters/Jones&Paulhus_2011_SITAR_%20chapter.pdf) . You can scroll down to fig. 15.1  where each is represented by letters P,M,N.

For example consider a certain former US President saying he was the greatest person ever the smartest person ever the best at everything. This was an attempt to manipulate people and yes it worked on some people but it was also quite obvious to many others that it was a shallow attempt at manipulation. 

Concealing emotions is not very easy for such people because they tend to react negatively to any kind of negative feedback they throw tantrums. So rather than concealing emotions they tend to express negative emotions when they get upset. 

What you are thinking of is actually more properly machiavellianism. This is a related but distinct dark trait. People high in machiavellianism are excellent at manipulating other people can conceal emotions as needed and generally are quite subtle and duplicitous. 

But that is a very different story than narcissism.

Do you think we pick Americans at random for clinical trials? Of course not. What's important is random *assignment*. That's the part that allows you to isolate the effect of the treatment. It creates pre-treatment groups that are as similar as possible by distributing known and unknown biases equally. Sampling method affects the *generalizability* of your results.

If you want to make a claim about American political beliefs, then you need a sample that is representative of Americans. You might randomize phone numbers or addresses to get a reasonably representative sample. You could also use stratification to replace much of the randomization.

If you want to make a claim about the effect of Flozac™ on the human liver, you do not need a random sample. Most human livers are quite similar, relatively speaking, so as long as your sample has good range in terms of sex, age, and weight, you're good to go.

jb6ye3h,t1_jb6nr1i,2023-03-06 22:09:41,science,"The best way to understand what happens in a comprehensive form is for me to explain that shame-counteracting strategies of the narcissist come in 2 facets: the grandiosity facet and the vulnerability facet. The latter includes the more harmful behaviors of blame-shifting, gaslighting, lies, manipulations, devaluations, insults, criticisms, rejections, etc. While grandiosity is constructive, the strategies of the vulnerability facet are destructive to relating personalities.

As I see it, there are two main effects of exposure: 

Depression.  

1) Blame-shifting is an externalizing strategy to counteract the shame they feel.  Blame shifted to the victim means they will internalize what the narcissist is externalizing. Depression is largely the result of a thought pattern which unrealistically blames oneself for disappointments caused by both external and internal factors. That is what makes depression an internalizing disorder. 2) Devaluations, criticism, insults, and rejections serve the narcissist's purpose for counteracting shame by self-suggesting a favorable comparison of themselves to their abuse victim. This always aggravates the worthless/hopeless symptoms which originate from the self-blame of depression. 

Confusion. 

Whether it seems so or not, each person has their own conception of reality and whether some of those realities reflect actual reality or not is less important than being able to own and maintain a chosen conception of reality.  The problem with exposure to abuse is that gaslighting, lies, manipulations and even blame-shifting leave us confused about the validity of what was our reality, prior to the deceptions, as well as whether the imposed reality is to be trusted. Chronic exposure to this type of abuse leaves us feeling confused, directionless, empty and vulnerable. These effects last a long time after exposure as well, leaving the victim confused about whether or not their abuser was such a bad person, even while consciously knowing they were abused. Those who are able to survive with their personality intact are the ones who hold firm to their chosen reality, in part because that also defeats the narcissist's externalization of blame to the victim; therefore, largely defeating the depressive effects as well.",dansvans72,t2_9ro5a,1,0,reddit2

Random sampling is useful, but to say that an RCT *must* have random sampling is simply incorrect; what it must have is random assignment.

[Berger 2002](https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/jmasm/vol1/iss1/11/): ""One salient feature of randomized clinical trials is that patients are randomly allocated to treatment groups, but not randomly sampled from any target population. Without random sampling parametric analyses are inexact, yet they are still often used in clinical trials.""

[Elwood 1982](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7082529/): ""Ideally, a complete sampling frame should be constructed, that is, a list of every available subject who fulfils the criteria relevant to the trial. In practice this is usually unattainable in clinical research, and a sampling frame may have to be limited to, say, all the patients who attended a particular clinic""

Random sampling is important for generalizability and even expected in some fields. But it's not what the ""R"" in ""RCT"" stands for, and it's not a defining feature of RCTs. Your claim that Study 1 is not an RCT is simply incorrect.",potatoaster,t2_640xi,1,0,reddit2

Leaders behaving badly: The relationship between narcissism and unethical leadership

Carrie A Blair, Katherine Helland, Bill Walton

Leadership & Organization Development Journal 38 (2), 333-346, 2017

Purpose

Narcissism is often cited as a construct that is likely related to unethical leadership. Still, only a handful of empirical studies have examined the relationship between narcissism and workgroup outcomes, and practically none have linked narcissism to leader behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to use narcissism scores to predict behaviors associated with unethical leadership in a controlled setting.

Design/methodology/approach

Participants completed a measure of narcissistic personality. Participants also completed an administrative assessment center (AC). Qualitative analysis was used to code the behaviors in the AC into dimensions associated with unethical leader behavior.

Findings

Narcissism was related to the display of unethical behaviors during the AC. Scores on the narcissism scale correlated positively with behaviors associated with unethical leadership, including one-way communication, control of power, insensitivity to others, an unrealistic assessment of the environment, manipulative communication, and pseudo-transformational behaviors.


Second, it is important to distinguish between any leader and ethical leadership. You seem to confuse these very different concepts, and assume that any one described as a leader will be an ethical leader. No. That is the entire point of the ethical leadership literature--to examine a subset of leaders who demonstrate particularly ethical leadership as opposed to any kind of leadership which may include leaders high in narcissism or other dark traits.

You are correct noting that narcissism and other traits do predict leadership emergence, though not leader effectiveness, under some conditions, considering the effect size is not that large. For Example here is a meta-analysis: 


Narcissism and leadership: A meta‐analytic review of linear and nonlinear relationships

Emily Grijalva, Peter D Harms, Daniel A Newman, Blaine H Gaddis, R Chris Fraley

Personnel Psychology 68 (1), 1-47, 2015

Past empirical studies relating narcissism to leadership have offered mixed results. This study integrates prior research findings via meta‐analysis to make 4 contributions to theory on narcissism and leadership, by (a) distinguishing between leadership emergence and leadership effectiveness, to reveal that narcissism displays a positive relationship with leadership emergence, but no relationship with leadership effectiveness; (b) showing narcissism's positive effect on leadership emergence can be explained by leader extraversion; (c) demonstrating that whereas observer‐reported leadership effectiveness ratings (e.g., supervisor‐report, subordinate‐report, and peer‐report) are not related to narcissism, self‐reported leadership effectiveness ratings are positively related to narcissism; and (d) illustrating that the nil linear relationship between narcissism and leadership effectiveness masks an underlying curvilinear trend, advancing the idea that there exists an optimal, midrange level of leader narcissism.


However, this is measuring leadership in general and not ethical leadership specifically. As the article I mentioned above describes, when people hire in narcissism become leaders they tend to act in an ethical way rather than ethical ways. 

Just because some people high in narcissism can become leaders does not mean that ethical leaders are narcissistic and in fact the data suggest the opposite.",TargaryenPenguin,t2_2pr84s5a,1,0,reddit2

Yes; and allowing an employee who harms the work and well-being of others to continue working at the institution is counter to that.

> HR is not your friend. HR is there to protect the company.

It's the duty of all employees to benefit, or at least not harm, the company; otherwise, from the company's perspective, they shouldn't work there. Though it might still make sense from the individual's viewpoint; sometimes you just really need that money and can't afford to try to change jobs..

Protecting the employees though is, usually, benefiting the company. This is why sometimes outside investors ruin the culture and environment of the company, as they tend to demand short-term profits over long-term well-being. That tends to slip to unethical leadership style.

> If the company decides that the ""problem"" employee is more valuable (and narcissists are adept at navigating institutional power to fulfill their narcissistic supply) then the person complaining will be managed out.

In a book called ""Hiring for Attitude"", the author(s) call these people ""Talented Terrors"". Superficially, it _seems_ that they make up for their negative traits with high performance, but typically if you actually look at their total impact, it's far into the negative side.

It's a type of a problem hire that ordinary hiring processes are bad at spotting. These sort of people tend to cruise through recruiting processes due to their skill in convincing people and their technical capabilities.

But in truth they turn out to be a burden, and I do agree that they are a burden that is hard to get rid of. It would be ideal to not hire them to begin with, as sometimes a too passive or careful management fails to properly spot how problematic they are and act accordingly.

> I'm happy for you that you have a workplace you have such trust in. Your situation is not the rule for most, perhaos even the vast majority of workers.

No I 100% agree that most employees don't work in as good conditions and with as good culture as they would deserve.

ewvql6j,t1_ewv5ugq,2019-08-14 19:44:44,science,"""There are too many other people!  They're the problem, and I won't change until they do!""

Blaming population is passing the buck.  If the population went down, per-person consumption would rise and nothing would change.  

The population is largely stable or even going down in most  industrialized nations but their consumption is still rising.  The third-world regions we associate w/over population have much lower per-capita consumption.  

The pollution in the third world is largely a direct result of manufacturing and extraction done to meet demands of modernized societies.

And the claim that ""these poor nations will push us over the brink as they improve their standard of living to match ours"" is the ultimate denial of our responsibility for the dire condition of our planetary ecosystem.

How about adopting a mindset along the lines of ""I need to live in a manner which our planet can support, despite my ability to have a more lavish lifestyle.""

Or just own it: ""I'm causing these problems but I don't want to put out the effort and make the sacrifices to reduce my impacts.""

Hanging around with a group of like-minded people, and telling each other that ""There are too many people -- besides us -- who are trying to have the same lifestyle as we have, and we won't (or can't) do anything about it until they do"" is the worst thing possible for the future of our planet.",cybicle,t2_11gp3n,1,0,reddit3

ewvunxb,t1_ewvsfb4,2019-08-14 20:25:20,science,"> I'd like a source about ""regular"" (I presume you mean chemical) sunscreen ""absorbing into the skin.""

I don't use the word chemical because mineral sunscreens also contain ""chemicals"". But that's the whole health concern, that the absorb all the way into your blood stream and could have health effects due to that: https://www.wired.com/story/sunscreen-chemicals-soak-all-the-way-into-your-bloodstream/

> many chemical sunscreens are carcinogenic 

There is no evidence I've been able to find any sunscreens cause cancer. 

https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/6-sunscreen-myths-debunked.h26-1592202.html

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-science-of-sunscreen

Sun damage, however, has definitely been proven to cause cancer! Now there is some concern about some sunscreen ingredients causing other health effects, and evidence for damage to coral by some ingredients. So it's definitely wise to stick with reef safe or mineral sunscreens in the ocean. And mineral sunscreen works just fine, just have to rub it in more and apply more often. Like I said I personally find it more of pain in the butt but I still use it. I've had pretty good luck with Blue Lizard and Sum Bum versions, the sun bum mineral tinted is actually the easiest to rub in I've found but it's also not super cheap at $15 for 1.7 ounces, so I use it for my face only and normally use blue lizard on my arms and legs.",,,3,0,reddit3

You probably know that in heat like that even being naked wouldn't help much, but wearing loose-fitting clothing keeps the sun off your skin, which can help you feel less exhaustion. If you invest in a high-quality wicking fabric that's really breathable that's where it's at.

Chemical sunscreens have been absolutely useless down here for me, regardless of SPF (tried before I learned the difference). I don't even bother. Australian Gold is a lotion. It's worked very well for me! They sell 3 kinds in Ulta: tinted, untinted, and fragrance free (for kids). They sell it at the Long's near us, too. The tinted one is lovely but too dark on me. I haven't tried the regular version because I don't like fragrance. I use the kids' version, which is spf 50.It dries matte and I've never managed to sweat it off (seriously, I love this stuff). I've developed a sensitivity to one of the ingredients, so I can't use it on my face anymore, but I've never been burnt while wearing it, even out all day at the beach. Regular soap takes it off in the shower, but you'll need a makeup wipe or face wash to get it off your face, otherwise it's not coming off. So just be prepared. Seriously.

It's a zinc sunscreen, so it'll give you a bit of a white cast, but I'll take it. Just have a mirror or a helpful friend if you need to reapply (so you don't turn into Casper). I rarely reapply because it hangs around so long. Tinted versions of mineral sunscreens exist if you're really self-conscious about it. 

Other sunscreens I recommend: Blue Lizard (make sure you're buying the mineral kind because they do sell ones with chemical ingredients as well). La Roche Posay sells mineral sunscreens as well (sold at Long's, at least my Long's) that are supposed to be high quality, but I haven't tried any.

When you're looking at sunscreens, make sure to look at the percentage of active ingredients. Australian Gold is 4% zinc, 4% titanium dioxide. That's on the lower end, but it's worked great for me. Blue Lizard is 10% zinc, 5% titanium dioxide. That's pretty good! Stay away from stuff that is on the low side, like 1 or 2%.

Also, if you want a lip protectant, I've been using Pacfica's mineral tinted lip balm ($5 at Ulta) and haven't had any issues. It's spf 30, doesn't taste weird, and seems fine. They have 2 different sheer colors (really just looks like my normal lips) plus untinted, which I imagine has a white cast.

Titanium, to my knowledge, also isn't the heavy hitter in mineral sunscreens--zinc is much more successful at blocking UVA. There aren't very many straight up titanium sunscreens that I'm aware of, so that makes me wonder 1.) why didn't they measure zinc, which is by far the more common and useful ingredient in mineral sunscreens? and 2.)

ewwisfj,t1_eww76f2,2019-08-15 00:28:39,science,"Sorry, I was trying to type out the previous reply while wrangling a toddler so I wasn't very clear.

Without getting too technical, UV grade zinc oxide particles are easier to ""shape"" during manufacturing to balance transparency (i.e. the level of whiteness on skin) and broad spectrum protection as it is better at providing UVA.  Titanium dioxide, while primarily a UVB booster, actually can also provide broad spectrum protection by itself (the FDA considers anything above 370 nm critical wavelength to be broad spectrum) but the unique physical structure of TiO2 above that CW usually makes it  far too whitening for most consumer preferences.

ZnO is very much not a skin irritant - in fact it is also an anti-irritant as well, which is what makes it so effective in diaper rash creams.  To clarify, the FDA in-vivo protocol involves measuring the level of irritation on a test subject's skin post sunscreen application.  Using botanical actives or extracts with known anti-irritation benefits (and no conmeasurate UV benefit) is one way some manufacturers artificially boost SPF.   

The FDA is very much aware of this practice, but has their hands full just trying to validate the safety data (or lack thereof) on existing known UV actives.  To give you an idea of how deliberate they are, the FDA only recently announced their intention to elevate zinc oxide to GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status as an approved UV filter.",The_Musing_Platypus,t2_wwiy3,2,0,reddit3

ex0pa70,t1_ewyzhmi,2019-08-16 01:26:58,science,"It might be more clear if I explain how the FDA testing protocol works in a smidge more detail.  It involves applying a set amount of sunscreen within a specific surface area on the subjects skin.  Now bear in mind that SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor, and roughly tells you how long one can stay exposed to the sun before damage occurs.   Thus the test protocol will focus on how long the skin can remain exposed to UV light before showing irritation.  The longer this takes, the higher the SPF rating for the sunscreen.

Now this test assumes that the sunscreen actives are actively preventing UV light from reaching the skin, either by quenching the UV radiation (i.e. chemical sunscreen actives) or physically reflecting them (i.e. zinc oxide and titanium dioxide), and any skin irritation or lack thereof would demonstrate the protective effectiveness of the sunscreen.  Certain anti-irritation botanicals, on the other hand, may reduce such irritation without providing any actual mechanism to prevent the UV rays from hitting the skin surface.  So what happens is it may look like your SPF is going up from the test results, but it is really just the illusion of protection.

So yes, zinc oxide provides a dual benefit of being an anti-irritant while also acting as a physical barrier to UV radiation - you may think this may make it easier to hit higher SPF in this test, but the physical characteristics of zinc oxide actually make this quite difficult (hence why titanium dioxide is still used as it is more efficient at boosting SPF).  Another way to look at this is that zinc oxide is better at UVA protection while titanium dioxide is better at UVB, and SPF is purely a measure of UVB protection.  On the other hand, pure anti-irritant ingredients, whether they come from natural or synthetic sources, do not provide any UV protection at all (if they did, the FDA would be evaluating them for approval as an actual UV active, which is a SUPER long process), and really just provide formulators a way to artificially boost SPF while keeping costs down by reducing the amount of actual UV actives.  As mentioned many times in this thread, mineral sunscreens are much more expensive - this is mainly due to the cost of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide since there are  only a handful of plants around the world that manufacturer USP and UV grade mineral filters, so some brands are incentivized to reduce UV active concentration by using these anti irritants and film formers to keep overall formulation costs down.  *Cough* Coola *cough cough*",The_Musing_Platypus,t2_wwiy3,2,0,reddit3

>Diversification is a widely proposed policing reform, but its impact is difficult to assess. We used records of millions of daily patrol assignments, determined through fixed rules and preassigned rotations that mitigate self-selection, to compare the average behavior of officers of different demographic profiles working in comparable conditions. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians. These effects are largest in majority-Black areas of Chicago and stem from reduced focus on enforcing low-level offenses, with greatest impact on Black civilians. Female officers also use less force than males, a result that holds within all racial groups. These results suggest that diversity reforms can improve police treatment of minority communities.

And here's the link to the study: [**LINK**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6530/696)

Also, figure 5 has some interesting results. In predominantly black and predominantly white areas, black officers stopped less people and used less force (10-20 less stops per shift).

0.1 fewer TIMES over 100 shifts for use of force.  That's not 10%, that's a numerical 0.1 fewer times over 100 shifts, that's 0.001%.  But when broken down by predominant ethnicity of the neighborhood, it becomes even more interesting.  Very curiously, the data does not provide any analysis on how the race of the officer's numbers differ based on neighborhood ethnicity.  For example, do white officers make the same approximate number of stops regardless of neighborhood?  I see white vs. black officers contrasted here, but not white officer in black neighborhood vs white in white neighborhood.  We should be looking at consistency as well, which will give us a better feel for racial bias.  We'd also need to correct for violent and petty crime rates.

>Turning first to Black officers, Fig. 3 shows that when faced with comparable working conditions over the course of 100 shifts, this group makes 15.16 fewer stops and 1.93 fewer arrests, and it uses force 0.10 fewer times than white counterparts on average—that is, compared to white officers given the same patrol assignment, in the same month, on the same day of the week, and at the same shift time (all padj < 0.001 after Benjamini-Hochberg multiple-testing correction for all cross-group comparisons and all categories and subcategories of enforcement). 

Turns into these percentages

>These gaps are large, representing 29, 21, and 32% of the average stop, arrest, and use-of-force volume for white officers citywide...

In the course of a 100 shifts during the same month and in the same neighborhood, black male police officers make ~2 less arrests. And, that is roughly 20% less than white male officers in the same 100 shifts? So, a black dude is making 4 arrests/shifts and a white dude is making 6 arrests/100shifts?

If it's just an extra 15 speeding tickets the is representative of the populationg, then I'd say that's more proactive policing and they're just earning their keep.",Send_Me_Broods,t2_5fglfrs5,25,0,reddit4

>To assess the impact of diversity in law enforcement, we draw on newly collected data, assembled through years of open-records requests, that allow us to overcome long-standing limitations. These include officer demographics, language skills, daily shift assignments, and career progression. We link these files to time-stamped, geolocated records of the same officers’ decisions to stop, arrest, and use force against civilians. After aggressively pruning data to maximize analytic validity, we compile a panel of 2.9 million officer shifts and 1.6 million enforcement events by nearly 7000 officers covering the years 2012 through 2015. Most notably, we leverage fine-grained information on daily patrol assignments, which vary exogenously on the basis of fixed rules and preassigned rotations, to examine how officers of different groups behave when faced with comparable circumstances and civilian behaviors.

I see that as a testament to the difficulty of studying our society... but all the same, I never quite feel convinced by anything a sociology study tells me.

Compare this to my own field of research, aerospace engineering. Sure there can be disagreements between studies, but for the most part findings are very objective and can be taken quite seriously. There’s a big difference between natural science, engineering, math, etc. and social science/psychology somehow.

uses of force without adjustment for time or location.

>**Average instances of use of force per 100 shifts:**

> Black officers:  0.16

> Hispanic officers: 0.30

0.16-0.32=0.16 fewer uses of force per 100 shifts

0.16/0.32 = 50% reduction in use of force

That's without adjusting for time and location (patrol assignment, month, week, and shift time) which is why it differs a bit from the text of the paper (0.10 fewer uses of force per 100 shifts for a 68% reduction in volume).

EDIT: corrected 2 errors; 1) I was comparing overall use of force in the paper to use of force against black citizens in the supplement and 2) I misread ""representing 32% of the use-of-force volume"" as a 32% reduction when this is actually a 68% reduction.",misplaced_pants,t2_ab6am,11,0,reddit4

There are roughly 50 million black people in the US. Half of 15,000 is 7,500. 7,500 is 0.015% of 50 million which means about 0.015% of the black population is responsible for half the country's murders. 

So what intelligent assumption could you make about the ethics of an entire race of people based off 0.015% of them?

As a blatant example, if the white officer and black officer had their stats flipped, many people would draw the conclusion that even though they make less arrests, white officers target black civilians more while being more lenient with white ones. But you still make a good point and we can still compare their use of force with stops made. We get:

>  
>Hispanic officers use force against blacks in 0.7% of stops  
>  
>White officers use force against blacks in 0.7% of stops

It does appear that black officers are slightly less likely to use force here. But, Hispanics are just as likely to use force against blacks as whites. The title is blatantly pinning whites as the abnormal one, when the outlier is clearly black officers. The title says hispanics make ""far fewer stops and arrests"", when the data shows *slightly* fewer stops, and *more* arrests than whites.

(From the actual study):

Mean use of force per 100 shifts is only 0.27. Hispanic officers used force 0.30 times and white officers 0.32 times, while Black officers only 0.16 times. For white officers, 72% of those instances where against black civilians; for hispanic officers, 70%; and for black officers 88% of those instances were against black civilians.

The only takeaway here seems to be that whites and hispanics are more likely to use force during a stop than black officers. Which may sound like a story... except you have to stop and ask yourself ""does the use of force happening less than half a percent of the time sound like a problem?""

It doesn't. The difference between 0.16 and 0.32 times out of 100 stops might be ***relatively*** big, but when you zoom out it's negligible. Less than one half of one stops out of 100... no matter which race, sex, religion, gender, etc. you want to slice it.",rayluxuryyacht,t2_iy7co,0,0,reddit4

In these contexts, I very much do have the assumption of shared experiences with other White travelers, regardless of their country of origin.

The idea behind ""White privilege"" is that most, if not all, White people do have significant overlap in life experiences in terms of tangibly and intangibly benefiting from their Whiteness. Whether it is something they are readily willing to acknowledge is another question. Just as it can be difficult to discern whether an individual has been treated poorly in one single incident because of his or her skin color, so too it is difficult to discern whether an individual has been treated favorably in one single incident because of his or her skin color. However, over time the accumulation of incidents would pretty clearly point in the direction that Whites do have the shared experience of benefiting from their skin color, just as Blacks have the shared experience of being treated worse because of that same factor.

So agreeing that all Black people across the world likely have the shared experience of being discriminated against based on their skin color and ancestral origin, I do think equally Whites have a shared experienced of benefiting based on their skin color and ancestral origin.",handbookforgangsters,t2_8q3km1ha,1,0,reddit4

If gravitational theory was consistently wrong in its experimental predictions %1 of the time it would be an incomplete scientific theory.

Also I missed your edit on your previous comment so I'll respond to it here. Yes your quote mentioned ""civilian behavior"" but deeper in the Sciencemag article they clarify what they mean by civilian behavior:

> Our results also reveal patterns requiring further study, especially with regard to causal mechanisms. One explanation for these disparities centers on racial bias, i.e., white officers are more likely than Black officers to harass Black civilians. Technically, it is also possible that Black officers respond more leniently when observing crimes in progress (25). Though we cannot fully disentangle these observationally equivalent explanations, our data show that these enforcement disparities are predominantly focused on relatively minor crimes, not violent offenses, suggesting little trade-off in terms of public safety. Arbitrating between these competing mechanisms will require objective information on civilian behavior.

ibld31l,t3_v7mf5w,2022-06-08 10:32:55,science,"Individuals who contract COVID‐19 often experience memory, attention, and concentration problems, even after recovering from the initial illness. A new study from the University of Waterloo shows individuals who had contracted CCOVID‐19 reported significantly more cognitive failures at work.

“COVID-19 is going to be an ongoing part of life, at least for the foreseeable future,” said James Beck, an associate professor in Waterloo’s Psychology department. “It is now common for people to catch COVID-19, recover, and then return to work. Yet, in our study, people who had contracted COVID-19 reported more difficulties at work, relative to people who had never caught COVID.”

Beck and his graduate student, Arden Flow, collected data from a sample of 94 full-time working adults who either had or had not contracted COVID‐19 at least one month prior to the study. Both groups were matched on key demographic characteristics. 

“Relative to the group who had never had COVID-19, the group who had contracted COVID-19 reported more cognitive failures at work, which are defined as problems with memory, attention, and action,” Beck said. 

A second finding of the work is that cognitive failures were associated with decreased self-ratings of job performance, as well as increased intentions to voluntarily leave one’s current job.

ibnj110,t1_ibnahr1,2022-06-08 20:43:42,science,Nope. All the problems started after I was infected and were very very obviously related to the infection. I wasn’t stressed nor isolated nor quarantined nor any of that. I was back to work almost immediately (essential worker) but wasn’t a hospital employee so the stresses of that didn’t affect me either. The vaccines didn’t do anything to me (no side effects) and I had 0 issues months after getting vaccinated. It all started when I got sick and I wasn’t expecting it either (I wasn’t particularly afraid of it given I’m young and healthy and took only moderate precautions related to not trying to get my parents sick). It also all correlated with the damage to my senses of smell/taste which are still messed up. Its clear the virus causes brain damage in some.

The participant who had the lowest concentration (participant 8) had things in place such as an air purifier, bathroom fan, used a vacuum cleaner, didn't use lawn chemicals, and had an electric stove, with only 2 family members. 

If this participant also didn't have a pet, had hardwood instead of partial carpet, and opened windows for ventilation I'm sure their score would be even lower. 

That's not even considering the fact that their house was cooler and less humid than the other participants houses, which would also help.

So all this study does is highlight that if you have poor ventilation, and use things that contain harsh chemicals and pollutants, with nothing to help improve the quality of the air in your house, then you will have higher concentrations of fine particulate matter in your home.

hw7nwxv,t3_sobfma,2022-02-09 11:32:01,science,"A new study from the Texas A&M University School of Public Health suggests the air quality inside homes may not stack up against air quality inside office buildings.

The pilot study, published in the journal Atmosphere, delves into indoor air quality and health outcomes in people working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers measured indoor air quality in both the offices and homes of employees in 2019 and 2020 and evaluated their health outcomes during those periods.

Air pollution indoors is most often linked to building materials and the activities of people living and working in those buildings. These pollutants include volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from carpet and furniture, paints and other chemicals as well as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and mold.

Prolonged exposure to indoor air pollutants is associated with a wide range of poor health outcomes, from headaches and dry eyes to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. These outcomes have driven significant work into improving office building indoor air quality. However, the percentage of people working from home has grown dramatically over the past two decades and skyrocketed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning home indoor air quality can be considered a workplace health issue.

Taehyun Roh, assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Genny Carrillo, associate professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Texas A&M School of Public Health, along with colleagues from Houston Methodist Hospital and Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, analyzed indoor air quality in an office building between May and July of 2019 and then at the employees’ respective homes between June and September 2020.

>Simulation with a system dynamics model revealed that the implementation of **energy efficiency measures in public buildings has a major impact on indoor air quality**, leading to an energy efficiency/indoor air quality dilemma. On the one hand, energy efficiency measures in public buildings reduce both national energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, but on the other hand they **reduce indoor air quality thus causing losses in productivity for building occupants**. If mechanical ventilation is used, indoor air quality is improved and productivity is increased but this comes with increased energy consumption. The simulation results show that if ventilation is operated according to national building standards, total energy consumption in public buildings increases by 1.3 % in 2014 and by 2 % in 2040 (orCO2 emissions 7050 t/year) compared to the situation where there is no mechanical ventilation. If the implementation of the energy efficiency measures is increasing at higher rate, the difference between both alternatives is increasing more. In schools the key goal of education is improving individual outcomes as Hayward, Hunt and Lord \[12\] have emphasized in their research. The priority should be buildings that achieve sustainable development and yet meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

hw7xq81,t3_sobfma,2022-02-09 13:10:20,science,"5.	Conclusions
This pilot study assessed workplace IAQ and SBS symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in academic administrative staff members whose workplace changed from office to home due to the pandemic. Low-cost sensors were found suitable for in situ and continuous IAQ monitoring due to their simplicity, speed, and data accessibility. This study found that working from home may cause greater health issues for employees due to poor home IAQ, emphasizing the importance of the interventions to improve the home IAQ. One of the recommendations to enhance IAQ at homes can be achieved through behavioral changes such as opening windows and doors unless the outdoor air quality is harmful. Another approach is to provide remote workers with portable air purifiers with HEPA filters, particularly in locations where appropriate ventilation is difficult to attain. Lastly, integrating these strategies with smart building technologies would maximize the health and wellness of building occupants.

Office buildings have better monitoring and quality control over air than at home but that could be fixed by…. Opening a window…",,,1,0,reddit2

hw9xh8i,t3_sobfma,2022-02-09 20:56:48,science,"I have lots of thoughts on this. 

Most offices fail all measures of sustainability and environment care. Air conditioning is a serious part of that. They often simply circulate air after cooling it. Less than healthy oxygen levels… indoor chemical emissions from modern plastics and floor coverings, all swirling around. So you would ideally need a gas filter, not just a particle filter. 

The filters are… pretend filters, that only collect the largest particles. The ones I have seen take large quantities of water to clean. 

Where the office draws air in from outside, meaning it’s not simply concentrating microscopic dusts and chemicals that are more or less dangerous when inhaled over long periods, things are better, but there’s usually a limited filter on that too, so while the particulate levels are lower, and the oxygen is higher, carbon dioxide lower, and while the noxious emissions from plasticers and particle boards and glues and synthetic carpets and paints and all the other indoor modern materials are reduced due to the small quantities of air brought in, overall, the air quality is still terrible. 

The only time this is acceptable is when the outdoors air quality is worse. That is common when there are factories or power plants or mills burning coal, or using industrial chemicals, such as in nations that are major manufacturers. I’m not considering natural dusts from desertification as toxic or moulds and spores and pollens as pollutants, as the key to a joyful life is to recognise the massive value in being able to tolerate the conditions we evolved in over many millions of years. Face masks can be used if you’re allergic to natural dusts and airborne organics from flora.

Also, anywhere that cars travel at medium to high speeds, they create dusts from brake pads, from tyres contacting road surfaces, from exhausts (most catalytic converters are limited as to what they can do for exhausts, and it’s still a toxic poison that’s emitted). Those dusts are what’s brought into the buildings as ‘clean air’. So air pollution is a critical issue also in all suburban and urban regions. 

The outcome, the inhaled pollution, it’s a contributor to health issues, and wherever there are air conditioned buildings using legacy technologies and roads that have typical cars and other heavy vehicles and start/stop traffic, even where air is drawn in from outside, you’ll see long term health consequences that become especially prevalent in older age when experienced people are most valued and important, and when their lifetime of work and effort is suppose to culminate in a happy and healthy retirement that allows them to enjoy life, rather than suffer through health consequences. 

The way to overcome this is to have lightweight transportation using modern materials. Bicycles etc. or cars and motorbikes and scooters that go at slow speeds reducing tyre dust. To keep the vehicles inside or undercover so the tyres don’t prematurely perish from uv exposure. If cars, they should be slow moving to reduce dusts also, ideally of a much more lightweight design and self-driving. Between the slow speed and lightweight design you have less need for heavy brakes and tyres, and can use far lower weight batteries and you have less wind resistance, the self-driving means a slightly slower transit time is fine as one can do other things during the journey. 

Also, planting out cities where dirt is exposed. Wherever there are trees and plants, especially long grasses and weeds, you have a reduction in dusts from exposed dry soils and plants that help. So the use of chemical sprays to control weed growth on dirt surrounding trees or other flora isn’t a sound use of labour resources. Best is to control the weeds through planting grasses and creepers and small plant species that can crowd out the messy random weeds that might cause issues from more severe allergens or might not provide year-round cover during dry periods. 

When working from home, the way I managed air quality was to put a fan in a window drawing air in from outdoors and stand and sit in front of it. This was because after all considerations, the overall higher quality of air was outside, and no affordable technology was able to overcome the risks from emitted chemicals of a toxic nature and problems with paints, microplastics and microfibres and other dusts and danders from dust mites (arachnids) and insects that in my particular case were assessed (non-scientifically) as a greater health risk. The house didn’t have screens and it was unaffordable for me to install them as I had debts. I also didn’t have any renewable energy options, so I relied on direct on-bare-skin ambient air circulation to keep cool and happy in 30-35 degree heats while working and active. As my air quality was from outdoors, my need to maintain time and energy consuming cleaning was lower, so overall the environment appeared ‘dirtier’. 

Things today are different, but only if you have income. But it’s possible to do much with limited incomes. 

Thanks to the competitive manufacturers in China and other nations, low cost goods can be used to screen a house or unit, low cost air quality sensors are available, that include primitive forms of chemical detection. Air conditioning is improving, heat exchangers are more efficient and use less materials and renewable energy sources are available, and you can purchase low cost carbon offsets elsewhere or support health or conservation initiatives if your energy isn’t renewable or is polluting (though sadly Energy companies are sometimes too blind to see that they need to clearly state to the public that their energy is damaging and destructive, and that they can’t afford or are able to address those issues timely, so recommend the consumer to a variety of options to aid society elsewhere).

Also masks are now readily available at low cost.",xeneks,t2_yhw55,1,0,reddit2

To use headlines like this furthers an argument for going back to the office even with the article saying to just clean your house and protect the air quality.


Step back and look objectively at this article.


One building with eight employees were looked at. Not a very massive or in any way defining scale of data here.


The headline is intentionally pushing the idea that working in the office is better for you.


They ignore very obvious points like breathing all the fumes in rush hour traffic or the loss of about 2 hours a day solely in commute, loss of sleep. This list goes on.


So the article could spend the entire wall of text arguing against working at the office and I'd still say it is pushing the opposite narrative.

hw8uqhp,t1_hw84dma,2022-02-09 16:58:43,science,"Outside air is going to remove C02 but it can only fix PM problems to a point. For example, during wildfires you cant just take outside air, There are 2 days a year in Ontario when the smoke is so bad we have to close windows. But some locations just never get real clean outside air, like near a desert where sand constantly blows.

 I track C02 as an indicator of how ""fresh"" the air is in my apartment and cracking some windows usually brings new air (with 400ppm co2) pretty quick. My apartment only has 4 rooms and they all have windows. There is no need for large fans but until I started tracking C02 and PM25 I had no idea that my space was like that. And of course your air PM25 just goes towards whatever the outside value is. Im convinced my outisde air is worse than the average for my city because how close I live to a highway.  


So my point is that you dont need an HVAC system you just need some basic tools to make smart decisions. And like everyone is saying, a filter is prob a good investment, its a really easy fast way to just take all that air you are already breathing and polish it up, no matter where it was coming from its probably got a bunch of PM25 and these cleaners really do scrub that right out",timmeh87,t2_4h6j2,3,0,reddit2

During one of their routine exams, I said that I thought my son’s butt was facing down, which would make him a breech baby. They all laughed at me and said that that was actually his head. A few weeks later, it’s almost my wife’s due date and our son was still positioned the same way, so he hadn’t moved. They offered to do the ultrasound and she was hesitant at first since it seemed unnecessary since they claimed his head was facing down. But, she decided to do it and lo and behold, he was breech.

There's methods to reverse a breach position and methods to actually deliver breech with very few issues. Both are becoming less and less well-known as time goes on. OB's are too eager with the scalpel these days - Cesareans are huge money-makers for the hospitals.

Edit: Oh, another interesting paper and an event I witnessed directly, estimation of fetal weight isn't as accurate in later gestation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810856/

Woman I know went in for an ultrasound in late pregnancy and they estimated her baby was 10lbs at the moment, with 4 weeks left in her pregnancy. They opted for a C-section immediately and...baby came out to be just shy of 5 pounds. I would have been pissed but the hospital hides behind ""well they're not 100% accurate"" to shirk liability.

It's important to be educated with **all** the risks for any procedure going into a hospital, even seemingly benign ones. Very seldom are things like these mentioned to patients. In my wife's pregnancy they were adamant she receive Stadol (a category C drug) to ""help her sleep through her pregnancy"" and also receive an intrauterine probe...that they couldn't actually come up with a good reason for doing, while increasing the risk for infection dramatically.

My best friend had a baby the year prior to me, was sent home 18 hours after giving birth.

jfw5fui,t1_jfv02dd,2023-04-11 23:10:34,science,"The standard of care in most developed countries is very good without third trimester ultrasound. Women in proper antenatal care will have regular clinical growth measurements, fetal heart rate checks, blood pressure measurements, blood and urine tests and swabs for bacteria. There may be benefits but the benefits may not outweigh the costs. It’s one thing to say that it will reduce undetected breech by 71%, but what is the rate of undetected breech?

Let’s run some figures, not to conclusively answer the question but just to illustrate how it might not be clear cut:

Here’s a study from Australia https://ranzcogasm.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157.pdf which found that of the few percent of women who have a breech baby, only 2.2% of them were undetected. Let’s round that up and say it’s 1/1,000 women who have an *undetected* breech under current treatment. Now let’s add a routine third trimester ultrasound for every woman, and we’ll assume that that catches all the undetected breeches (although in reality some babies will be head down at ultrasound and then turn). How much is an ultrasound? When you factor in equipment, staff time, facility costs, liability etc $100 would be not a bad round number to mess around with. It might be more, probably not much less. So $100 for every women, and we are saying perhaps 1/1,000 will have an undiagnosed breech. So that’s $100,000 spent for every undiagnosed breech prevented.

Is that the right way to spend the money on women’s health? That’s a complex question. Every undiagnosed breech won’t end in disaster. At minimum it will generally create a high pressure situation for the mother and the medical staff to make quick decisions and deliver the right care. More rarely (in this rare condition) there will be a major long term impact to the mother or the baby.

There are about 4 million babies born each year in the US. Is routine third trimester ultrasound the *besr* way to spend an additional $400 million on women’s health? That’s not for me to say, but it’s not as straightforward as you might think.",theartificialkid,t2_a5qqe,3,0,reddit3

The gold standard now is fundal height measurements for tracking growth and abdominal exam for evaluating presentation. If there is any concern on physical exam that will prompt ultrasonography. Even if it a patient comes in active labor a sole presentation ultrasound takes 15 seconds to do. All the breech pregnancies I have found have been based on atypically shaped gravid abdomens and then did a quick US to check after.

I get it, there will be obsessed moms that abuse the system.....but if doctors are inducing left and right so babies can be born before their vacations, is it that bad of an idea to have a pre birth ultrasound first?

Yes, Breech deliveries are dangerous for doctors and nurses *that don't know how to deliver Breech.* It's more painful and should be avoided if possible (which it usually is) but it's still better than a c-section if there's no other complications. C-sections have their uses and it's definitely nice to have the option, but *25% of live births are not emergency situations requiring a c-section*.

But don't just take my word for it: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35844089/

>Vaginal breech delivery does not result in a higher neonatal admission rate in comparison to primary and secondary section. In contrast, there is a shorter NICU duration in case of neonatal admission after vaginal delivery.

As I've said before, C-sections are money makers and doctors will greatly exaggerate the risks of delivering naturally to cash in.

Good luck getting that covered by insurance. Purely elective are not as common as you would think, and since it won't be covered by insurance, the hospital won't be making as much money compared to self-pay.

Elective c-sections are, quite simply, stupid. It makes me wonder what kind of parents they'll be for their children if childbirth is too much trouble for them and that they'd like to schedule it around their vacation.

>I’m surprised by your claim that c sections are money maker.

For my wife’s pregnancy, the OB personally did a scan at ~8w and 12w.

The machines can be tweaked and dialed to increase penetration, even different transducers can be used. However, this is often at the expense of image quality. They're constantly carefully navigating that balance. 

Additionally, in high body habitus patients sonographers will have to hold up the pannus of the patient with the wrist with which they're holding the transducer. This is not an inconsiderable amount of weight. 

In roughly one-third of all pregnancies the mother is pre-pregnancy obese. My wife is a high risk perinatal sonographer and none of her roughly 40 patients last week were below a pre-pregnancy BMI of 50.

For example in a public system none of the services are expected to make much money so they can cross subsidise low population areas. It's one system so its all connected.

Then we had a group spend the night in the lab where we kept them awake by playing board games, socializing and watching movies. After they had been awake all night, we re-tested them and compared their results to students who were sent home to have a good night of sleep.To do this, we developed a computer test that shows participants images of people in negative, positive and neutral situations. For example, we showed people in pain, people laughing and dancing or people just sitting at a table. We then asked participants to first describe what the people in the photo were feeling, and then how strong their own emotions were while looking at the pictures.

>Our findings were clear: Sleep-deprived students felt less empathy for people in negative situations than students who had had a good night’s sleep.

hiuy6ox,t1_hisbw71,2021-11-01 07:14:15,science,"Source: Disabled previous Firefighter, Flight Paramedic, SWAT Paramedic.

EMS and Fire agencies are chronically short staffed and have been for decades. The issue is the low pay and benefits. Over 70% of Firefighters in the US are volunteer, as an example. Though, even in areas with sufficient workers, agencies have little incentives to move away from 24 or even 48hr shift days. It lowers overhead costs for the department for a number of reasons. The effect it has on the employees are not cared about as a general rule. Its a meat grinder industry that turns out plenty of new recruits who are statistically unlikely to work 5 years in the field and will likely leave the field with lifelong mental health issues, the treatment of which will not be paid for by the agencies. Suicide rates in first responders are insanely high. Anecdotally, I went to 11 funerals for coworkers last year, all suicides. Being emotionally cold to others is the least of our worries.

More workers will always be needed in this field but it will likely never equate to more sleep for them. When financial concerns outline that the minimum number of staff be on duty at any given time, it will mean a lack of sleep.",Marshaze,t2_10jalw,1,0,reddit4
hiuy6yx,t1_hisbw71,2021-11-01 07:14:23,science,"Partially. The other thing that’s needed in the US is education on when to call 911 and what it’s used for. 

For example, went to the same residence three times in a weekend because an elderly man wanted to be carried upstairs because it was time to go to bed. He’d call each morning because it was time to go downstairs. When we got there he was laying on the floor by the stairs. The fire department had been called even more than that to assist him up and down the stairs that weekend. His adult son lived with him and the two of them refused to entertain a conversation about a nursing home. His adult son was very capable of assisting him upstairs but refused. 

Nursing homes have also figured out that they can call 911 to supplement their staff and then start paring down staff to save money. Out west it’s become a huge issue in certain states where the fire departments will go to a nursing home 10+ times a day to do anything from changing bandages to lifting/moving patients. Lobbyist groups for the nursing homes help use the money saved to line the politicians pockets and keep the system in place. 

We can’t refuse to go to a call when someone calls 911. Once we’ve made contact with a patient, we can’t leave their side or else it’s legally abandonment. That means there can be a cardiac arrest next door but we’re stuck with the first patient regardless of the complaint. A fun game we play on shift is “count the cars in the driveway.” We’ll get called out for something simple, elbow pain for example. There will be 6 cars in the driveway but everyone has this misconception that you’ll be seen faster at the hospital because you called 911. If you call 911 for elbow pain, and at the hospital someone drives up to the front door having a heart attack, the heart attack is going to a room first while you go to the waiting room. I’ve dropped people off in the waiting room more than I’ve taken them to a room.

Therefore the fewer hand overs you have , the fewer mistakes you will get.
Ergo, instead of having 3 shifts per day you can massively cut the error rate by only having 2 shifts per day.

I don’t know if this argument has a basis - but presumably there have been studies run showing that the errors from sleep deprivation by having fewer, but longer, shifts are outweighed by the errors from handovers that would happen if you had more, but shorter, shifts.",ImBonRurgundy,t2_112r4h,0,0,reddit4

I worked in two services. One was very rural where we would sometimes go 2-3 days without a call. We did on site day shifts with on call night shifts. When we had staffing issues I worked something like 65 days straight with that onsite/on call schedule and I was plenty rested throughout the whole stretch. The other service was urban where we ran on average 6-10 calls per 12 hour shift.

It would be hard for me to ever point blame in their direction. Some would say they knew they were too exhausted and chose to work anyway but I say they knew they were over exhausted but there was nobody else capable of doing the job so the patient would have either just been left to die or the doctor takes a chance and uses every thing to his full ability to save that life.,JessieJames0685,t2_5yh6whxp,4,0,reddit4
hiw1hkh,t1_hitbc2z,2021-11-01 14:53:03,science,"This makes me wonder if the so-called ""lack of empathy"" problem in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is really a ""lack of sleep / poor-quality sleep"" problem.

Other, recent studies showed that sleep problems are reportedly as high as 80% in people diagnosed with ASD. Well over half (\~50%) of people with autism, adults as well as children, also tend to have significant sleep issues. For NT children, the figures range from 1-16%.

(NT = Neurotypical, or 'typical', as in 'non-autistic'.)

So many people with ASD reporting sleep problems would undoubtedly affect their ability to feel for others, according to this study on the effects of lack of sleep on empathy.",Obversa,t2_k11a2,2,0,reddit4

histm8f,t1_hisokot,2021-10-31 19:37:03,science,"Same. I was misdiagnosed with 3 separate types of bipolar disorder by 3 different doctors, and when I told the third doctor I think it may be wrong because sudafed helped me start on homework when the ADHD was milder, and it never made me ""manic"" he got real pissy with me. He did everything just short of accusing me of being a drug seeker. It took me 20 minutes straight of talking to him to try to convince him that I was telling the truth about my symptoms. I have never been treated worse by a grown adult in my life.

If anyone here is thinking about all this and it seems like things are hopeless, a good psychiatrist is supposed to run a full-on interview with you before they diagnose you. They should be asking detailed questions about your entire life, and screening you with questionnaires. Any interview where they dismiss you after 10 minutes is not valid. It takes at least 30 minutes to diagnose this condition and rule out a lot of similar-looking conditions.

If it still feels hopeless, it's very expensive but you could go over their head and get a neuropsychological evaluation for ADHD. That's where a therapist administers tests to you for like 6 hours straight to see how your brain functions. Some psychiatrists actually require this to confirm your diagnosis, and I don't agree entirely with that unless it's clear the patient would be able to afford it, but it is a verification process that not a lot of people know about until it's ordered.

Barring that, search for doctors with high reviews in big cities. Rural areas have a lot more doctors who will be dismissive and work out of outdated versions of the DSM. My previous psych's problem is that he wouldn't diagnose adults - he was working out of the DSM-III. We're on the DSM-V now, 40 years in the future here.",,,15,0,reddit4
hisay93,t1_his5chb,2021-10-31 17:26:49,science,"TL;DR - Adderall. Lots of useful medication info below

That's a really good point. You might not even need to take a stimulant for it. Although stimulation medications are the most effective treatment for ADHD, there are other non-stimulant drugs that work very well in some people. Strattera is one of those. It acts similar to an antidepressant, but it works on one specific chemical norepinepherine in a specific part of the brain. It works very well for some people, but not for everybody, because it doesn't affect dopamine (more below).

If you did happen to eventually need to try a stimulant if that didn't work and other types of non-stimulants didn't work, I'm seeing people talk about how Vyvanse is a much more mild experience compared to Adderall - that it's easier to fall asleep on Vyvanse and it doesn't key you up the same way. There are many other options though, so don't despair if it's not for you.

I've just been diagnosed in July, and I'm on Adderall XR (generic) 25mg once a day, and I really hope to get on name-brand Adderall next month. When I tried something similar to name-brand Adderall instant release 15mg in the past (5 separate times), it made me \*SO TIRED\* that I fell asleep one of those times. But it also gave me energy that I really need to function normally.

**The #1 piece of advice** I can pass to anybody right now is that the generics do not act the same as the real brand-name medications. The brand-name medications are much more effective at quieting down my internal monologue and making it easier to pay attention when people are talking to me. Highly, highly effective. My intelligence went through the roof, and my depression was immediately reversed when I took that instant release. And Adderall XR has no good generics, even the Authorized Generics don't work as well.

The cool thing is that stimulants affect us differently from typical normally functioning people. We're not likely to become addicted to them like average people, and they really slow down our racing thoughts and relax our minds and bodies. To me, Adderall is a much more effective medication than any and all antidepressants and sedatives I've ever taken. The most chill of chill-pills.

What it is, is that our levels of action of neurotransmitters called dopamine and norepinepherine in the brain are so low compared to average people that we're so understimulated that we can't relax or focus. Dopamine is responsible for feeling conscious and relaxed and in-the-moment and good about things that entertain you. Norepinepherine is responsible for getting you active and ready to get up and do things. Dextroamphetamine (an active ingredient in a lot of stimulant medications) helps increase the availability and concentration of dopamine, norepinepherine, and serotonin in our brains.",,,23,0,reddit4

hit0l30,t1_hisvxdt,2021-10-31 20:25:18,science,"You might want to reconsider that. If any stimulant makes you sleepy, that's like a 100% clear indicator of ADHD. It happens in a large amount of people with ADHD who have a sleep deficit, but not all of them. It does not happen in neurotypical individuals.

Rationale: Stimulants stimulate you. If you take a stimulant and it calms you down, that's because you were understimulated - it brings you up to a normal level of calmness. That means you have a lack of dopamine in the brain. That means you have ADHD. This is general info, not directed at you or me, but this lack of stimulation may be difficult to notice if any other stimulants are involved like nicotine or THC. Remove all stimulants from your body, and if you're non-functional, that's ADHD.

If a neurotypical person takes a stimulant, it goes beyond that because they were already at a normal functional baseline of dopamine in the brain. They don't \*need\* caffeine to get things done at work, it just helps (unless they're physically addicted to caffeine, which is really common in untreated ADHD)",,,3,0,reddit4

If you're able to, eventually trying stimulant medications if you have ADHD is worth the entire struggle. Life-changing in so many different ways I can't describe to anyone who hasn't had the same experience.

Coffee:  Makes me jittery and uncomfortable. Heart palpitations at the amount I need to have any effect on me (400mg+). Chemically disables me from sleeping (adenosine antagonist); choose awake for 2 days or asleep and dysfunctional, therefore making the ADHD symptoms worse. Gives me panic attacks. Makes my brain more noisy

Stimulant medication:  Makes me mentally calm. Makes me physically relaxed. Totally treats my Restless Legs Syndrome, which also happens in all my other muscles throughout my body, especially the upper back pain - just gone. Much better than any anti-anxiety medication for me. Complete opposite of jittery and uncomfortable. Calms down my symptoms of OCD because I can get my life on track in every way. Reverses my social anxiety disorder. Literally unlocks like 15 - 20 IQ points caffeine just can't; neurotypical people joke that caffeine does this for them, but I'm dead serious that stimulant medications actually unlock your intelligence if you have ADHD because you can actually think clearly without random thoughts and non-thoughts flying constantly",,,10,0,reddit4

hisrj2w,t1_hisktok,2021-10-31 19:22:48,science,"So, I have gone through the gauntlet when it comes to some of these medications. My issues aren't as extreme as narcolepsy, but given the chance, most days I'm capable of falling asleep sitting up if I decide to close my eyes for a bit.

By and large, Modafinil had the least side effects (for me), with a decent positive effect. It doesn't amp me up or cause hypo/hypermania. I don't notice much in terms of anxiety like some medications. It doesn't have a heavy withdrawal price if I miss taking it or run out at any given time that I've noticed (compared to other medications, at least).

The worst I have to say about it is how benign it feels. If you take too much, too late in the day, you will not fall asleep. It's not an amped up, got-things-to-do, got-everything-to-do!, feeling. It's a quiet buzzing of electrical activity that doesn't want to stop. It's like insomnia. Being tired, knowing you're tired, closing your eyes, and nothing happening. You're just laying there awake, with your eyes closed, and you don't drift off anywhere, let alone to sleep.

If I set an alarm an hour before I want to wake up (4:30-5:00am), take 100mg, then go back to sleep, the next time I wake up (6am) my brain is buzzing, awake, ready for the day. I may take another 50-100mg in the morning. If I'm feeling especially tired, I may take 200mg in the morning, maybe another dose if I remember to do it before 11am. But even though I may take up to 200mg in the morning, I won't take 50mg at 3pm in the afternoon if I want to get to sleep by 10pm. It -will- linger, and keep me up. If I miss it in the morning, I don't take it if I want to fall asleep within 10 hours, regardless of the dose.

I haven't experimented with large doses (though my normal amount may be considered large to some, I don't know). It took some getting used to knowing when I could take it so that it wouldn't mess up my sleep schedule, but after I figured that out it worked out pretty well.

Idk if this random comment on this random chain will help anyone, all experiences with medication are different and other people's experiences could vary widely from this. But this has been how it works for me.

-- Edit --

As an added side note, even though I deal with hypersomnia, if my sleep schedule gets messed up by staying up late or sleeping in, it can make it difficult for me to fall asleep at my normal time over the next few days. I have tried benadryl and unisom, and even taking half a pill they knock me out and make me feel like crap the next day.

Melatonin works wonders. I have a bottle of 5mg pills. If I want some help falling asleep, I might break one in half and take it an hour or two before I want to go to bed. If I -need to sleep in an hour-, then I take a whole one.

I don't smoke, and if I bought a 6-pack of beer, you'd probably find a couple still in the fridge 6 months later. I don't know how these things interact with anything I mentioned above.",AmInedible,t2_4477e3ad,1,0,reddit4

Also medications can make a huge difference in sleep architecture as well. Another thing is restless leg, or frequent periodic limb movements. The watch readings are basically just a guess. I see a lot of patients come into the sleep lab claiming they never hit REM, or they are awake for weeks at a time, which isn't true. They're hitting REM sleep, although it can be severely fractured due to an underlying sleep disorder. And people can't stay awake for weeks at a time. If a person is truly that sleep deprived people are going to slip into micro sleeps at the very least. And at that point would probably be almost hallucinating. The special forces actually train soldiers to manage they're micro sleeps/ sleep deprivation so they can be alert during missions.

In college I was always sleepy, fell asleep in some classes there, too.  I would start hallucinating before falling asleep, dreaming with my eyes open.  I used to fall asleep at my night shift job too and I would wake myself up but not be able to move.  Like, I couldn’t physically make my eyes open.  

My senior year I started getting really frustrated that I wanted to pay attention during lectures but just couldn’t.  I suspected ADHD because it runs in the family and was also dealing with depression. I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with both.  The ADHD meds helped a little with being sleepy all the time but one of the things I kept bringing up was that I felt like I dreamed too much at night.  

My doctor finally referred me to get a sleep study.  Turns out I had narcolepsy.  I had something like 27 wake ups during my night sleep test and never went into deep sleep.

CBD Isolate, in which they chemically extract the CBD into its pure form, and then add it to a carrier oil (or a vape, or whatever).

CBD on its own is good for some things (like anxiety, and probably seizures), but when you want the muscle relaxant and pain-relieving properties, then those extra terpenes and cannabinoids are really what work best (they are even stronger when all used together; it's called the ""entourage effect""). Actual cannabis has more of these compounds, and in greater quantity, but even with hemp-derived products it can make a difference (sometimes you have to take bigger doses).

I actually think that five CBD is a combination of the two; full spectrum extract with some extra CBD added for strength. 

I've tried isolate in the past, and it didn't do much for me. I hope that someday cannabis will be legalized federally so that we can get more of the cannabis CBD products; I suspect that people that use CBD are just going to the CBD stores and probably don't really know the difference.",abx99,t2_6kew9,2,0,reddit4

Even in a unionized setting, we can be forced to stay 4 hours over our normal shift ending time, because staffing is at a bare minimum at all times and any absence must have coverage.  Same can happen with shift start time as well (although you usually get a little more notice in those instances)

So a normal 7-3 shift suddently becomes a 7am-7pm; or the next day's shift suddenly becomes a 3am-3pm.  Mind you, I'm only talking about people on 1st shift, and with regular 8-hour days.  Those people on 2nd and 3rd shift have way worse sleep quality/quantity than us first shifters.

kp7fqvz,t3_1akflni,2024-02-06 17:45:18,science,"> The research, led by UCL in collaboration with the University of Southampton and Queen Mary University, London, analysed the work and sleep patterns of over 25,000 men and women between 2012 and 2017.

> The researchers found that compared to people who worked a standard 35-40 hour week, those working 55 hours a week or more had the poorest sleep – including short sleep and sleep disturbance. Short sleep is defined as less than seven hours a night and sleep disturbance as struggling to fall asleep within 30 minutes, waking up in the middle of the night or early morning, and a self-rating of poor-quality sleep.
>
>Those who worked most or all weekends and nonstandard patterns, like shifts, also experienced sleep disturbance, and either short sleep or long sleep – more than eight hours a night.

My memory is becoming a blur and days just blend into one big muddled mess. Every week I fly trips that take me through multiple time zones and I lose a day going west. Takeoff at midnight on the west coast. Fly in darkness all night to Asia. Land in late or mid morning the next day. Exhausted and need sleep but it's now daytime at the hotel. Try to get some sleep on my layover (it's very broken and restless even though im beyond exhausted). Then takeoff the next day just as the sun sets. Fly all night eastbound through all the timezones again. Gain a day again. See the sunrise  2/3 of the way back. Land afternoon the day before (since I gained a day) back in the US. Drive home to see the sunset once more as I unpack. In certain times of year I can see a sunset and sunrise and sunset again within one flight.

This has destroyed my circadian rhythm. Your body cues off of light for that.

I also pick up a ton of overtime, last year I hit my own personal record and worked a lot. So the time off ends up being turned into extra money. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes I'll just take the time off, but I can choose.

k4e91nl,t3_1759ydj,2023-10-11 09:32:21,science,"> The team focused on glucocorticoid hormones in the adrenal gland which regulate many physiological functions including metabolism and appetite. Glucocorticoids are known to directly regulate a group of brain peptides controlling appetitive behaviour, with some increasing appetite (orexigenic) and some decreasing appetite (anorexigenic).

> Strikingly, the team discovered that rats in the control group ate 88.4% of their daily intake during their active phase, and only 11.6% during their inactive phase. In contrast, the 'jet-lagged' group consumed 53.8% of their daily calories during their inactive phase (without an increase in activity during this time). This equated to nearly five-times more (460% more) than what the control group consumed during the inactive phase.  These results show that it is timing of consumption that has been affected.

>This new discovery revealed how completely, and significantly, disordered the neuropeptides become when daily glucocorticoid levels are out of synch with light and dark cues.  However, the authors suggest the neuropeptides identified in this study may be promising targets for drug treatments adapted to treat eating disorders and obesity

Night people generally do worse on almost every metric from health, mental performance, wealth, etc. 

I think when they do studies of indigenous people, that the difference in time they go to sleep is usually half an hour or so. 

Then you have studies of people when they go camping and avoid artificial lights, and then those night people start going to sleep much earlier. 

So while genetically there are evening people, the difference is likely to be small and doesn't explain people who go to sleep really late. 

So many night people are just day people, but doing almost everything to mess up their circadian rhythm, through artificial light exposure, etc. 

You can take night people and force them to go to sleep earlier and then their mental and physical performance in tests improves. 

&#x200B;
>Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by actigraphy and circadian phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no adverse effect on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical ‘suboptimal’ morning hours.

I'm a night person and I get wanting to have time to spend with people but I could never constantly screw up my sleep schedule like that. At most what I'll do is stay up a few hours extra or sleep a little later. It's enough that it allows me to have a social life but still keep to my schedule.

For instance, I stayed up later yesterday (sleep around 3pm) and then woke up around midnight. Now it's about 9:40pm and within the hour I'll be laying down to sleep then be at work a little after 9pm.

It's already annoying enough making those small alterations to my schedule... I couldn't imagine having it significantly worse where I'm trying to completely reverse it every few days.

Nice spot. I don't think I have any specific studies on that. Also I think in general it's going to be hard to tease it out.

When you look at just correlational studies then you'll have all sorts of cofounders. So people who are morning people are linked to psychological factors like constraint. So those people with more constraint are going to exercise more and have better sleep habits which then results in them being morning people. So then it's not going to be easy to tell if they are healthier due to being a morning person or exercise, health/sleep habits etc.

>Constraint was associated with Morningness and earlier circadian phase

https://www.psypost.org/2023/08/new-study-sheds-light-on-the-connection-between-sleeping-patterns-and-wages-168300


>Participants reporting a “definite evening” chronotype were 54% (95% CI, 49% to 59%) more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle than participants reporting a “definite morning” chronotype. A total of 1925 diabetes cases were documented over 469 120 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the “definite morning” chronotype, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes was 1.21 (CI, 1.09 to 1.35) for the “intermediate” chronotype and 1.72 (CI, 1.50 to 1.98) for the “definite evening” chronotype after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, shift work, and family history of diabetes.

In the end I don't really stress much about the details.

Even more genes than that are post-translationally modified by ribosomes according to circadian (ie light/dark) timing. The way that genes express themselves in response to light and darkness is not a coincidence, but adaptive to dirurnal living and nighttime sleeping. 

People can make themselves “night owls” by avoiding seeing the sunrise, constantly exposing themselves to dim (compared to outdoors) artificial lighting that doesn’t vary between night and day, and scheduling their days in a way that causes them to stay up late. However, before artificial lighting was invented, night owls were extremely uncommon (as was sleeping under 7 hours per night).

I remember one specific clinic in Ypsilanti that had an obvious trap house outside the parking lot normally full of guys and dogs outside.

Black pain being ignored has always happened.

More recently Serena Williams spoke about her medical concerns being ignored by doctors. Her body feeling good is her whole career and the doctors thought she had to be exagerating how it felt.

jcarjaz,t1_jca4po5,2023-03-15 14:41:26,science,"The big thing is you have to worry about opioid withdrawal in the baby, and that's a great point. 

In a healthy baby you wouldn't give almost any medications so it wouldn't be an issue. In an unhealthy baby you may have some concern with cumulative effects like if you use a benzo and the patient has opiates on board - it could cause more sedation than expected. Neonatology isn't really my area, but I would be pretty surprised if you were using a drug like that in a brand new baby and that baby wasn't intubated, though, and once you have the airway secured then it's irrelevant. The concern with excess sedation is that we could lose the airway, so once you have an advanced airway, you're okay.

Edit: withdrawal is definitely an issue, healthy baby or not, though. We slowly wean addicted babies down from opiates with lowering doses of morphine. But a utox won't tell you if they're addicted. It'll just tell you if they've had any opioids in whatever time period that opioid shows up.

jcd2nxe,t1_jccs3cg,2023-03-15 23:26:41,science,"My best friend is an OB/Gyn and a women. Most of my friends are OB/Gyns. Patients lie their asses off to them every day. When in medical school they are trained to take a history in such a way that detects liars. Because EVERY patient lies. Usually about stupid stuff. But sometimes they lie about things that can effect their care. So the testing is there to protect the patients and the fetus.

Also patients are stupid. When they come into an ER they may say “I had a hysterectomy”. But that they really had was a oophorectomy or a salpingectomy. Which means they can still get pregnant. I’ve heard first hand accounts from physicians that have had that happen. Also, patients lie about their sexual history. Maybe she’s in a lesbian relationship now, but she’s cheating with a man. Will she admit that with her girlfriend standing there? Nope. 

But at the end of the day if a doctor provides care and harms an unknown fetus or misses an ectopic pregnancy, they get sued. It doesn’t matter that a patient LIED, the doctor is still liable. And the liar of a patient will happily sue them. So malpractice insurances also requires doctors to practice according to standards of care and guidelines. Those include mandatory testing for every woman with a uterus that has entered puberty. 


Here’s an article explaining why marijuana can effect care.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952818018318026

>The multi-systemic effects of cannabinoids and their pharmacological interactions with anesthetic agents may lead to serious consequences. Low doses of cannabinoids have been associated with increased sympathetic response (tachycardia, hypertension and increased contractility) with high levels of norepinephrine detected 30 min after use. High doses enhance parasympathetic tone leading to dose-dependent bradycardia and hypotension. Severe vascular complications associated with cannabis exposure may include malignant arrhythmias, coronary spasm, sudden death, cerebral hypoperfusion and stroke. Bronchial hyperreactivity and upper airway obstruction are commonly reported in cannabis users. Postoperative hypothermia, shivering and increased platelet aggregation have been also documented.

Here are a couple more.

High doses enhance parasympathetic tone leading to dose-dependent bradycardia and hypotension.

forc496,t3_g90fza,2020-04-27 17:48:37,science,"Reasons employers \*can\* benefit from unions:

* Fair wages, established by consensus rather than predatory behavior by an opponent remove the adversarial nature of hiring someone on, starting them off on the wrong foot.
* In the event wages are reasonable, able to afford life, so rather than being exhausted from a night at the laundromat, being able to afford a washing machine.  This results in workers having the mental and physical energy to put towards work.
* More likely to have work-life balance on their time.  Being able to visit a dentist, rather than suffer through dental pain.
* Given management is intrinsically adversarial in most corporations, employees having a non-adversarial environment they can share with coworkers where management isn't there.  No need to organize or coordinate outside activities to keep employee cohesion.  Lack of risk of bungling such.
* Lack of risk of termination to employees, which typically results in backstabby abrasive self-protective behavior.  This leads to better teamwork.

Reasons unions \*can\* suck for employers:

* Bad faith contract negotiations suck.
* Unable to get rid of bad people who act in bad faith.
* Lazy atmosphere can emerge and persist where employees spend most of their time surfing the web for personal purchases, making personal calls, using social media, or thinking about things like camping or their next vacation.
* Union dues and overhead is just another expense.

Fact is though, unions actually rely on the success of their businesses as well, so while they \*can\* be adversarial, it's beneficial for everyone if they're not.

Marx was fascinated by capitalism, and didn't necessarily hate it, but correctly identified certain issues, and the exploitative nature of business owners and the imbalance of power in their favour. Which is why he concluded that workers collectivizing (and, he surmised, eventually coming to own their means of production) was the only way to avoid these issues long term. Many labour unions have roots in Marxism but never quite made it to the point of taking over the means or production unless forming a co-op.

Likewise, the economy of scale necessary to provide the cheapest possible product for the masses is also the purview of monolithic entities.

Lest say I have skill and experience in a particular role, there’s 5 companies hiring for that role, the ones with a Union are probably paying a higher wage/benefits and therefore attracting more applicants.  More applicants means a better choice of the best ones.  Meanwhile those low paying companies continue to justify low wages, saying staff aren’t productive enough to be worth more, because those productive ones took the higher paying gig.  Similarly, the higher paying employers can place a higher standard on their workers because the workers want to keep that higher paying job, if the others try to hold employers to a higher standard then those employers move on to a place that’s easier work for the same wage.  

Unions protecting poor employees is a whole other issue, and shouldn’t happen with a strong union.  Seems like the average Union should be opposed to a handful of low performers disrupting the morale of the remaining members.  I think what really happens is that bad managers scapegoat the Union, “they won’t let me reprimand him” or “the union says I have to do it this way”.

Keeping low-productivity staff around actually sucks out the average/high-productivity employees' morale.

It *always* happens when unions are strong. Unions care about seniority more than anything else. They're scummy when they are strong, doing things like hiking their dues right after they bargain for a raise, such that the workers themselves haven't seen real wage increases in decades.

And it's not like you have a choice to not join the union either, because it's effectively closed shop - you don't get officially hired after your 2 month trial period if you don't join the union. So it's not like it's a weak union.

fot84pk,t1_fosxiw6,2020-04-28 04:07:30,science,"The good thing about unions though is that their stance does not change. A for employee union, will always focus on the employee. But what happens when Mr. pibb retires and his greedy son in law Dr Pepper takes over (I bet his doctorate is in some dumb topic that doesn’t even relate to the industry)? Before, HR may have been for the people, but now it’s concerned with silencing problems rather than fixing them. And with Dr Pepper in charge, he doesn’t want to hear wind of a union, else you’ll be fired for unrelated things (showing up to work late, despite never being late). Ultimately, even if you have a good HR, it’s still a good idea to have a solid union in place.

In addition, unions can provide services to the company that the company may have otherwise not had. A union can provide training to employees that goes more efficiently than HR may have been able to have provide, as well as more in depth training, due to the nature of employees working with employees. Such examples may be that an HR can get roles established and basic training, but the union has an employee doing that same task that can train you 1 on 1 in order to help you get started and up to speed faster. 

Furthermore, unions can help in the selection process for skilled employees. See unionized trade jobs, such as electricians. People can join the union without having work, and then be recommended to contractors. This is useful to employees and employers. 

Next is a level of job protection that many people aren’t offered. Many states are right to work states, where you can be terminated at any time just because (my first ever manager told me this while hiring: “Now just know that this is a right to work state. We all need our jobs here, and corporate has ways of shutting down places that decide a union is a good thing, so if you want the job, and you want to keep the job, don’t mention them.” This wasn’t a manager trying to scare me, this was a manager who just wanted to keep his own job). 

Finally, you have preset wages. Having decent wages set up in advance is useful from both the companies end and the employees. It negates the need of wage negotiation for new hires, as a union can effectively say “hey this is what everyone should start at” and no new employee should feel like they are getting a raw deal. Additionally, knowing that you are receiving an unfair wage, the union can band together to help you get a fair amount of pay. Such examples can include wage discrimination between people of colored and women in the work place. Unions are key in preventing such actions from occurring.

So yes. While you may not require a union at that exact moment, a union is like a hundred dollars in your back pocket. You’d rather have that hundred dollars when the world goes to hell than not have it.

Thats still not fully accurate. A lot of times the employer, more specifically the manager, aren't following the steps outlined by the labor agreement to start the termination process. Across the board, the only thing Unions do in terms of terminating workers is that they make the process longer but not as significant as the popular notion (more record keeping, take specific steps to outline infractions, etc.).

I think this correlates with the 'Middle Management Syndrome', wherein corporate culture follows the questionable norm that you *must* be promoted if you do well. Consequentially, the people doing good work will keep being promoted **until they stop doing good work**... which means the natural outcome of this mentality is a management layer where everyone is doing a bad job.

As anecdote to an alternative, the (IT) company I work for doesn't have middle management or 'ranks'. There's the GFs (the people who founded the company, and serve as the public face and 'diplomatic contact' towards high-value customers) and employees. Technically there's Project Leaders, too, but they are on the same level, in both personal attitude, payment and privileged, as any developer.

Think that companies won't take away benefits? Think again. In the post war era, many companies often provided medical insurance. Some even paid the full price for it. Since the union busting of the 1980s, business did their best to prevent them from providing insurance. Look at Papa John's, for example. They made sure that their employees worked less than their policy to provide Insurance. You had to work, IIRC, 38 hours a week. Employees were often scheduled about 30 hours, so they were part time and didn't qualify for insurance. 

That's a worse case scenario. Even unionized companies used that ""part-time"" phrase to short-change their workers. AT&T, where I was a steward, often did that. I was a call center employee, and a large number of ""part-time"" employees were actually working 40+ hours a week. One of my team members did that for the 5 years I worked there.

Ye, this kind of structure only works if the employees fully accept the notion that there is no 'advancement'. But as I outlined, 'advancement for the sake of advancement' is inherently counterproductive. And if your employees desire to feel accomplished or confirmed in their work, there's other ways to achieve that than throwing pointless promotions and 'Executive Lead of Executive Offices' titles around... like actually treating them well and in face-to-face telling them that you appreciate their work.

Another fun tidbit about our company: Every project team is eligble to have one 'team event' every three or so months. The team decides, and anything (within reasonable price range) goes. This can be attending a sports event, the classic bowling evening or just a night in a bar. The company pays all of it. 

Additionally, each team has the right to demand their associated GF to eat with them once per month, usually in a local restaurant or beer garden (basically an open pub / restaurant combo in a more casual setting). Aka, you can drink a beer with the top-level guy and chat over any topic that you might want. And yes, the GFs actually do answer any team that calls in that right (albeit obviously most teams don't really have the need to do that every single month... we had like 5 of those dinners last year, fun times).


Back to the point at hand: You don't *need* advancement. I don't care if I 'never get promoted', because there's no point in seeking a promotion. I don't need a fancy title to get paid well, because I will be paid well anyways. My GF is a sympathic and capable person, who knows that they know nothing about the actual work us developers do, and will represent our technical opinion to customers with absolute confidence in our decisions.

It sounds like some gilded-age nonsense, but [the core thesis of the judgment](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-ebay-domestic-holdings-inc-v-newmark) has been upheld in court within the last decade.

The problem is, it doesn't do that, at least not consistently. The real outcome is that things like paying dividends end up being treated as a bigger priority than anything else, even the continued existence of a company.

This is why around the 1970s, with the crushing of labor unions, left-wing political parties, & the social democratic New Deal wing of the Democratic Party (which had always been a ruling class party, but had at least been under enough pressure from the working class from 1945-~1970 that it would accept some concessions & reforms), with the emergence of neoliberalism as the establishment consensus, the political elite of both parties— representing the monied interests of the ruling class— began dramatically rolling back the labor victories of the New Deal, & the  standards of living of working class people began to plummet right up through the present, with the neoliberal wing pretty much entirely consolidating power over the Democratic Party, implementing very conservative policies, in the 90s with Bill Clinton’s New Democrat/Third Way movement. 

Rebuilding labor organizations & left-wing (IMO crucially pro-democracy, anti-capitalist, left-libertarian forms of) resistance is the only way we will ever shift the balance of social forces back in favor of the working class majority & consequently improve the lives of most of the population, placing human wellbeing, the common good, the interests of the working class, the social ecological survival of the species, & higher values of democracy, freedom, above the profits & power of the ruling elite & their corporations once & for all, dissolving the class divide that has led to such horrific human consequences & finally moving forward on the project of human emancipation which the values of the Enlightenment imagined, but was never able to realize through liberal capitalism because of its class-hierarchical, exploitative nature (a nature which, as extreme inequality grows less & less maintainable, can only be sustained through increasing authoritarianism, with the ruling class using the power of the state & propaganda/indoctrination as their means of preventing the people from overcoming their rule).",Sex_Drugs_and_Cats,t2_f37tz,4,0,reddit1

1. Kroger, union rules were super restrictive and moving up was near impossible unless you were a non union manager. To become a manager you have to leave the company for 1 year then come back and apply. There were also lots of rules and restrictions in how the job is done. Minimum wage was $4.25/hr the Union paid $8/hr and $300 a month was taken out for union dues. The insurance included was useless 60/40 split with a small cap. 


2. Fred Meyers Different union pay was $10.41 per hour, due to family I received medicaid. I still had to pay 15% of my income to get the union insurance (no opt out). I never saw another benefit.


3. Several attempts by unions to convince me I needed a union for my tech job. I was making $28/hr and had ok insurance. After the big paycut everyone got they setup strikes and tried to get us to go union.


I saw no point. I made decent income for my lack of college or official training and had freedom to come and go as I pleased as long as my work was completed on time.



1 of the tech companies I had worked for went union. The rules were oppressive from comments from former co workers. The union was disbanded by the employees.


Today I make over $40/hr doing roughly the same work (although I have more experience now). I can still come and go as I please as long as my work is done. I also have awesome insurance that covers just about everything for very little cost and I get a raise putting me in the $50+/hr rangebnext year.




I am sure for some industries they are quite good and important, my opinion is they take in money, provide very little and do just better than worst case with lots of restrictions and in a way keep areas poor as there is little growth opportunity, because companies cannot modernize without adjusting the union contract.

I find a few methodological errors in this paper. 

1. The word ""responsive"" is not proper, the study doesn't measure dynamic shifts on poor/rich voter preferences, rather it is about long term preferences. E.G. is the congressman more likely to vote in favor of policy X/Y which group 1 or 2 prefers.

2. The study does not appear to adjust for the absolute wealth of a district. There is generally a pattern in most states that higher absolute wealth increases tolerance for redistibutive policies. This is simple math, the richer you are the more you can tolerate redistributing without wrecking your economy. 

Neither of these are deathblows to the paper's credibility, and it does seem to show unions are strong political forces, but the headline is a bit clickbaity, and obviously linking to something without free access is just plain rude.",anti_dan,t2_t72w9,1,0,reddit1

Fundamentally, politicians typically react to campaign backers over any other group or individual, due to the disproportionate impact they have on their re-election chances. (A great study of this is “republic lost”)

Trade unions often act as significant campaign contributors, so feed into this unequal system where contributors sway politicians’ attention. 

my query really sits on whether the presence of trade unions genuinely shifts the balance of power from vested interest, or actually just continues this process. 

With the UK Labour Party Falkirk scandal, and the election of Ed Miliband as leader, I’d argue that indicatively it did not.

We decided globalization was a good idea and we can't really go back to regional markets. I understand that when a company is valued at a big number everyone wants to get a piece and float all boats, but the supply chain costs *most* companies are beholden to for generating capital is hard to reduce without some unpalatable trade offs. 

Tech is probably the best place to extract wealth and feed it back into the rest of the economy because valuable intellectual property, and low physical goods demands, means diverting capital wont sink the company the way it would for say a car manufacturer or food provider.

Because of this tendency towards monopolization (Corp ownership is just in stocks) ownership can monopolize. This leaves a single laborer in a bad position because they HAVE to compete but wages are driven by demand. 

But if labor monopolizes, you have a greater position to counteract the demand side pricing. 

But eventually, even with outsourcing, automation becomes more attractive. 

But a corps continued existence is demand based, there is a huge incentive to get liquid capital in the hands of demand.

I think we all took for granted that both sides would, even with differences in opinion of how to do it, be interested in providing a healthy society.

I think the last 3.5 years have shown the falseness of that premise.

Yes, capitalism requires a class of capitalists and not-capitalists to function, but no where does it require the classes to be, 'super-wealthy racists protected from laws and consequences through their influence' and 'so poor you can never leave your job thus becoming effectively slaves while the cops kill you indiscriminately to keep you under control so get back to work during a pandemic because the government won't help you.'",Murgos-,t2_j8zp5,3,0,reddit1
fzpcvya,t1_fyu19vq,2020-07-30 06:15:06,science,"Very few people ""quit their jobs to rely on welfare programs"" according to all the research we have seen on things like UBI. Generally the three groups of people who do this are people who quit in order to raise their child, people who quit in order to go to school or some type of trade education or skills training program, and people who decide to start a new business or creative endeavor. So if we did something like a UBI for four years and those three groups of people quit their jobs for four years, then we'd have more kids getting to spend time with their parents, more skilled people coming out of education programs, and more creative and business experiments. These are all pretty good for society and the economy, and it's likely that these people wouldn't stay out of traditional work in any case. A parent might go back to work once their child starts kindergarten for example. A student would once they finished their studies. A creative person or entrepreneur might if their new project didn't turn out profitable.

So none of these are really so bad as fallback options. Yes it would be better if they were more stable in knowing that they would have a guaranteed amount of money in terms of paying their rent for example, but for a new program it's not like everyone would immediately trust the system would last forever anyway.

I hope to god you don't work in an engineering field, or in any field that cares more about comparing different solutions to each other to find the best one than about whether the first solution found works at all.

(Also most police officers don't actually live in the community they police - but that isn't here or there).

They're asking that the responsibilities of the police - such as mental health checks - be regulated to better suited professions, and that communities take advantage of the many, many ways to prevent crime instead of just heavily enforcing the law. Detectives will still exist, (better trained) people will still exist to deal with dangerous suspects.

Some people want to abolish the police, but I don't even think they mean ""abolish the police tomorrow"". Police forces almost always top the budget for municipals, and what people want is that instead of paying for an often arbitrary, racist and corrupt agency to be given that money, that money go towards improving the community - community centers for kids to have a safe place to be in that cuts down on gangs, better education so people can improve their lives, better funded social workers, better funded community health centers, etc etc.

Work requirements are common in US safety net programs.

Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence that work requirements increase program exits by 23 percentage points (64 percent) among incumbent participants. Overall program participation among adults who are subject to work requirements is reduced by 53 percent. Homeless adults are disproportionately screened out.

I was taught all of the lies, and believed them for a long time. But because I believed the lies I also believed that people were inherently equal, which is something they constantly claim without believing. 

But because I believed all humans were equal, all of their positions created cognitive dissonance. Whenever I learned something new, I would change my mind about that subject because my primary goal was always making things better. I believed their arguments because I thought they were telling the truth about them being the best, not because they harmed people. 

I really have a hard time getting into the headspace of people who are against abortion, for example, because while I was strongly against abortion for years it was because I *honestly* believed that life began at conception. Once I stopped believing that by getting more information, I stopped being against abortion in the same moment. 

My HS English teacher actually started the process for me I think. I remember being crazy pro-death penalty, because of course I was. One of the books he had us read were competing essays from different angles on various subjects that were considered controversial, and I read all of them about the death penalty.

One of those essays demonstrated that the stated goals of the death penalty were not even being served by the death penalty. (It does not cause a reduction in rates, it is not cheaper, and it is often inaccurate.) The argument was so clear, and the data was so in favor of it, that I changed my mind minutes after reading it.

Once that started it was like dominos falling one after another.

So all I can imagine is that people who adopt these positions are much, much more interested in something outside of the arguments they claim to make. They don't care about getting people back to work, despite that being the argument, because if that was their goal they would have *already changed their mind.* The goal therefore must be whatever is the consistent through-line of their actual policy, which is just denial of assistance and benefits for those beneath them.",Caelinus,t2_emecd,591,0,reddit2

Here is a description I think conservatives would more readily engage into, which I think could create better dialogue.

We believe in individuality and accountability of people. Where it’s okay for there to be current momentary suffering, because suffering is a motivator to work harder. And at an extreme, it’s even fair for suffering to increase to the point of death if you choose not to work, because that is the justice of your lack of labor. No one controls you from working but you, and your lack of resources/opportunity is real life justice coming into play. (Individuality/accountability)

It’s not that aid programs can’t be effective, or that conservatives don’t want to help poor people. It’s that preventing suffering without accountability (not working) is inhibiting growth, and at a large scale limiting justice. (God wants us to be good people that work. And the results of our labor are more important than our stationary existence.)

I think there are flaws with this belief, because suffering can only do so much to change someone, and love is meeting people where they are at, not “watching them suffer until they realize their mistake.”

Actually, it’s a 20 hour weekly requirement. A lot of these people are working just not consistently 20 hours a week. This is especially problematic for people with disabilities, working mothers, people whose employers want to keep them part-time, etc…

> then maybe you didn't really need the stamps in the first place?

Ah, this is a very different argument from the one the post referenced and debunked but I’ll entertain it anyway.

That’s a big maybe…“You’re not dead without it so you didn’t need it” is a rather draconian line of reasoning. But the program was never intended to be just for people on the brink of starvation. It was meant to combat hunger as well as crime and healthcare costs. It was also meant to provide more nutrition to children, which has massive long term effects on their cognitive function, making a smarter and saner society.

> How else are these people living? 

You assume that they ARE living. I volunteer with a homeless shelter and, for some of these people, losing SNAP benefits would be a death sentence. It’s not exclusively for people who would die without it but it still does have many people who would. And getting a job is incredibly difficult when homeless. Try showing up to an interview with no ID, no mailing address, no shower, no professional clothes, etc… it doesn’t go well.

> Some other supporting party must be subsidizing their unwillingness or inability to get work.

We’ve already covered that this assumption is untrue for many and some of them will just die so we’ll skip covering that again and address some other flaws in this thinking.

Again, it’s not just getting work. It’s a reliable 20 hours a week. 

Do you know what people do when they’re hungry and can’t afford food? For a lot of them, the only option is crime. In fact, there’s [research showing that just the disbursement schedule of SNAP benefits cause a substantial difference in crime, grocery store theft increasing by 20% when staggered](https://files.webservices.illinois.edu/6984/carrjillian-paper-10-30-17.pdf).

They don't want to solve the source of the rift causing culture war, then people might actually pay attention to the core issues affecting us all. The old guard Democrats and the old guard Republicans are in cahoots to further the goals of the ruling class.

Sure Republicans are *worse* from our perspective but that's the whole aim. To be ""better than"" the other side, not to actually be good or help us. Notice the Republicans are made to feel the same way about us, that they're morally superior. The two parties serve the ruling class and the ruling class almost exclusively. The capital class writes their checks now. 

The purpose of the Democrats is to play the ""doves"" part in a domestic version of the renowned ""Hawks and Doves"" foreign policy strategy. They are allowed wins for problems that are caused for the sole purpose of giving the illusion of a functioning democracy.

The Dems slowly move right and point at the Republicans to say ""they have gone too far! we must repair the damage!"" and then can only manage to pass stop-gap measures, bandaids and temporary fixes. Anything truly good gets stopped, even just barely, in a way that it's ""out of our hands"" as they say.

Take for example the 2022 pre-christmas rail strike that was planned. Democrats, instead of drawing it up as one bill, split it into two bills. In one bill, all the provisions of the contract that the rail unions were striking against. In the other bill, some paltry few sick days were on offer.

BOTH parties passed the first bill rather quietly, because what the media ran with was the second bill.

Conservative media: The Democrats are trying to push government overreach onto the rail workers. The government shouldn't get involved! Voting NO to show we're pro labor!

""Liberal"" media: Oh no! We voted for the sick leave and it didn't pass! Those darn Republicans! Oh well, get em next time right? PRO LABOR, PRO UNION PARTY AMIRITE?

All this is not to say that there aren't good faith actors in the system, but that good faith actors don't make it far and fall behind in the political game. Thats the consequence of giving the greediest among humanity the most power. The capital class will warp the system to their benefit even and espescially if it means they can leave us behind.

The whole point of our system was that the rich could have their mansions and yachts and nice things beyond what we could have, so long as we got to have a decent living in exchange for our labor. The deal has been broken - and it won't swing our way unless we put up a fight for it. 

***""Well OK Mr Smart Guy, what do we do?""***

Voting can still work if we do it en masse, unified behind a common goal, as a recognizable voting bloc, in conjunction with Dual Power strategies. We would need actual progressives to run and get elected. Starting local and working upwards. Demonstrations would need to be held and they would need to be financially disruptive but peaceful. 

And for those of you so inclined, you would need to find a local militia group like the John Brown Gun Club and join it. Your goal should not be violence, but deterrence and morale for your peaceful-minded compatriots. Should it actually come to needing violence... then God help us all because a full blown violent revolution on our home turf will irreparably destroy many lives and a lot of infrastructure.

This is the most asinine take I've seen in months, congratulations. There is absolutely zero basis for this conclusion. Profit *by definition* involves extracting more resources out of the transaction than the goods are worth - it is *manufactured inefficiency*.

Markets drive efficiency only in cases of scarce resources which are not equally valued by purchasers. We're discussing food, not luxury goods - every human on earth needs food to the exact same extent, and we have plenty of studies stating that the world produces more than enough food to feed everyone. The issue is logistics of distribution, not scarcity of food.

In other words, food does not fill either criteria for efficient market distribution. Instead, it *creates inefficiency* for the purpose of generating profit - the free market cannot distinguish need from want, and buyers who overpurchase or hoard food will be willing to pay more for it, which will be interpreted by the market as ""valuing it more""/""higher demand"" and adjust prices upward accordingly.

The only beneficiaries of a free market system for essential needs with inelastic demand (food/shelter/water/medicine) are overconsumers and sellers - for everyone else it is a net negative, because profit, again *by definition*, is extracting additional value out of the market than actually exists in the transaction.",Gooberpf,t2_yx8y8,8,0,reddit2

jlagoo4,t1_jl9p4ij,2023-05-23 13:50:05,science,"To me, the idea of ""when life begins"" is so unhelpful when we are judging the ethics of abortion as a moral action. because, inevitably, the same stupid line of reasoning is trotted out, and we get so deep in the weeds of the ""exact minute 'life begins"" that it becomes akin to Diogenes bringing a plucked chicken into Plato's school to argue *""See, you defined a human as a featherless biped and I have produced a featherless biped. This is a human""*. Its stupid, and intentionally so. A vain appeal to some definitional abstraction that is not obliged to be true just because humans strung a line of words together. 

We all know, whether outright or intuitively, that a person who has not experienced a single day of lived reality is a different moral entity than a person who has existed for decades. One is an abstraction of a person, a concept. The other is a living, breathing *human* with interpersonal connections, history of agency, and a moral worldview. We know that killing this person would be murder, and that murder is a gravely immoral action. But with an unborn person? If you are willing to make the *exact same moral argument*, its not unlike defining a human as a featherless biped, and getting upset when someone clever comes along poking all sorts of holes in your definition. 

But none of this even gets to what I consider the core of the issue - The pro-life crowd has this belief that their position is the *only moral position*, and that their moral position is *unquestionably* ethical. To me, this is extremely frustrating, because their position has one hugely *unethical* quality (the reduction of female autonomy in a society with a history of reducing female autonomy). But because they have convinced themselves that their interlocuters are literal baby murderers, they absolve themselves of any critical self-reflection that a thinking, ethical person *should do when they curtail the agency of a group of people along some subjective, moral line*. 

So, we end up with two competing ethics - the ethic of protecting the unborn and the ethic of protecting the autonomy of women. Both are imperfect, as allowing abortion will inevitably result in the termination of pregnancy (thus ending life in the pro-life view). And limiting abortion limits the agency of a *majority of citizens* in a very critical way (the decision about how one's own body should be managed). And yet, the 'pro-life' side is, from my observation, totally unconcerned with the dilemma their position creates. They see no dilemma...and how could you when you perceive that your actions are saving babies from a meat grinder. Everything else becomes comparatively minimal when viewed next to that. But with these competing ethics, the pro-choice crowd is the only one willing to ""cross the aisle"" and say ""We understand that this is a serious decision, and not something that should be encouraged for the fun of it"", while the pro-life crowd says ""We don't care how much suffering this will cause, you're wrong and we're right.""

And all of this simply to avoid the unpleasant truth - because of the ethical complexity of the issue, these things should be left to the individual to decide for themselves. Nobody should have *this choice* limited simply because people who lack wisdom decided to strip it away.",rogueblades,t2_4wffd,13,0,reddit2

Life in this context is not referring to ""life"" in the scientific sense, but life in the ethical sense, first off. So it would be better to say ""Human Rights begin at conception"" but the phrase they *use* is ""Life begins at conception.""

Fetus' are of course alive, but to assert that they have human rights at conception *requires* them to be indwelt by something like a soul, as they have no nerves or brain at that stage. But to assume the existence of a soul is a unwarranted positive claim. I would need evidence proving it's existence before I decide to restrict the rights of obviously human people on its basis.

This is a significant misrepresentation. There are exceptions for people with kids **under 7**. Recent research has discovered that most kids continue needing nutrition at least until they’re 9.

You also say able bodied adults but that’s not accurate. It just allows for exceptions for people on SSI/SSDI/VA disability, but that’s an extremely high standard. It also takes months or even years to get approved for those programs. Many people are disabled but not “disabled enough” to qualify or are disabled enough but lack the medical records to prove it because they can’t afford and access regular medical care.

They did one uber eats run to see if that was something that could earn us money in the mean time, quickly learned the $10 wasn't worth it, but the state considered that self-employment and made us disqualify for any unemployment pay. Unfortunately after starting the new job It didn't get much better as my spouse had a medical emergency and spent almost 2 months hospitalized. I totaled my car during that time. Paid a ton in rental fees while waiting on insurance, and now  ""new"" car prob needs new transmission. We both missed 2-3 weeks of work from testing positive for COVID. Then I had my baby over a month early with complications requiring .e to stay in the hospital longer. My spouse has court days due to trying to sue last employer and putting coworker in jail for sexual assault that happened at work. 


I really wish daycare vouchers didn't require you to already be working, I've put almost $3k in daycare tuition on a maxed out credit card while waiting for my application to be approved. I meet all the income guidelines, work 40hrs in medical field, it only asks for like 3 documents (pay stub, photo ID, simple form) so should only take someone 5-10 min to look at, but it keeps getting pushed back. I have to work with 4 weeks of paystubs to be approved for daycare vouchers, but it's so expensive haveing to pay for it before it gets approved. I can't afford to stay at home without pay either. I went back at 6 weeks since I didn't have any paid maternity and had already worked up so much debt from those 6 weeks of bills (baby was over a month early and $10k of NICU bills I'm still fighting). I couldn't have my first day back at work until my kid had their first day at daycare, which they wouldn't let him start until I paid the $1,300 tuition in full first. I've now paid for 3 months while my application for vouchers is still waiting to be approved. I tried to apply while I was still on maternity leave but they kept denying saying I had to be working or had to provide all these filled out forms that we're impossible for me to get when my local management says they aren't authorized to fill it out only headquarters/corporate can, but they are several states away and couldn't fill out the local paperwork, Its all managed by a third party portal with access codes and stuff, Not personalized,  that obviously the local state people aren't going to go online to get, they only want their local forms filled out by hand. Not to mention since I'm at home on leave I don't have access to my corporate emails or contacts (My company actually got purchased/acquired/closed/merged/moved during that time,  So I was completely out of everything, And why I lost all my PTO and maternity leave unexpectedly). They denied me at first for an error they made (I have physical letters that they mailed to me saying that they request documents and the letter itself even says the date that the requested it is dated after the date they said I was denied for not having things by their due date and all the dates are all just mixed up and even the letters arrived weeks apart in the wrong order), but said the only options I have are to file an appeal which takes up to 90 days and recommend a  lawyer  to see them in their appeal court or restart the process which is another 30 days which is more daycare I got to pay for while fighting for things I shouldn't have to be. 


I've had to get state attorney general's office involved 2 separate times within a year to fix issues with health insurance I purchased from the state exchange when they wrongly denied access to care for me and my family. I won both times. But it was a hell of a lot of time and missed work to fight. 

The red tape just makes things so hard for people trying their best. Before Sept-Oct (I've honestly lost track of when it all started to spiral down) of last year things were great and we were debt free other than mortgage. Now we are about $10k in credit card debt, a car loan for a car that needs a transmission, and pending $20k-ish hospital bills and don't qualify for WIC so paying $20 for 2-3 days worth of formula too. Had more programs been available and quick and easy to access when we needed them I would have a much better outlook on our future right now. Ive spent hours filling out pages after pages of financial aid forms for 3 different hospitals, only one excepted it even though they all say the same. At one hospital all I'm asking for is to have a payment plan, I don't even need a discount, just let me split the payment, but I need f re-fill out all the financial aid forms before they allow a payment plan. It's all government run even though it's through a private hospital. Why are some accepting and some declining then? Why do they need months of my bank records just so I can split my bill into a couple payments without going to collection? My health insurance won't pay for my care from when I got my baby checked after the car accident when I was pregnant, saying my car insurance should cover that, but they say they already closed that claim and I have to re-file a ton of papers to try it again, but it's already been months and my doctor told me it will go to collections if I wait longer for the claim to process so I stick it on a credit card. I can't float much longer but on paper make too much for any help, and the help I do qualify runs circles around me, denies, and requires too much time to fight for. Why do I have to fight so much? I take so many unpaid breaks from work to call insurance to see why something denied and for them to re-process it. I eat about one meal a day. Today was 4 perogies. I feel too much financial guilt to eat more. I wish I wasn't a few dollars over the limit for WIC and SNAP, I wish formula  wasn't so expensive. I get breast milk off of strangers online to help. His special preemie formula has been sold out for 2 months, tho WIC has it. This shortage is insane . just 1-3 months of assistance would have us in such a different place than where we are now. 


My dad lost his job of 30+ years during covid, a shop man with very specialized skill set. Took a few months to find a new job at 1/3 the pay. He couldn't get any unemployment due to his SSN haveing errors, apparently already claimed by someone else for benefits? He spent days on the phone that no one picked up. Just busy signals or transfers or automated messages. Reached out to many places but all so booked up or no help. Once he finally got a new job he was back to working 10+ hr days in the shop or on the field and does not have time now for more 8+ hr phone calls hoping someone from the gov office will pick up and know where to direct him.

Nobody should have this choice limited simply because people who lack wisdom decided to strip it away.

Yep, this is the core of the pro-choice argument, and it is why it is fundamentally different. The ethics here *are* complex as they intersect way too much with how people view the meaning of life. I used to think of it from an Evangelical Perspective and because of that my reasoning went to being against abortion, as my assumptions did not allow much else. 

But upon learning the complexity my stance has shifted to pro-choice. Not pro-abortion, of course, I do not think people should be encouraged to have abortions for the sake of having abortions, I think they should have the option and it is not the place of the government to inferfere in that healthcare option.

But the caricature I always hear is that pro-choice people are literally pro-abortion, and as evidence they always find some millennial peer of mine who, steeped in irony, have done something like an abortion party. It is what they did to me, and how they operate: They constantly redefine terms to make circular tautological arguments.

The way things are structured is that not everyone needs to work. There are people born into wealthy families who will never have to work a day in their lives. There are elderly people who haven't been able to save enough to keep up with inflation and have to keep working despite being past retirement age. They stand at the front of Wal Mart greeting folks providing practically 0 functional service to society. 

You're being sold the idea that everyone needs to pitch in so that society can function, you're being sold that story by people who do not need to pitch in. 

I haven't had to vacuum since getting a robot vacuum. Doing the dishes is trivial once you've got a dishwasher. A good washer and dryer save you tons of time on laundry. There are robot lawn mowers. There are apps to order food from highly automated kitchens.

There are so many things out there which would make it so that your weekly chores are done in an hour or two. They are treated as luxuries because a stratified society doesn't want the working class to have access to all of the means that make their lives easier.

Farms are highly industrialized, there are far fewer people who need to work them to yield greater crops. We have so many people who would rather not drive to a McDonald's themselves, that they'll pay an uber driver to deliver it. A simple A to B delivery problem that could largely be handled by flying drones. 

Meanwhile there are people out there whose Job it is to work in medical insurance and find ways to deny people care. There are people out there whose Job it is to make telemarketing phone calls to sway your vote. There are so many people who work jobs that are actually a net negative for productivity. 

We are so far beyond the actual need for work that we invent bad work that hampers the good work so that everyone is left working rather than simply enjoying the fruits of our labour, instead the only ones who get to really enjoy it are the ones who were wealthy enough to never needed to labour.

In fact, 86 percent of all SNAP benefits go to households that include a child, elderly person, or person with disabilities. In addition, about 92 percent of all SNAP benefits go to households with income at or below the federal poverty line.

And even taking into the above, many households have earned income.

>Many SNAP households have earned income. Almost one-third of SNAP households have earned income, though only 20 percent of households have gross monthly income above the federal poverty line. The average SNAP household’s monthly gross income is $872 and net income is $398.

Famines in socialist projects happened. Three main ones come to mind: The Soviet famines of the early 20s (around 1921 to 22, mainly attributable to the ongoing civil war), the Soviet famines of the 30s related to collectivization and worsened by poor harvests and bad weather, and the PRC famines of the 50s. 

Many of their mistakes and problems actually mimicked ones made in profit-oriented societies: unnecessary exporting of foodstuffs (this was especially prominent in the 1930s Soviet famine), bad harvests compounded by bad government policy around how to handle shortages so on.

I'd note I've deliberately excepted famines in states not *necessarily* attributable to a failure of the economic system, like the two German famines during each World War (both due to Allied blockades) - you might say that should apply to the Bengal famine but the British absolutely had the means to ameliorate the situation and refused because Churchill was a massive racist, and by that reasoning the German famines could have been avoided by Germany *not starting the damn wars.*",PlayMp1,t2_evmda,11,0,reddit2

You don't have to keep people in comas on life support indefinitely, especially if the family can't afford the care costs involved. It'd be unethical to force that.

These things are never black and white issues. There are pros and cons, and consequences for every choice made. The abortion debate, to me, is about quantifying harm. Arguing about when life begins and whether abortion equates to murder is pointless. There's tangible negatives that comes from abortion bans...rises in poverty, crime statistics, etc. The potential that an unwanted child might have a problematic home life. The stress from unwilling parenthood and the effects that has on a child's development. How would you weigh all of that against the death of an unborn human? 

I, personally, place more value on the human experience, not the human. An unborn human lacks any history, intelligence, and sense of self. Because of that, I believe abortion is, if not moral, then at least the lesser evil. I genuinely feel that more quantifiable harm comes from banning abortion than allowing it. 

I also believe in bodily autonomy. The woman should have final say in what happens to her, above all else. It's unethical to force people to use their bodies to save others. If you need a new kidney and you know someone who would have a compatible one, then you still need their consent...we can't just force them onto a table and take it. In the case of abortion, this means the unborn loses something they need to live, but I still hold the mother's bodily rights above this.

Of those 5 years, I was legally able to work for 1 (and probably could have gotten an exemption for 1-2 during the green card application process), as I was a dependent on my mom's visa without a green card (or at least that's what I was told by people who know more about the process than me - it's plausible that could be wrong, but regardless).

What would have happened to me if my mom and stepdad had died? I personally would probably have been fine - my stepdad's family would have helped me out, most likely - but hypothetically if my mom and I moved to America on our own with no family?

Do I just give up and starve to death on the streets because I'm not legally allowed to work? And even if I were able to get an exemption of some sort, what about the time it would take to get that, then find work, and then receive my first paycheck?

I would have been an ""able bodied single adult with no kids"" (even if we assume that that'll never get abused) for half that time, but I was in no position to provide for myself at any point.

> Perhaps they live in some other America that I never visited

That is exactly correct. There are many parts of society you have clearly never visited. You would be blown away at the depths of desperation and suffering certain communities of hard-working people have to endure. As you get older, you will become more aware of the aspects of life you have not yet experienced.

Regarding your question, it's challenging to find a specific number for annual starvation deaths in the United States. This is partly because starvation is often a result of other underlying issues, such as homelessness, poverty, or mental health disorders, and it's not always listed as the direct cause of death. Someone who is severely malnourished will likely die from a heart or liver issue rather than from all their muscles failing simultaneously. To understand what death by malnutrition looks like, [this is a pretty good brief summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_States#Health_consequences). The number of Americans who aren't getting enough food [appears to be jumping significantly this year to 25%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/one-in-four-americans-food-insecure/) because of all the cuts to food programs. It looks like the number of people who are categorized as dying purely of malnutrition in the USA is less than 1000 per year, but millions die from poor health as a result of poor nutrition. 

That article also does a good job of explaining how food insecurity makes it much more difficult to work. For instance, if their car has a major malfunction they have to choose between eating or fixing the car. If they rely on their car to get to work, they will lose their job for choosing to eat. 

It is also important to keep in mind that the number of people currently dying of malnutrition is much lower than it would be without these programs in place. You are pointing at the solution and claiming there isn't a problem. If we stopped feeding people through government programs, then we would have hard data on how many people are not starving to death because of these programs. Do you think this is a worthwhile approach? Just to ensure no one is failing to die who you believe deserves it?

Obviously someone who is malnourished is not going to function at their best, which makes it much harder for them to contribute to society by working. Taking away their food until they make enough money to feed themselves is deeply irrational on top of being cruel. It deprives us of significantly more workers than keeping our population functional would.",you-create-energy,t2_xa6ef,1,0,reddit2

Smoking a high CBD marijuana (Cannatonic) mixed with a medium level THC marijuana (I'm a one hit wonder so I use very little) combined with ropinirole lets me sleep. The pain I experienced is ""translated"" to pressure by the marijuana. I don't know how else to explain what happens, but the pain is gone and replaced with a feeling of pressure. The Ropinirole stops my restless leg, arm and body. Yeah, body. At times my entire body jumps. Lasts a microsecond and I lift clear off the bed. First time my wife saw me do it she totally freaked. Luckily the arm and body jerking is not common like the RLS, which is 24/7.

When it's really bad I eat a gummy. Sometimes I have to smoke as well, but I wait an hour before doing so. That combo works well.

f2zfdgj,t3_depwlm,2019-10-08 07:12:49,science,"I wonder if it matters how much the hobby resembles the work or job on a more individual level? Because I had a similar issue when I initially tried going into multimedia as a career. For me the problem was that doing my hobby as a job basically clashed with all the things that I liked about my hobby and that I was confident about, but if how I perceived my hobby had lined up more with how it functions as a job I might not have hated it as much. If that makes sense. Like, I don't feel as confident making stuff that's dictated by someone else and I don't do well when having to create stuff on a schedule with deadlines. So it made something I usually enjoyed and did well at exhausting, and made me constantly compare what I thought would work or what I wanted with what was demanded of me, but if I was the type of person who enjoyed a challenge in that area and did well on a deadline I might have done better. 

If someone did rock climbing as an activity where they focused a lot on safety and just having fun then they might not do well in a job in, say, rescue where it's dangerous and tense and they're out of their element despite performing familiar actions. But maybe they could do fine in a safe lab environment where they can focus on getting results because it's something they're more comfortable with? Alternatively, what if what they like about rock climbing is the thrill, and they're good at going up against a problem and conquering it? Then could they actually do well in a rescue type job that compliments that?",Ppleater,t2_7qn8v,5,0,reddit4

f30qrr6,t3_depwlm,2019-10-08 18:45:55,science,"IIRC the classic maxim for life-work balance is to find three things to which you can apply yourself; one that makes you money, one that gets you exercise, and one as a creative outlet. 

Seems like a lot of people have been tossing out the same half-joke of “what if the scientist is a geologist.”  That doesn’t matter if you’re able to pursue the aspects of the other hobbies that fulfill their respective purpose.  The fact that a geologist is climbing rocks isn’t particular meaningful if the geologist is fully applying him/herself to the rock climbing pursuit.

Many people find burnout with excessive overlap between hobbies and career because they get caught up in the business aspects of their hobby in the course of their work. Then you don’t enjoy the free time hobby of the same kind of pursuit. That’s the whole point of this article and anyone who is laughing it off and distancing themselves from it with pithy irony are doing themselves the greatest disservice.

For anyone who comes across this and is struggling with that balance, for any number of reasons, I can empathize. There are all kinds of reasons that life makes finding this balance difficult. But the best things in life can be found in the active pursuit of them.  Try what interests you as a possible hobby, don’t expect to be great at it when you’re new, and find something that speaks to you in some way.  Rounding out your life to support a hobby and balancing it against responsibilities is what life is all about.

He's in a whole other category, just like Michael Phelps. These ridiculously high performers are certainly the exception. Just like Bill Gates is an exception; I just watched [Inside Bill's Brain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10837476/), and it's incredible to get a glimpse at someone who is so single-mindedly focused on whatever they're doing.

Basically, I'm less willing to use my extra energy or time on work when I have the opportunity to use it on something I find more fulfilling (and I doubt I'll find a career where this will change in relation to climbing).

Perhaps I get anxious less at work when presented with a difficult situation, since I've developed good coping mechanisms for high stress situations over the years (focus on what you're doing and you will more likely be okay).

That being said  I'd happily take a mountain rescue job (the skills transfer over) if it paid well, but it would likely spoil climbing a little in that dragging bodies out of canyons and crevasses is very grim.",,,1,0,reddit4

There are likely some hiring managers that discriminate extremely heavily in favor of women and others that discriminate extremely heavily against them. I didn't expect it to be this strong, though.


Of course, if biased hiring exists, then a male resume contains different information about a candidate than a female resume with an identical job history, which undermines our ability to be confident the hiring was really biased.

Women are typically held back from male dominated fields by perceptions of lack of COMPETENCE. As perceptions of competence improved, discrimination decreased.

Men are typically held back from female dominated fields by perceptions of RISK. (For example, risk of sexual assault or predatory behavior). Perceptions of male competence in female dominated fields may have improved, but perceptions of risk may have not 

I will add that it is possible also that perceptions of competence and perceptions of risk do not equally improve based on overall more positive performance. A single risk case can have more of a negative impact on perception than a single incompetence case

kpe1iur,t1_kpcy7qi,2024-02-07 21:20:18,science,"Here's the issue with that.

She's right, if you're using crime as a marker. 

Here's the issue that.  That's not where you're supposed to stop thinking. 

That would be correct also about a poor person, a black or Latino person, or a young person. I'm sure you could pull up a litany of additional groups you could accurately make that claim about.  You can, accurately, say that statement about those groups of people and not be *factually* incorrect.  This is actually where a lot of ""scientific racists"" get off not thinking they're racist but in fact pragmatists. 

The issue with that is, if that's where you stop thinking, you are in fact a standard textbook bigot. That's exactly how bigots rationalize things. You've reduced all members of a group into the worst version of that group, dehumanizing them so you can then disenfranchise them, while promoting an ideology that openly rationalizes the loss of their equality. 

That same person would not be so casual about saying that about someone from poverty, or a black person, or a Latino person, because they have internalized through social pressure that there is complexity there and they should not do that. Edit: And they don't make the logical connection that all of these groups exhibit higher crime rates due to some societal lack.  Because *they* have been failed in some way by *all of us*. 

The issue seems to be, from my perspective, that we have been conditioned, through the same social pressures to *not* see the complexity when it comes to men.  Society at large promotes this idea, much like society at large promoted women's various disenfranchisements, sustained by both gender's through stereotype. It's used as both an excuse to embody it without serious judgement, and an excuse to be bigoted towards men.

Edit: It seems to me this is made more difficult though by the fact that the world still needs the ""bad man"" image for both fear, and in practice to maintain societal control. I see much of conservative America's forgiveness of police brutality being wrapped up in the perspective that violent men are important to society, and that promoting the inevitable, intrinsic dangerousness of some ""bad men"" (and not seeing this as a systemic problem) protects the acceptance of ""good men"" to use violence without consequence.",BigDowntownRobot,t2_df42v,367,0,reddit1

We know from prior research that there is a tremendous double standard applied to men and women when they sexually assault a minor. We also know that children that are assaulted by women still face elevated risks of trauma and future disorder.

It's a significant blindspot for too many people on this topic.

Another blindspot is that teaching used to be 90+% men. But because it was considered one of the few jobs that obviously favored women, early women's liberation activists focused on the field as a good entry point for women to enter the workforce. A foot in the door.

They argued that girls needed role models in schools and that men don't understand them so more teachers need to be women. And that worked. But they didn't stop pushing at 50% representation. And they never reversed course and said, ""Hey, wait, boys need role models too, we need more men to teach now,"" as the ratio passed 60% and 70%. Now we're in a boys' education crisis with them struggling at all levels of education and being 44% of university students and declining.

Instead, what the people that fought so hard to create the imbalance did was claim that it wasn't their decades-long push to favor women in the field that caused the imbalance, but *the sexism of men*. They claimed that the real reason for the huge swing in gender balance was men fleeing the field to avoid ""being associated with women"", or something like that. 

But if you ask them if they're willing to engage in activism to get more men into teaching they not only won't do it, but it's likely they'll show up as protesters anywhere anyone tries to address the issue. We know this because half of the early founders of the Men's Rights Movement were active feminists that got ostracized for focusing on issues like boys failing in education.

As someone that was on the early education track but had to bail for various reasons(some of which were discrimination I was receiving that I highly disagreed with), I think a lot of men just don't grow up thinking about child care or having to care for their siblings/cousins any more.  You combine that fact with the fact there are far more ""sexy"" career routes for men, and you're gonna see a fairly large dip in the people interested in it.

One avenue that attracted me, other than just having a ton of child care in my background, was the philosophy around ""the most impressionable stage of human development is in those crucial pre-K years and being able to positively influence a child will live on for the next 80+ years of their lives."" I think more men would be cool with early education track if we pushed that positive idea of making a huge influence on kid's lives.  Male ego is a big fan of having a lasting ""legacy"" and this one allows you to literally touch the lives of thousands of kids before you hit retirement age. 

I also think another avenue of attack would just be getting 'fun playful' dudes to sign up for it as well.

Women often have to prioritize time off over pay as the primary caregiver for children or aging parents. For men, who still have that stigma against being caregivers and also likewise feel more burden to be the providers, focus on pay vs time off/benefits.

As far as why we see more men the higher the education level: I speculate it's due to the better perception (grade school vs highschool seen as more prestigious, and even moreso for higher education), and increase of more ""masculine"" disciplines like science and math. Anecdotally, I had 1 male teacher in elementary school, and none at all after that until highschool science. I also think there is an association between elementary school requiring skills like ""good with children "" and ""nurturing"" (feminine coded) vs when they grow, and the focus is more on ""quality "" of education (in parentheses, because I don't believe that being a man has any bearing on quality of teaching, but perhaps that is an existing association)",Necromelody,t2_jived,13,0,reddit1

It's unfair to say that women can't be good at leadership and math or ""logic"", and also assert that men are inherently bad at communicating and empathy (and whatever other traits often passed off as ""masculine"" and ""feminine""). Because often it comes down more to personality and the individual than it does gender.

Men also are underrepresented in fields involving children, and there's evidence that it's having a detrimental effect on young boys.

Less than half of a percentage of the total job market both available and employed.

Race is not a good indicator for criminality in the first place. Other factors have a much higher correlation with criminality that would serve as a more unbiased predictor for risk assessment.

Poverty level, age, and sex have a higher correlation across all racial demographics with criminality than race itself.

Discrimination on these bases is common, and that includes race. There are no micromanaging practices that will erase this fact in a capitalist system where the only risks companies take are which fines they're willing to pay. And when the risks for discrimination against protected classes (that being, white women) is higher than the lawsuits associated with criminal activity in the workplace, you're going to get this sort of disparity. A concentration of all wealth is still in the hands of a very small demographic, mostly compromised of men anyway. Most jobs are held by men, as well.

This is not to say that the woman were inherently smarter than the men. It's just that to be successful as a woman in STEM, you need to be VERY confident, VERY committed, VERY stubborn. Otherwise, you quit. Men were not put through quite the same selection process.

I haven't said (or thought) that, nor have I seen it anywhere in this thread. Indeed, I'd agree that women in STEM, or at least in CS, on average, are more driven than the men. I think it is a tougher path.

I don't see that that necessarily translates for wages (where job hopping, and negotiating at hire likely plays a bigger role). Still, my understanding is that women before childbirth tend to out-earn men in many places and roles these days. I think the gap in tech, for same education and years of experience is essentially noise.

Dishonest people, of course, don't correct for things like hours worked, sometimes even lumping together part-time and full-time, or considering all people over 70% to be full-time, even though there are significant gender skews.

For anecdotes, the three women I knew best in my master's program: one moved into HR where she's now an SVP. The other worked for a number of year's, took time off for the two kids, and decided not to go back. The third is still active, but at a smaller company. I know at my company there are more women in management (as a percent) than the graduating classes, likely the result of execs saying that's what they want (they didn't phrase it that way, they just have an explicit diversity goal to hit a higher percent than the national average, and that of the better schools we tend to higher from). In short, if anything, women are being favored for roles at my company.

(I'm just digging up the studies that show women favored in STEM hiring 2:1 and in entry into the AAAS 10:1 or something)

Studies found:

[National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418878112)

CSA from women to boys is absolutely a problem that is disgustingly downplayed and not taken as serious by society as it should, and does go underreported and happens way more often than people think as your link shows. 

Nevertheless, even accounting for unreported crimes, even your link says nothing to the contrary about men being CSA perpetrators more frequently than women. 

Indeed the two stats your link gave paints a picture,

> We also pooled four years of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and found that 35 percent of male victims who experienced rape or sexual assault reported at least one female perpetrator…

> 96 percent of women who report rape or sexual assault in the NCVS were abused by men. 

Still, female perpetrators happen more than thought, as your link says, still not as common as male perpetrators. Whether it’s a biology thing or a cultural thing causing that, i don’t know, but it doesn’t matter when it comes time for parents to hire a baby sitter to watch their daughter. 

Particularly, the stat from your link shows that only 4% of women rape or SA victims had female perpetrators bs 96% male.

The tl;dr version is that men overall work an average of 3 hours more per week than women, and childless men are around 20% more engaged in the workforce than childless women. Both factors combined lead to more generous raises. To add, once kids are added to the mix, women with children tend to on average work 2 hours less per week than childless women, whereas men with children tend to work slightly more hours. This means that women with children work at least 5 hours less per week than the average man.

kpepqej,t1_kped07o,2024-02-07 23:41:20,science,"I don’t believe this paper says that there isn’t a wage gap. The exact opposite actually. It does say that the gap is smaller in a narrow band of measurement.

“Younger women – those ages 25 to 34 and early in their work lives – have edged closer to wage parity with men in recent years. Starting in 2007, their earnings have consistently stood at about 90 cents to the dollar or more compared with men of the same age. But even as pay parity might appear in reach for women at the start of their careers, the wage gap tends to increase as they age.”

“A good share of the increase in the gender pay gap takes place when women are between the ages of 35 and 44. In 2022, women ages 25 to 34 earned about 92% as much as men of the same ages, but women ages 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 earned 83% as much. The ratio dropped to 79% among those ages 55 to 64. This general pattern has not changed in at least four decades.”

Clearly child-rearing is a large factor, but even controlled for in this paper, a significant gap appears with age. This is POST child-rearing age, when women rejoin the workforce.

“**Employed mothers earn about the same as similarly educated women without children at home; both groups earn less than fathers”**

“Among employed women ages 25 to 34 with at least a bachelor’s degree, both mothers and women without children at home earned 80% as much as fathers in 2022.”

Clearly then motherhood and fatherhood are affecting the genders differently, and women ARE getting paid less even in situations where they should have been the ‘ideal’ pick i.e., they don’t have the burden of children but the male candidate does. Even then we see a wage gap.

**“Higher education, a shift to higher-paying occupations and more labor market experience have helped women narrow the gender pay gap since 1982. But even as women have continued to outpace men in educational attainment, the pay gap has been stuck in a holding pattern since 2002, ranging from 80 to 85 cents to the dollar.”**

kpd2ux2,t1_kpcyirj,2024-02-07 18:08:18,science,"How about the CDC?

The basic point is that made to penetrate is not legally considered rape but it is sexual assault. And it happens at the same rate as rape. And the perps are mostly female. The stats put number of female sexual predators at atleast 42%.

In the US the CDC also gathered the data for ""made to penetrate"" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.

As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm

an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey

and

The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.

vs

an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey

and

Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women. 42% close enough for you?

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.

data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

And non CDC study...

A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.

a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.

And another non CDC study...

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators.

when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).",RyukHunter,t2_3wj7v80t,29,0,reddit1

For starters, even if we assume purely cold and calculated justifications for both forms of discrimination, the cost of pregnancy is much lower than the potential cost of sexual assault. The former, you may have to pay for leave, or you can hire someone else to fill the role. It is typically not that big of a cost to the company, at least in comparison to the lawsuits you'd have to pay if you actively refused to hire women. You're also more likely to hire new employees if you provide better medical coverage in general, regardless of who is more likely to use it once every few years. However, the consequences of hiring a sexual predator are much greater. It's why, you know, companies don't spend money covering up pregnant employees. Even if we ignore the lawsuits that are possible from having SA occurring in the workplace, you have a lot more to lose for keeping a sexual predator on board than you do a pregnant person.

Instead of trying to force this comparison to work, why don't you just switch to a different, more common form of bigotry? Felons, rehabilitated or not, are refused many positions in the workplace. Felons are less likely to commit a crime if given opportunities after serving time. Refusing them the position increases the likelihood of recidivism. Not only that, but the assumption of criminal history is one of the reasons minorities with names and addresses associated with their ethnicity face greater hiring discrimination. This would've been a much more compelling argument than... women getting pregnant. Because it's actually the exact same topic. A double standard implies one has greater consideration for one side on a given topic. But if the consideration is one may need a month of sick leave and one may _rape_ someone, that's not a double standard.

The point is not to blame women. It's to help men by holding female predators accountable which will in turn help women.",RyukHunter,t2_3wj7v80t,13,0,reddit1

How is it not reality? I don't know how many more studies I should cite but you seem hellbent on denying it. By your own sources it's atleast 1 in 3. My sources put it at anywhere from 50 to 80%.

Did you read the empathygap article?

>but to try and say that they are more numerous than male predators feels like a reach to make women “the actual perpetrators of oppression” when nothing you’ve presented actually shows that to be true.

I haven't said they are more numerous than male perpatrators as a whole. They are the majority of perpatrators against men and boys. Don't misquote me. Female perpatrators on the whole are roughly equal to the number of male ones. Not more.

And you seem to be showing your true colours. I never said women were the actual perpatrators of oppression. Neither are men. It's both together. But that's not my aim. I just showed how a severely overlooked issue (female violence against men) is a significant factor in violence against women.

No. 1.7% is the number of men who were raped (As in penetrated forcefully) in their lifetime.

It's also the number of men who were made to penetrate in 12 months before the survey. Which is equal to the 1.6% of women raped.

>And “made to penetrate” isn’t included in rape because it is its own category of sexual assault.

Which is wrong. And exactly the problem when it comes to rape research and statistics.

No that's not the definition. Male victims of made to penetrate are defined separately from male rape victims.",RyukHunter,t2_3wj7v80t,11,0,reddit1

Because rape is considered a more serious crime than sexual assault. By continuing the distinction you are continuing to reinforce that false and dangerous belief that men being victimised by women is not as serious as the other way round.

Yes they do. And it makes sense I guess. You just never hear about such a case. Probably because female om female sexual assault is completely ignored.

Then why the distinction? Honestly rape is an archaic term. It should be eliminated from legal codes (Like it's already the case in many European countries).",RyukHunter,t2_3wj7v80t,1,0,reddit1
kq0q20d,t1_kpyn3yr,2024-02-12 01:31:42,science,"Exactly. 

And I agree, I think each type of sexual assault should have it’s own distinctions and definitions so it’s easier to effectively punish perpetrators in court. The word rape has such a hard definition in a lot of peoples mind, and so I think sexual assault against men isn’t taken as seriously partly because “rape is a woman’s problem” for a lot of people. It’s wrong (men can certainly be raped) but I think a lot of people just make automatic assumptions with male assault victims when the word rape is used for certain forms of assault that makes it harder for them to not only feel comfortable coming forward, but even seek help in the first place.",Candid_Wonder,t2_7h529920,1,0,reddit1
