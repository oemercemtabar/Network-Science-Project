You communicate with the employee that they have your support, and tell them if they need time off to keep you in the loop, whatever they need to be comfortable returning to work. If they want to come right back, respect that wish and just advise them that you are cool and keep an eye on their welfare.  You figure it out and make it work, because your people need to come first.

Its not fucking hard and it chaps my ass thay so many managers just want a power trip, especially over something life-altering like this. I've gotten into heated arguments with corporate over this shit, and I've come out on top every time because the cards land different when they realize that not only are they paying to turn over a staff member but also a manager that costs significantly more to replace.

My people first, fuck everybody else.

I would put in a polite clarification with your manager as to whether there were any issues related to the non scheduling. If it's anything less than 100% you will be scheduled, file for unemployment asap. 
 
If you reside in a city/state that has predictive scheduling you may also request to file for loss wages based on the laws wording. 

Haye to hear you lost a job you enjoyed but may need to unfortunately take quick action to avoid financial issues taking a toll. Also if you have credit cards, check to see if life changing events may be used as a qualifying reason for any potential benefits.",evoslevven,t2_106bco,36,0,reddit4

Get as much as possible in writing, especially email if possible but texts if not. Screenshot and backup anything sent to you. If you get enough info and can prove this was due to a medical issue, you may have some legal recourse - in which case, it is worthwhile to speak to a lawyer. Also speak to your local and federal labor board. Employers get away with a LOT of illegal stuff in the US (and elsewhere) simply because people don't often report it.

You dont have to take shifts and you don't have to be offered them. There is zero ongoing expectation of work. It's pretty exploitative towards the employee because what usually happens is the employer will push for you to take more shifts than you can handle, or shifts on days you already said you can't do, and if you try to exercise your end of the bargain and refuse the shift, they'll just stop giving you hours.

jo62v40,t1_jo5rpv7,2023-06-15 00:13:27,TwoXChromosomes,"That isn't exactly true.

FMLA requires that employees provide notice ""as soon as practicable"" which means that, as long as you meet eligibility requirements, the employer can't punish you for missing work due to needing to care for a qualifying medical condition. Employers usually have a process for vettingleave requests to determine what accommodations and leave will be necessary for something the employee is able to provide notice for, but when an emergency comes up the employer can't discipline an employee for using the FMLA leave they're eligible for as long as they're notified as soon as circumstances allow.

The issue here is that OP might not have been working at this place long enough for FMLA to apply, and (maybe this is clarified later in the thread) the employer might not be big enough for FMLA (there need to be 50 or more employees working in that location or in other locations within 75 miles of that location). If OP hasn't been working there for the full 12 months or if this is a small enough business, FMLA wouldn't apply and that's probably the only way it wouldn't apply in this situation. There might be other laws that would still apply to protect OP in this case, but if it hasn't been the full 12 months then FMLA would not apply.

It's also worth noting that these 12 months don't have to be consecutive as long as the break in employment is less than seven years. So, for example, if OP worked for this employee for three months six years ago and started working for this employee again nine months or more ago, FMLA would apply as long as OP has worked more than 1250 hours in the 12 months prior to the leave.",captaindoctorpurple,t2_o8e20,5,0,reddit4

However, I also find women's professional attire to be pretty damned if you do, damned if you don't. For men, looking professional comes down to covering skin -- exposed arms and exposed legs are highly unprofessional. For women, the height of professional apparel is the skirt -- which is inherently more revealing than pants. Of course an outfit can be too revealing, but (based on all the disparaging things you hear about women's pants suits) it can also be not revealing enough. Women can't be held to the same professional apparel standards as men because the rules are completely different. Clothes are bizarre.

I only hope that these ideas eventually dies out, with the old guard so to speak, because there's really no arguing with them.

But yeah, it sucks, and there's a number of really tight Jewish enclaves in Toronto, so I'm not surprised.

I was due to do some work experience at a military tailors - one of my classmates had gone before me for a couple of weeks. She sent me a message along the lines of ""A word of advice, don't wear a skirt. Manager thinks they're not appropriate"". 

I was a bit taken aback (and so was my friend, who frequently wears modest dresses and skirts because it makes her feel classier, and now had to stick with the one and only pair of jeans she had bought). I asked her if it was possibly a health and safety issue, but apparently not. Apparently it was inappropriate for a woman to show her knees whilst sewing. There was no specified dress code or uniform to wear, so it was sprung on my friend rather out of the blue.

It made me really irritated and I couldn't figure out why - but you've hit the nail on the head. Suddenly we had become potential sexualised figures rather than equal workers. I chose not to go for the work experience in the end due to other circumstances, but there was a time when I was considering sending a politely enquiring e-mail to the manager about all of this.

So, in general, we base our work wardrobe on cultural norms.  We wouldn't wear something extremely low or high cut, for example, to a legal or financial business meeting, because the culture of these industries dictates a higher level of formality.  If someone went against those norms, it would be distracting and make people uncomfortable.

In the orthodox world, cultural norms are much more conservative.  (Yes, I am female. No, i don't have a problem with this.  If you catch me in a more patient mood, maybe i'll launch into an explanation.)  If you walk into an office that adheres to these norms, and you stick out from what's normal, it will serve as a distraction.  

And yes, men are usually more conservatively dressed too.  

All that being said, I wouldn't have gone about it in the same way.  I would hope that, ideally, you would have been given a heads up about the dress code BEFORE you showed up, and in lieu of that, he would have just ignored the situation and made a note for next time, in order not to make your wife uncomfortable.

I'm Jewish, so at first I was just delighted that they would even consider hiring me, but in the end I found the symbolism of the hijab too troubling (strikes me as saying women ought to be ashamed of their femininity), and couldn't do it.

I'm Canadian, and from the GTA as well and I have an answer for you. Unfortunately, the only solution to prevent the discrimination from happening is to expose the issue and pursue it.

I know it sounds exhaustive to pursue when it could set you back, however the majority of Canadian laws are *reactionary*. In this sense, the offense must occur and a sentence passed for a punishment to be handed out. While this is aimed to be a fair system, it has the problem that it doesn't dissuade people from making the offense when the complaint will never be filed and charges can never be laid and of course--no punishment.

So, if your wife would like something to happen, she must pursue it. Though she doesn't have to do it alone. Find a group that may already be seeking class-action against that employer or becoming involved with a group such as the Ontario Federation of Labour Women's Committee. She will still need to be able to publicly support her complaint as the complaint would be filed with the Ministry of Labour, although the OFL *could* make the complaint on her behalf.

Guys need to follow a protocol to have their entire lower bodies covered, while women can wear skirts to their knees. Yeah, there's some gender discrimination going on, and it isn't directed toward your wife.

There are five possibilities 

1-he does it because he believes he should not be seeing a womans exposed knees 

2-what you said

3- he has been avoiding exposure to things everyone else takes for granted his whole life because of his religion and eventually came to appreciate that a big part of it is the more he doesn't see of/have with other women will add one more beautiful unique exclusive aspect to his relationship with his wife and in accordance with the philosophy of his religion he wants to protect it at all costs 

4-some combination of the above

5-he was sexualizing you albeit inadvertently

regardless of that in any of those cases you should have been informed before the interview his religious beliefs and the consequent expectations 

also there is a prohibition against verbally hurting someones feelings


and there is yet another prohibition specifically against embarrassing someone 

also he does occasionally walk outside where women are not dressed to those standards and I would assume in those cases he simply looks at faces and avoids looking at other things (like I try to do)

conclusion he should have at least been exceedingly apologetic and sensitive when he asked you to cover your knees or else simply done the interview and walked in after you were already sitting behind a desk so he wouldnt end up seeing your knees since embarrassing you is a much stronger prohibition than seeing a womans exposed knees however that doesnt make his position discriminatory and certainly if it is the 3rd one I would even say it is laudable and I wish more people today were this devoted to appreciating their spouse properly

WTF!? Crazy. But whatever, the job payed well and I thought ""fuck it, I'll trim my sideburns 3/4 on an inch to meet this dude's standards."" I lasted about 2 months in that place. My employer on several occasions spoke to me in a way I felt was unacceptable. The rest of the staff took it for granted that you just work in fear of this guy and his bullshit expectations and that's just how it is. I chose not to stand for that and I just quit.

You say that this no knees rule doesn't apply to men, but tell me, did you see any male salespeople walking around wearing shorts?  If you did, then maybe you're onto something, but I highly doubt that you did.  Your potential employer had a dress code which mandated modesty for women, this means a skirt below the knees and most likely a prohibition on low cut blouses that your tits hang out of.  I know that there is typically no ""modesty clause"" in male dress codes, but the reality is that the male body and western style of business attire does not allow as many opportunities to present the male form in a sexual way, hence there is rarely a need to implement such a clause.  I have yet to see a pair of khakis designed to accentuate the bulge in a guy's pants, and if I did start to see them, I, personally, would find them inappropriate in a professional setting.

Think about how much character and maturity your wife could have shown if she respectfully agreed to this small request and went on to nail the interview. That kind of thing shows RESPECT.

Instead your wife got offended by somebody else's religious customs. Do you have any idea how ridiculous that is? 

Orthadox jews are people too, their traditions are antiquated, BUT THEY ARE THEIR TRADITIONS. And if you are applying for a job to work for a person who is Orthadox, you should show respect for their tradition. Why do you expect THEM to change?

You are making this out to be a huge SJW issue about objectification and sexualization of the female form. You dont understand anything about Orthadox Judism nor do you respect it. Instead you get angry and offended because it doesn't abide by what you think is ""normal"".

The potential employer could have easily asked your wife to leave without giving her a reason if he didn't like how she was dressed. Instead he asked her for a small sign of respect and was still willing to interview her. That is not sexual objectification, that's the opposite since he was willing to asses your wife's qualifications anyway and give her a fair chance! Your wife's response was extremely short sighted and immature, and borderline oppressive to HIS religion. 

SOURCE: I am a roman catholic male raised in NYC working for a jewish institution. I work around Orthadox jews all day. I respect their religion, and I owe them that respect not only because my Jewish boss was gracious and kind enough to give me job, but because they are people who deserve their religious beliefs respected, just like everyone else.

I don't agree with this. I don't believe for a second that he saw you as a sexual object or reduced you to your body. In fact, on the other hand, I honestly believe he wanted to interview you based on your experience, education, etc and wanted to engage and interact with you as a human being rather than man vs woman.

Would you not have felt more objectified if he had asked you to dress in a more revealing outfit? That would be sexualizing and reducing you to a body.

I personally believe the job ad should've mentioned dress code for the interview. If not, he's at fault. If the job ad did mention dress code and you violated it, then you're at fault. But stating that the guy reduced you to a sexual object is ridiculous.

Starting with the most extreme example, do you believe it is appropriate for an employer to insist their employees wear clothes (as opposed to nudity)? Many people would say this is appropriate and reasonable. If so you might ask then, what should be covered and why? If your reasoning for this answer has to do with modesty or what is appropriate, then you must understand that your definition is socially founded and other social definitions are equally valid to yours. So, back to your situation, the orthodox owner's social definition of what was considered appropriate cover was different than yours, but that does not make it inappropriate except as far as you consider any dress code whatsoever inappropriate.",zok72,t2_nzz79,-4,0,reddit1

The OP said that ""MEN WEARING SHORTS IS NOT THE SAME"" and other have said that it is not the same because shorts are not professional attire. OK. What constitutes professional attire? Is something written in law?

I believe that there is not such thing has a dress code written in law. So the idea of dress code is a cultural social agreement. Most people in business think that such and such is professional, and everybody goes along because it's the culture norm.

My question is why is the views of the business owner about professional attire wrong? She felt offended by it, but what if someone felt offended by some restriction of what is considered ""professional attire""?

In the beginning of the post the husband even describes the wife's Clothing: "" form fitting dress to the knee"". Why is showing a little bit o thigh inappropriate? Why is the nee completely fine? Well you will argue maybe a sexual component to the thigh. So everyone who finds a sexual component to the knee is automatically wrong? 

This seems like a cultural clash more then a sexist issue. I mean I to do find this knee thing to be silly. But I find some things to be scandalous that other people have no problem with.

Why should her wishes and wants supplant the owner of the business?

So I'm wondering if this guy is using his religion as an excuse and taking it one or three hundred steps further and claiming this is against his religion, when really it isn't, but just wants to hide behind it because he has some other nefarious reason behind wanting her knees covered? 

Maybe?

Other than wearing jeans and a T-shirt to work, very few men are going to be affected by a dress code. Women can be policed seemingly at random. Maybe a policy says ""no skirt above the knee,"" but the boss is having a bad day and decides your skirt is too close to the knee. Maybe it says a shirt can only be X inches low, but if you have a bigger bust you'll get called out for having ""too much clevage"" and told your body is indecent, even if your shirt's within company standards. And that's not mentioning schools, where high school girls are regularly reduced to sexual beings and shamed for wearing completely normal clothing like leggings or tank tops.

So no, men aren't going to be wearing mini skirts to the office. But they're also not going to be told their bodies are sinful or indecent by their boss. They're not going to be told that their female boss can't look at them without feeling lust, so they need to go home or put a blanket over their sexy shoulders or wear looser pants.

The point is that he ignored her entirely professional means of dressing (a societally accepted standard) and said it was unprofessional because *female* knees are inappropriate. Men don't wear skirts because societal conventions dictate otherwise; not because men's knees are arbitrarily deemed sexual by their (potential) employers. Men don't wear shorts to work, just like women, because shorts are viewed as too casual for an office environment. I doubt that a man wearing a kilt would be told that his knees were sexually inappropriate. In other words, there are two factors at play. It's not to whom the rules are applied; rather, it's the justification behind the rule that makes it gender discrimination.

cuihzdc,t1_cui686l,2015-08-28 11:14:37,TwoXChromosomes,"First off, it was a ridiculous request to have made of her but there might be a better road to dealing with this.  Couple things potentially working against the labour board claim and I am pointing them out for people who find themselves in similar situations later, not because your wife did anything wrong. She was asked to cover her knees but did she decline and attempt to continue the interview? It sounds like she chose to end the interview process based on the request alone. Again, totally fine she did that and understandable, she did nothing wrong by declining the interview. 

Claim wise, there is no way to demonstrate that she would not have been offered an interview or job had she declined. It would have been better for a labour board claim to have politely declined then been denied an interview or job based on the declining of the request. 

This case will now comedown to is it a labour issue to make this type of request without demonstrating there would be any negative impact for simply saying no thank you. Not sure that is as easy a case to make as your other options. 

It is entirely possible the answer is this type of request is a human rights violation based on how upset your wife was but the labour board issue is a bit tougher.

It's illegal. You cannot force someone to wear religious attire against their will just as you cannot force someone to remove their religious attire against their will. It's part of Religious Accommodation labour laws if I'm correct. In a nut shell, employers cannot discriminate based on religious beliefs and must accommodate them (to the extent that it does not negatively impact business). Same for race, sexual orientation, etc.... Employers who force religious beliefs and practices on their employees can be considered discriminatory since it impedes on the employees personal beliefs. The goal is to create a neutral workplace environment where everyone's beliefs are respected and welcome in a way that does not  negatively impact the business or the workplace environment as a whole.

In terms of forcing someone to cover their knees or various other body parts. Employers cannot force anyone to dress a certain way (like covering their knees, or wearing a uniform) unless it is mandated as part of their dress code policy. However, they cannot have a policy that prevents employees from wearing religious attire (it would be considered as part of not accommodating religious beliefs and discrimination). On top of that, dress code policy must subject each gender to the same policy. They basically cannot make it more difficult for a woman to dress appropriately than a man and vice versa. Hope this answers some of the questions.

I seriously promote reading the labour laws if your Canadian. Everyone should know their rights.

It's sort of the equivalent of a man asked to cut his hair short basically. Back decades ago, women showing their knees in the workplace wasn't acceptable yet people like you and I think nothing of it, in the same sense that my male coworkers can have their fashionable ""sexy"" locks of hair and sometimes have bangs covering their foreheads and resting on their ears and collars rather than the short slicked back look of men in the 50s.

But there are still places with conservative management that are from different backgrounds and are accustomed to the social norms of decades past. There will always be something progressive in fashion that is driven by the youth and things that are unprofessional now will be just fine in the future, something which some fraction of people disapprove of. Wherever the fringe is, it will always exist. And it's been pushed so much in recent history it's difficult for me to imagine it social progress about this accelerating even more just with how long people live.

By that token I don't know that professional attire can be defined or qualified meaningfully without proving particular discrimination beyond gender because as you said, ""'appropriate dress' doesn't mean everyone needs to wear the same thing"" between genders due to feminine and masculine fashion distinctions. And what qualifies as appropriate dress is a matter of personal opinion that varies by person. This is why different businesses have different dress codes. And if *someone* is setting the dress code for a company who has more of a right than the person who owns it? 

I'm obviously against this personally but I have some ethical turmoil with personal rights here and to be honest I think there's very little chance of legal recourse.

But they sent someone in to politely explain the dress code and to offer her a way to fix the problem.

**They never refused to interview her, at all.** They just asked her to cover her knees, since it was the company policy.

Had they let this influence their hiring decision, then yes, this would definitely be considered unacceptable. But they explained and offered to let her fix it. It's hard to tell if the owner was actually discriminatory towards her or if he simply wanted her to follow the dress code before the interview.

Regardless, it isn't discrimination. There aren't laws preventing an employer to set minimum dress requirements for men and women in the workplace. 

Knees aren't a protected class. Women and men alike do not have a right to dress however they want at work. Now, if OP said the men are allowed to wear shorts to work that bare their knees, that would be discriminatory as one group is being treated differently based on sex. But that isn't the case, is it?

Bottom line, the owner of a private company has a right to set minimum dress code requirements in the workplace and there are no legal grounds to call this discrimination.

If it were not culturally mandated that I wear pants, I would consistently wear a skirt. So much more comfortable, especially on a hot day.

It is indeed annoying that appearance is so important in office culture, but I think it serves an important purpose. We use our professional appearance to signal to others attributes such as competence and self awareness.  Its a key indicator. It demonstrates that you are socially aware enough to know what the standards are, and that you are self aware enough to know whether you meet those standards, and it demonstrates that you are organized enough to shave/put makeup on without being late for work. It sucks, and there is definitely sexism at play around appearance, but I don't think including makeup as part of basic professionalism is part of that sexism. 

My perspective may be skewed. I am training at a software house that appears to be fairly diverse and tolerant.

Even for the job interview, parent-teacher conferences, you name it, my face was clean and clear. I didn't play pretend for anyone.

The truth was all of the above, and I wish someone had been honest with *me* about it when I was their age. I had to learn the reasons by trial and error (mostly error--expensive, embarrassing error!). Over time I realized most people didn't care, or didn't say so, but I noticed the faces of my colleagues and wondered how many sported the makeup because they felt they *must* to look professional. How many heard one ""expert"" say so and went along with it?

Insisting on makeup for any profession, with customer face-time or without, is not only sexist by distracting from the actual work for a gender-based double-standard, but also supremely insensitive for those who *can't* wear it due to skin problems, budget problems, or whatever.

I don't care if you care or not I only mention it to highlight the fact that I am not just talking our of my ass. I've had to deal with dress code issues for most of my life. 


- I was on a receiving end of  a negative remark while being interviewed ( I was wearing a blazer and long pants with flats)  by my interviewer who had a secretary in a very casual outfit and was he himself reclining so far back on his chair that he was almost laying down through the interview.  I don't care if he was the owner or not it wasn't professional and I declined  the offer. 


- I had to correct my staff on their dress code and there was a way to do it without offending anyone. 


- I've witnessed first hand an interviewee being informed of the proper dress code if they where to start with the company.  


- I could go on and state every example but those 3 make my point 


She was dressed smartly, if it doesn't suit their policy there was a way to state it.  Not by bringing her something to cover her knees with. The interviewer could make her aware of the fact that it's company policy should she wish to accept the offer if they were offering her the job.

Just watch any show or film set in the 50's/60's when female presence in offices started increasing.  Women were even banned from wearing pants in many workplaces until the 90's!

So the work dress code for women is heavily focused on skirts and dresses. Not made of flowy, loose, light materials but more form fitting.  It's continued from there. 

There are skirts and dresses that are modest but would be deemed inappropriate for work, and that's the kind of stuff you'd see at the beach, for example. 

There isn't really a style of shorts, for men or women, that is good workplace attire.  All ""nice"" women's shorts would be too short, and the nicest men's shorts are a staple for fraternity boys to wear on their ""fancy"" date nights, so it just looks immature.  ",hacelepues,t2_4ievt,7,0,reddit1

There is, however, a qualitative difference between insisting an employee wears/removes a hijab, and insisting that they wear a below-the-knee skirt. Suggesting that they are equivalent is nonsense. 

As I look around my office now, pretending to work before I knock off early on a Friday, there are several women sharing the office. A couple of them are wearing long skirts; it is normal attire. A couple are wearing trousers, also normal. I'm in Auckland, NZ, but I assume things could be the same in Toronto. So the difference between wearing a skirt above the knee and below the knee is not generally especially profound. On the one hand, this means that it shouldn’t be too much of a bother if you wear a slightly shorter skirt. On the other hand, it means that if the shorter skirt is a bother, it’s not unreasonable to require a longer one.

The employer can require that workers dress appropriately. ‘Appropriate’ depends on many things. It depends on the role you are performing, and who you are working with, as well as your cultural milieu. If you are working extensively with religiously conservative clients and colleagues, then appropriate attire changes. You will get judged on how you dress.  That’s a matter of doing your job well.

There are endless comparisons. Why do men have to wear ties in some jobs? Why do many employers proscribe shorts? Or jeans? The answer is usually that workers need to look professional. What it means to look professional varies by context. In some contexts, a skirt above the knee just doesn’t look professional.

Additionally, even if it went past her knees, it would have ridden up when she sat and not covered her knees at all.

And they don't have to refuse to interview her for her attire to affect their hiring. An applicant's attire is part of how they are evaluated, which you clearly agree with, and if women appear to be unprepared for the interview while men don't because there are unusual and illogical expectations for women that don't exist for men, then that is very likely to affect who they actually hire.

As for whose responsibility it is, in my experience, potential employers let you know when the interview process will be atypical or has specific requirements. Additionally, her attire was appropriate for that job title. It would be different if she'd shown up for an interview for say a lab position wearing open toed shoes, since of course closed toed shoes are required in all lab settings, but she wore what sounds like appropriate attire for the job she wanted and for an interview and wasn't informed that there were special requirements that only applied to women. That's where it becomes discriminatory.

That something is gendered has no bearing on whether it's sexist.  Male-gendered fashion is founded on the expectation of working in the military (combat), and/or factories, and regular, potentially aggressive riding of horses (and ""moral"" considerations of what would happen to women if they rode horses mounted like a man).  These situations are largely irrelevant in the modern time, and yet the fashion remains the same, not out of necessity, but because such attire and the occupations they represent were, in past centuries, gendered as male.  

**From a modern point of view, we can see those decisions as being founded upon sexist principles.**

If heavy industry had been considered ""a woman's work,"" then women would have started wearing less frills and more pants far sooner.

Of *course* I saw the dichotomy there, but the hard reality is that there are considerable differences in acceptable business dress for men and women. 

Note: this is is not a complaint, just a clarification of my point. Where ""business"" attire is required, men must wear jackets and ties, even in summer. Choices of colours and patterns are severely limited and shorts are unacceptable (save for the exceptions as above). And even where ""casual"" or ""street"" clothing is policy, skirts and dresses for men are prohibited. 

That's not the entire list and women are also faced with clothing restrictions. These stem from general norms which are and have been very slow to change (hats haven't been expected/required since the '60s, men's vests since the '90s). Fighting that isn't a hill I'm willing to die on right now nor, for that matter, pass on an otherwise excellent job.

The business owner is an ass. His demand might be acceptable (legally?) if the reasoning was an office dress code which matches similar businesses & industries, but completely unacceptable since he stated it was due to his personal beliefs. I'm not familiar enough with Canadian law to comment on the actual legalities but this sort of nonsense is plaguing the US right now.

cuibuuu,t1_cuibb26,2015-08-28 04:59:53,TwoXChromosomes,">‘Appropriate’ depends on many things. It depends on the role you are performing, and who you are working with, as well as your cultural milieu. If you are working extensively with religiously conservative clients and **colleagues**, then appropriate attire changes. 

I completely agree with everything except for the inclusion of colleagues' preferences in the above statement. That's why I said it would be okay if the nature of the business were such that most clients would expect that kind of dress, and why it would be fine to prohibit face tats and green hair. But the OP clearly states that this was solely because of the boss's religious views. What OP's wife was wearing is completely appropriate in that cultural milieu, and I don't think it's reasonable to say it's not appropriate just because someone at that company (even the boss) personally doesn't like it. If you were working somewhere and then tomorrow they went out and hired a lot of people who followed a religion you didn't and who felt uncomfortable with how you dressed, would you need to conform to that because they're your colleagues and now represent a majority of workers in that company? What if the company was sold and your new boss followed a different religion, would it be fair to expect you to dress differently then? Unless it is necessary to perform your function at that business or could, according to the culture of the country where you work, be considered inappropriate or informal, then I don't think colleagues or bosses have any right to impose their religious dress code on you. How is hijab completely different? If the culture in which you're operating says visible knees are fine, but you insist women cover them because your religion requires it, how is that different to, when visible hair is culturally fine, insisting women cover it because your religion requires it?

But that doesn't mean that's a style that is easy to buy in stores.  Look at Brooks Brothers website, that bastion of corporate attire-- there is not one over-the-knee skirt available, and the sole dress that is longer is just past the knee and made of a very stretchy, body-conscious material.  Ann Taylor has mostly quite short skirts.  There are a three of over-the-knee styles, but only one is work appropriate.   It looks frumpy to me.  Worn with a white blouse, a black cardigan, and sensible black shoes one could easily pass for a nun in it.   (The other two longer skirts are a beachy maxi skirt and a dowdy looking beige number with buttons up the front that would look at home in a 1980's Banana Republic catalog-- before they were bought by the Gap and sold safari-wear.)  Look at Nordstrom's site-- every suit in the ""wear to work"" category is at the knee at the longest.

cuibtqn,t1_cuibe4d,2015-08-28 04:58:31,TwoXChromosomes,"I think there are two different issues. Was the dress appropriate for an interview and why was she asked to cover her knees. I don't know enough about Orthodox Judaism to know if there are rules that women's (but not men's) knees must be covered for sexual reasons or not. If she was told that women must cover their knees because he boss finds it too sexual then yea that is gender discrimination. If se was asked to cover her knees because the boss finds bare knees (on men or women) inappropriate for cultural, religious or professional reasons then it isn't gender discrimination. Without him saying explicitly that it was due to her gender, his motives weren't clear.

I disagree that men aren't ever asked to cover more. Generally very short shorts and tank tops are seen as less appropriate on men than women. In the workplace men dress more modestly and cover more than women do. In many schools boys wearing low rider shorts that showed their underwear were made to pull up pants etc. Few boys wear speedos compared to women wearing bikinis. I don't think the argument that women are expected to cover up but men aren't really holds water. In most environments the men will be wearing more clothes and showing less skin than the women. Men don't keep their dress shirts open to show their chests the way women show cleavage. I worked in a  high school as the boys wore far more clothing than the girls did. I can't really think of a work environment where men wouldn't be expected to cover up but women would. 

I disagree too that women's clothes is always seen as sexual. I can't really think of a time when i felt my clothing was perceived as sexual in the workplace.

How does this prove that requiring women to cover their knees is discriminatory when the example you provided was regarding an employer *requiring* women to wear makeup? Oh yeah, she **LOST** the case too. Great example. 

*YOU* don't think it is too risque for a woman to bare her knees (neither do I, but our opinions are irrelevant) but the owner of this company does. If they have a stated dress code requirement in the employee handbook requiring knees to be covered, there is nothing you can do short of quitting. Now going the other way (which is the case example you provided) and requiring women to dress provocatively would be illegal. 

If you can't understand the differences, I don't have the stamina nor the care to explain it to you. This whole thing isn't a women's right issue and women wasting their time arguing that it is, is just that- a waste of time. ",Whit3W0lf,t2_o01rz,-1,0,reddit1

I wore black shoes, a long black skirt (or occasionally brown), a blouse, had clean hair that was always brushed and either put up in a bun or a smoothed pony tail. I never came in with wet hair or something on my face.

The problem is that some of the highly ranked ladies in the office wore high end couture (we're talking Saint Lauren which can literally be a $2k blouse) and massive amounts of jewelry.

I think it comes down to this: if a man showed up dressed ""inappropriately"" or against the dress code in some way, he would not be asked to rectify it immediately. The reason she was asked to is because her knees being exposed was seen as sexual. If a man had, say, worn shorts, his interview might have gone more poorly for having worn casual clothing, or he would have been told of the dress code if they asked him back, but he would not have been asked to cover up his knees. She was wearing professional clothing and was asked to cover up her knees because she was a woman.

It's also worth noting that pencil skirts are almost exclusively worn with pantyhose, so it's not like there's ever bare skin showing. 

That said, it is perfectly reasonable for you to follow whatever religious beliefs you have, and if your religious beliefs keep you from wearing shorts, then that's entirely up to you. However, you cannot enforce your religious beliefs on other people.

cuiuf7k,t1_cuis2fs,2015-08-28 17:38:45,TwoXChromosomes,"To hopefully clarify what I'm asking:

What happens when an employer's expectations of formality prohibit the wearing of a hijab?  What about requiring makeup?  Very strict skirt lengths?

When are expectations of formality considered unacceptable due to religious protections?  Where do religious protections fall short?

I think the problem with the original issue (OP's post) is not inherently a problem of religious dress.  It's more that she was not apprised of this requirement prior to spending the time preparing, travelling to the interview, and then being told that her dress was unacceptable.  Essentially, she was censured on the tenets of a religion to which she does not subscribe, and by standards of which she was not previous apprised.

Perhaps it would be different if the office had maintained a light sheet/draping of some sort (maybe a towel) to accommodate interviewees that hadn't been made aware of this issue.  There's a difference between saying ""could you please cover your knees,"" and, ""the owner is Orthodox Jewish, and asks if you'd be willing to cover your knees with this [towel/sheet/coat/whatever] during the interview out of respect for his religion.""  It would have been even better if they had, in their job posting or interview confirmation, given dress code requirements so that this would not have been in question.  If this is the employer's issue, then he bears the onus (socially and professionally, if not legally) of ensuring that the issue does not become a problem.  Clearly stated dress codes and affordances for those not informed of the dress code both fit as professional, respectful resolutions.",82Caff,t2_j2fbs,1,0,reddit1

I have worked in professional environments for almost 20 years and have never seen or heard a woman being told her clothing is too sexual or too immodest or that she is wearing club clothing. That just doesn't happen where I live. I think a skin tight club dress is actually inappropriate professional work attire. Not because it is too sexual but because it isn't appropriate. I would feel  the exact same about a man who came to work in skin tight leather pants and a skin tight shirt. Same as if both came in their bathing suits. I think there is professional clothing for both men and women and non professional clothing and it isn't only about being sexual. Obviously if I lived where you do where the women are policed and told each day if they are modest or immodest and told to cover up because they are being sexual then I would feel differently. Where I live that doesn't happen as both men as women are expected to dress professionally but no one polices them for immodesty and the expectation for professional dress is not based on sexuality but on what is appropriate in the work environment.

Clients/customers disliking it is not legally a valid reason to tell someone to remove identifying religious wear, or even to transfer them to a non-customer service role within your business.

My question to you is, where the law clearly establishes the right of an employee to dress according to their religious requirements, how can it also uphold the right of an employer to require employees conform to the employer's religious requirements? Isn't the freedom *not* to wear the identifying garb of someone else's religion as much a component of freedom of religion as the freedom to wear identifying garb of your chosen religion? If there were ever a conflict between the two, the employee's beliefs would win out every time.

cuip2a8,t1_cuikqy3,2015-08-28 15:23:50,TwoXChromosomes,"That's not a bad point, and I had to think about it. I think it comes down to dress code again. Any restaurant that had a fancy dress code would have that indicated on their website, or by sign, to make patrons aware of the dress code. That means that it is perfectly reasonable to turn away someone not adhering to it. In this case, there was no indication that the company she was interviewing for had a stricter dress code than the norm, so it's unreasonable for them to enforce it for the interview. 

By any normal standards, she was definitely dressed professionally enough for an interview, but the most important thing is this: if you really believe that the same thing would have happened had she been a man? And to make that question less absurdly about a man wearing a dress to an interview (not that I think men shouldn't be able to do that if they want to), say the man either showed up in some sort of formal shorts and was told to cover up his legs, or idk, showed up in a short-sleeved button-down and was asked to put on a jacket to cover his arms. If you do think the same person might have done those things to a man, then there is no reason to think that this type of discrimination is gender-based.

As to whether or not it was sexual, I suppose you're right, it is a bit of an assumption. But I don't think it's a large leap, though, as the reason given was that the boss was an Orthodox Jew, and the reason for any law about women having to cover up in religious law (that I'm aware of) is ultimately sexual.

cum2obm,t1_cujg642,2015-08-31 18:12:55,TwoXChromosomes,"My opinion on the subject is a bit more nuanced.  As I've stated, the main problem OP's wife faced was that this requirement was thrown at her literally at the last minute, through no fault of her own.

A dress code can serve many purposes, as dress is a form of communication.  How your employees dress will speak volumes about your company, as well as help to set baseline expectations and standards for how employees treat each other.  Your appearance influences how people treat you.  

Dress codes are also, as I previously mentioned, a tool for enforcing health-and-safety standards.  Requiring cleanly-laundered clothing minimizes health risks and increases the quality of the work environment for all attending workers.  ""No jewelry, loose clothing, or skirts"" will protect people from getting pulled into machinery.  I don't feel that religious protections should be considered to supersede health-and-safety requirements, as enforcing such ""freedom"" puts that person, those around them, and the business all at risk.

If the job is in a religiously disposed field (i.e. offices supporting a religious institution), then requiring clothing conforming to that religion's standards is acceptable, as workers are, in some capacity, representing that institution.

As you previously stated, and I agree, an employer is within their rights to establish a dress code that suits their purpose.  The dress code should be rational, clearly posted, and easy to follow; any exemptions should be vetted against health and safety requirements.  In cases where guests are not made aware prior, those requiring the standard should have affordances in place.  It's rude to invite someone in and then make demands on their person or attire.

Specific in this situation, it's not wrong of the boss to require clothing that cover the knee.  It was wrong of him to require it after-the-fact for an interviewee.",82Caff,t2_j2fbs,1,0,reddit1

I agree. If the company expects clothing that meets Orthodox Jewish standards, they need to inform people in advance.

I don't think that's true, though I'm far from an expert.

As I understand the Orthodox Jewish ""dress code"", it applies to both men and women, and requires *tzinut*, often translated as ""modesty"", but translations are always imperfectly inaccurate. *To Be A Jew* defines it as ""moderation in speech, in dress, in eating and drinking, in seeking pleasures and entertainment"".",Khaaannnnn,t2_6yyw6,1,0,reddit1

But it *is* worth exploring this aspect of decriminalizing further to understand why this data shows what it does.

I'm not at all opposed to the idea that prostitutes should be licensed—however much I believe it should be treated as any other profession that also means that one can recognize that it's a high-risk profession in which case it can be licensed and regulated like any other high-risk profession and in order to obtain such a license a course on say STDs should be mandatory of course. I'm entirely okay with a world where it's illegal to offer your services as a prostitute when unlicensed in the same way a construction worker that breaks down your wall must be licensed for if it breaks down a load-bearing wall a lot will go wrong.

Another thing is that it's easier to filter out the slaves that way. The process of obtaining the licence can be used to filter for trafficked slaves that are there against their will more effectively and since it would be illegal to commission the services of an unlicensed prostitute but completely legal to use a licensed one the trafficking business should be less profitable.",quantum_prostate,t2_2csj5ypq,1,0,reddit2

>The problem here lies in the clandestine nature of both the prostitution and trafficking markets, **making it difficult, perhaps impossible, to find hard evidence establishing this relationship**. Our central finding, i.e., that countries with legalized prostitution experience a larger **reported** incidence of trafficking inflows, is therefore best regarded as being based on the most reliable existing data, but needs to be subjected to future scrutiny. More research in this area is definitely warranted, but it **will require the collection of more reliable data to establish firmer conclusions**.

I'm a mediocre white man in tech. The most skilled and productive person I've ever worked with is a woman. She has rewritten most of the project that I worked on for years. She writes code faster than I can spec it, and it runs faster, reads better, and has far fewer errors than mine. If you run ""git blame"" on our project it comes back as 80%-90% her work by lines of code. When I'm wrong, she tells me I'm wrong to my face and explains why. She's pretty much all of the stereotypes of the talented code-bros in silicon valley and other media except that she's also a pleasant person to be around.

The worst person I ever worked with was a basic bro who spent most of his time either talking about cars he wanted to buy, complaining about how easy the work was (a remarkable claim from somebody who never delivered a single complete feature), or complaining about how some companies have hiring incentives for women. This was about the greatest injustice he'd ever seen in the world. Dude was dumb as a rock and toxic, but you can get away with both if people assume that you're ""naturally a logical thinker like all men are"". I used to believe stuff like that (sorry), but now I know it's just because I was told I was ""logical"" all my life since I was a child, and many girls don't receive the same type of encouragement, or even if they do, they end up getting into STEM / programming only to discover that it's poison all the way through. I'm trying to talk my fiancée into a programming career because she's mathematical as all hell (kicks my ass in logic / word puzzles every time), but both of us realize that her biggest challenge will be getting talked over, ignored, joked about, or worse.

Anyway, long story short. We need more women in tech, not just because you deserve to be here, but because better work gets done when you don't have a bunch of basic dudes all saying the same thing in meetings without listening or thinking. The first step is for men to wake up and pull our heads out of our asses. I have to admit that when I first started working with programmers who aren't men (gasp), there was definitely some defensive ego bullshit lurking in my brain and it took me a while to address it.

Generally my first advice is to be initially cool even with off color things until you can identify a clear problematic trend. At the start of a job is when you need to establish a reputation for being level headed and reliable, and it’s sexist as fuck, but that’s STEM for you. Pick your battles *very* carefully. 

A lot of guys who ultimately do not suck 100% will wander in and say something incredibly bad and stupid. (You are simply never safe from working with bad or stupid coworkers; the focus here is on potentially dangerous ones invested in hateful ideology.) My advise is to begin to bully them until they respect you (my tactic) or otherwise set standards for how your coworkers address you. Make it very clear via direct traceable means (text/teams/etc) that there are behaviors/speech that shouldn’t happen around you; I’ve explicitly told guys to take it to the locker room. Ignore what they say when confronted or checked entirely—they might bluster or make empty promises to improve—instead pay 100% attention to whether the shit behavior stops. *It often will.* 

This does require confrontation. Practice in the mirror. It is always acceptable to err on the side of being too formal/professional, but honestly even just asking them to repeat themselves a couple times can be perfectly sufficient. 

But for men who persist and actually say things like this post’s CEO, you may have to start a notebook. “On X day new hire John tried to ‘fix’ a process [experienced female coworker] was working on. As a result, X process was impeded/contaminated/delayed.” “On X day John was heard saying all women smell, causing a dispute that extended the workday.” Etc etc. be objective. I never hand over the notebook, but use it to pick the best/worst incidents to highlight to management. You want a trend of at least three solid events before addressing it if you want the charge to stick. 

The way you proceed from there is heavily dependent on industry and management, but I can tell you what worked in my case. I presented it informally as a training issue; the new hire was struggling and visibly frustrated, and incidentally he expressed concern that his training was conducted by female coworkers. He seemed dubious of his teachers’ qualifications and regularly questioned their routine practices. I said it seems like he has lots to learn about our company policies as well as job-specific training, but he’s having difficulty in the current training structure and would benefit from intervention. I also informed management that regrettably the problematic coworker did not respond well to my teaching style and I wasn’t sure how to respond to visible frustration in the workplace, so I would be focusing my training on the other new hires in the interest of efficiency. 

After that it was out of my hands. He apparently promptly spilled his own beans in his next meeting with the manager, and now my workplace had one less open misogynist. I’ll take it.",Throwaway97104538,t2_qhzzk9v1,25,0,reddit3

ii74j9c,t1_ii6flgz,2022-07-30 00:13:06,TwoXChromosomes,"I think this is a maybe-yes-maybe-no situation. It looks like a lot of trans issues are regulated on a state level rather then federal level, so some states are going to trans-friendly while others will have transphobic laws. I recall, for example, that one of the left-right differences in opinion was that the left considered trans discrimination to be either part of sexual discrimination or an additional type of Title IX discrimination, while the right argues that it's okay to discriminate against trans people because 'it's not part of sexual discrimination' and isn't currently listed as one of the other protected classes. \[Let's not be overly concerned with the interpretations of bigots, though, they make decisions emotionally and then rationalize it after the fact.\]

It looks like the Equality Act seeks to codify trans discrimination by adding it explicitly to Title IX, but it was proposed, passed, the bill is introduced and repeatedly dies in committee, latest because the conservatives were basically refusing to pass almost any bills during the Trump presidency. It's on the table again though.

For sure though, your friend could have checked with a lawyer and maybe (?) it could have been a case depending on the state? Maybe?

In addition the offer rate for interns to convert to a full time job after graduation is fairly high. If they’ve bonded with the team, and the team has invested time in getting them ramped up, they are seen as a good bet for a full time hire. 

Most of the big tech companies also have extensive programs to bring interns in from under represented groups, partnering with schools and other training programs.

So you know how sometimes people bond by being a bit rude to one another? Like I’ll tell my best friend in the world that I want to hurl her into the sun for making a bad pun. Oddly enough, *this* is the energy I aim for when checking dudes’ shitty comments. It’s a way to show disapproval, but you wrap it up in something else—almost a joke—so neither of you have to take it too seriously until a similar comment happens again. 

For example, I’m in the lab working on an assay and I mess up. My male coworker who was already on thin ice makes a comment about me maybe being better at making sandwiches. Very clever. 

I could reply and call him out on being blatantly and overtly sexist. I could complain, I could even tell a manager. I could pretend to entertain the thought that this grown adult man might actually not know why what he said was shitty. 

Or I can immediately and happily offer him an arsenic sandwich made special for him and his whole family, coming right up. 

It’s unhinged, yes. It does take a little bit of audacity. But honestly you’re returning the rude energy he gave off in a whole new direction. If someone has to decide which remark is worse, your silly joke won’t be the problem next to his more blatant and quotidian sexist remark. It’ll tell him quietly not to mess with you, and it’s a style of ‘confrontation’ that is a hell of a lot easier than sitting them down and explaining in little words that their shitty comment—that they already know *damn* well sucks—is problematic. 

Keep it light and dismissive, he’s saying stupid things, you’re just trying to speak his language and you’re saying you disapprove. Maybe if he acts right next time he can regain the respect he visibly lost. 

Oddly enough, I’ve found that this approach occasionally can end in something of a friendship? People respect you when you stand up for yourself, even in this unusual fashion. Everyone wants to be liked and humor plays a big role here. 

Also, a weirdly high number of guys are genuinely so dumb about what is and isn’t offensive… This method I use sets the bar pretty low, so when I actually tell someone I want them to apologize, they know they just messed up *bad.* Honestly? They normally do. 

(I recognize that I am honestly a more confrontational person—what I’m suggesting won’t work for everyone. But it’s a new approach and I’ve had success with it, and I hope this wasn’t too much of an essay and helps someone!)

And this is entirely disproportionate to the general population and must be rectified. Sadly, when tech industry and heads of those businesses quote statistics about women in tech, they regard the change in the statistic rather regarding the change as a proportion of the whole. 

It’s chicken and the egg: how many women in tech roles versus how many women apply for tech roles is probably just as small, because of the uptake of STEM careers when women are still locked out.

Christmas hasn't really felt like a holiday the last few years (or thanksgiving, or any other holiday) and I recognize it's 100% because all that labor has been dumped on me. I'm the one who has to put the tree up and other decorations, who has to make giftwrap accessible for other people, who plans the meals and acquires the ingredients, who makes gift lists to make sure everyone has something, etc etc etc.

It felt magical when these things just ""happened"". Now that it's essentially my job to make these things happen or they don't get done, there's no ""magic"" in anything at all, just utter exhaustion. And I don't even have kids! Right now it's just me, my disabled mom who I live with and help take care of, and my sister visits. Mom is cranky that there's no tree this year or wrapped presents because I just didn't have it in me to put away fall decorations and pull out christmas. Been dealing with having mono and a concussion and struggling just to exist and she wants ""our"" new years resolution for next year to get back into the ""spirit of christmas"". Lolno, you can make that happen yourself. I have bigger problems to worry about than putting up a christmas tree, like managing my chronic illnesses. 

I wish holidays felt better but honestly when all of it is dumped on you to personally deal with on top of all your other regular stuff, oh man. I just feel like garbage from October to January because all I can see it as is additional work that I don't have the extra energy to do. Other people feel entitled to my labor and it's definitely a thankless job so why bother? 

I appreciate that my mom tried to make holidays magical when we were kids and I have an even greater appreciation now of how much work that entailed.

He buys all my gifts and his families gifts, and wraps them. I do the same for him and my family. He put our tree up one evening while I was asleep and took all the decorations out the garage so they'd be ready for us to decorate the house and tree together the following day.

While I did food prep this morning he cleaned the house, and following dinner after I'd cooked, he cleared everything up and got all the leftovers in containers and into the fridge. 

As part of everyone's presents I also made little hampers of home-smoked food, one for each household in families. Every step of the way he's helped, from helping to find good boxes to put the hamper goodies in, to taking part in the curing, smoking and vac packing of various things.

He still doesn't really care about decorations or activities, but he comes with me every year and cuts the tree down, and drags it out of the woods. And he just asks where the lights should go and hops on the ladder to make it happen (I am very afraid of heights). 

He doesn't do any of the baking, but he'll sit for an hour and decorate cookies. And all in all,  I think there were more presents from Santa that he contributes that I did. And typically, I do most of the cooking while he cleans up.

But if only one person, woman or man, is doing all the work of making some event special, then maybe it isn't special for everyone involved. 

I grew up in an immigrant/refugee family. Our holiday traditions tended to be a mash of what we thought were American traditions with whatever was comfortable with the older relatives. For Christmas, there were presents and decorations at some point. The big thing was that we'd gather and have a potluck of sorts, and people would help to clear stuff afterwards (mostly the younger people because of immigrant culture). 

When I celebrated Christmas with my wife's family, it was such a giant difference. It honestly seems more like a stress that my mother-in-law puts on herself because of childhood trauma because her stress pervades throughout and everyone else goes along because they think she needs/wants it.

With the last few pandemic years making it harder to make it a big deal, the holidays have actually been enjoyable. So, I guess I'd just want to add that any kind of holiday magic may not even be wanted by people when it is forced so maybe people should take a step back one year to check if that's the case..

Honestly it just sounds like women in these situations simply settled.

I know several men in my life who do a ton during the holidays. My brother in law does everything, including setting up all the lights and decorations inside and *outside* the house. Two of my best buddies are also the type who decorate and cook and buy/wrap gifts. My brother in law especially is big on Christmas. My sister basically has two jobs during Christmas: Help him pickout gifts, and find matching pajamas for the family that year. He does everything else.

Every year my wife and I take a more egalitarian approach. My wife, my daughter and I all put up the tree and decorations together and every year we take it all down together too. My daughter and I go out together to shop for my wife. My wife and I shop together for our daughter, and we both shop separately for our respective parents/siblings/friends. We also both wrap gifts and I do all the wrapping for my wife because my daughter hates wrapping gifts. Every year she is in charge of breakfast Christmas morning and I'm in charge of dinner that night.

Every year we do a special ""Present from Santa"" even though our daughter is in on the secret. We have it set up special with a note from Santa and near the place that cookies and milk was left out. This is a tradition from my side of the family that I was adamant about passing on. If it's a present that requires assembly, I do the assembly and leave it out for her. If not, my wife does the wrapping in special gold and white paper because she honestly could be a professional gift wrapper.

Stop settling for losers who don't cook, clean, do laundry, chores, help with the kids, remember your birthdays, holidays, or put in work with the festivities.

That stupid thing has to be moved every night starting the DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.  Then as if that's not enough, people will act like you're some kind of xmas hating monster for not having your elf get into ""fun"" trouble at night.  My sister sets up these elaborate scenes for her kids' elves, good for her, it's great really.... however, this makes me have to explain why our elves are so lazy and not fun to my kids.  Did I mention that this bullshit begins the DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.  

Second thing, I have to harass everyone in the house to make their xmas lists to the point that I feel like a drill sergeant demanding toy reports and updates to pass to family who ask for it over and over...   

Third, most of my shopping or packages have to be rushed inside.  In a prefect world I'd arrange them in my hiding closet, but I usually don't have time, so they get thrown in so as not to be seen, and dealt with later.  Here comes later, which by the way is never not Christmas Eve.  Everyone is asking for wrapping paper to wrap their gifts they bought while I'm upstairs in my closet pulling out shit I forgot I had even bought and trying to separate all the items by the person receiving.  Once that is done, I go on to the second sort, which is figuring out who is getting what from my spouse and I, and what is from Santa.  ( I realize that this is a good problem to have and I grew up with not a lot for xmas every year, but this post is about the hidden stress of running it, right?) Now finally everything can be wrapped. You better make sure you have a system to track the presents or tag/label all of them immediately, otherwise you are going to learn a really heartbreaking lesson.  The most depressing part of this will be when I am wrapping my own gifts so that I can partake in the gift opening in the morning.  I literally put in more work than actually needed, since I already know what it is I'm wrapping for myself, just so my kids see me open things too.

I told her, welcome to my world. And she finally realized how I gave her that gift for many years and still do now and again, but as I get older, she's taking over more of the Christmas work for the family and her little brothers who I adopted. 

But this is her choice. She insists on the ""magic"" and as I get older,  I realize just how much that magic was simply hard work. 

I've cut a lot of corners for dinner this year, it's mostly heat and serve. But there's still planning and timings and a few things we still make from scratch just to remind us of the old days I guess.

I grew up in a house with vastly uneven labor. I decided I wouldn't be like that. We try to put equal effort into things. If things get messy and I don't want to clean up I just hire a maid service. It's not that expensive and sucks so much tension out of the house.

You should be. Next year let your boyfriend do it and, if he doesn't, just make a nice meal for yourself and buy something nice for yourself. Unless BF steps up.

>I just didn't realize how much of Christmas I took for granted when my mom was doing all the work and I think a lot of people are probably the same. 

Not in my household growing up in the **1970s** with a SAHM. Putting up the Christmas decorations was a family affair and we all loved it.  Christmas shopping was also a family affair. The parents would take us kids out and we'd buy X-mas presents for everyone in the family. Parents would go together to get presents for the kids.

We each took great joy in wrapping the presents we had bought. I couldn't tell you for sure who wrapped the presents to us kids, but I'd guess my parents did it together.

Food shopping was a family affair. That was normal as we did the weekly shopping together.

The table being set with the fancy china was done by the children because we wanted to use it. (Only got used at Thanksgiving and Christmas.)

My mother did do the cooking. But I took over holiday meal prep as a teen after my father died and that's when I realized how easy it was. The only thing made from scratch was the mashed potatoes. Every thing else came out of a package. Always the same five things: frozen Green Giant niblets corn in butter, Pepperidge Farm stuffing, a can of cranberry jelly, refrigerated rolls from a can and gravy from a mix (which later became gravy from a jar). For the turkey my mother's cooking technique was to put the turkey in a covered roaster with a couple of inches water and then ignore it until it was done. (Turkey always came out very juicy.) We never had a dessert until I decided to start making it and I'd make two pies: lemon meringue and chocolate both from Jello pudding mixes in store bought pie shells.

We'd clear the table as a family.

My mother would do the dishes herself. But she had OCD. She had this thing about washing dishes. But once they air dried, we kids would put the fancy china up.

At the end, we'd take the decorations down as a family.

Frankly, it sounds like your father, like your boyfriend, are both just lazy.

EDIT: And let me add that we weren't some happy, together family. We were really dysfunctional. You try having a mother with multiple undiagnosed mental illnesses and a distant father with a drinking problem. It was Lord of the Flies at my house.

I didn't celebrate any of our holidays beyond the essential religious stuff after I moved out of the parents house. They were essentially much needed holidays to unwind.  Not wind myself up with celebrations of things that haven't mattered in thousands of years. 

My wife however loves them.  She loves the decor,  the smells, the ambiance the society and she would start planning and preparing for the next one as soon as one ended and just getting more hectic as the next came closer

Of course we eventually ended up arguing about it because I didn't really give a shit beyond going shopping with her and forking out some money when required.

She understands now that as much a she doesn't appreciate my lack of interest in these holidays and the effect it has on her enjoyment of them,  I also don't appreciate her interest in these holidays and the affect she has on my enjoyment of them.

My parents do the whole thing and divide work:dad buys and sets up the tree, mom decorates with some help from dad (high up in the tree), dad preps all the veggies and meat (all cleaning and cutting, some dishes require fine chopping) and mom does the cooking. They also hire a cleaner before Xmas to come make the house ready for holidays.

My in-laws make tamales and the whole family makes the tamales for 1-2hrs at the big table. Even the kids. When they make other food, FIL is in charge of meat, MIL makes the sides.

My mum's family always does Christmas, but I cut ties with them when I was 8 because they're racist and abusive af; I only have a vague memory of what it was like with them. My dad's family used to get together on Christmas day, but we were officially celebrating granny's birthday, and there was an explicit agreement that she was the only one who got gifts (although us kids always got a few). They see it as pointless consumerism, and nobody wants the stress of Christmas shopping or additional unwanted junk cluttering up the house. More often than not, we did it at a restaurant, so that nobody had to host. Granny died ~15 years ago and her funeral was the last time they met. With the exception of one aunt on my mother's side, none of us are religious, so it was a meaningless holiday anyway. I have only had a Christmas tree at home three times in my life. I have done one Christmas with the family of a friend and they were pretty similar; a couple of salads and lots of nibbles, but no Christmas tree and very casual. Christmas is just not a big deal for us and I didnt realise it's supposed to be such a stressful event. 

Is it normal to be angry at people who don't want to participate? It's supposed to be about family, right? Why not just get a pizza and chill out together? If he's not pulling his weight in general, that's an issue I understand; nobody wants to look after a bunch of grown adults who can't look after themselves, but why is he the bad guy for opting out of a fancy Christmas do? If mum wants to go all out, that's pretty cool and I'd probably get in on it too, but I wouldn't be trying to bully others into taking part. What is the point in that?

Usually, it is at least me and my mom at home for Christmas. Sometimes my brother too. And if we are putting up a tree, we are all involved in it. We all decorate it together. That was always part of christmas itself. Decorating the tree together. And i always assumed that was the case with people but apparently not. 

We get presents for each other. But we do our own shopping. She used to get the presents for us when we were kids. But never anything for the adults, mainly because we probably could not afford it at that point. But since we have been able to, everyone does their own shopping for gifts for everyone else.

When I visit my mom she's constantly finding new ways to make work for herself and everyone else that just feels completely overwhelming and unnecessary to me. She has this drive to make everything ""perfect,"" but I never see her actually enjoying it.

I don't want a ""perfect"" holiday, I want to enjoy my mom's company while *relaxing* together. I don't need a homemade feast with five desserts. I don't need every inch of the house to be ""festive."" I don't need to use the fancy silverware that you have to hand wash and polish (that frankly looks exactly like the ""normal"" kind to me). I don't need an enormous pile of impeccably-wrapped gifts.

My siblings and I would all be happier with no decorations, crap food from the store, one gift each, and a movie marathon while our kids play with their grandparents. As it is, she has zero time to play with the kids because she's making everything ""perfect.""

It's a self-esteem thing, I think. She can't accept that we genuinely come to see her, not for all the food and stuff. But she overcompensates and leaves everyone feeling overstimulated and exhausted. Then she gets upset that she ""has to do so much work."" Just... please don't.

That said, we know that traditions are important to my mom and one of my sisters, so we happily join in on simple things like decorating the tree, decorating cookies, and exchanging smaller gifts. We even do a chunk of the cleanup and bring food to share. It's not an unwillingness to help, we just genuinely want...more chill fun and less of everything else.

My Christmas celebration at home with my kid and husband was mostly store-bought foods (I have chronic pain and can't do much cooking). We decorated the tree at Thanksgiving. We made little pre-baked gingerbread houses from Aldi and simple Christmas crafts from Target. We didn't even wrap her gifts, just gave her what could fit in her stocking. Even if I'd wanted to do more (I really did want to buy more presents), I know that my daughter shuts down and gets really cranky when overstimulated. So, I genuinely gave her less stuff so we could have more fun.

OP's boyfriend and her probably just need to meet in the middle. She could do less, he could do more. Whatever they decide, if they make the plans *together* it will be more fun for everyone.",IShipHazzo,t2_5rviyunz,143,0,reddit1

Sure there's people who still want to preserve those traditions into adulthood, but like you said, it's unfair to *expect* others to put work into something that they don't want nor need. If only one person cares and the benefits of doing it are really just for themselves, they should focus their efforts into making it enjoyable for *themselves* specifically, and any help they receive should be a nice appreciated extra instead of something to be expected.",Thefancypotato,t2_xeev0,114,0,reddit1

j1ns7db,t1_j1npf0w,2022-12-25 22:57:38,TwoXChromosomes,"Ditto. My mother was also someone (along with my father) who doesn’t care for Christmas. It was about going together on a family vacation, having a nice dinner, or just watching a movie together. No decorations, no wrapping presents, etc.

I don’t want to come across as indelicate since I know a lot of people enjoy going all-out on Christmas, but there are also many people who just legitimately do not care for it.

My mother has never cared for decorations, wrapping gifts, etc. It wasn’t because my dad didn’t out in effort either. She just didn’t get see the point. My mother would actually ask my dad why he was wasting time putting up “useless” decorations when they could be doing other things together for the holidays.

To assume Christmas *has* to be X, Y, and Z is the same as how men assume women *have* to care about their interests (cars, action hero movies, etc.) Sometimes, you just gotta acknowledge that your own interests are just that: your own, and people are **not** obligated to go all-out to help you fulfill them.",Interdimension,t2_gv4n9,7,0,reddit1

When the younger of his sister lives in the same city their mom lives, and has a car, while the oldest sister lives hours away, never contributing to any expenses, and while barking what hubby should do, oh, and yea, he should send her money too, cause of her children need it!

All the while making me out to be some evil money hungry whore(i earn the same as hubby) who is turning him against his family(i told him, after all their stunts and the money they both owe us, we are NOT sending them any money), and like how im not a real woman.

He got so frustrated with his oldest sister that he didnt even invite her to the wedding lol.

Sorry! I really needed this as i know that even tho hubby doesnt entertains them, he still loves his sisters and nieces so i usually dont badmouth them to him.

He also refused to listen to me about about that we now serve more portions to one room and if they don't get it they will call and ask for it. He argued with me and told the from that they can tell them they ""don't need it""(he hadn't been in the kitchen for about a month and the amountthey got changed) and was like ""they don't need it, I am prepping it"" and they of course called and asked for the extra food. 
I was like ""see? it is a good thing there is more still, I told you they were going to ask for it"" Then he decided to prep the other stuff and go home and when I had to serve it we were about 6 peoples short of everything (which is the exta they needed and told him about). 
I sent what was finished and of course I waited to see if they called for it, because  it ment cutting up a whole cantaloupe and opening food (that weren't open yet) just for a couple people last minute rush and then having to store all the extra. 
Of course they called and it cause me more problems because he just refused to listen to me and say ""they didn't need it"" only to leave with me thinking that after the first issue he then portioned the correct amounts after because he said it was ""all done"" only to find out he still refused to listen to someone who knew more than him.

*People* are hard to work with. In the veterinary industry we are dominated by female doctors and nurses and they are *incredibly* toxic. Gaslighting, passive aggression, physical fights, tattling, cliquing, the works. A decade of hell from different clinics, major hospitals, and it’s all the same. The all female clinics were undoubtedly the worst. A single male doctor or nurse will even out the hysterics, and that is a serious claim almost anyone on the field will make. This doesn’t mean that women dominated fields are terrible, this means that all *people* are insufferable to work with in way too many scenarios.

No, women dominated spaces are not inherently better. All people suck under pressure and it depends heavily on the industry whether or not the *people* behave. 

I worked in field engineering/electrical with all men and it was healthy and easygoing.

Worked in an art space with both men and women with ease.

I’ve worked in tech with both insufferable men and women.

Being the only man or woman in an opposite gendered space puts you at an immediate disadvantage, of course it’s going to suck. I’ve worked in a female dominated space with a male several times and there is just as much climbing up their back, micromanagement, and making them uncomfortable as well.",Gimmenakedcats,t2_170zkn,18,0,reddit2

From a european perspective that's kinda ridiculous, since we already have that (since 2007 for Germany) and that's with still mostly men in positions of power. The distribution of the parental leave between women and men is still a huge issue though (and the number of men who are using ANY of the legally guaranteed time is shockingly low, especially considering that in my job I don't know a single father who didn't)

koggc9n,t1_kof73bn,2024-02-01 16:54:31,TwoXChromosomes,"Just speaking as long-time game dev and Internet writer, an entitlement complex towards creators definitely doesn’t know gender bounds. But there’s absolutely layers when a creator is visibly feminine and most of the consumers are straight men.

I had to get into it with someone on r/artbusiness that while he meant well with “just ignore hateful IG comments and misogynistic abuse on Steam”, it just isn’t that simple. Yes, there’s women trolls out there who are just as vile and resentful as men. But a shitty comment might ruin your feed for the day, toxic gamer bros will make it a point to ruin your entire career. Like there’s a REASON why game dev is one of the hardest creative professions that is also incredibly expensive and unpredictable, but also has some of the most entitled and toxic fans. There’s a freaking canyon between insane AAA budgets and how indie devs have to fight for scraps, and marginalized creators bear the brunt.

And that’s not even getting into what we face WITHIN our industry. Remember all the horrid institutional misogyny that came to light at Activision like women’s freaking breast milk being stolen from the fridge? The “Cosby Suite”?

I’ve been independent my whole career and managed to avoid a lot of that as a result, but not totally immune. I’ve posted some of my experience in this thread but someone who I thought was an actual work friend who I met through a professional Discord group turned out to be anything but that. 

This man Googled past talks of mine and brought up my appearance first, not the subjects. This amped up after we met in person at a big party. Then he sexualized a picture of me cuddling with my pet and that was IT. I knew I had to yeet this fucking creep from my life and now I don’t want to post in that Discord anymore.

This is how I handle it.  Know in yourself that you are probably smarter and more talented than the males on the team.  

Ask questions When they criticize your work. How can WE make this better? How is it better the other way? If the answer is because it's easier to develop at the expense of user experience, ask for user testing for both concepts. If they complain about user testing, ask why should WE develop something that users hate? If users hate the experience, they won't use it.  THAT is a fact.

If the concept of user testing is anathema to the company, bring your concepts and designs to people receptive to looking at your designs/concepts and giving you feedback.  Take them for  a coffee, donut, whatever to get your feedback.  ALWAYS, always keep it about the work, so no sexual misunderstandings happen. So if you think someone may be a little interested in you sexually, cross them off your list for feedback.

There are good men out there.  They will give you feedback without issue. They will also help you.  Seek them out.

I'm an introvert.  This is always hard for me. Sometimes you need to step out of your comfort zone to get what YOU need to turn out a quality product.

So, through sheer force, we're slowly giving more and more opportunity and power to women - which is a great thing. Many industries are actively hiring and promoting women to gain balance where men have had all the privileges. 

Young men today are told that men built a system to benefit themselves, but don't feel like the system is benefitting them at all. They now feel like women are now given an 'unfair' advantage over them.

On a society-wide level, this of course is not true, but an an individual level it can explain the backlash of increasing sexism and misogyny. 

I feel that it's time to give woman all the opportunity and power - for better or worse, regardless of how 'unfair' it may seem to some - just to see what happens.

I think it's important to know that women (even throught they're a bit less than 50% of the total pop) are treated like a minority.

Don't know if it's still like that but, the ads, when you watch tv you always get a load of ad.
I'm fr**ch and I can remember an ad for a car. The ad had one particular sentence ""if he gets the car, he will the woman""  Women are often associated with a variety of items and that you can have them if you have this or that object. The problem : this will lead to think that women can be posseded and are more than a object but less than a man.
Of course, men also got this kind of ad but most of us come from a very patriarcal system were men aren't see as a minority.
And even if all the ad are not the same as the one a give for exemple, a lot of them follow the same directive.

If in a society you are the minority and seen like a lesser human being, it will lead to what we have right now. And like in every society, when a minority got a bit to much of hightlight they will be hated by a part of the majority ( Niceguys, sexiste people in general )

I'm not sure if you read the article you linked here, but it says this:

""This means that for almost all non-football athletes, and across nearly all sports, female athletes have many more athletic scholarships available to them than do men. This is supposedly made up for by the availability of football scholarships to men, but only a tiny proportion of men are big enough to play football, which is largely a sport for giants. And even for those men who could snag a football scholarship, it should be considered a form of gender discrimination to funnel men, and only men, into an incredibly dangerous and violent sport. Giving more scholarships to women for track and soccer while telling men to play football virtually guarantees that male athletes are put at greater risk for extremely serious injuries, including brain injuries with lifelong consequences.""

Male students speak in college classrooms 1.6 times as often as women, according to a new academic article published in Gender & Society based on 95 hours of observation in nine classrooms across multiple disciplines at an elite institution.

The researchers found that, compared with female students, male students are more likely to speak without raising their hands, to interrupt and to engage in prolonged conversations.

Women are significantly more likely to die, or be seriously injured, in car crashes than men. 

Crash testing is often based on a standardised 50th percentile male dummy. This equates to a 1.77m tall man weighing 76kg which is significantly taller and heavier than an average women.
Female crash test dummies do exist but they are not mandated to be used in most tests. A pregnant crash-test dummy was created in 1996 but testing with it is still not government- mandated either in the US or in the EU.
Women are thought to be less well protected than men. A study by researchers at the University of Virginia found that women wearing seat belts were 47% more likely than male seat belt-wearers to be seriously injured and 71% more likely to be moderately injured.

In the fields I worked in, workers often had to explain/educate a customer on various things so we got a lot of questions.  If a male coworker ever walked by while I explained something to a customer, half the time the customer (males and females alike) would immediately ignore me and ask the male coworker their question or ask them if my answer was correct.

Thankfully, my male coworkers hated casual misogyny and would usually say something along the lines of ""I don't know anything about xyz, she's the expert in that subject"" and walk off.  After which, the customer would listen to me just fine.

idiq156,t3_vj84w0,2022-06-24 04:04:27,TwoXChromosomes,"Probably victimhood claims by men are given more credit even if they are mocked, they are atleast believed most of the time.

Just think about people who protected Kevin Spacey (including an aquintance of mine) and called the accusation lies up until the point they realized his accusers were male. All cases where a male says he was victimized are more likely to be believed unless the story sounds fishy. 

I don't say ""believe all women"" because it's nonsense. Innocent until proven guilty and all that. But I would also say that you shouldn't accuse some of lying or suggest they are lying beacuse they are a woman. Stay neutral until the full truth is out and don't try to bury an accusation just because you don't trust/like the accuser. 

This is true to not just rape and domestic abuse, but bullying too. Everyone suggests that girls are worse bullies beacause they hurt you more, but I was bullied and the worst were the boys. Girls are better at mean comments and mean comments hurt, sure. Jokes made about killing you for the lols hurt more, IMO. Boys hit harder. Boys attack in bigger groups. Boys are more likely to be pick on people with non-conventional looks, weaker backgrounds or no social circles to protect them. They are more likely to enforce ""norms"" as children at the cost of violence, like tyrannical little shits aiming for an application at for the taliban. The boys were always the first to point out a new accessory or haircut that was too edgy for them. They get the ""boys will be boys"" and the ""that's how they show they like you"" treatment when the bullying is serious and purely out of malice. 

Education system: The education system is failing. Is it because it's bloated and full of useless information while not teaching real life skills? No, it's because boys are doing worse than girls,. (sarcasm) People complain that boys do worse because they are discriminated and disciplined more. I think it's BS. Boys misbehaved more in every schools I've been in. Plus, teenage boys trying to hold a conversation while ""whispering"" in the back of the classroom sounds like 2 bears having an arguement over mating rights.  They get disciplined more because they misbehave more. They do worse because they get bored more easily. However, you can never teach algebra or the tudor house's history while playing soccer or fortnite, sorry. If we fix the education system everyone will do better and the difference between boys and girls would be relatively the same, but on a higher level. 

As ThankstoDenial said below me. Proffessional sports is one. My country had terrible sport teams for years to the point that most people wanted the state to cut founding to their overpayed as fuck teams. Luckily they managed to bring home something substancial lately, but it's been years of humiliation thanks to them. Meanwhile our women's basketball and handball teams were really successful.

She's also quite a reserved person, so wanted someone to filter out salesy bullshit). As we walked into the showroom, the sales guy immediately walked up to me to ask how he can help. So I just directed him to her.

So we went around, looked at a few cars, she decided she wanted to test drive one, so back in we went to ask for a drive, obviously he came immediately to me again. Redirect number 2.

When we got back from the drive, in which I was just a passenger listening to the car, looking for warning signs etc, friend and I went to have a chat so I could give her my opinion, and she decided she wanted to buy it, so back to the sales guy. He sat down and looked at me, just pointing towards my friend. At that point, I think he got the hint, because from then on he gave her his direct attention.

It was similar when my wife and I went car shopping for a car for her, and I had to point out then that it was her car, she was the buyer and making all the decisions, but I don't remember it being that bad; maybe this guy was just a bit slower on the uptake.

It took me a lot of self discovery and maturity to come to grips with my misogyny. Once I did, I finally learned to look at at my actions with more honesty. I found that as long as misogynists can claim some sort of plausible deniability, they will justify hate very easily ie gamergate being about “ethics in journalism”, and totally not an online hate mob full of sexist pigs. 

But more importantly, I came to grips with why I had such a reactionary world view: I felt scared.

What my kids watch on youtube is pretty split female/male host but you cant really compare Mr beast or pewdie pie, they been at it for ages and though I don't watch, Mr beast seems to put alot of effort and money into his content.


Not sure which female you tubers deserve to be on the top but if Lilly Singh is top 3 female youtuber and pewdiepie is no1 then it's more about people having shit taste than algorithm pushing away women.

Its like comedy, men or women can choose to watch it and make it popular but it's not a sexist thing when 46% the viewers on youtube are women.

The rest of examples may be diffrent but I would argue the same with sports.
Most people watching sports are men (not me but I digress) if people aren't interested then it's not making money or views.

My personal theory is that women get so much attention that they learn how to filter it out (My assumption is that unwanted attention is pretty easily rebuffed politely under the proper social circumstances).

Men have a different experience in some cases.

""Highly attractive"" males may have a little bit more difficulty rebuffing unwanted advances.

A completely normal female may approach such a male and be rejected (which is totally normal everyone experiences rejection).

My point is that ""highly attractive"" people may have different experiences based on their gender.",atb12688,t2_48tdp,-36,0,reddit3

Like I’ll admit .5% of my reasoning in not wanting kids (amongst a multitude of other reasons) is that if they’d ever die I wouldn’t want to be judged by my likely initial inability to cry due to my shock and confusion. I’ve heard of moms being ostracised, publicly ridiculed, or horribly harassed (especially if the kid really is missing) because they didn’t weep for the nosy masses on CNN or whatever, and then it’s all swept under the rug, like a billion+ people didn’t just call a grieving mother a heartless bitch repeatedly for 1-3 months on every possible version social media. “But she didn’t CRY! She totally did it!” And if the kid is missing for years, well, then it’s like an anniversary to re-incense people + when documentaries get made. In the end, even if she wasn’t involved but especially if the kid is found dead, that’s kind of her public image for life while often the husband or boyfriend is more like a “yeah and him too probably.”",TheNonCompliant,t2_14qgnw,18,0,reddit3

I'd get notified it was a bluescreen when I restarted. This along with the fact that I had an attic room with the sun in the evening shining right into my window and it easily becoming 35°C in my room when I played... I figured that my graphic card broke due to warmth and overheating issues. 

And I explained all of the above in detail to the man at the only computer store in our town, while my dad was standing next to me as he drove me to the store. And the man behind the counter, while I explained what was wrong with my pc was only looking at my father. When I finished speaking he asked my father ""so, what is the problem with the pc?"" At which point my father, who knows fuck all about computers goes ""I dunno, she just explained it? It's *her* pc.""

Furthermore, in no way are those studies designed to ""kill off"" the people who participate. Companies wade through layers of bureaucracy to even get to the stage of human studies! A lot of pharmaceuticals are not even being explored just due to that burden. If a treatment applies to rich white men, it will be more likely to be developed than a population with a rare disease or from a non-abundant community.

 New treatments being studied and tested for market are NOT a way to talk about disposable a population is - it shows how IMPORTANT THE POPULATION GETTING THE MEDICINE MADE FOR THEM ARE.


There are a lot of vaccines for deadly diseases that are only endemic in non-rich countries, which rich countries do not put funding towards unless the risk of spread is high. Why? **Funding is to protect populations that are deemed important.** 

The people who are more disposable are those who don't have medications targeted towards them. 

People who are disposable are given a societal hand of, ""take this or things will be worse for you"". So, they take it, and have a higher incidence of adverse effects in their population. [BTW that was my parable of women and birth control]",DigbyChickenZone,t2_8rmvk,5,0,reddit3

However, having your demographic (women) entirely overlooked in clinical trials can leave permanent harm, which can also be challenged, but is less likely to be won, because “oh well that drug has already been FDA approved”  

3. The “men are disposable” line is frequently repeated by individuals with misogynistic intentions.

People think there’s this wave of adult ADHD diagnoses based on recent media and it’s all just a big hype but really it’s women becoming educated on what ADHD actually looks like in women, recognising they’ve been experiencing it all their lives, and seeking treatment. 

In Australia, ADHD medications are not available for government rebates if you were diagnosed in adulthood. It’s only on our pharmaceutical benefits scheme for those diagnosed in childhood. So women whose symptoms were present but ignored in childhood are required to pay the full cost out of pocket where our brothers or male friends diagnosed at 5 years old get discount prescriptions for life.

Men and Women will never be equal, based on that we are not the same. We have different physiology for a reason. As a species of animal on planet earth, Women can create life, can nurture and heal. Men are physically bigger and stronger to protect those traits. The problem is not equality, it's respect. We have all been conditioned in modern society to forget our natural programming and try to defeat it. We compliment each other. We can do things the other cannot because it works both ways to maintain balance. That balance has been shifted and now it is a power struggle. A long time ago Men took power and abused it. Now that's the norm. Doesn't mean it's right. 

Old native tribes had a system when in a time of peace, the women elders made all the decisions for the Tribe. In time for war, they handed the control to the men to protect them, and they didn't ask how or tell them how to do it. When the war was over, the men were welcomed back into the Tribe and thanked for their protection, they shared the experience, and no one was left out. Power was returned to the Women and they resumed peaceful life. Sebastian Junger talks about it in his book ""Tribe"". It points out the fallacy of today's society where PTSD is prevalent because our modern culture doesn't do that. We don't share our traumas and are constantly told how to be, and what to be. We are not accepted to be ourselves, so now everyone is screaming to be allowed to be themselves, and just want respect and acceptance.

The halo effect is very real. People in general were far more welcoming to me when I was pretty than when i was ugly. People would do nice things for me out of the blue and generally wanted to be around me, no matter how awful I became. When people throw themselves at your feet, they become disposable and their welfare becomes less of a concern.

At the same time, I came to crave the attention and adoration of others. Being worshipped is addictive, but you're always looking for more. When you don't get more, it leaves you feeling like shit. This is what happens when you use narcissism to keep depression at bay, I guess.

Basically, being hot turned me into someone I hated, leading to self loathing, which could only be soothed by the adoration of others. Chasing that adoration led me in some dark directions, and through it all, I always feared losing that adoration.

Then eventually, I did lose it. I went into a sort of self-reinvention exile during which I cut off all of my friends and didn't socialise for about three years. I rebuilt myself from the ground up, unlearned a lot of bad lessons and became a far more conscientious and wholesome person. I stopped hanging around with the old toxic crowds I used to circulate in, and I've become much happier and more stable.

But during those hermit years, I transformed. I wasn't the cute, elf-prince looking guy anymore. I wasn't prioritising my looks, and instead put more effort into my physical and psychological health.

I shaved my head, wore ill fitting clothes, and generally looked a bit like a hobo.

People's attitudes towards me were shockingly different. It was as if I had just turned the ""asshole"" setting of the world up by a half dozen notches. People were literally only nice if they were being paid to be nice. (Cashiers, doormen, bartenders etc.) Everybody else wanted nothing to do with me. It was as though ""ugliness"" was a disease they were afraid they'd catch.

I didn't mind it at the time, weirdly enough. Social isolation was something that I had spent years fearing and running from, but now that I was immersed in it, the world hadn't ended. I realised that I could be happy in my own company. I took up hobbies and learned useful skills instead. I focused my energy on becoming the person I wanted to become.

After passing through the eye of the needle, I can definitely throw my weight behind what you are saying. When you've been on both sides of the fence, you have a much better picture of what it's like on either side, but for those who have never been attractive, they think that the grass is always greener.

Being beautiful is like having a resource that everybody wants. Nobody wants to spend time with you because of who you are, they just want access to *what* you are. You're just a thing in the eyes of those who want you.

Although my experiences and yours are definitely not the same, I feel like there is enough similarity that I can strongly empathise with your position.

idi797e,t1_idhyyqe,2022-06-24 01:23:22,TwoXChromosomes,"I feel like the big problem here is the ridiculous pay gap between the people (mostly women) doing the actual work and the managers. I honestly believe in many professions it's harder and takes more qualifications to do the actual work than it is to be a manager. You see it all the time in tech where people who can't hack it on the ground end up in middle management spending the rest of their careers trying to justify their existence. The difference in tech is that the pay gap between workers and managers isn't all that great (and in some cases the managers even make less). I think it just comes down to society not valuing FDP at what they should.

I bet most of these men who end up as managers in FDP just go in and want to be a manager because it pays more. Like, they don't really care much what profession they end up in as long as they're making money. I feel like most of the women in those fields primarily want to help people and have a fulfilling career. It's sad that we don't value that more as a society. In my opinion, that's the real travesty of the wage gap. You hear a lot of men argue that the wage gap doesn't exist because women choose to work in lower paying professions and then their argument stops there. If only more of them would continue the thought process to its logical conclusion, which is that maybe we aren't valuing the professions that women choose as highly as we ought to. I'd hate for ""closing the wage gap"" to mean women moving to MDP just for the sake of more money because then who is going to do all the important work that women do now?

I have had women treat me like an idiot when they’re the idiot.

I wanted to get an HIV and hep screening After an incident where I feel like my drugs were diverted prior to a upper endoscopy. They use fentanyl and Versed to sedate you, I’ve had this procedure before and those drugs worked great, this particular day there was no sedation at all. They can you imagine getting fentanyl in your IV And feeling nothing? Here’s ago a local hospital hired a nurse who had been fired from everywhere he worked for stealing drugs but they didn’t know it. What he would do was he would inject himself with the drugs he was supposed to give the patients, then he would fill up the syringe with saline and inject the patients.  Not only did they then suffer in tons of “unexplained” pain, he also gave 80 people that they know of hepatitis.

So anyway I was explaining to this woman that I wanted to get tested for these things, and I explained it was because I believe that my drugs have been diverted. So I explained it the same way I explained it above, and she said “But you can’t get diseases if you didn’t get the meds.” I was like what are you talking about if someone sticks needle in their arm and they stick that same needle in my arm and they have diseases oh yes I can.

This idiot thought I was saying that they never even came and gave me the drugs, and that I somehow thought I contracted HIV just being in the hospital. It was such a bizarre train of thought I stopped going to see her. I mean it was insulting that she thought I was so crazy that I thought I caught HIV from not getting an injection, but it was even more crazy that that’s what she got from what I was saying.

idk72gr,t1_idid1l9,2022-06-24 14:15:59,TwoXChromosomes,"Yeah y’all must not be a sports fan. College sports are not less competitive and they are watched for different reasons. College is the more pure form of football and basketball and even then is largely popular because the fact that it’s schools and the students will attend and show pride.  It’s tied to being an alum and having school pride and wanting your former school to crush the rivals.  Men tend to be passionate about that.  I’d venture to guess female college sports get more attention then women professional sports for this reason.  Plus you still have freak athletes that do insane stuff but the team aspect is highlighted more and there tends to be more passion.  Additionally,  you’re watching to check the pipeline of talent for your pro sports team.  How can you get excited for the draft without knowing the prospects?  You’ve gotta watch the college level to know who’s coming in.  By less competitive sports fans generally mean less athletic/less flash. Womens sports aren’t less competitive in that they don’t play with passion or have close games.  It’s just they have less athleticism so the end product isn’t as flashy.  Sports is entertainment at the end of the day and some flash is needed. Hell even the nba struggled in the early 2000s when there were less stars and flash. 

I’m sorry but this simply isn’t the hill to die on.  There are many ways women are wronged but sports is probably the least of them.  The main issue is women simply aren’t as into sports or at least not made to be.  I always wonder the percentage of women that complain about this issue that actually are into sports.  Most women I know simply watch championship games or games when they are forced too.  Trust me,  if women started saying they are going to this bar to watch women sports (and force explained the sport to men) or bars were packed with women watching them,  men would start to watch it too.  But to expect men to be able to support both sports alone is a bit absurd and shows a lack of understanding. It actually is a huge time commitment to be a sports fan. Takes hours to be up to date. How the hell are men supposed to find that time.  Especially in this economy.  Plus alot of men become sports fans at a young age when they aspire to be an athlete.  You’re not gonna watch womens sports when you’re trying to get better at the male version of the game.  Even over time with work and life,  men have less be less time for sports fandom so you’re not gonna be as up to date as you were in the younger years.  At a certain point you only know the stars or your team roster and not much about the rest of the league. How tf are we supposed to nearly double are sports intake when we barely have time for the male sport we do watch.

Women playing sports needs to be normalized. That would require majority of women liking sports.  Most don’t care for it.  Last,  the suggestion that sports weren’t made with women in mind is absurd and acts as if women aren’t human.  Sports are inherently physical.  Men are simply more physical.  Knowing this, please tell me how you design a sport specifically for women???  There are some adjustments that can be made to current sports to make it more flashy like the male counterpart. but the women in those sports are uninterested in it and understandably so because it changes the game they love.  For example, most men have been saying for years that the womens basketball rim height should be lowered to allow more dunking. But the women in the sport disagree and the sport continues to go largely unwatched.

TLDR:  sports is a different issue than everything else in the thread.  The issue is more complex and you’d probably have to be a sports fan to understand.  A lot of the complaints voiced demonstrate a complete lack of understanding about what being a sports fan is and how the love of a sport arises.  I’m actually very passionate about this topic as evidenced by this long ass response because I do believe sports needs to be forced onto more women at a young age the same way it’s forced on boys.",trafalgarlaw11,t2_lsm7182,2,0,reddit3

This is going to make me sound so old, but I miss when it was easy to find a mechanic who understood my vehicle instead of just running diagnostics and replacing every possible part related to the codes until the codes go away. 

20 years ago, they may not have taken me seriously at first when I took my car in because I'm a woman, but they'd listen once it was obvious I was describing the issue well. Now? They just ignore whatever I have said and go by the codes. 

My last visit that did any good at all was me spending 20 minutes going through exactly what was wrong, and making sure they could work on a land Roverand, and when I dropped it off late at night, I did a quick bullet point of each issue: 

* cruise control randomly will not engage regardless of status of check engine light. Workaround: turn off and restart.  
* Code xxxx, small leak somewhere in exhaust. Please find where and fix. 
* Code xxxx. Fuel sending unit sensor on pump is failing. Please replace.  
* Oil appears to be leaking from rear main seal, but might be from oil pan directly above it. Replace appropriate seal.  
* Small leak in upper radiator hose since replacement, loses appx 10% of antifreeze every 500 miles. 
* ignore B side brake light sensor wiring error. I stole the wiring for trailer brake lights. A side fully functional. 
* If you just clear the codes, they will come back in about 100 miles. 

 The tech was literally given ""customer complained check engine light is on."" They had it a week before my husband got a call - I'd listed him as my emergency contact and written on there ""he knows nothing about this vehicle. Just leave me voicemail unless the thing is on fire.""  He told them call me. I had to call them 3 days later, because they left him voicemails instead of calling me. It really went downhill from there. I did manage to get them to fix the oil pan leak and the radiator hose. I replaced the fuel pump as soon as it was warm enough to work in my garage and that code is gone. So now I'm down to the intermittent light for the exhaust leak I can't seem to find and the cruise control issue. I don't have the tools and shop space, but also I've developed an autoimmune disorder that gives me really bad arthritis. It's hard to work on things myself anymore. 

I've had her at 6 shops now trying to get those dealt with. 'sorry, we can't diagnose a Land Rover."" Then why did you accept my vehicle to begin with and waste a week of my life? 

I also miss when I could go to a shop and say ""I'm not sure what's wrong, but the car sounds lower pitched and vibrates differently than normal. It used to be smooth, but now there's a tiny stutter every 3-4 seconds"" And they'd ask questions to get to the issue and get it fixed. That was a cracked exhaust manifold on a 1991 Corolla, btw. Now, I just get funny looks when I say things like that. They do a test drive and say it's fine. It's not fine. They just don't know what she used to feel like. 

Like I said, this makes me sound old, but I miss when mechanics weren't ""techs"" and knew what to do from experience, not documents. That's especially hypocritical of me given what I do for a living now is 90% following docs.",jorwyn,t2_52yf2,5,0,reddit3

And if the caller’s response to “you have teams installed and want us to help you learn how to join video meetings?” Is “I don’t know, are you stupid? Why are you asking this question?” The IT professional on the line asking clarifying questions to (*actually know what the problem is*) is probably not the stupid one. 90% of my job is clarifying what people are saying because people see a “technical” problem and lose their minds and forget how to communicate.

Editing to add:

Even if he DID have teams installed, it wasn’t a stupid question. In tech support, we almost always have to ask clarifying questions in order to determine scope of work. If all he needed was for a tech to show him how to join a Teams meeting, we could get him in and out in well under a half hour. If we also needed to install Teams, I need to make an appointment for at least an hour. If he didn’t even have a Microsoft Account, we may be looking at 2 hours of us setting up an account, doing the install, giving him a crash course, and then having him ask many many questions. I needed to know the answer to schedule an appropriate appointment time for him.

I certainly could do that. But I don’t think that’s good messaging. I think kids should basically be raised in a neutral manner. My own parents where ahead of the curve in this regard. I am one year apart from my sister. If she got a doll and I thought it was cool they bought me one too and we played together. Likewise if I had…perhaps a toy car, hot wheels, if she wanted to play she got her own as well. I had Barbies growing up because I didn’t think it was something I shouldn’t play with. Eventually as I got older things shifted as I was shaped by friends and society. But that base really stuck with me and helped me (I believe) to see beyond the issues that some of my peers experienced in their teenage years (identity etc). 

Obviously, the commercial nature of these shirts is just companies selling what sells. I’m sure it’s different in every school system, but these days where I am, most educators do not do the old thing of gendering interests or careers. (My nephew wants to be a nurse because his mother is and the school is encouraging that interest).

It would be no different than me calling you Junior at all times because you're younger than me, and you aren't allowed to force me to use your name; it's intentional dehumanization.

>The fact you call him a hack, leads me to believe that you don't like to hear uncomfortable truths and prefer to live in a world of comfortable lies. You are afraid to look inward and see that he may have a point. You don't like it. That is ok. It is good to have different opinions in the world. That is what makes it awesome. 

Have you looked into the arguments by his colleagues and other psychologists and sociologists about the things he says and how his arguments are laid out? You should.

>It doesn't mean I don't support someone else finding their way, as long as it doesn't control how I find mine.

Nobody is impacting your rights or how you're living your life by just wanting to be called he/she/they etc. Refusing is just intentional asshole behavior, regardless of your excuse. Again, it would be no different than you asking me to call you by your name in the office and I ignored that to call you Junior because I don't like being told what to do.

Like out of most males I meet these days and I even meet very few people, at least 1/4 are seemingly always ready to jump on any opportunity to assert themselves and tell me I'm wrong about anything. Just very ""I'm all about me and you'll know it. The next 1/4 are secretly aggressive and just look for any opportunity for personal gain, some in that hide it well, others dont.  Divide the last  couple into 1/8ths one part being creepy as fuck, the next being a functioning human, and then the last for those that seem absolutle oblivious to everything and how they remember to breath and walk at the same time and not die astounds me. Somewhere in there fit a 5% that manage to have a bearable conversation outside of them being a customer at work.

Those are probably bad percentages and if I thought harder I could be more precise maybe. But like, c'mon people I have to be associated with... Really? 
I'm not saying I'm the best but I don't believe I fall into anything other than functional human or maybe that 5%. I don't know if I can have a bearable conversation with myself however lol.

>Then they cry and whine like babies when no one pays them attention, all the while the *WHOLE world* is set up precisely for this and for *THEM*. Then, if that weren’t enough, they want to force us to give birth and raise their toehead children

Also I find this to be disturbingly true in more cases that I wished to overhear or be directly present for. Let alone what you cand find as far as online posts. Except maybe the children are not le toeheads, least they dont *have* to be. But no really though there's a lot of men out there who have a really weird and creepy, even archaic perspective on having children and what rights 'belong to them'.
Also am referring to my all-time experiences and being in military had me meet quite a few different people from different cultures and backgrounds. Moved a lot of states too, so I don't speak only from the high school the examples upcoming. Sorry, I reflect on the experiences light heartedly but I wanted to toss out a small background with my fellow males for context and basically just to say I didn't only go to high school in one town, and then live in my mom's basement in that same town till now.

Having heard some people talk about it first-hand I felt.. Wrong. 
Not to mention the absolute correlation between ""No girls wanna date me cause I'm ugly"" or ""Girls say they want a nice guy but they want a jerk""and having a narcissistic, abusive, overtly aggressive or otherwise disgusting personality. 
Too often I had tried to befriend the ""misunderstood loner guy"" in high school.. Hell I was nice, but I was definitely a 'loner guy' aside the 3 friends I had. At least two times in school and once in military. First guy was a prick and stole my stuff. Second guy was a control creep, and that was just on me. Can't imagine the talks he had with actual females. Third was a guy in my unit and he seemed alright but after a month he started wanting to talk about some creepy ass stuff, even after kindly informing him I wasn't into any of that which he showed me.

Differences were:
For me: I didn't like people.
For them : People didn't like them.

There's a meme for this right? ""We are not the same""

>I think many people in this sub are living in the past, most messaging out there these days is neutral or girl-biased. From tv shows to literature to commercial products.

But the REALITY of our world isn't. This post isn't talking about ""messaging."" The OP, complete with citations, isn't about how we portray gender differences. It's about quantifiable, measurable issues. I agree, it's a lot better to be a kid of either gender nowadays then it was even twenty years ago as far as ""messaging"" goes. There's still massive discrepancies in the reality of the workforce, healthcare treatment, legal system, etc etc.

Like there's also quantifiable real world issues men face too, that affect boys as well. The fact that there's been a mild overemphasis to girls that they can code too! Or that girls tshirts have pivoted from ""I'm a princess"" to ""Girls a great!"" (Which again is outdated, tshirts are more neutral these days), is not the worst thing boys face, nor evidence that girls don't have real world struggles.

And no, I'm not just using the t shirt example to minimize. Like you, I'm using it as a representative example that ""mild positive messaging"" girls get is not a major issue.

I totally get what you mean about modern cars. I'm really really good with mechanical ignition stuff. I was the one in our shop who specialized in those. Even though I work in IT, all the computerized stuff confuses me. I appreciate that it does some to lower emissions, and I love some of the features - my back up camera and sensor is so amazing! Speed relative power steering is really underrated, too. Speed relative stereo volume is, as well. But it's so hard to troubleshoot some things now. Like, I finally just replaced the in tank fuel pump because the sensor came with it. Before I did, the symptom was ""when I fill the tank all the way, she won't start like she's not getting fuel. I have to pump the gas and floor it when I push the start button to get her to go, and she'll immediately die if I let off."" I got a *lot* of looks for revving so hard at the pump until I found i needed to stay under 3/4 tank until I fixed it. Whyyyy? The pump is mechanically sound, so I suspect the sending unit sensor is bad, but I'm just guessing. 

That whole thing pissed me off, too. I'd take it in almost empty, because I knew they'd have to drop the tank. I'd tell them (a different shop than the one that couldn't diagnose) the exact issue. They'd fill the tank and be like ""oh, yeah, we can reproduce it, but now you've got a full tank, so we don't want to drop it."" Okay, the first time that was annoying but fine. The second time, it was infuriating. ""We have to reproduce the issue."" But you already did! It's like no one thinks anymore; they just follow scripts. 

I see that so much in IT, too. If following a script doesn't fix it, they're just clueless as to how to proceed. Can't even give my order at a fast food place without following their script. Even grocery store cashiers are so scripted that the fact that I need to read lips to understand people hasn't even mattered with mask mandates. They're always going to say the exact same thing, and it messes them up if you vary from it. Also, when did adults stop being able to count change?

Let's discuss this for a second. It is not an excuse, it's a reason. To imply that inferrs that he has some hidden agenda. I do not believe this to be the case. He doesn't want to control people's way of life. He also just doesn't want his controlled either. I happen to agree with that sentiment. Secondly, you making up a name to call me is different than me asking to be called it. But, if I go changing the law to force people to call me something and if they don't there will be penalty, that is controlling me and how I want to live my life. Now you use a 12 year old logic because kids don't like to be told what to do? Do you have kids? If you do, and if you pay attention to them, you will see that kids are atupid and think they know everything. Its the job of the parent to mold them into respectful and helpful members of the community they live in. It is the job as a parent to teach them inclusivity but not to force your way of life on others. It's the same with any Religion, or any organized group who want power over others and have it their way.... do you see the parallel yet?

To say no one is impacting my way of life by telling me how to talk, how to act and how to fall in line, and if I don't, I'll be persecuted or worse, is a comforyable lie. That is the exact deffinition of coersion. He does not reject using pronouns directly to people. I don't think any realistic rational thinking person will refuse who you want to be, unless you're a prick about it... then, yes, people won't just lay down and grovel when you say to do so. Again, it's not about the individuals personal preference. It's about ""call me this or else"". I don't take kindly to being threatened. Especially when I'm supportive of people finding themselves... Just don't force it down my throat. You want to be called something other than the normal terminology? Super! You be you.

I truly find myself taken aback when I do encounter people who, as you very well put it ""see people as pieces of meat"".

idjdgk3,t1_idj8btq,2022-06-24 09:01:08,TwoXChromosomes,"Oh and also you have quite a topic at the end there about the societal views and how they influence men. Just recently I had been thinking about many of the past governments, the focus on kings/patriarchies, the actual views society has imposed for numerous centuries, and the dynamic of women having the responsibility of birthing children and how all that has played into the average  ""male of today"" mindset.
And again for a lack of feeling like these are the proper words here we go: I am able to recognize how people of the past may have thought a certain way 'for a time'. But not this long.

It seems simple to me that ""Every ONE is a human and a person. They are just like me with wants, fears, and needs."" But too many people will choose to damage another living being in favor for a slight benefit to themselves. In some situations for seemingly no benefit at all, but just to inhibit someone else.

In summation, I tried to logically think about how we got to where we are today and I don't understand it. Maybe I am biased. No. I am DEFINITELY biased.
Way I came to understand it growing up in America was that EVERYONE is entitled to life, liberty, and justice. (that's even while undergoing a lack of some of those, which maybe is why I feel how I do).

A right to a Life without excess hardship. The Liberty to experience life and emotions as we see fit and in a way that doesn't cause hardships for others. And Justice in the event that a wrongdoing happens, we as a society, will make it right. Because even though humans are flawed, there is no fair reason to not hold people accountable to their actions.
And to fix these things not just because we wouldn't want that to happen to us. But because it isn't right for it to happen.
Whether or not that's the message America wanted me to get, I don't rightly know.

Apologies for going on a rant that isn't so much exactly about the gender equality gap but more led to my feelings on a human-to-human gap, though it is why I made a separate comment. Still I feel it holds some relevance to the idea of treating women the same. I don't even really post things here or talk about anything in general but, I dunno. I don't care so much that my opinion is heard, and I don't expect an impact. Im just a random guy somewhere. Just oddly felt like sharing my single viewpoint to this also random person on reddit because I agreed with their thought. Wanted to try and limit the view to only myself and my opinions in the sense of opposing the idea of say, the ""NOT ALL MEN"" posts I have seen. As I only can speak for myself. 
I then futher wanted to make sure I hadn't wronged someone in my posting, which led to your comment, which broached a topic I recently was thinking of and that prompted me to take the past 30+ minutes to quantify this response no one will most likely see. But hey. I believe that is Reddit!

dqn5aoj,t3_7gvvui,2017-12-02 03:30:10,TwoXChromosomes,"I have felt for the past several years that the best way to combat the abusive parts of the sex industry would be to change the way we perceive the workers.

There are a few goals I would like to see achieved by the industry:

1.) Pornography is acting and should always be treated as such.  No one should be calling or thinking of these actors as whores or sluts.  They are putting on a convincing performance for the camera, just like any other actor would.  They should be celebrated for their talent and dedication, not ridiculed for doing something ""gross"" (that we are watching in increasing numbers and amounts).  To change the way we perceive them, pornography education should be incorporated in sex education.  (This should be clear, but I am not advocating for showing pornographic videos as a way to educate high schoolers).  Rather, they need to be educated core principles like ""pornography is *fantasy*, not reality"" and ""what you see and fantasize about in porn is probably not what your significant other is going to want to do"".

2.) As actors, they need a union.  A good one.  Maybe even SAG.  In some ways (STDs, age-confirmation, and some poorly-enforced rules about the use of drugs), the industry has been able to self-regulate.  In other ways they have not.  This appears to be a side effect of the dubious legal history of pornography.  A union would be the first step toward protecting people from entering the industry as a last-resort due to financial, domestic, drug, or any other problems.  That is where a massive part of the damage lies.

Nothing really can be done about it, as we live in a free society and the unintended consequences are too high for banning, but it's ridiculously bad for most developing male brains.  And no male wants to be in porn hell after 25 years old. 

The next logical step from the adult industry would be legalizing things like p411 and the like.  College aged women will start making 200-500 an hour to pay for an ever increasing tuition and homes costs, and porn will be left for the poor, which already is for the most part.

I highly majority of users of pornography, which skews male are going to give a shit.  In the videos women are treated as disposable objects to use and degrade, her comfort, let alone her pleasure is largely irrelevent.  Why are the viewers going to see these women as people when the videos premise is that they aren't.

Earlier today on all a GIF of a woman dancing was oosted.  She was naked.  The comments on that video were horrendous.
There was no care if that content has been posted with permission. They all went on about how she was an escort, how they'd smash that, how her body is almost perfect except for *insert flaw*, speciulation over how much it costs to fuck her and whether it would be worth it.

A couple of posts mentioned that the last time it had been posted it came out that this was just 'a girl someone recorded and her boyfriend posted it'.  No one cared that potentially her consent was violated and that it could have been revenge porn.

They treated her like a piece of meat to pick at and consume... Because all that matters is their dicks.
That is the person that most pornography serves, and prostitution too.

dqnbqzk,t3_7gvvui,2017-12-02 06:23:01,TwoXChromosomes,"I hate pornography. I refuse to watch it. I think the whole industry should burn to the ground. If it did, then things like child porn would have a lot less to hide behind. If women want to have sex for money on camera, then they are nothing more then over payed prostitutes, except the men have to be payed to have sex with them as well. It's funny how pieces of paper will make people do anything. Since they are not pretending to have sex, I guess people call them actors since they are pretending to want to have sex with eachother. Im sure im going to get a lot of thumbs down, and that is ok with me. These are my opinions. I feel sorry for people who do porn. I feel even worse for all the people, men especially, who think they cant survive if they don't watch other people have sex so they can masturbate. Most guys I know have convinced themselves it is a normal part of everyday life. It isn't meant to be. Porn permeates too many aspects of life these days. Children are exposed to it because of carelessness by parents. The world was a better place before the constant barrage of dicks and vaginas. I do not understand where the fuck everyone's imaginations have gone. If these chicks dont want to be sexually assaulted then maybe their job should be something other than sex. Like, come the fuck on. All bets are off, and shit is nasty, but as soon as they call ""cut"" the guy better keep his hands and dick to himself? I can see why men or women would think they have the right to be more physical. They assume if you get fucked for a living, you probably don't mind, they certainly can use that as an excuse.

Jane Villanueva grew up with questionable notions of relationships because of negative messaging in two (arguably three depending upon your feelings of young-mother Xiomara) ways. 

The first was Alba's sex-negativity. Alba presents sex and virginity in the form of a flower metaphor. That is to say that Jane's virginity is like a healthy, preserved flower, but once virginity is taken away and the flower reshapes and can never return to its original, beautiful form. This, of course, was done because a) the Villanueva women are extremely religious, Alba in particular (Xio seemingly less so than her mother or daughter) and b) Alba is terrified of the notion of Jane ending up like Xio (scarred by relationships that didn't necessarily work out, parenting at 16). So Alba's feelings are justified and presented as sympathetic in part but still clearly and horribly wrong.

Jane's other relationship issues seem to stem from an early love and fostering of romance novels (which she writes) and telenovelas (basically soap operas: español). JTV loves both and plays with the tropes of each, especially the latter, but also recognizes that they probably aren't the basis for healthy and productive relationships. Jane begins the series in an idyllic fantasy-land where she's swept away from Prince Charming and internalizes wedding plans for her boyfriends ten minutes after meeting them. Her relationships in her teenage years didn't work out for various reasons (the virginity thing, a wedding proposal gone awry), but her adult relationships, romantic or otherwise strengthen after legitimate conflict and dealing with issues in a realistic and not 'soapy' way.

Ethical, feminist porn is available, it just exists behind paywalls. That’s also a big part of the issue: women pay for porn even less than men so they never see behind the paywalls. I say this without malice, I didn’t pay for much porn before working in the biz as a woman, but it’s definitely been an eye opening experience seeing what a broad world of wonderfully wholesome porn exists.",agentadventure,t2_nn84g,4,0,reddit4

Regularly that wouldn’t apply to women who are not in the sex industry because they are not providing the same services we are so they should be treated as any other normal individual and human that deserves respect. The two aren’t interchangeable because one is offering a service that we knowingly and consensually provide while women not in the industry are not offering that. Whether sex workers or not everyone deserves respect as long as they are not harming anyone else. We’re not saying that all women should be treated like us in the industry because what we are doing and providing is a fantasy, it’s not real, it’s only for entertainment purposes.

Also, it's already too easy for people- women especially- to get away with making false rape accusations and not be punished in the slightest way- if they get caught at all, which a lot of the times, it seems that word of mouth from a few people is evidence enough for some judges.

My point is that there are many cases where the women actually love the scenario they are in and actively seek out people to do these kind of sexual acts with. Jumping to conclusions about what the woman is thinking or wanting is dangerous because you have just as much chance of getting it wrong as you do of getting it right. 

Would you like it if other people started telling you how you can and cannot express yourself sexually?

There should also be a standardised set of work environment regulations that are actually enforced.

A boss using a promotion for sex is different than a human trafficker using a mothers child as blackmail. Its all very complex.

 And I agree, its definetly an issue that needs lots of open discussion and a lot of thought. A few of my very close female friends and family are rape survivors.

We're back to consent.  You can legally give consent when you are an adult.  Nearly every legal system in the world defines that by an arbitrary age.  Whether that's right or wrong is a debate separate from the issues at hand, but it is largely done because policy like that tends to work for the greatest number of people in that particular sovereign.  And that is the goal of policy that affects everyone; to make it fair and applicable to as many people as possible.  In the US, that age deemed fair is 18.  As a criminology scholar, I can go on for days about why 18 is a balance between biological expectations, societal expectations, and so on and so forth.  If you don't feel you are an adult at 18, by all means write letters all 535 members of the US Congress, the legislatures of all 50 states, several thousand social workers, police officers, teachers, judges, doctors, the military, tobacco companies, dentists, and credit card companies.

>Why do you think that someone giving you permission to do something makes it the right thing to do?

This discussion isn't exclusively about morality.  This is about freedom and the law, given that your position is an assertion whose implications are that we should ban pornography.  But let's assume this is about morality: consent is not, in and of itself, a sole qualifier for moral permissibility.  You can't consent to being murdered, for example.  Other factors need to be considered.  Harm, for instance.  In legal philosophy, let's turn to JS Mill's Harm Principle.

**""The Harm Principle holds that the actions of individuals should only be limited to prevent harm to other individuals. John Stuart Mill articulated this principle in On Liberty, where he argued that, ""The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.""**

In essence, an action ought to be permissible if it does not cause harm to the individual, harm to others, or harm to the broader society.  Ask yourself honestly: how does other people consenting to having sex on camera for money *harm* others?  I'm not asking whether you're comfortable with it or not.  You're free to simply not consume it.  I'm asking what objectionable harm is done.  You'll find it isn't a whole lot.  What there is, initiatives like the subject of OP's link aim to correct.  Other safeguards are also implemented to prevent, say, children from seeing these things.  Though I will admit most of that is up to parents.  Still, those parents would be in the wrong to ban something as a whole to prevent their children from seeing it.  I am not beholden to their children.

>Why do you think that making unwanted advances at a woman in real life is worse than pleasuring yourself to the sight of her having sex with another man for money?

The first scenario involves a woman who is not consenting to the advances.  We're back to consent.  In the second, it can be reasonably concluded by the performers in the pornographic video that their work is consumed for sexual pleasure.  They are consenting to this *knowing* that people are not only going to be viewing it (indefinitely, mind you; once it's on the internet, it's there forever)...they also do so understanding that creepy mouthbreathing men from Montana are going to be jerking off to it.

On the other hand, many crimes have  a very arbitrary point at which it changes from, say, theft to grand larceny, and crimes around sex work will inevitably have the same struggles, but these issues can only be dealt with properly out in the open, legally, imo.

This is what my responses have been to. Not anything else. This makes it not paying for an agreed upon service. Consent does change in this scenario. I'm not saying you can have sex with a prostitute without consent. I'm not saying you can punch an MMA fighter on the street.

Prostitution is a service. The prostitute being given what was agreed upon up front makes it consensual. Taking an item off the shelf at the store, you are entering a contractual obligation that you will pay for the item or leave it in the store. If you leave the store with the item that is a breach of contract and is theft.

Take the legality and taboo out of the service and it's still a business. Ask the IRS. Even if you earn money illegally, it's still illegal to not pay your taxes on your income.

The consent is contingent upon fulfilling the contract, and the contract is contingent upon consent. Not fulfilling the contract would in fact negate consent, because the consent is contingent upon first fulfilling the contract. It's similar in the entertainment business. An actor agrees to perform a role contingent upon a contractual agreement. If the contractee does not pay but still demands the actor perform the role this is invalidated because the actor only agrees to perform the role contingent upon fulfilling the contract, which includes payment but also possibly a host of other factors pertaining to environment, audio setup, lighting, weather permitting, a peaceable audience, and so on. These other conditions would be akin to the other things that accompany consensual sex, such as a peaceable partner, not a violent one, respecting the ways of touching her she's spelled out, etc etc. You seem to be confusing goods (items off a shelf) with services. There's clear difference between goods and services in the economy and in the legal system. In law there is criminal law and common law (contract law), its not one generic bag of laws as though everything were akin to goods. That's just not how it works.

To buy something at the checkout counter is not engaging in a contract. Just some differences to keep in mind. If you run off with a jar of peanut butter from Walmart you engaged in theft, criminal law, but you did not break a contract, common law. It can be confusing but its how it is.

This is someone who has never heard ""NO"" in his life, To him, there is no way he could ever be wrong because his entire life has (most likely) been filled with ""YES"" and ""YOU'RE AMAZING"".

Fight to get that ""write up"" removed, ask your co workers for help with that, and there is not a chance in HELL he will win a lawsuit for ""workplace harassment"", it happened ONCE and he quit the 2nd time.

""Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.""

He used dairy. With a regular. Who's the kind of lactose intolerant that goes into anaphylactic shock on contact. 

My bosses had made it clear a few weeks beforehand that they wanted him gone but needed evidence so every time he wanted to handle a ticket I kept it and wrote the mistakes on it, then proceeded to leave the tickets in an envelope in the register after our shifts. He pulled about 7-10 mistake tickets per 50. I still remember a lot of the mistakes, like his dumbest one was using the wrong cup size and getting called out for it by the customer and then he doubled down insisting he used the right one while standing next to the cups in the customer's plain view. The most consistent was making lattes when the customer ordered and had it clearly written on the ticket they wanted a black americano, after being directed to look at the recipe posted by the machine, which he rolled his eyes and would never do.

1.  Your outburst was your fault, but it was caused by your management's lack of managing and putting you and your team in a difficult situation that they should have and easily could have rectified on their own.  There was no reason for you to need to snap at him other than you had been pushed too far.

2.  Yes you could have handled this better, so use this as a learning opportunity for you too.  You should have escalated to your manager your frustrations sooner.  Started documentation on their lack of action so if you'd been let go you could prove a hostile workplace/discrimination case to the unemployment board to get your unemployment.

3.  Last note: If i were in your shoes I'd have blown up the exact same way.  Having 3rd party perspective doesn't mean I'd do as I say. I think you're right to start looking too.  Clearly you don't trust your management to listen and take action if you complain about such behavior.

io6nt5f,t3_xck4ka,2022-09-12 22:58:48,TwoXChromosomes,"I love you. In certain work places it can be extremely difficult for women to speak up about toxic men, but you did it. And it worked. 

Could you have taken him down in a slightly less agressive way? Maybe. But you're absolutely right that management should have handled it ages ago. And it doesn't sound to me like you actually said anything beyond the facts to him. I'm irritated you got written up for this actually. Sounds like they're mainly trying to protect the company from any legal issues, but they should have thought about how he was harassing the rest of you first.

I think you're right to feel very disenchanted with your employer over this. I sometimes wish I had had the balls to leave my company back when I went through a harassment situation. I hope you find something better soon.

As for the guilt you're feeling - I think that's your natural reaction as a good person to check yourself and to acknowledge that your actions impact others. It's an emotional knee jerk that has usually served you well in the past to course correct. But it's not serving you well in this situation because it is primarily his actions that lead to this point, not yours.

He had literally hundreds of chances to course correct - take the training, listen when people correct his incorrect statements, stop missing deadlines, see that no one was on his side after the first incident, or choose not to quit. All of the consequences he's facing are direct outcomes of his own actions. I truly believe something like this would have happened eventually, you just got sick of it first and triggered him.

Please don't feel guilty for a second longer. Normal 19 year olds do not act like that! I am a female engineer surrounded by male engineers, including new hires. Do they regularly interrupt me or take credit for my ideas? Never, because they're not social nitwits. Normal people learn not to behave that way in high school. If anything, this might be the uncomforable wakeup call he needs so that his next job goes better.

I hope that the adrenaline and panic wear off soon. You went into fight or flight mode so it makes sense. Maybe go on some jogs this week to get the rest of it out of your system and try to get some decent sleep. Hopefully your employer will do the right thing and things will blow over soon.

I mean, maybe they did, and they just couldn't get traction because the people who should have listened thought it was ""just one person"". Who knows, at this point?

Maybe ideally you would have said something (not necessarily to Captain Centre of Attention there, who clearly would not have responded well, but to your supervisor, to your boss if that's a different person) before the outburst, but it sounds like they should have been able to already see the issue and manage it themselves before that anyway and they chose not to, so I wouldn't lose sleep over it.",Rarzipace,t2_5uvky,6,0,reddit1

I wouldn’t feel bad. Somebody needed to shut this guy down. Really, it should have been his boss, but for some reason they didn’t. Was blowing up at him out of pent-up frustration the best way to raise your concerns? No. Were your concerns/complaints reasonable? Absolutely. This guy sounds way out of line and awful to work with. Your coworkers were glad you said something! It sounds like once the higher ups found out about this situation they thought his attitude was a problem too! Don’t feel bad he quit! 

I’m not sure I would think of yourself as someone who bullied another person out of a job. You stood up for yourself, and continued to make a note every time you observed a problematic behavior. You weren’t counting every time he went to the bathroom and making fun of him for it or gossiping about it, you were counting the number of times he interrupted a meeting at work after you (and your bosses, it sounds like) told him that behavior was inappropriate and needed to stop and he continued it anyway. 

I get that you feel shaken up after confrontation. It’s hard not to feel bad after something like that. And you probably do want to make sure you don’t get so frustrated you blow up again, it’s not a great look even if I sympathize profoundly. But you’re not a bully and it wasn’t your job to nicely reign him in and coach him on office norms, that’s what his boss should have been doing.

I don’t want you to be any more stressed about it, but I’ll be real with you. That was pretty hostile. And I don’t think you actually stood up for yourself. Standing up for yourself would have been correcting him after the first interruption, not letting it build until you can’t take it anymore.

I’ll say that I don’t think it’s entirely your fault though. I agree with you on how your company enabled this behavior.

Because we’re expected to be so agreeable and not cause confrontation, or we’re judged extremely harshly for it. But at the same time we’re only human and there’s only so much you can take. So we let it build and build trying to be “a good little girl” hoping some arrogant ass will magically become self aware until we just can’t fucking take it anymore.

Not at all. 

He’d been acting like the prince of the kingdom since he showed up. You told him off and embarrassed him. He gave a non-apology. He acted surprised and offended that he didn’t get his free pass back. And then he quit. 

Even from this far away, it’s clear that he left because he couldn’t take the blow to his ego. Maybe he went home and cried about what a mean person you were, maybe he raged out because the off-the-books promise of being a big company manager man wasn’t worth dealing with the consequences of his actions, and maybe it was actually just a “give me what I want or I’m running away” style bluff that the company didn’t give in to.

Whatever it was, you didn’t make him quit. If anything, you and your team were too kind and generous in giving him so many chances to do better.

He didn't even listen when it was discussed in an open forum **despite** being told his behaviour was inappropriate and that he needed to apologise.

This asshole KNEW EXACTLY what he was doing. And what he was doing was 'working on an internal promotion by way of empty shoes'... In other words, he wanted to get you to quit so that he could rise just a little higher in the ranks. Doesn't matter that you're not his superior.   

To him, the Sales Department consists of X number of employees, and the newest employee is the one that's at most risk if downsizing should happen. So, he needs to reduce the number of older staff so that someone else will be hired to take that position. He can't wait until someone leaves of natural reasons. By that time, someone might have reason to downsize the department! and he won't rise in position!

The fact that they didn't fire you is a very good sign. Take the write-up with a healthy bite of Humble Pie.

I Replied All to her smarmy email response to me that was along the lines of ""Yes, if you looked at the images with the product you would've seen that."" that what I see on my end must be different than hers and that I promise I don't ask her these questions just to annoy her. I said I am trying to make our website as straightforward and helpful for our customers as possible, so I don't understand why she takes it as a personal attack when I ask a simple question like ""How many towels come in this set?"" I sent screenshots to show her what I saw and why it wasn't obvious to me.

My boss (who was on the email) emailed me separately and said that some of my language bordered on unprofessional. I said ok, sorry, having a bad day and that really set me off.

I once had an outburst at work to over unfair treatment and was nearly fired. 

I cried all day when I wasn't planting my foot and telling people to get higher ups involved. I was freaking out, worried about being sued, worried I'd never work in my industry again. I was intimidated, talked down to, I was told I was lying. They tried to switch the narrative from ""I'm doing what is right"" to ""you're crazy and acting out for no reason"".

When higher ups got involved I was vindicated, I was given my pay, I wasn't fired. The person who yelled would be trained but I was told I could also take up a grievance. Yet the scars from the battle I had remained. Panic, tears, etc.

The stupid thing was I was harbouring *their* guilt. *Their* fear.  I thought I was he problem, but the only reason any of it happened was because *they* made my job unsafe!

*He* was a problem in the work place. *He* was under-qualified. He is young and had neopotism on his side. He can make it through this without your concern and he was going to learn somehow. You were creative and efficient and you made things **better**.

You need not stay, but you are not guilty of anything but speaking out. He was bullying and harassing everyone with his BS in these meetings. The write up and this chance of being sued are all just higher ups covering their ass because he has family in the company. 

If he wasn't going to change, you were gunna make him. I think the only thing better would have been getting a coworker in on it.

I don't want to fly off the handle too much, especially because I have no idea what your actual workplace culture is. it is just so dejecting that you should have to second guess yourself when a man doing the same thing would be lauded for being assertive, taking initiative, telling it like it is, etc etc. 

I do think you can clearly see how many people agree with your choices. if there is any real threat of legal action, it is the company's liability, not yours. hopefully they recognize that what you did was for the betterment of everyone who works there. if they don't, i think it is so much better you find an environment that will recognize and appreciate that you value the quality of the work you and your team do and are willing to take personal risks to maintain a quality work environment.

eblvbgt,t3_a5a8fu,2018-12-12 02:51:39,TwoXChromosomes,"My first experience in dealing with sexual harassment as a manager was actually all within my first year in said position. This was at a family owned company with no HR department. So, my first experience in having to navigate a harassment claim was when I had to discipline a subordinate (employee A) due to performance. This person (male) was quick to bring up a claim of SH against most of the other males stating  that there was inappropriate conduct between some of the other male employees. Accusations of male on male simulation of “grab-ass” and sexual innuendos. This was a warehouse with all males in my portion of the operation, so if some of you have worked in a warehouse, you folks might have an idea of the environment and interactions between mostly (18-25 y/o) “men”🤨😩. Now, being there for a year, I can say that the atmosphere of working with guys on a warehouse floor is rough at times and I can confirm to having observed some of this behavior. As a manager, I would try to curve it immediately and address at once. 
 
Keep in mind that the claims of SH were only brought up because this was the second incident where I had to speak to employee “A” about his performance (in a 2 week span) and told him that this was his last opportunity. Any further issues and that would be the end of his job. Well, long story short, employee “A” made direct accusations towards another employee of having been inappropriately touched. Come to find out that there had been some words between both employees the week prior due to the accused having brought something employee “A” had done to my attention (that’s where the 1st disciplinary came in to play).  I gathered all the information regarding the incident and begin researching. Soooo, we go to the cameras. Not to my surprise, there wasn’t any truth to the incident or the timeline he provided.

Long story short, I took it to my superiors and they decided, after some legal consulting, that termination was the best option. I’m no longer with that company, but I believe that “A” tried to sue the company. I heard that it went nowhere.  There was also other incidents, but I’ll elaborate if requested. 

For several years I had to learn  “on the fly” as a rookie manager and tread lightly with many situations due not having the support of HR and competent ownership. It seems that your bosses have the right mindset when it comes to harassment. Most places aren’t proactive about it until an incident occurs or unless it’s state mandated.

Constantly hear about how so-and-so thinks I'm cute or is into guys like me, straight up telling me to my face that they want to do stuff to me. Aside from the sexual harassment, a lot of my female co-workers have higher standards set for me just because I'm male. I do everything to the book, handle difficult situations very well, and go beyond my job expectations along with working over 60 hours a week, and yet I'll constantly hear about how I don't do ANYTHING. We have a huge gossip problem at my workplace and it gets so tiring. I remember when I had to report a male co-worker for sexual harassment and my supervisor was telling me I should just take it as a compliment and he would never act on what he's saying ect. ect. And I explained to her that that doesn't help the situation at all. So he never got moved away from me or fired, until him being 2 hours late all the time and possibly stealing drugs from work caught up to him months later.

 To be fair though, I never had proof or witnesses, so I didn't expect anyone to get fired, but I did hope I'd never have to work with them again. ",Aazrhul,t2_fre20,48,0,reddit2
ebmb60j,t3_a5a8fu,2018-12-12 08:06:13,TwoXChromosomes,"I truly hope there was an investigation instead of a no-questions-asked termination. This recently happened to a friend of mine: slept with a coworker a few times (no rule against this), then got promoted and became her superior who was in charge of downsizing their department. All sex and potentially in appropriate communication immediately stopped after the promotion. Once he started the layoff process, she reported him for sexual misconduct indicating he had pursued her and used his higher position for sex (not true at the time of their relationship). 

My friend was immediately fired without any investigation, even though he had written evidence and had witnesses falsifying her story. She then tried to use this to get a raise, which helped his case, but at that point she was safe from firing due to whistleblower laws. This was right as the #metoo movement was gearing up so he had a hard time even getting attorneys to return his calls. Turns out she did this at a previous company too. My friend works in a very small industry so his career is permanently ruined and he’s currently building a case to give to the company, attempting to clear his name. He’s been advised not to go to court because of the current social climate. 

Since this happened he’s developed depression, become suicidal, and is totally afraid of getting back in to dating. Working a minimum wage job bc he’s been blacklisted in his small industry,
Possibly losing his house soon. He’s the rare case where a false accusation ruined his life. 

Am I saying doubt a victim? Absolutely not. We have enough of that. But please consider all sides and evidence before taking action. This was a learning experience for me and I hope other Redditors will consider things very carefully before laying blame as well (not saying there’s a chance OPs manager is innocent, just thought this story was relevant).

Threatening retaliation for reporting harassment or any other illegal activity is also illegal. For anyone else who might find themselves in this situation, this is the point where you:

* write down, with dates, everything that has happened/was said so far
* start keeping a journal about anything related to this, with dates and times
* contact your State's Department of Labor or equivalent to report the matter

A report with evidence like a detailed journal while it's fresh in your mind is surprisingly effective; even if it doesn't solve _your_ problem, it may help the next person down the line.

Then it's up to you to decide which story is more believable, who is more credible, and who has a more pressing incentive to be dishonest. (That last one is a no brainer, by the way. ""I didn't do it"" is the very first lie children learn to tell to get out of trouble, whereas weaving entirely fictional accusations to get others in trouble is psychologically abnormal at any age).

You behaved appropriately in believing the accuser but conducting an investigation, and when it turned out to be a false accusation, responding appropriately.

That said, I've dealt with maybe a dozen SH claims, and I always do investigations. There were only two where the outcome of the investigation was anything other than ""yep, that was definitely harassment and remedial action needs to be taken"". And of those, only one was a false accusation (similar to your case, where it was made to try to deflect from other serious issues the accuser had).

The other case was inconclusive (we couldn't find supporting evidence, but we also couldn't find anything to suggest it was a bad faith claim), so we made horizontal transfers of both parties so that future interaction was minimized, made sure they both got retraining on sexual harassment, and kept a closer eye on both of them.

I would generally expect HR to be on the side of protecting the company from harassment enforcement or lawsuits, so there's a decent chance HR will help here. Documentation helps them help you.

Harassment is not a criminal matter, so the police will do fuck all. If it's _assault_, don't go to HR at all, go directly to the police. But if it doesn't rise to that level, it's not a police matter and that's a waste of time and effort.

The escalation for violations of labor laws like those prohibiting sexual harassment is:

HR -> State Department of Labor -> Lawyer

ebmx67u,t1_ebmf0yd,2018-12-12 15:57:03,TwoXChromosomes,"> There's no point in a ""search for the truth"" when it comes to sexual harassment.

I disagree. It's true that it's a ""he said/she said"" situation, and you probably aren't going to achieve a standard of proof that would fly in court -- nor should you try. It's also true that you should believe accusers, and take their claims in good faith.

But you should _definitely_ conduct an investigation before taking significant action against someone, because that's the only ethical thing to do. Among the practical reasons for doing so:

* if the problem is larger than the specific accusation, you want to find out
* if you want to support a for-cause claim in the firing so you don't have to pay big bonuses and/or unemployment to a harasser, you need evidence to show the cause
* there's significant value in explaining that someone was terminated for harassment, but if you don't have evidence of that claim you can find yourself on the bad end of a defamation suit
* it's beneficial for everyone at the company to see an investigation take place; it shows the company actually takes the accusation seriously, and isn't just firing people to avoid bad PR (i.e. it shows the company actually cares about the issue, not just their image)
* when the response to an accusation is an investigation, that provides an incentive against future false claims. False claims of harassment and assault are exceptionally rare in part because claims are investigated. If you habitually don't investigate, you create an incentive for false claims, and that harms legitimate accusers

**tl;dr** investigations are a good idea, and are _part of_ actually believing accusers

ebm3gqb,t1_eblylax,2018-12-12 05:10:39,TwoXChromosomes,"Of course. Well, a couple of months after, there was another incident that was brought to my attention, which I had to deal with. 

One of my employees came up to me one day and told me that in talking with a female co-worker, she confided that another associate (we’ll call him “creepo”) had ran into her in a portion of the warehouse where she had been working that moment alone and began chatting with her. It seemed like just a regular conversation at first (her description of the events) and she continued to do her work while politely trying to dodge his questions with short answers.  Then, out of nowhere he came up behind her and grabbed her in a bear-hug and tried to kiss her neck. She was able to push him off and was immediately headed out the nearest door. Shocked after what had just happened, she was unsure how to proceed. One important piece of info is that the victim worked for another company that was leasing space within our facility. So, she wasn’t under my responsibility; however, creepo was 😩.

The employee that made me aware to situation, brought it up to my attention, even though the victim asked them to let it be. They felt it was the right thing to do. Which, I’m very glad that he had the confidence to come to me and speak up. I spoke to the victim privately and got a statement from her. At this point I had to get the victim’s supervisor involved due to the complexity of the situation. To my surprise, the supervisor mentioned that creepo had tried that same scenario on her, to which she basically pushed him away, told him to fuck off, and warned him to never ever try that again. It appears that this isn’t creepos first rodeo. However; This is where said supervisor fucked up by not reporting him on that incident in my opinion, because all he did was move to another target and try to victimize her. The supervisor and I discussed the incident and unfortunately, because she wasn’t my subordinate, I had to leave it up to her to handle the situation with the victim while I reported the incident to my superiors.

At that point, I was told to bring it up to manager “A” and they would address it, since we STILL didn’t have an HR department. I did as I was advised and left it at that. Well, I come to find out later that the manager and creepo were somewhat friends or friendly, which resulted in creepo being simply moved to another department. A couple of weeks later the victim came to me and thanked me for addressing it, even though she didn’t want to make a big deal about it (her words). She said she was resigning and was ready to move on from her current job. She assured me that she had come to that decision prior to the incident and was going to be leaving anyway to follow her true calling. I told her that I wished her the best and appreciated her honesty; however, in order to make sure incidents like these are far and few, the best course of action for her and everyone (including creepo) is to tackle the issue head on when it rears it’s ugly head. She was young and a bit naive, but had a very sweet personality. 

To end this story, I followed up with everyone involved and was told to leave it up to the manager they directed me to. Creepo was still employed at the company when I left.  From what I know he was never reprimanded for the incident. My last words to my superiors about it was that creepo was a liability, a “cancer” per se, that definitely needed to be “trimmed” to avoid an incident which might burn the company.

ebmxco5,t1_ebm0ava,2018-12-12 15:59:24,TwoXChromosomes,"Media is not the right answer.  It really has a backlash for the accuser.  My question is if the unwanted attention stopped.  If it didn’t, then tell the regional manager again and then if it still doesn’t stop you go to a lawyer or go above the regional manager.

Many companies would fire someone for showing up at an employee’s home for non-business reasons or for a direct threat to your job but mostly because it shows really poor judgement and is a misuse of your private information.  (How will they treat private company information, what other havoc will they wreak or customers will they stalk?)

In reality, the employer’s duty is to act to stop the behavior.  If you tell management once, they should sit down with the perpetrator and outline what is acceptable and what isn’t and document it.  Now the company and the perpetrator are both fully aware that the attention or behavior is unwanted.  This gets it out of ‘he said, she said’ murkiness.  Now, if the perpetrator continues, you report it again.  At this point action should be taken to immediately protect you/halt it.  

Once management knows, the entire company is liable but it often takes 2 reports to see action.  I see so many women give up because someone isn’t fired after one report.  I think there is often poor communication to the victim too about the process.  I got one guy fired but only because I overheard the initial and the second complaint... nobody would come to me directly. 

Now in your case, the regional manager was an idiot.  He wanted the word harassment stricken from the record because he thought that made the company less liable when it does the opposite.  I would have reported that above his head., in writing.  The owners would absolutely care about an idiot manager leaving them exposed to lawsuits.  In your case, he should have taken immediate action just because that manager who was new was clearly a ticking time bomb.

If there is evidence that supports either side it’s not “implicit belief” thus lacking evidence the only other potential resolution is no contest. This is where the only response on the matter from the accused is where they choose not to operate on any investigative inquiries to the accusation. Now policy usually stands here that severance is made because no contest isn’t permitted. Keep in mind this doesn’t establish truth only a cause and effect. An accusation is made; it is neither confirmed or denied; the investigation is not contested and thus the resolution plays out by the policy. Now you could say “No contest seems to imply guilt or validity to the claim” but that’s absurd. That’s like saying I can’t formally proof this thus I can proof it.

Believing an accuser doesn't mean you don't verify their claims before taking action against the accused. It means you proceed from an assumption that they're making the accusation in good faith, rather than from an assumption they're fabricating the the claim or overreacting.

It doesn't mean you don't investigate before taking significant action against the accused. Instead, it basically means the assumption of innocence _applies to both parties_. You don't assume the accused is guilty, but you also don't assume the accuser is lying.

If you go to the police and say ""my neighbor attacked me"", they believe you. They help you file a report, make sure you have the opportunity to get required medical attention, etc. You can use that report to get an emergency temporary restraining order, even -- the Judge will generally believe you were attacked and take action to keep you safe.

However, the accused is still innocent until proved guilty.

Not being able to do a _perfect_ job of finding the truth doesn't absolve you of the ethical duty to make the effort.

If the accusation is more than harassment -- if it rises to assault or worse -- then your first sentence makes a lot of sense. And it's also why such reports should be referred to law enforcement who has access to the correct resources.

But that doesn't mean you don't do an investigation on harassment claims. It just means you need to be realistic about the scope of the investigation -- it should be one of due diligence. You should be looking for:

* is this an isolated incident or part of a pattern of complaints? Repeated complaints are evidence of a more serious problem that can't likely be educated away, for example

* were there people other than the victim who were aware of the incident? If they witnessed it, why didn't they report it? Unlike assault, sexual harassment often _does_ have witnesses.

* what supporting evidence exists? you'd be surprised how often there is very clear evidence of harassment; harassers often think their behavior is acceptable. I've helped fire at least 4 people in my life who harassed their victims over corporate email or messaging systems...

* is there any mitigating or exculpatory evidence? in the one case I've seen of a false report, we noted that the accuser had reason to lie (the accused had received a bad review from the accuser) _and_ the accused had a detailed record of the accuser's repeated threats to make a false report

In the roughly dozen harassment claims I've helped investigate, most had clear supporting evidence to bolster the accuser's claims. Of those that didn't, all but 2 resulted in disciplinary action against the accused because we had no evidence of bad faith on the part of the accuser, even though we had nothing conclusive; the degree of that action varied based on what we did find.

And, as I said, only one was identified as a false report, and there was pretty decent evidence to support that finding.

I'm not for a second denying that sexual harrassment is an immensely important problem. All I am saying is that we need to take care that in dealing with the problem we don't undermine other important principals of free society, such as the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"".

To abandon those things, or supplant their importance with a primary fixation on subduing sexual harrassment *at any and all costs* would be like using a cannon to kill a mosquito. You'd ultimately cause more damage to the big picture then you would remedy.

This might just be a semantic disagreement. Usually when people come in here complaining about our tendency to believe victims' stories, they are demanding incontrovertible evidence that the incident happened exactly as described. Video, eye witnesses, a confession, DNA, a pronouncement carved by God Himself into a stone on a mountain top, or whatever. Otherwise they insist that the sex offender is DEFINITELY innocent, because they don't understand that ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a legal concept rather than a moral edict for ordinary people. Ordinary people are of course free to pass judgment using their own observations, experience and common sense, since my own certainty (for example) that Kavanaugh tried to rape Dr. Ford in high school is of no consequence to him. 

So when someone whines about ""the truth"" I tend to assume they're that kind of person: someone who refuses to believe that anybody on earth has ever sexually harassed or assaulted anybody else unless they've personally jerked off to the photographs.

I may have misunderstood the post I responded to if it meant something other than the usual shower of misogynist chuckleheads we always get here whenever sexual harassment comes up.

Think of it from the HR Work Politic prospective  

Openly watching porn at work is creepy, you’re obviously uncomfortable and thats pretty good case to fire someone for harassment in the general sense.
 However because it’s kind of hard to prove he was intentionally targeting you that’s probably why they went the lazy route. Instead of opening and investing the case.

Along with that he sounds like the sales “golden boy” so that’s going to be another factor too. 

Assuming he doesn’t have an previous incidents and trying to avoid a scandal. I’m not surprised but what they did but they should have handled it better. Like move him, make him take SH classes and disciplinary actions.

I don’t think people are excusing his behavior as much as pointing out that.

I think that might be overstating it; I read that as ""who seems more trustworthy"", but it's really more ""what best fits the available evidence"" combined with ""do we have a high enough confidence to take action"". In the case where the evidence was so inconclusive that we couldn't reasonably take any disciplinary action, I still personally trusted the accuser more (based on knowing them both; he was... a bit ethically challenged, in general); but I can't punish someone based on my gut.

Yeah, I see that a lot too, and I can understand your reaction in that context.

You are the one acting as self-appointed interpreter of other people's thoughts, not me.

I have not said that I know what anyone else thinks. I'll leave that up to you.

I have said what certain words or phrases mean in an objective sense. Whether someone who writes those words and phrases truly means them is a completely unknowable matter (to all of us except you, obviously). I even acknowledge that, yes, maybe OP meant what you say they meant. Did I not? It was never my contention that OP knows what they are talking about, only that what they are saying is immoral and counterproductive to society.

If OP does not mean those words then all the better. That's good news. It means one less bigoted person in the world to deal with. But regardless of whether or not OP truly means those words, they should expect people to object to idea which they represent. 

It makes no sense to arbitrarily substitute the idea expressed by those words with a more favourable one just because we are sympathetic to OP's position. 

If I posted ""Kill all Egyptian babies!"". Would you object to that? Well what if I clarify by saying that ""I didn't mean that literally, I just meant that babies are cute, that's all"".

""To have confidence or faith in, and consequently to rely on or trust to, a person"" -- ([*Oxford English Dictionary*, 'believe'](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/17376?redirectedFrom=believe#eid)) is the meaning I'm talking about.

Words mean more than one thing. And yes, they matter. Context also matters to determine the complete sense (both denotation and connotation) of a word. Believing can (and often does) mean assuming good faith -- that is, assuming, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that someone is telling the truth. It doesn't mean we don't verify that belief before assuming the guilt of and/or punishing someone they accuse. 

Believing something doesn't mean you can't also harbor doubts. ""I believe this is the case, but I'd want to be sure before taking any serious action"" is a completely reasonable sentence.

Wow, talk about projection. No, it's quite the opposite. You chose to interpret what OP said in the least-favorable light possible, while I bothered to read OP's clarification and chose to share that with you.

>I have said what certain words or phrases mean in an objective sense.

Words don't have objective meaning. If they did we'd all speak the same language. Words change over time, languages diverge, and people can word things poorly, unintentionally obfuscating their own point. I typically choose to interpret what people say in the most favorable light, while you apparently get to be the arbiter of what someone meant, despite evidence being presented to you that disproves your interpretation. You may want to look into the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).

>If I posted ""Kill all Egyptian babies!"". Would you object to that?

Uh, yes, that would, in fact, be a call to genocide.

>Well what if I clarify by saying that ""I didn't mean that literally, I just meant that babies are cute, that's all"".

I'd say you're mentally ill because those two interpretations are basically polar opposites. When I say that words have no objective meaning, that doesn't mean we just get to make shit up, it just means that words can sometimes be interpreted in multiple ways within the confines of language as it currently exists, and as per the principle of charity, we should strive to argue against the most coherent and reasonable interpretation possible. What OP said is not the polar opposite of what she meant, but one possible interpretation of the original wording - one which is more charitable than your interpretation of ""always believe women because they're women,"" unlike your example where the two things you said are quite literally on far ends of a spectrum.

It's clear to me at this point that you're not really arguing in good faith, instead opting to pick apart word choice, interpreting them in the most negative possible way, and then arguing against that interpretation in an effort to drag the argument away from the far more important point. Stop this - it's so easy to recognize for anyone who has even a rudimentary knowledge of philosophy, and it only serves to make you look like an idiot. It's the philosophical equivalent of the internet debater pointing out grammar mistakes and claiming victory. The sad part is, you seem like a nice enough person.

I only claimed to know what the literal meaning of OP's words were, and I reacted to them in good faith according to their actual meaning. Despite what you may maintain, words do have meaning. Yes, those meanings can change over time but I do still have a firm grasp on the meaning of the words OP used here. They have not changed in my lifetime. I read OP's words according to their literal meaning. If that's unfavourable then so be it, but it's how words should be read in such a format.

You, in fact, are the one claiming to know what OP thinks. You, in fact, are the one doing some interpretation of OP's words to go beyond simply the literal meaning of their words in order to put a spin on them (favourable or otherwise).

Just like in the example I gave, and in the example in the OP, the words used have a completely different meaning from the idea which was supposedly meant to be expressed. It's an extreme example but those are the best examples to make a point. Reductio Ad Absurdum.

The point here being, if you express an abhorrent idea then people are likely to object. If you express an abhorrent idea by accident because you meant to say something else then people will still object because, generally speaking and without your mind-reading skills, how would they know that the person used the wrong words?

Even if the reader was indeed a mind-reader like yourself, it STILL is a situation where it benefits all concerned to highlight to the OP that they have expressed an abhorrent idea. It gives the OP a chance to edit their comments to prevent people from getting the wrong idea. That's not a bad thing.

1) Solve a bunch of problems.  Dig out an old textbook from college about the subject, go through the chapters, pick one problem per chapter, and solve it.  Remind yourself that you *can* do this, and you *did* study, and having an off day or two in your interviews isn't the end of the world.  Then just take a day to do something fun, and then go on to the next interview.

1. never answer questions about your personal life, especially pertaining to anything family/dating related. you don’t have a family and you don’t want one. 

2. every male interviewer will talk about your fuckability once you leave their office. get mad about it now so you can get even about it later. preferably by giving him an hr nightmare that will ruin his career. 

3. always expect them to be interviewing you for the sake of diversity, never to actually hire you. then take notes about all the shitty things they say so you can sue them for discrimination.

my dad was a sales hiring manager in the 80s-2000s and was extremely misogynistic. he only hired women for secretarial jobs, and always expected them to find a husband at the company, then take maternity leave and never come back. it took him having a daughter entering the workforce to see how fucked up that was,  but his advice has worked for me time and again.",cylondsay,t2_56qsus77,67,0,reddit3

That situation reminds me of a YouTube commercial I keep seeing. 

It's a rotary engine company. The guy starts off talking about how his dad is a physicist. He never says what his qualifications are. I just assume it's a ""family business"" shell company. A way for Daddy to pass down his wealth while avoiding taxes. 

The son is probably just a middle man. The father will run the company from the shadows until he dies. Then, the company will tank and he will extract wealth as he racks up debt to be offloaded into the LLC. Dump the company, and start again with his offspring. 

He's begging for small investors around tax return season. It's never a good idea to buy into a family business like that. They're notorious for using family ties to avoid prosecution/ testifying against each other. Don't work for a company where the leadership is related.

I would suggest OP touch base with her father just to learn if there is any history between the men.  No, that doesn't excuse things, it may be part of a conversation about professional conduct that the OP will have later with interviewer's superiors.  The industries that I have worked for over the past 25 years are very aware that they need to attract intelligent, talented young people if they want to remain industry leaders into the coming decades. I can assure you that our CEO, our HR departments would be very concerned to get feedback on an interview that exposed such an lack of professionalism from the interviewer. If state employment law covers the hiring process, then the company's legal department may be anxious to reduce their risk. Lastly, just in case it makes OP feel like she has the power to hit back, leave feedback on the interview in the ""Glassdoor"" app.  I made use of Glassdoor during my most recent job search. It was enlightening.

Subject eventually came up that he and my dad knew each other (uncommon last name). Once suspicions were confirmed, this guy acted like such an insecure baby around me after that. It was quite funny. The power balance was already in my favor, as the one representing the company with billions and he being the one hoping to get some of it, but it was hilariously lopsided by the end.

I spent summers working at my parents’ company in high school and college. My parents company’s name is my last name. I was interviewing for an internship, so most of my experience was at the company that I share a name with, so he asked, “Did you work for your daddy?”

The guy also showed up late with food in his hands, having forgotten he had an interview. He hadn’t looked at my resume until we were in the room together, and at some point he got up and left the room to get something from a printer. While leaving, he told the woman outside the door to the interview room, “Don’t let her run away!” It’s like he knew how creepy his vibes were.

I was offered that job at $15/hr, 30hr commitment a week, but I took a different one for $12/hr, 10-30hr but unstable commitment per week. Financially, it hurt a lot that semester.

It’s also completely unprofessional and creepy to suggest that you have a sugar daddy who will pay for your surgery.

Excuse me? I’m 45. My husband wants me to be comfortable and without the pain that is keeping me from doing the everyday things I love. I would have already gotten one but I have blood clot issues that would make surgery more risky. 

I was asking for a referral to a geneticist who could look at my blood clot factors to see exactly what’s going on which would help my hematologist determine what to do for me for surgeries and whether a reduction is something I could get done.

And, as much as ""know"" about how/when/length and duration of sleep, we actually know very little. A good night's sleep is important, but there's truly no set amount. During a manic phase, a person with bi-polar who is not sleeping is usually staying up all night or only sleeping a few hours, and not every manic person necessarily has sleep disturbances. And during depressive phases, they are more likely to sleep average or longer than usual, than to miss sleep. But there's no one size fits all, and we do not diagnose based on that alone.

I will say this though, to your defense, as I think about it more, (again this is California bias) the massive difference between whether or not I would consider it patronizing is the use of ""your"".  I know that's minor, but English is special that way.

If it’s a specific concern that can be dealt with (did I close the garage door? Did I remember to bring in the groceries?) I just get up and deal with it.  It’s annoying, but my brain will usually shut up and let me sleep afterward.

If it’s generalized anxiety or something I can’t deal with immediately, my brain needs a distraction.  

If I can focus on something like a book, great.  

If not, I’ll try something quiet but contemplative.  Watching/interacting with a pet, taking a walk, sitting outside and staring at the stars, something like that. Something that helps draw focus externally and/or remind my brain that it’s concerns can be set aside for now - pets are happy just to spend time with us, the stars will shine no matter what I do. Sometimes knowing that my life is small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things is a comfort when I’m feeling overwhelmed, sometimes remembering that there are people who love me no matter what helps.

Meditation can also help. Even just laying down and counting breaths can help me ignore my brain long enough to go back to sleep.

It’s normal for most people to feel calmer at low doses of certain stimulant medications, the difference tends to be the “ceiling” at which higher doses start to induce hyperactivity. Because the baseline dopamine and norepinephrine levels for most people diagnosed with ADHD is much lower than in neurotypical people, therapeutic doses of stimulants for someone with ADHD may be far too strong for someone without ADHD.

5. Hydrate well, all the time to help flush stuff out (but not like a crazy amount, just make sure you're drinking enough water on the regular

jakeoqm,t1_jahp6x5,2023-03-02 01:34:15,TwoXChromosomes,"My husband insisted on making our house smart about 9-10 years ago. It’s been awesome. I can control lights from phone and even the garage door. Alexa is also awesome. When we use something up in the kitchen or are running low, it’s so easy to just tell Alexa to add it to a list we’ve created (grocery, Target, Trader Joe’s…) 

I have a lot of physical issues and have mobility issues. Not having to get up to turn on/off lights is so helpful. No more walking through a dark room because the light switch is in a very inconvenient place. 

You can buy smart LED light bulbs that last forever and connect to an app. You can change the color and dim the light. Even programming certain colors and light intensity for different occasions. It’s really helpful.

It’s also great for double checking that you’ve turned everything off. 

You can also get smart outlets that you can turn on and off through an app. My grandmother would have loved that. She was so worried about burning house down and would fret so much when she went somewhere. My mom and I would double check all the outlets and lights to reassure her. She had fire related trauma back when nobody was treating mental health issues like today. 

I have a few shows I like to calm down enough to sleep. 

There’s some really cute Japanese anime like Studio Ghibli’s My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo, Kiki’s Delivery Service (in the American version Kiki is voiced by Kirsten Dunst and the cat Jiji by the late amazing Phil Hartman), Spirited Away, etc. A lot of Studio Ghibli are on HBO. I also love Bee and Puppycat and Brown and Friends (both Netflix). 

I also love Bob’s Burgers’ Crossing Swords, and The Great North (all Hulu).

One of my all time favorites is Invader Zim (Enter the Florpus is on Netflix and I bought the digital box set on Vudu after watching Enter the Florpus and falling in love with a 15 year old series that is no longer streaming) 

My husband loves The Simpsons and Futurama (Both HULU and The Simpsons is also on Disney +)

There’s something so comforting about watching a well loved series in the dark cuddling with your cats that helps me sleep. 

I also have a CPAP that also really helps because my electrical heart issues makes it more difficult to breathe in my sleep which makes me feel uneasy and wakes me up gasping. 

I bought a Manta sleep mask to go with my CPAP because it was blowing a little air in my eyes. Blocking out the light helps me sleep more soundly and longer. The mask has adjustable eye cups that velcro to the outer mask. The cups are also hollow so they don’t press on your lashes and eyes. I love that mask. My nose is boney and my cheekbones are high so every mask I tried leaks a little air out even though it’s getting a great seal. 

Sounds of the ocean or rain and thunder also put me to sleep. YouTube has some 8 hour videos that I sometimes listen to. 

Sometimes nothing works so I get up and read or watch TV for a while. My husband put a small entertainment center in our bedroom so I can watch TV and play video games from my adjustable tempurpedic bed which is the most comfortable place to sit in the house. 

The Roku app also lets you listen with earphones which is also awesome. So I can hear it without having the volume too high or disturbing my husband.",savvyblackbird,t2_ienlg,2,0,reddit3

There are therapists you can talk to on text. If that would give you an extra layer of protection and make you more comfortable trying again. You could sit with a trusted friend and a pet, and if you don’t like the therapist you can just stop messaging. No anxiety of having to sit in their office and feel like you can’t leave.

Telehealth appointments could also be an option to consider. Being able to talk face to face would be more effective for both of you, but you could also just terminate the session and never have to deal with them again. 

I don’t want to pressure you. It’s ok if you choose to not try again. People keep trying to get you try again because therapy can help sooo much. It feels good to be able to set down that burden of emotional baggage. 

But the most important thing is that you go slowly and do what you feel right for you. Doing nothing could be the right option for you.

My dad had a blue-collar job that paid the mortgage and all the expenses for a family of four. A second income wasn't necessary, but my mom, then in her early 30s, wanted to work. Years earlier, she had dropped out of college because she only wanted to have and raise babies, but after 9 years of that, she found herself craving interaction with adults during the day. (She was an extreme extrovert.)  She went to work, and her frequent screaming mood swings faded away.  EVERYONE in the house was happier.

I remember a lot of women doing the same.  That's why the phrase ""latchkey kids"" became prominent in the 80s.  Kids came home from school, unlocked their houses, and did their homework for a couple of hours until their parents got home from work.

A lot of misogynists (including some women) blame women for ""saturating"" the workplace and driving down salaries, thus making it impossible to support a family on a single income. In fact, many misogynists believe that if they can drive women out of the workforce, salaries will magically increase by 100 percent for the men who remain employed. They're deluding themselves. Women (a huge percentage of the workplace) aren't to blame for today's low salaries.  Greedy employers are to blame.  You might even say that capitalism is to blame.

It wasn't feminism that put her to work outside the home to have money. It was marrying a jerk who she felt she had to stayed married to, because the patriarchy told her she didn't have a choice.

But what feminism has done for all of the men in my family and myself is make everything better. Specifically I was the one who made enough money to buy a place to live, a place that all of my family has come to stay at when life got too be too much or the rising cost of housing put them onto the streets. Feminism has given me the means to build up credit thanks to the 1970s finally allowing women to have credit cards - we couldn't before then. Feminism has allowed me to vote and to keep voting to turn the tide away from those who want to see women being nothing more than chattel again. 

And feminism has given me the ability to keep working and keep a roof over my husband's head along with my family while he fights the cancer and its aftermath once it went into remission. 

Feminism has frankly given me a far, far better life than my own mother had for the longest time, until the day she turned a job into a full-time career and made enough money that it finally forced my dad to get sober once he realized she didn't need to depend on him anymore. We all benefited from that most definitely and yeah, so did he since sober got him back on track.

When people complain about feminism I think they're just parroting crap they hear. The day in and day out of it is that it's given women the ability to live better and provide a better life for everyone in their family and community in general. 

Women always worked by the way. It's an absolute 1950s television myth that they didn't. Or that feminism is to blame for rising costs. No man, that rests purely on the fact our elected leaders give repeated tax breaks to the wealthy while making the little guy carry the burden of taxes they then give away to large corporations asking for bail outs.

A couple moving out to somewhere more than a stone’s throw away from at least one of their parents was exceedingly rare. Families were multigenerational, even up until the 1920s census the inhabitants of a dwelling was rarely “two parents and their children.” Families lived with one of their folks, whoever had the room for them. Once they got their own place, if they were superfluous children, they took siblings with them.

People also lived a lot closer up until [gestures at American expansion]. A woman could tolerate a more odious husband than right now, because both of their main emotional support was a web of the local community of women, who did those chores together.

She should not oppress her tenants and workers but should be just and consistent. She should follow the advice of her husband and of wise counsellors so that people will not think she is merely following her own will. She must know the laws of warfare so that she can command her men and defend her lands if they are attacked. She should know everything pertaining to her husband’s business affairs so that she can act as his agent in his absence or for herself if she should become a widow. She must be a good manager of workers. To supervise her workers, she needs a good knowledge of farming.

The percentage of women working outside the home (in the US) rose from about 20% at the beginning of the 20th century to 75% by the 1990's, and the level of education in play rose dramatically as well, turning women into a value creation powerhouse.

For anybody else here, I cannot recommend enough her *Letters from Othea*, *The Path of Long Study,* and *The City of Ladies.* She speaks so clearly about the slanders forced upon women of her time that it's actually kind of depressing how little her writing needs to be updated to match the 21st century.

In the City of Ladies, she meets Lady Reason, Lady Rectitude, and Lady Justice, and one of the things she discusses with them is the source of men's misogyny, particularly that which has been transmitted through literature. She points out that if women were so fickle, and inconstant, and emotional, and generally inferior in wit and intellect to men, men would not have to go to such lengths in order to court them and use the incredible amount of skill and deception they apparently feel the need for. Kind of like how *The Game* presents women: mentally vacuous objects to be won but also, somehow, requiring a highly refined set of skills to be successfully seduced. 

And calling her a widower from Venice is quite the understatement of her accomplishments as well. She was incredibly well-learned (she describes her own education as ""scraps from her father's table"" which in my opinion is basically self-slander), the first in France and perhaps in Europe to make a living solely from her writing - profession that didn't really exist at that time - participated in the first ever literary debate / controversy over the ""Quarrel of Woman"" and the Song of the Roses, and her writings are an incredible synthesis of Dante, Boccaccio, and Augustine. And she did all this while working to feed herself and her family after the death of her husband - who I will add was also a paragon among husbands. They were truly partners, and she was grieving and deeply angry with the world and with God for many years.

jpgvi21,t1_jpfoeja,2023-06-25 14:16:26,TwoXChromosomes,"This was the part I was thinking of:

>Why then if women are weak and flighty, and easily manipulated, silly and lacking self control, as some clerkly authors say, why do those who pursue them have any need of ruse? And why do women not give in at once, without requiring that strategies and tricks be used to catch them? For it is not necessary to go to war for a castle that is already captured. And even a poet as subtle as Ovid, who was later exiled, and Jean de Meun in the Romance of the Rose: What great exertion! What an elaborate enterprise! and what great learning, both accessible and obscure, what adventures he described there! And how many people are entreated and begged, and how much effort and trickery is there in order to accomplish nothing more than the deception of a maid through fraud and cunning, for that is the ultimate goal! Does a weakly fortified place require such an assault? How can one try so hard for so easy a prize? I do not understand or believe that such great effort is needed to capture a weakly fortified place, nor scheming, nor ingenuity, nor great subtlety. It is necessary to conclude that, since scheming, great ingenuity and great effort are required to deceive a noble or low born women, they are not so fickle as is said, nor is their behavior so changeable.

And if anyone says to me that books are full of such fickle women (a charge made by many, and one that I dislike), I answer that women did not write the books, nor did they put into them the things one reads there against women and their behavior. Thus do male authors write to their heart's delight their own cases, happy to yield in nothing and to take for themselves the spoils of victory: for aggressive people quickly attack those who do not defend themselves. **But if women had written the books, I know for a fact they would have been written differently, for women well know they are wrongly condemned.** The parts are not fairly distributed, for the strongest take the largest pieces and the one who divides up the pieces takes the best for himself.

\-------------------------------

Just the other day, there was a post on here about the different attitudes towards raising boys and girls. That one was ridiculous because of the way it suggests fathers cannot relate to daughters (and also that mothers don't deserve to have children *they* can relate to).

>And again, I cannot keep quiet about a habit of thought that circulates commonly among men, and even among some women, which maintains that when women are pregnant and give birth to a daughter, the husbands are unhappy and grumble because their wives have not given birth to a son. **And their silly wives, who should be overjoyed that God has safely delivered them and likewise thank Him from their hearts, are upset because they see their husbands unhappy.** Why, lady, are they so sad about this? Are daughters more trouble than sons, or do they love their parents less or are they more indifferent towards them than sons?

The conclusion they come to is that

* Worry about the cost of marrying off your daughter is misplaced because boys cost way more (education, living expenses, superfluous expenses, and ""a lot of silliness""
* Worry about their daughters being mislead by bad advice can be easily fixed by good parenting and good role modeling
* Sons are more prone to ""rough and grievous brawls and riots and leading dissolute lives""
* Sons less frequently take care of their parents as they age and are also more likely to desire their parents dead because they stand to inherit (the daughters will inherit nothing and so want their parents to live)

>I certainly do not claim that all sons are like this, but there are a lot who are. And if they are married, God knows how eager they are to exploit their fathers and mothers: they could not care less if these weary old people die of hunger, just as long as they get everything!

* Even assuming you have and raise the best of sons, they are far more likely to move around, see the world, travel, be occupied by other pursuits and so are just, generally, going to be less useful and available for less companionship to their parents.

\---------------------------------------------------

A few days ago there was a post here about that guy who was upset that in his old age, young women were no longer in his bed, and he was just generally angry about how he was no longer getting random attention from strangers he felt he was entitled to:

>But I beg you tell me why and for what reason so many different authors have spoken about against women in their books, since I already know from you that they're wrong: is it Nature makes them do it or do they do it out of hatred, and where does all this come from?  
>  
>....

\[It is discussed that some men hate women because some women really are crappy human beings and are thus motivated by good intentions. But this does not justify them because ""you should never excuse gross ignorance"" and ""to harm and wrong one party in order to help another is not justice, and nor is to blame all feminine behavior in opposition to the truth""\]

>....  
>  
>Other men have blamed women for other reasons: some have invented blame because of their own vices and others have been motivated by defects in their own bodies, others through pure envy, and some others by the sheer pleasure they experience from slander. Others, in order to show that they have read many texts, base themselves on what they have found in books and repeat others and cite authorities. Those who invented blame because of their own vices are men who wasted their youth in dissolution and had a great many love affairs with different women, used deception in many instances, have grown old in their sins without repentance, and now regret their past follies and the dissolute life they led in their time. But nature, which does not allow the fulfillment of the heart's desire without sufficient power of the appetite, has grown cold in them. They are mournful when they see that the life that they used to call good times is over for the, and it seems to them that the young who are now what they used to be, are enjoying the good times. **They do not know how to make their sadness go away except by blaming women, believing that in this way they will make them displeasing to others.** And one sees commonly such old men speaking obscenely and dishonestly, just as you can see with Matheolus, who admits himself that he was an old man with plenty of will but no potency.  
>  
>....  
>  
>Thus women are not as disloyal as some claim, rather, many of them are loyal; **but it happens rather frequently that they are deceived and betrayed in love. And when they find themselves thus deceived the most intelligent women withdraw from love, and in so doing this, they act very wisely.** Should they be blamed for reacting in this way? And if God were to give you

\-----------------------------

She was also particularly irritated with the way in which the biblical story of Adam and Eve formed the bedrock for slander against women and their supposed inferiority:

>When it occurred to His holy will to form Adam from the clay of the earth in the field of Damascus, he led them, after he had created him, to the terrestrial paradise which was and is the most worthy place down here on earth. There he made Adam fall asleep and formed the body of woman from one of this ribs, which signifies that she should be at his side as a companion and not at his feet as a slave, and also that he should love her as his own flesh. If the supreme craftsman was not ashamed to create and form a female body, Nature should be ashamed? Ha, it is the height of folly to say this. Indeed, how was she formed? I don't know if you noticed this, but she was formed in the image of God. Oh, how can any mouth slander something which bears such a noble imprint? But some men are so crazy that they believe, when they hear it said that God created man in His image, that this means the material body. But this is not so, for at that time God had not taken on a human body. Rather it refers to the soul which is an intellectual spirit and lasts forever, just like the Deity. God created the soul and put completely equal souls, one as good and noble as the other, into the female and male bodies. But to return to the question of the creation of the body: woman, then was made by the supreme craftsman. And in which place was she mad? In the earthly paradise. And of what? Of vile matter? No, but from the noblest matter that has ever been created: it was from the body of man that God made her.",Apophthegmata,t2_tw8xu,1,0,reddit4

I genuinely don't remember if boys were forced to do this, but I don't recall any boys being kept inside during recess to rewrite their assignments.

I read a study that said that in elementary schools, boys are most often praised for correct knowledge, and girls are praised for compliance and good behavior. Boys are more frequently criticized for misbehavior, and girls are criticized for incorrect knowledge. I'd say penmanship is treated more of a behavior than a knowledge.

From [here](https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/how-gender-disparities-affect-classroom-learning):

>This pattern of differential treatments based on gender begins in the early elementary grades and continues into college (Goldberg, 2016). Teachers tend to discipline boys more severely and provide them with more praise and feedback than girls. They praise girls' works mostly for physical appearance, such as neatness, cleanliness, or artistic quality, instead of content.

They are ignorant to the fact that Putin has always run a mafia state. He has been testing the waters on this for 10 years now, but he has never been anything other than a war hawk imperialist running a corrupt oligarchy. The privatisation that followed the fall of the iron curtain in many of these countries may have let go of the most overtly authoritarian aspects of the state but otherwise led to nothing but corrupt oligarchy exploiting the already established networks of power. Re: Russia in particular the people were poor and weary of 60 years of oppression that ultimately led to being defeated and humiliated so they resent ""The West"" and are extremely susceptible to reactionary rhetoric. That's how he has enjoyed immense homegrown support at least until this war, not to mention far more insidious online astroturfing than most people realise. But it's not only the oligarchy that is obviously conservative in every sense of the word, the people are poorly educated on many topics and the perniciousness of reactionary thought makes it so that any push for feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. gets easily branded as ""Western propaganda"" not just by political commentators but by many common people too. This has started to spread more and more throughout Europe over the last 10 or so years from what I've noticed, and more and more Europeans online are starting to laugh and point fingers at what they call ""go woke go broke"" in media (because for better or for worse the anglosphere is still one of the biggest international exporters of its media and culture, we used to pirate it pretty heavily in the 90s and 00s but now it's even more normalised and entrenched in popular culture with things like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Steam for video games etc.) It's deeply concerning on many levels.

> so many self-described ""MLs"" expect worldwide working class solidarity when they treat the traumas of eastern europeans with ridicule & contempt.

Because slavs aren't white. They're not the first to think that way ;) But more seriously, it's convenient for the privileged to dismiss intersectional issues by conflating everything under class. In abstract it's not that much different from people who respond to transgender struggles with ""umm ackshually all gender is oppressive and we should just abolish it all"" and then just go about their normal day without doing anything.

Anyway... McCarthy won the propaganda war big time. 99% of Americans don't understand what socialism is, most of them think it's intrinsically bad but can't form a coherent argument as to why, and half the Americans who do support it seem to default to a brainrotten form of reactionary support like the examples you mentioned. In a country where wealth inequality is pressing its boot harder and harder on their necks, people have to choose between voting for the capitalist party that offers some human rights, the hypercapitalist party that wants to take away the rights of non-conformists, or not voting at all and letting the middle one win.

straight up: i have had to boot SOOOOO many ""leftists"" out of the discord communities i moderate because they very slowly and subtly started dropping kremlin talking points... then escalated to linking to ""news sites"" like South Front, which seems like a pretty typical kremlin-backed propaganda outlet, but when you dig a little deeper you'll find posts with literal Holocaust denialism. caleb maupin type shit.

this issue is so close to my heart because i was actually dating an ML guy for like 6 months. it wasn't a problem at first b/c many of our ideological differences were pretty minimal by american standards: pro-labor, anti-capitalist, socially progressive.

unfortunately, he was really an ideal mark for kremlin propaganda: army veteran who had been to iraq/afghanistan, poc with a conservative upbringing, more socially reactionary than he initially admitted. we broke up in part because his social views became more and more transparently ""trad."" he was still very trans-positive, but had some really noxious views about gender roles. (for example: trans women are women, but they should always strive to be ultra-feminine) he started belittling my stances on never changing my name after marriage, not really wanting to present ultra-girly, mocking the idea that women could be oppressed by the pressure to get married & have kids, etc.

he got meaner and meaner about ""portland anarchists"" (who can admittedly be a cringe bunch, but were getting disappeared into unmarked vans during the george floyd protests) and as someone who has a lot of anarcha-feminist views, it was really upsetting.

at a certain point i couldn't quite tell just how much overlap he had with the MAGA crowd, which was really alarming. he refused to vote even though he lived in a state where abortion bans were on the table, and slipped in some subtly antisemitic comments & praise for north fucking korea, so i dumped him.

...sorry for the long ramble. it's just that i'm really unnerved by how this new brand of USSR apologist bros in the US are really starting to become indistinguishable from the ""patriotic socialist"" / nazbol crowd, even amongst non-white MLs. i see this weird mishmosh of self-described ""anti-imperialists"" who are all siding with the kremlin because they're anti-nato, despite leftists in former soviet bloc countries telling them that putin's expansionism & russian chauvinism is a serious fascist threat. it makes no sense, and has to be super alienating to non-western leftists who don't appreciate americans lecturing them about how america must be stopped at any cost—irrespective of the suffering a more powerful putin or xi jinping would inflict on the people who live under/near those regimes.

the american leftists who *have* been showing solidarity & avoiding kneejerk ""US/NATO bad so Russia & China are above criticism"" tend to lean more anarchist... but there's no state-sponsored propaganda machine spreading anarchist talking points (for obvious reasons) so it's an uphill battle.

>McCarthy won the propaganda war big time. 99% of Americans don't understand what socialism is, most of them think it's intrinsically bad but can't form a coherent argument as to why,

the one thing socialists on the anarchist/lib-left spectrum of things *do* have going for us is that the more individualistic bottom-up socialist alignments resonate better with many rural and working-class americans whose cultural values emphasize self-reliance, and who have decades of baggage & distrust around the word ""socialism."" they understand from lived experience that positions of power tend to attract corrupt assholes. (advocating for anything that sounds like ""big government"" is a hard sell for people who have dealt with the petty tyrants of their local DMV)

the best solution i've found for building solidarity is to talk about class struggle stuff & intersectionality without relying on loaded terms like ""toxic masculinity,"" ""late capitalism,"" and ""privilege,"" which have unfortunately become associated with sanctimonious, out-of-touch college kids. if you can describe these issues without using certain terms, americans are much more open to listening to the actual ideas those words represent.

2. If you don’t already have it, grab a copy of the employee hand book for your records. Ask them to specify what part of the handbook you violated and where it states you can be terminated for that violation. I would hope they gave you paperwork explaining this as part of what they wanted signed but I’m not holding my breath.
3. Get a lawyer. At least for advice. This sounds like straight up discrimination. An employer can’t tell an employee what they can or can’t do on their free time. They can ask for you to not associate the company, but they can’t say you can’t have your hobby. 
4. Don’t sign that NDA! At least not without a lawyer looking into it first. If the severance is so small, id say to never sign it. If you need the severance then id say to go back and say the severance is too small, negotiate a higher price and if they don’t want to provide you a reasonable amount for keeping your mouth closed about their bad behavior then id delicately insinuate how many more people would like to hear your story outside of your 37 followers.

Don’t make this easy for them. That’s what they want. That’s why they want you to sign an NDA. Nah. If they want to keep you quiet they’re going to have to reach deeper than that particularly since they’re letting you go for a hobby they have no say over during an economically unsteady time.

Of course, please consult an attorney, as this all very questionable.

They are required to pay you for hours worked (however they may try to adjust your wages).

If they can't cite and justify the wrongful conduct, it will likely invalidate the dishonorable termination, and you will be entitled to unemployment.

Double check your employee contract and make sure there isn't a severance clause in there stating that you are owed in the event of your situation.

Only after you have been paid what you are owed should you even consider any other terms: they have betrayed your employee contract, attempted to illegally hold funds, and extort your silence.  Why would you trust any deal with them?

Whatever the hush money is, it's worth that much and more for you to be silent, so don't be.  Make sure any former co-workers that you're friendly with know what happened.

First thing is to lawyer up then very slowly dismantle their existence with the ultimate goal of getting justice and hopefully silence them in turn. I have to say I notice these Men trying to persuade you into “being” with the men in their circle. Could it be that this has a lot to do with? I grew up in church and have seen this many, many times. Having faith as they call it is just a word they use for going along with their agenda. The underlying problem is a lust for power and control, they of course are using religion like so many others. I grew up in a small town in the Southeast of Alaska called Ketchikan and I saw quite a few well off men start churches with the sole purpose in mind to get rich and to use their congregation for their own desires. The largest “contributor’s” or “tither’s” getting seats on the governing board and those men would in turn start their own churches with the monetary backing of the original church and this abuse spreads like a disease effectively destroying the communities they benefit from. I’m only saying all this because I’m a God fearing man and I know this situation far too well and when you said “they tell their employees to have faith.” My skin crawled and memories that are 30 years old came back and I’d be doing you and many readers a disservice if I didn’t point this out as it’s grossly inappropriate as you can clearly see how they conduct themselves(banned from his wife’s work)and people like this need to be shut down!

Next start looking for new jobs immediately before embarking on anything legal. We all need to eat and sleep and those both take money. 

As for legal advice--lots of suggestions already and so much depends upon where you are located. IF in the US the law still depends upon the judges, magistrates, hearing officers, arbitrators and since I work in law I know most of those systems are slow normally and glacial right now--covid. Plus  you need all sorts of evidence--documents, statements, dates of events, etc. for anything and everything--did you read the documents you signed when you were hired? Many if not most folks do not and many of those documents have what are loosely called ""morals clauses"" which give employers huge and vague numbers of reasons to be able to terminate employment.

Sometimes living well is the best choice--I'm personally not a fan of revenge. Given you and your friend could get a podcast up and running maybe learn how to promote it? Know this right from the start--all things legal will take lots and lots and lots of time so do you want to spend it challenging this company or building your own lives? The outcomes of challenges are never, and I mean never!!!, certain. 

How long do you want to spend still engaged in dealing with these people? Me? I'm gone, yesterday and I will figure out the money and get a new job, somewhere, somehow.

h32xh1u,t3_o7rv4f,2021-06-26 06:08:03,TwoXChromosomes,"I'm sure you've already received this advice, but DO NOT sign the NDA. Your coworker is OWED her earned wages, regardless of the severance offered, and those earned wages cannot be denied. This is a Dept of Labor violation, and your friend can file a DOL complaint over this. Earned-but-not-paid wages are due the day you are terminated, or very soon after, and there's no way an employer can withhold this.

Check the right-to-work laws in your state. You may or may not be able to file a complaint for wrongful termination. Either way, do not sign the NDA. When they let you go, file immediately for unemployment, be fully truthful, and you will probably win your unemployment claim. This will hurt your former employer far worse than anything because they will be on the hook for this amount plus it will raise their unemployment insurance rates.

Good luck, and it sounds like you are better off at a new employer anyway. I hope you find a new job soon! Once you do, please be sure to detail your firing on your podcast.

hwg7d1d,t3_spkn4a,2022-02-11 01:58:53,TwoXChromosomes,"Worked for a Silicon Valley startup a few years back which sent the whole organization to Mexico for a long weekend after securing way more funding than expected, and it was agreed as part of the deal. Stayed at a fancy resort with swimming pools, I think someone on the board owned most of the place and it was technically off-season.

Anyway, we arrive and people go in the swimming pools and have some drinks. I decided to have a nap instead,  but afterward I hear that one of the Sales people was grabbing all the women's bottoms in the pool, despite numerous requests to stop. It impacts the trip negatively for those affected, and no punishment happens, he is kept an eye on by everyone but nothing more occurs. He never even apologized.

The sales office was in a different location from mine so I never saw him again, but I was so offended by it I brought it up with my manager every two weeks. I found out he was the highest performing sales person in the company. Nothing happened for over 6 months, then my manager one day told me he'd been fired. I can only imagine he did something else.

Some of the people affected were in HR, and even they couldn't rally support to get rid of him because he was high performing. I learned a lot about how corporate priorities really work from this, sadly. They'll protect him until the potential lawsuits become more expensive than the hush payout.",etothepi,t2_61gsj,919,0,reddit2

If I lifted my arms to get anything off the shelves, my shirt would lift up, exposing a small bit of midriff. One of the kitchen guys would squeeze behind me all the time, putting his hand touching my skin. It skeeved me out so bad. He also would just stare at my boobs whenever he talked to me and was just an overall creep.

When I was complaining about him to my female coworkers, they said he did that to them, too, and encouraged me to go to my boss. I told our GM and the guy got pulled into the office. It was one of our busiest nights so almost everyone was working, and even though the door was shut, we could hear everything. This man got freaking REAMED out by my boss. Basically, if he so much as looked at any of the girls there the wrong way and got one more complaint, he would be out the door so fast he wouldn't know what hit him.

Sure, he didn't get fired. But I think the humiliation of knowing that everyone heard was so much sweeter. He got teased like crazy and the man didn't even look my way the rest of the time I worked there. It was hilarious 😆",erinnebell,t2_14psbo,1520,0,reddit2

Disclaimer: I’m an attorney but this is NOT legal advice. 

You’re in CYA mode. Cover your ass. Not only is this letter a good idea to put pressure on getting this guy fired, but it’s also ensuring YOU don’t get caught up in this. 

Hypothetically if this guy does something like this again to the wrong person and it comes out the company knew about his behavior and did nothing, they will look at who knew and what did they do. 

Right now you’re the low girl on the totem pole. C suite will point their finger directly at you for “not ringing the alarm” loud enough. Which is obliviously b.s. but that’s what happens. 

Such a letter destroys that argument and also may actually prompt action now.

My story is almost the exact same as yours. I worked in shitty office jobs for about 15 years. After being fired from the last one for ""being grumpy"" I needed a big change. Bit of background-at that last office job I was tapped out making $13/hour and was pretty much at the highest I would go. With a mortgage and being an adult, I always had to have a second job. SO yea, I probably was grumpy... I was tired all the time haha! I was also 30 and scared as hell to make a major life change. But I live in a very industry and construction rich place so researching trades was easy. I ended up choosing electrical and took a pre-trades course at the technical college here. I also got a full grant to do so-being a woman in a ""non-traditional"" course. SWEET! Finished the course and started my first construction job and haven't looked back! I haven't had to have a second job since. And I found I can be myself on a construction site-I'm a bit... sassy lol :P I am no longer an electrician (whole other story there lol)-I do safety now and have worked my way up to management. I LOVE my job, my career, my company, and my guys! And I'm always trying to recruit more women ha! We definitely need to get the word out!  
I'd say if there are a few \*negatives\* its that no one knows where I fit in... The guys treat me like one of them and the office gals don't really know how to treat me. And sometimes people assume I am either a lesbian (I'm not but there's nothing wrong with it!) or looking for a husband/hook up. These are easy enough things to get past and don't bother me at all :)",givemeagdusername,t2_27ppjqym,20,0,reddit3

Most men will be cool with you, not 100% PC as trades tend to have a lot of swearing and boosting but generally it is not aimed at you or your gender. There'll be moments that really hurt, like getting turned down for a job while they worry about mat leave but also knowing you are too early career to rock the boat. But over all day to day is pretty good.

Just keep yourself safe, there's a lot of people who take shortcuts and knock the safety features off or don't tie off on 40 story roofs because it's only a moment. Don't die cause your nervous calling someone out on stupidity.

ec6qqty,t3_a7y3bc,2018-12-20 15:52:42,TwoXChromosomes,"I’ve always admired and wanted to go into the trades. If I’d been a man I think I would have been an electrician, or welder, or carpenter, maybe a mechanic. I think I would have liked to be a truck driver too, as I’m solitary and work best alone. Fear kept me from pursuing anything like these jobs, because I got so much sexual harassment from men from a very young age just out in the world with and just in factory and office jobs I didn’t think it would be wise to work in fields of mostly men and where I’d often be isolated with just men. 

I remember being a teenager and construction guys hooting and hollering at me and my friends when we walked by, that happened a lot. It was an accepted part of the culture then (‘80s) but was really scary for me. One experience really scarred me, I stopped to watch some electricians fix a broken power line because it looked interesting and they both leered at me. One guy licked his lips at me and the other rubbed his crotch. I was 13 years old. Would those same men acted that way to a female co-worker? Maybe not but these experiences left the impression on me that these sort of jobs are not safe for women. 

I love seeing women in these fields now and I think the culture has improved a little. I admire women like you who push through the fear and break through these barriers!

The pay was decent but the constant harassing comments and the doubt in my ability sue to my gender was unbearable. I did it for 13 years and was always stressed and hated it. When they had a downturn and laid me off, I decided never again. It was about the company and the culture they create for me. They allow their low level management play favorites and degrade the woman in the shop. It was belittling and I gained 50 pounds due to the stress and anxiety it caused. So I suggest that those considering this leap to look into the company and how they treat their employees and the policies that are there if any to protect you from the harassment.

I worked with a team of all-men-but-me for a while and, while they occasionally called me a ballbuster, at least they listened when I had something to say. I took no shit from any of them so they treated me like an equal. Then one day, the boss hired a woman to be the office manager. She was very young and had no idea how to work with men in a way to earn their respect. They ignored her, dismissed her, treated her like a stupid child. (Which she kind of was in a way.) She was married to one of the managers and ended up having an affair with one of the foreman. So there was a lot of stupid drama around. Anyway, the boss decided to send her to some corporate class; I can't remember what it was, but she asked me to go with her. Apparently, she couldn't travel to a city three hours away and find a hotel and attend a class/workshop all by herself? Fine, it was a chance to get out of town; I went with her. It was a lot about women in the workplace and something something about leadership. 

The speaker opens the floor for questions and my companion raises her hand and says, ""The guys I work with don't listen to me, even if I have a well-presented proposal. They just ignore me?"" And the lady -- I loved this shit -- paused a second and said, ""I'm going to be a little harsh right here, okay? We teach people how to treat us."" BOOM. This woman was basically playing Mean Girl high school games and then couldn't figure out why nobody respected her. She'd get upset and defensive when the guys teased or pranked her. She didn't really understand how to dish it back. I didn't even have brothers (she didn't either, come to think of it), but I did grow up at the racetrack because my dad raced motorcycles. So I guess I had some experience relating to men in their ""territory."" Anyway, she asked me for guidance at that point and I think followed my lead a little bit as time went on but they never really respected her because she fucked a foreman pretty much right under her husband's nose and her husband worked with us and was devastated. They are still married, btw, have four kids, and she cheated on him a couple more times. But he's a doormat, so he keeps taking her back. ",Dogzillas_Mom,t2_12gmqj,179,0,reddit3

I will always recommend getting as much experience as possible before seriously thinking of trade school. See if you can get an unskilled job in that market and spend some time feeling it out. Not always possible of course. Also, talk to apprentices, young guys, old guys, and master level guys. Get a feel for where the industry might take you in twenty years, but also what it's like as a noob in this job market. Etc.

[MacKenzie Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKenzie_Scott) was Amazon's first employee where she was largely involved with the company's business plan, accounts and product shipping.

I've known women who are wives to doctors that open their own practices and the wives are the office managers (in addition to doing housework). I know someone who is a nurse who also works in her husband's private practice. I also know some women coders who work in their husbands' businesses, despite the fact that the husbands know nothing about programming. Instead the husbands market the company, thus people only know these men as the company founders (without crediting any of the actual work, that is essential to the company, to the wives).

Someone I know owns multiple apartment buildings and his wife manages all the buildings for rental (in addition to working as an engineer as well as managing their household).

All of these contributions are largely unknown because when someone asks any of these men — who founded the company/business? who owns the buildings? — it would be all those men. Many of these women work very hard when the businesses were started (until now) and yet, their contributions would never be recognised.

If another man were to do all these things, especially when starting a business? He would be known as a co-founder. If a wife were to be doing all these? Her work would never be acknowledged as critical to the company's starting point (and growth).",bwpepper,t2_8l4pjzql,49,0,reddit1

Both grandmothers worked hard and took care of their kids and homes while my alcoholic grandfathers did menial labor and drank away their paychecks. Both advocate for the women in our family to always have enough money to take your children and run.",Leasshunte,t2_a3hmyeco,9,0,reddit1

I am 51 and the fourth generation of five generations of women who have been or are passionate about textiles.

My great-grandmother lived in Llanelli in South Wales. She worked in a local factory, making metal toys, except during the war when they switched to munitions. But she also worked part-time as a dressmaker, making clothes not just for her family and friends but for other people in the local area, on her Singer 201K treadle machine, a semi-professional model. I have it now, as well as just a few of her old patterns, one or two are still in the envelopes they were posted in to her, as they had been ordered by a customer specifically. 

I looked up the serial number, and her Singer 201K was made in 1948. She probably had to save for a long time to buy it. She was still sewing on it until the last few yeas of her life, around 80 or so.

My grandmother worked all her life. She trained as a tailor in a local workroom as a City and Guilds apprentice. She always sewed, knitted, cooked, and baked. She was heavily involved in the local WI, including putting on plays with one of her best friends who would later become my drama teacher. 

She went on to work for 20+ years in the occupational therapy department of the local psychiatric hospital. She worked with the 'lifetime' patients - remember this was the late 70s to mid 90s, when times were different and some of her patients had already been institutionalised for decades.

Even in retirement, she ran her local pensioner's club.

My mum was a subpostmaster back in the UK. She also made all our clothes when I was a kid.

I sew, knit, crochet, weave, spin, felt, and more. I used to be a software developer before moving to France. I now live on disablity benefits, and I'm a single mum with two teenagers at home.

- She married a wealthy and politically powerful man.

- She had a huge staff who handled all the household chores.

- Her children get one mention in the passage because she probably had nannies and wet nurses.

- It says “she provides food for her family” but it’s difficult to imagine the lady of the house in the kitchen peeling potatoes. Most likely “She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar”, i.e. the profits from her businesses paid the household’s food expenses.

- The two SAHM-ish tasks she performs are managing the household staff (v 15) and sewing clothing and linens for the family (v 21-22)… but that sewing is part of a thriving business (v 24).

- She spends most of her time buying land, running a vineyard (v 16), trading like a merchant (v 14), selling her handmade sewing products (v 24), and participating in charitable activities (v 20). Definitely no cleaning, laundry, or homeschooling.

But somehow modern American Christians read that and draw the conclusion “The Bible says women should stay home and have babies, not get jobs”? Like, can you read on a second-grade level?

Not to mention, this Proverbs 31 woman is one of several women mentioned in the passage. There are also a lot of female servants. Woman… who worked for another person… outside of their own families… for money.

The standard of ‘women should only be in the domestic sphere’ was an upper class standard that was later expanded during and after the industrial revolution to the middle class - even then, poor and lower class women still had to work. Practicality supersedes the ideal in almost all cases.  

The only reason that women started staying home more is because more people became wealthier during the Industrial Revolution, allowing the family to be supported on one person’s labor. And it still was not as common as many think for women to only work in the home.

My family lived in a rural area on the Norwegian coast, as far back as we have records. Everyone had a fishing boat and everyone had a small farm -- a potato field, some sheep and chickens, maybe a cow or two. Basically you needed to both fish and farm in order to feed your family. Only a very small percentage of the male population had an actual profession other than farming and fishing, and even those that did most often also fished and farmed. Unmarried women might take work outside the home (typically as housekeepers or seamstresses etc.) but married women typically did not. It was only the men who went out fishing, but guess what the women did when the men were out on the sea? They didn't sit on their asses and do nothing, I'll tell you that much. Farming is bloody hard work and not exactly risk-free. It was thus for almost everyone up to and including my grandparents' generation; my parents' generation (the boomers) had other opportunities and options. 

My own grandmother, whose life spanned from 1907 to 1997, also had a job before she married, as live-in housekeeper and nanny to the family of a lighthouse keeper. A blocky old lighthouse built on a tiny bare rock, there's not much there except the lighthouse and a small jetty, and some seagulls.  Not really far out to sea, you could easily row there on a good day; but on a bad day the waves would be breaking over the roof of the lighthouse and going outside would be death. And yes, the lighthouse keeper lived out there for months at a time, with wife and children, and of course the housekeeper. Must have been a rather claustrophobic life for a young woman. She had that job for a number of years. Never had the chance to get an education beyond the basics; which was a gigantic waste of what those of us who knew her realized was a very sharp and curious mind. Later in life she was a voracious reader, well-oriented about the wider world, able to discuss a variety of subjects. Uncounted numbers like her fill the generations that preceded us, confined by economic and social circumstances to a life far smaller than their potential.",Bartlaus,t2_two9j,4,0,reddit1

jjj2m0b,t3_13coexf,2023-05-09 22:20:53,TwoXChromosomes,"> There is an extremely brief period in time in which the middle class had enough money to support a household with one income, but that was never going to last, and it sure as hell didn’t apply to everyone.

The middle class has always been associated with two-income families; it's the lower and upper classes that are more likely to have one income.  The lower class because you can't earn enough to pay for services, so instead one person has to do unpaid labor at home. The upper class case because if one of you is super rich it's less likely the other one can get a job where you'd notice the income difference… but that one's rarer, and high earners marry each other pretty often too.

You can see the common picture of this isn't right because two-income families go up when the economy is ""better"" and there's lower unemployment. It doesn't act the same way as people retiring when they can afford to does.

jjhqym6,t3_13coexf,2023-05-09 17:10:35,TwoXChromosomes,"My grandmother always worked, even as a teen as a soda jerk and part time sewing for a ladies shop to help make ends meet. She was one of the youngest in a family of a total of 14 children, 6 girls. Her widowed mother married her widower father and had more. They all worked on the farm to help, until they were old enough to do other jobs and help bring in money. 

Soda jerk is how she met my grandpa after the war. Even after they were married, she still worked sewing, or in production lines, or cooking at the local college, canning and selling/trading the extra food my grandfather grew. Selling quilts. This was all during that so called time of stay at home wives. That was fine for people in the suburbs or cities maybe. Out in the country that wasn't the case at all. 

My other grandmother lived in a city and didn't have to work, got married right out of school. After her divorce, she still had the house made into flats and rented out the extra space to make bills. Got part time jobs as secretary or assistant. Had my father and uncle working as soon as they were able to help out. 

My mom stayed at home but still worked at my school to help afford tuition. She was screwed when dad passed away and she had to start over after a 13 year gap, and her degree was fairly useless at that point.

And she did tell me that was the only job that he would ""allow"" her to work. And he died at 97, they were the same age, and he never let up on that train of thought. Ever. My grandma was not a whole person, she was an extension of his and that was it.

She had a nice life that she chose and they actually had a good relationship their entire life, one to envy. But for sake of self evolution, too bad she got married at 15 because that was the thing to do. 

And she had a good life with my grandfather up until they were 79 years old. Let this be a lesson to everybody, including myself. He became old minded, dementia and not confirmed nor Alzheimer's, yet he ended up falling for a very common scam with the company that he owned and he lost it all. $4 million, poof. And when he took the guy to court, the judge literally said that this was such a ridiculously common scam and he can't get blood from stone, so my grandfather won the judgment but he never received the money And he was warned by the judge he would likely not.

So what that meant is that they both lived their last 20 years and died in places they never expected because frankly they did not have family wealth underneath them to prop them up with the lifestyle they wanted. They were always expecting to go into the fun nursing home together, and they had planned for that but not financially. And our entire family blames my grandfather because he was a dick with his finances and never consulted my grandmother because she wasn't worthy enough or what the fuck ever. My grandmother has some responsibility too, I get that, because I could not live in entire lifetime with someone and not know my finances. But she was taught from the minute she was born that her place was the serve a man and that was it. 

She never self actualized better for herself and it bit her.

Other than that, the only ancestors I know that had jobs were preachers and military. So my family history absolutely goes back to women and our family being subservient housewives. And I grew up in a fringe cult. With purity checks and everything. Yet, the churches they opened up were Methodist.... let that sink in, even if you are of the opinion, as am I, that all religion is a cult.

My great great grandfather and my great grandfather were preachers of their time, one of the Lutheran Church and then the other of the Methodist because they changed the religion when they brought it from Germany to Chicago in post 1840's, which still is used as intended today.

Also, they may have changed from Methodist to Lutheran, that might've been the switch. I would ask my dad, but we haven't spoken for not quite 30 years due to the aforementioned cult that I decided to leave as a teenager

Anyway, that tells you how fucked up my ancestors were. And that's exactly what these people want to go back to. High religion, no questions, control over the populace.

However, it did not start to acquire that meaning until 1889, after a Rudyard Kipling story, and it did not do so universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.  
>  
>The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,\[1\] cattle drovers,\[2\] horticulturalists,\[3\] barbers,\[4\] engineers,\[5\] landscape gardeners,\[6\] the military,\[7\] doctors,\[8\] nurses,\[9\] teachers,\[10\] priests,\[11\] lay preachers\[12\] and even lawyers.\[13\]

Prostitution being the world's oldest profession makes no damn sense if you even think about it for more than two seconds. Prostitution is the exchanging of sex for monetary value. Monetary value (in the sense of some abstract value like dollars which no one can use for food or shelter) would need an actual civilization or some settled culture to even make sense. And if some economy exists well then there has already been a 'first profession' before prostitution. It likely would have been agriculturalists, farmers, cooks, builders or anything that actually makes a settled society function.

And if you're arguing that prostitution existed in hunter-gatherer times as the 'first profession' - why would a hunter-gatherer woman need to do that? She has all the resources to provide for herself. Systemic poverty that drove women to prostitution simply did not exist in hunter-gatherer times.",inaqu3estion,t2_lw66eez4,1,0,reddit1

Pastors, merchants, a bank teller (and eventually president), doctors and accountants, that sort of thing. When they married outside the middle class, they married (landowning) farmers. (Or farmers' children.) The women didn't work outside the home. One attended a finishing school.

Depending on the era, they would have employed a ""maid of all work"" and possibly a cook. Being a servant to the middle class was more work (hard to believe, but true) for less pay than being a servant to the upper class.

My Dad definitely married up. His ancestors were farmers, bricklayers, and a bank robber. We don't have many stories about the women. The  only reason I know they didn't work in the mills is that they didn't live where the mills were. Even in the family stories some were of questionable status (sometimes called ""character""). From that I conclude that their virtue might very well have been questionable or even for sale. (It seems silly to phrase it that way today, but that was the social reality at the time.

jjktyng,t1_jjhdmhh,2023-05-10 08:02:34,TwoXChromosomes,">The oldest profession in the world (or the world's oldest profession) is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to prostitution. However, it did not start to acquire that meaning until 1889, after a Rudyard Kipling story, and it did not do so universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.  
  
>  
>The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,\[1\] cattle drovers,\[2\] horticulturalists,\[3\] barbers,\[4\] engineers,\[5\] landscape gardeners,\[6\] the military,\[7\] doctors,\[8\] nurses,\[9\] teachers,\[10\] priests,\[11\] lay preachers\[12\] and even lawyers.\[13\]

Prostitution being the world's oldest profession makes no damn sense if you even think about it for more than two seconds. Prostitution is the exchanging of sex for monetary value. Monetary value (in the sense of some abstract value like dollars which no one can use for food or shelter) would need an actual civilization or some settled culture to even make sense. And if some economy exists well then there has already been a 'first profession' before prostitution. It likely would have been agriculturalists, farmers, cooks, builders or anything that actually makes a settled society function. 

And if you're arguing that prostitution existed in hunter-gatherer times as the 'first profession'  - why would a hunter-gatherer woman need to do that? She has all the resources to provide for herself. Systemic poverty that drove women to prostitution simply did not exist in hunter-gatherer times.",inaqu3estion,t2_lw66eez4,3,0,reddit1

For example - the women in my family were expected to be stoic through anything.  Pain, bleeding, childbirth, illness, and work in general.  And I'm not sure if that is a Norwegian-thing or just being heir to a legacy of nomadic, sea-faring, hard-working people in trades and service work. We survived because we were taught to survive, to preserve, to have less, and live with an odd joy through the arts, music, fashion, and invention. 

Plus, my personal realization - every single woman in my family, nonetheless my life had been sexually assaulted or raped back to my great-grandmothers.  And sexual assault was normal up to the 1990s.  We were supposed to laugh it off.  We were supposed be ashamed and keep silent.  We were supposed to be a good sport.  Yet, we survived and persevered. 

(And we remember the stories of the wives that went out west and just outright died. Or the ones that just went mad via farm/ranch work/isolation, hopped a train, and went home to mother. )

Thing is now - women are growing strong of mind, stronger economically, and the world is responding by creating a scenario where educated women MUST be controlled.  And part of that is neutering/demoralizing young men from equally rising to the occasion and being our equals in EQ and IQ or encouraging them to commit violence on some strange trip sexual intercourse is going to transform them into a successful person.  

We are stronger than that though. And we want a world where we can work side by side, focused on our work, and given spaces where we can explore sexuality safely and healthily with men who are smart, healthy, and clear of mind.",BigFitMama,t2_2qgaug3s,13,0,reddit1

The closest people in my life know that it's not just sitting around watching TV all day doing nothing. My husband had a few hang-ups with thinking/acting like I didn't do anything, but somewhere between our second and third babies he figured it out. After a few instances where I've been out of commission (our second spent some time in the hospital as a baby, a couple minor surgeries, and an urgent c-section with our last) and he's had to be the primary parent and home maker, he *really* realized it. He definitely recognizes and appreciates all I do, fortunately. It also helps when I point out that I would have to bring home nearly as much as he does for us to break even after childcare, lost benefits, and outsourcing housework that I wouldn't have time for anymore (unless he stepped it up on that front which would not be a selling point for him). I do plan on trying to find something once my kids are all in school full-time, but that's like 5 years away.

It's all chaos - parents who bring in a paycheck and parents who don't, it's all hard work for the benefit of our awesome little humans, and it all deserves respect and appreciation. My husband and I both recognize that we're fortunate. He has a good job where he works hard that makes it possible for me to stay home, and I get to be here raising my babies. I bust my butt with getting my kids where they need to be, running all the errands, keeping up with the house, the bills, the appointments, and my husband doesn't have to worry about any of those things.

Saying prostitution is the oldest profession is one of the many dog whistles that are commonly said that is simply not true. Traditional communal societies had no prostitution because when the community is a team and skills/resources are properly distributed, a woman does not seek out prostitution. 

The numbers in the profession were highest when skill training and job selection for women were held back. It's basically men saying, ""nah we're not going to hire you because you have no talent, don't worry we'll give you part of our paycheck for some entertainment"". 

Normalization of sex workers is to not demean women for being in the profession. But it should not be spoken of as if it's a natural and fine career path. Why?

Because research shows it causes significantly high amounts of mental trauma; suicide and early death rates are the highest in the industry. The majority who come from the industry will say they regretted doing it but were mislead on it as youths. Very few are successful in the long term, one of the few cases that I know of from social care that works with sex workers in my city that has 'done well' (in the sense that she saved her earnings, bought a condo, and quit the profession), gets therapy still because parts of it continuously haunt her even though she lives a decent life now. She regrets it because money cannot undo memories while money and possession can always be gained later.

The sex workers on Reddit or ones that are mentioned seem to be the 1% because apparently the majority of them do not suffer mental trauma, live great lives, and the majority of their customers were lonely nice men who simply wanted someone to chat with. That also reminds me of an old classmate as a teen who, I'm sure many have met the type, routinely engaged in promiscuous behaviour with older men and said she was fine, how she was normal and simply more mature than the other girls (because that's what the guys told her). Yeah, she had some issues.  

Redditors love to make it seem like a normal profession. Guess why? Because even if they are awful people, at the end of the day they can give you $10 a month to see you naked. It's become so normalized that high school kids 'joke' to their female classmates to get an OnlyFans account.

The woke movement has become so strong that I think now, more than ever, it is important to watch out for people who pretend to be an ally but have ulterior motives. An evolution of the 'nice guy'.

These sex workers face discrimination and abuse from all other women as well, from homeless women who don’t want to share bathrooms with them to women like the ones here, who are so anti-porn and anti-sex work that they don’t want them housed in their communities or hire them at a regular job.

However, aiming to destigmatize sex work for the benefit of current sex workers also ultimately helps ex-SW'ers/SW'ers looking to leave sex work because, if there's less stigma associated with SW overall, they won't have to struggle with discrimination when trying to find employment, housing, what have you.",TomatoesNRadioWire,t2_17d1bb,2,0,reddit2

The idea that all sex work is always an undesirable fate that women are stuck in out of desperation and that literally any non-sex work job would be better for them is something they try to steer away from suggesting. Historically, efforts focused on getting people out of sex work mean that problems that could be fixed about being a sex worker are ignored in favor of just trying to remove people from the situation entirely. 
  
The goal of destigmatizing sex work is to make it so that it will not be seen as a shameful/immoral thing someone did in the past that would make it hard to get another job. It is also to make it so that people who still want to be doing sex work can advocate for their labor rights. It is also to make it so that people doing sex work in any situation can be open and vocal about their needs and their experience. 
  
Your suggestion that sex work advocates focus on making it illegal discrimination to deny someone a job for past sex work is not really gonna be helpful when full service sex work is still criminalized or partially criminalized most places, which is usually the legislative priority of advocates.",Slime__queen,t2_4e3d0tzu,5,0,reddit2

Professional actors (women) and professional adult stars or exotic dancers are respected more than amateur porn artists, cam girls or Only Fans creators. Sex workers, they are somewhere higher up the scale than amateur creators.

This is primarily because, the professional environment that comes with a proper club or adult entertainment studio has many people working to produce content, distribute and market. In this journey, the artist themselves are just playing their part and hence, considered professionals in the minds of the common folk (both men and women alike) and they won't try to talk about it or get into their pants (except real sleazy ones, but they are the scum.) 

Now, when amateur stuff comes up - they are in a non-professional setting, as in - they are making content in their homes or with their partner and this is someone they know, and this exhibitionism is a turn off for majority of the population,... and these tend to take advantage of the voyeuristic tendencies of the general populace who are the avg. clients of the professional porn studios (industry). These invade normal social spaces like twitter, Reddit, Facebook in a bid to market themselves and thereby 'poison the well' for everyone in the room. 

Escorts are respected more than call girls or prostitutes (via pimps or roadsides) because, there is a professional structure that ensures the interests on both sides are secure. 

So, here - the professional stuff pays lesser than the new age content creation, for - there are a lot more folks to be paid, like marketing team, film making team, website management, database etc. Also, these do not violate general/ normal spaces.

Thus, by keeping adult work and personal adult life separate, society is willing to accept them as hardworking people and meanwhile the amateur ones are disregarded as lazy, poor decision making and susceptible to mental health issues or substance abuse that is ripe in the field and thus, ignoring them. 

The men and women on the right may cry 'everything porn is bad' but they do see the merits of adult entertainment in private spaces. They won't chase away a professional porn actor who might live in their street or judge them harshly or see them as immoral, but they would definitely, when they find a 'sex tape' or 'only fans'... and try to stay away and see it as dirty.",Olivebuddiesforlife,t2_8mac6g6c,1,0,reddit2

jdmbic8,t1_jdldh7c,2023-03-25 13:39:29,TwoXChromosomes,"I don't know if I buy only 1% of sex workers don't have trauma from being in the profession. I'm a former escort/kink worker, I knew a decent number of women in the industry, most didn't have horrific experiences. And while I believe the numbers you shared here - why wouldn't I? - I think a woman's experiences heavily depend on what age she started, whether she worked independently or worked for someone else, how heavily she screened clients, whether she was in a workplace that allowed her to say no freely, etc.

A woman who starts young, works for someone else, and doesn't feel she can say no to bad clients is imo far more likely to have a horrid experience than someone who starts older, works independently, and says no quickly and easily. Your earliest memories of sex should not be people paying for it. Having a boss or being in a financial situation where money is prioritized over your well-being is incredibly damaging.

I left the field because I got bored and wanted a normal life. But I really enjoyed the 5 years I did it. I never had more free time, I made a lot of money, and I was very picky about clients. Once you have regulars you trust it's really not a bad gig. And I got a glimpse under the social masks people wear which was fascinating.

I do agree there's a hyper-normalization of the field rn; for whatever reason I honestly find the OnlyFans thing horrifying. I'm happy for the women who make bank off of it, but they're rare; I hate that it's seen as a normal option for super young women to put up explicit videos of themselves. There's nothing *wrong* with it, per se, but videos can be out there forever. I liked escorting because it was private; no one who knows me now would ever guess I used to do that.

I'm conflicted on my attitude because part of the reason I'm worried is women are shamed for sex work. We shouldn't be. Most people watch porn but God forbid someone they *know* does porn, and you can't even have a conversation about how ridiculous that is because the double standard is so deeply ingrained and everyone just responds, ""I like movies and I wouldn't date an actor!"" like it's the ultimate gotcha. Our societal attitude toward sex is just fucked, and tbh I would argue people assuming sex work must be traumatizing is part of that attitude.

Can you show me where it says that? I've been googling around and I can't find anything that says that. 

There's been a kerfuffle around people asking that, because being a sex worker is not illegal in Canada (although using a sex worker's services is illegal and so is pimping/procuring), people in Canada who were prosecuted for performing sex work should be allowed to have their convictions expunged. Since they were prosecuted for doing something that is not illegal, should not have been illegal (this is definitionally true in a _legal_ snese, since it was legalised, but you can argue the ethics of the statement) and carries serious stigma, many argue they should be allowed to have their records wholly cleared, as if the prosecution had not occurred - i.e., expunged. 

As a result, though, someone who was prosecuted for sex work (even if they should not have been) would not be allowed to work with children, because they would have a criminal record for a non-whitelisted offence. This isn't specific to sex work: someone who has a history of shoplifting or who purchased cocaine in college would _also_ be barred from working with children due to their record.

This is a false equivalence. Prostitution rewards the idea that women are sexual objects that men are entitled to buy and use the same way they buy and use objects they find on store shelves. Arguing in favor of legalizing prostitution is arguing that men have the right to buy and use women, and honestly women deserve better. 

When we are talking about prostitution we aren't talking about a service like providing child care, or nursing, we are talking about commodifying women's consent and pegging it to a price. In other words, creating a trade where the product is the woman's body and consent, and imposing a capitalist competition where women will have to compromise and endure acts against their will because otherwise they'll lose their livelihood as there will certainly be another woman who'll endure what another can't endure and drag the bar even lower.

Finally, I believe that it's blatant hypocrisy to pretend we're against the sexual objectification and degradation of women, and still support an industry that is based on exactly that.",shedernatinus,t2_4xgvt5z3,30,0,reddit2

This is not me justifying the commercial exploitation of sex workers. This is me saying that feminism must be visionary and socialist to achieve meaningful change in the material conditions of women: it's capitalism that is the problem here.

Having women in top positions of business and right wing government is better than nothing, but it doesn't solve much for poor women. Neoliberal feminism is toothless. Women will always be sexually exploited in a world where workers are exploited. Rather than deny sex work is work, putting sex work in scare quotes as the OP does: fix the conditions of work. Sex workers could be in a worker-owned cooperative rather than be exploited by a gig economy. So could taxi drivers.

Hence solidarity is needed between workers, trade unions, women. There's a reason why socialists seek broad coalitions across oppressed groups.

1. The primary reason they are trapped is that alternative jobs are not present.

2. One of the main reasons they cannot get a different job is due to the extreme social stigma around sex work meaning that other employers are unwilling to hire them. 

3. One of the other main reasons is that people who are trapped working as a sex worker without the ability to pivot to a new career is that they lack other marketable skills. This is largely because they are often unable to get tertiary education. 

4. A huge barrier to attaining tertiary education is the financial costs imposed on students. They are typically required to take out loans, and prospective mature-age students can't take out those loans if they don't have a documented income.

5. The primary reason they do not have a documented income is because they are working cash-in-hand in an illegal or stigmatised industry that is either legally unable to accept non-cash, documented and invoiced payments, or because they work in a legal-but-heavily-stigmatised industry that banks and credit card companies refuse to permit to use their resources because of the social stigma and fears of money laundering. As such, they are unable to take or deposit most payments and thus are stuck earning, paying, and living in an entirely cash and in-kind economy, without the ability to document their income and thus provide evidence that banks and lending unions need to grant loans. 

So...

1. The stigma prevents them getting entry-level jobs in non-sex work-related industries.

2. The financial hurdle to gaining above-entry-level jobs primarily stems from the stigma associated with sex work.

3. The first two points trap them entirely within a cash and in-kind economy that essentially locks them into a grey market or black market life, which prevents them ever leaving sex work. 

I didn't even mention that the sex workers who do _not_ feel trapped:

* Tend to be native-born citizens of the country in which they work 
* They tend to be working in a country with a well-developed, post-industrial economy
* They are often white or white-passing
* They universally either work independently, or have legally-enforced employment contracts with brothels and other legitimate businesses that grant them employee and union protections under law.

So... they're the people _who are least affected by social stigma, and are most able to avoid exploitation.

If you don't speak your nation's primary language very well; if you are unaware of your legal rights - or, worse, you are an illegal resident who _has_ very few rights to know; if you are of an ethnic or cultural minority that is _already_ very stigmatised; or if you are working under a procurer or ""pimp"" who abuses you and against whom you have little to no legal recourse... then you are one of the people who is likely to be exploited. 

The reasons for this is clear: 

***Those are the groups that suffer from social stigma.***

When you remove the stigma of sex work and normalise it as ""just another job"", then you allow - or even _force_ - banks and lending companies to legitimise working with you. You gain a means of escaping the cash and in-kind economy and moving into an economy that allows for you to take out and repay loans and access government and private services, which VASTLY improves your chances of not needing to work in illegal, black market economies anymore. 

When you remove the stigma of sex work, when you normalise it, and when you use that social acceptance to construct **legislative regulations on the industry**, then you cripple the market for procurers' services. This grants employee and union member rights and protections to sex workers, which extends the full arm of the law to them for them to pull themselves up and start kicking the shit out of anyone who would try to exploit or abuse them. This makes it very difficult for black market employers - i.e. procurers - to trap their workers, removing their leverage over their employees (""if you don't obey me, I'll share with people that you're a [slur] and you'll lose your friends and family"") while ALSO granting a great deal of leverage to workers (_""if you don't stop abusing me/don't let me go, I'll report you to the police and have you arrested for abuse, and I'll prosecute you in civil court for stolen back-wages and embezzled funds""_). 

When you remove the stigma of sex work, providing legal protections and normalising supporting _trafficked_ workers over abusive black market employers, then you encourage victims of human trafficking to come forwards and report their abusive slaveholders to the police. They will know that they will not be punished for being victims of human trafficking - as, unfortunately, many currently are today - and will instead be treated with respect and care and potentially given access to humanitarian or refugee visas. You will normalise the idea that people who are, themselves, locked into a grey or black market economy can come out and escape that trap, especially if they've been enslaved and locked into it without their consent at any stage of the process. 

---

Basically... **legalising and normalising sex work as ""just another job"" facilitates women and girls leaving that industry, whether they were in it voluntarily or ESPECIALLY if they were in it involuntarily.**

So much of the leverage that human traffickers and slaveholders have over their victims comes from being able to tell the victims ""if you leave and report this, you'll go to prison. Even if you don't go to prison, now everyone will think you're a [slur] and you'll lose everything. You'll have no friends, no family, and nobody will ever give a [slur] like you a job again. So don't report us, don't run away, because it will just hurt you more."" 

That is the LITERAL PRIMARY TOOL that human traffickers have on their victims: the idea that if they run away or report their abusers, then the victims' lives will also be over. 

**The only reason the victims would be hurt is if sex work were so heavily stigmatised that even involuntary victims are judged as morally unclean... which is what our current society believes.** 

**This is a _fucking outrage._**

Legitimise sex work. 

Legislate sex work. 

Let go of stigma. 

Lock up abusers.

Normalisation is the best path that workers have to being able to leave the industry when, where, and how they want to, and is the best path to avoiding and shutting down abusive or exploitative practices when they're found.",jan_Apisali,t2_t5cs12og,24,0,reddit2

I’m saying men’s ideas about how they can treat women are the same and exist in different forms in several contexts, not just sex work. I am a sex worker. I obviously know the difference between your boundaries being violated in that context vs others. I’m saying the reason they think they can violate boundaries is something that is not unique to sex work and exists in other contexts.

Why is it impossible to conceive of sex workers being seen differently?

So few ""omg sex work is evil and must not be normalised"" people are willing to engage with the extremely fucking important fact that it's a fundamentally economic problem. They haven't got an answer to someone who presents actual legitimate economic points, it's just that sex work squicks them and they don't like it on principle so they choose to try to invent arguments about how it's actually helping women to keep the stigma around an industry that predominantly employs women.

They don't like porn or sex work for whatever personal reason, who cares. But they decide that their opinion is actually a fact, and will invent reasons to ignore legitimate counterarguments because they never want to accept that it might be better, overall, if an industry exists and is economically incorporated to align incentives in favour of employees. 

It's a real ""perfect is the enemy of good"" vibe. They're chasing for a perfect solution that means porn and sex work are removed from the earth and also that no women are ever hurt again by it and also that everyone gets a free ice cream. They just aren't willing to accept that _all industries feature exploitation._ Charity non-profits are some of the most exploitative companies of their workers out there. Vegan, ""anti-cruelty"" companies use non-renewable resources because they can't afford or don't care not to. Oil and gas companies, that absolutely pillage the Earth for profit, nevertheless pay extremely well and are often responsible for building whole communities from the ground up. _Nobody is pure good or evil._

Sex work has a lot of problems. But, all industries do. The solution is to regulate and manage, not to try to ""fix"" it by just demonising anyone who works in that industry as dirty and bad and criminal at worst, or a poor useless helpless victim at best. 

If you work in mining, then you risk being crushed in a landslide; if you work in sex work, then you risk being exposed to STIs, for example. Industrial accidents happen, often due to negligence on the part of management or the employer or the client, no industry is safe from this. But if your mine is an illegal diamond mine, then you are infinitely more likely to be beaten to death for dropping a shipment because your boss has no legal framework to restrain them from killing you. If your sex work environment is an illegal, unregulated brothel run by a drug-dealing pimp, then you are infinitely more likely to be beaten to death for not doing as the abusive employer demands, because your boss _also_ has no legal framework to restrain them from killing you. 

Exploitative industries are not exploitative because the practice itself is irredeemably bad. They're exploitative because _many humans will exploit if not prevented from doing so by the rest of us._ We fix the exploitation by regulating the industry, not driving it further underground, further away from the control of social rules against abuse and mistreatment.

We treat this like an economic problem, and it gets solved. Yes, some people will still be hurt. Some women will still be exploited more than men. Some people will profit off the sex work of others while disrespecting or mistreating the workers in their employ. _But it's better than that happening to everyone._

We don't aim for perfect. We aim for ""better than now"", and we never stop aiming. One day, we might reach perfect, but we'll do it by improving on a system that's already much better than the one we have now.

The truth is, by legalizing prostitution, we are unleashing a devastating storm of objectification, commodification, and exploitation of women's bodies. We are creating a market for the sale of women's flesh, where they are reduced to nothing more than sex objects to be used and discarded and abused at men's whim.  
  
The truth is, by legalizing prostitution, we are feeding into the toxic and degrading idea that women's bodies are mere commodities for men to purchase and consume. We are allowing for the creation of red-light districts where women are displayed like pieces of meat in windows, their humanity completely discarded.  
  
The truth is, by legalizing prostitution, we are perpetuating a culture of sexual entitlement and disrespect towards women, where men feel justified in using and abusing women's bodies for their own pleasure. We are turning women into nothing more than vessels for male gratification, denying them their right to dignity and respect.  
  
The truth is, by legalizing prostitution, we are creating a fertile ground for the trafficking of women and girls, where they are bought and sold like animals to satisfy the demand of men's sexual vices. We are enabling the exploitation and abuse of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.

jdlly8r,t1_jdlgoma,2023-03-25 08:34:26,TwoXChromosomes,"Studies showing increases in human trafficking ought be interpreted carefully. Evidence of a statistically relevant increase is obtained without regard to any other metric. Cutting the rate of trafficking with policies that result in significantly worse conditions and far greater risk for the remaining victims is not an improvement. 

There's also the reality that trafficking for sex work, especially in western countries, is complicated. To my knowledge, no studies attempt to characterize the increase in trafficking by how it functions. The unfortunate reality is that due to labor laws, coercive conditions in 'regular' work are not considered trafficking, when the same conditions applied to sex work are considered trafficking. A shitheel of a boss who exploits a persons poverty to get away with persistent wage theft and other such exploitation to coerce labor would not be considered trafficked. How much of the increase in trafficking is simply coercive and exploitive labor conditions is unknown. 

Legalization is also the absolute bare minimum of policy. It would be the equivalent to a labor law saying ""your boss can't have you arrested for not coming to work"". Strictly better than the alternative, but would do very little to actually protect you from exploitive conditions. Legalization of prostitution does not give sex workers easy or any access to the legal tools to prevent and punish exploitation. If you work retail and your boss doesn't pay you, there are goverment agencies that will take it out of your bosses hide with extra, and then proceed to heavily audit their books to find more issues. If working conditions are unsafe, Health and Safety will tear them a new asshole over it.

I’m assuming your entire framing is due to a lack of understanding of the issues and not malice. Feminists have been working on these issues for many many decades and there has always been work done to transition women out of the sex industry. I know because I’ve spent my career in non-profits and in government working on poverty, homelessness and women’s issues. I have literally been on the ground with the most marginalized of women, seeing and hearing how inadequate public policy and public stigma impacts them.

They are paying me for a *service*, which is to stop on their dicks with high heeled shoes, and occasionally smoosh tomatoes and grapes under my toes.

> Isn't it strange that the attempt to normalise 'sex work' has focused on normalising porn and prostitution

Firstly, sex work in quotes here unnecessarily to delegitimize it. Sex work is a real thing, no? By delegitimizing it you are stigmatizing it. Sex work is work. It does not need to be in quotes. Secondly, it’s disingenuous to say that the movement is in “normalising” porn and prostitution. These two things have always existed, like it or not. You are framing both as being deviant when you decry the work to end discrimination as “an attempt to normalise” when you full well understand that the intent is for decriminalization and legalization. Again, this is stigmatizing of not only sex work, but those of us actively trying to make conditions better for women.

> Shouldn't the social movement that professes to support ""sex work"" be focusing its efforts on any woman from the sex trade being able to move freely into another well-paying career?

Your coy positioning of this as a question is insincere, as there **is** actual work being done to transition women out of sex work, and that has always been going on. I have informed you of with this several times. And by the way, it’s not about moving sex workers to “well-paying careers” but to any other job where they can earn an income to support themselves. Not all sex workers make a lot of money either (the ones I help are housing-challenged) and they’re not waiting for lucrative job opportunities to leave. 

> Then we can start talking about how it's a free choice, but not before that day.

And here we have the cherry on top. You announce that you are absolutely ok with the current state of things, where both men and women like yourself can continue stigmatizing sex workers, refusing to change your own discriminatory views and refusing to yield to any social progress to help until *you* deem it acceptable on your terms. You’d rather continue forcing sex workers to the streets than actually giving them the tools and opportunities to leave. Do I need to connect the dots more for you so you can see your own prejudice?

> No shit, but my job involves going to my desk at 9am, not performing unwanted sex acts? Disgusting comparison.

They act this way because they don't view women in prostitution as humans, they view them exactly as I described earlier. They come to women in prostitution with the preconceived idea that what they're going to do is pay an amount of money to have access to a woman's body and the more they pay the more depraved their requests become.

Why is that ? It's because prostitution is about men buying sexual access to women, and the fact that a woman in this environment may talk back to them or have requirements is something they take very personally.

However, In case moving isn't an option, I'd suggest speaking to one's manager in a very fact forward conversation. It helps them realize biases they didn't know they even had.   
    
Case in point, I wasn't forwarding the promotion nomination for someone who reported to me. I just ""felt"" he wasn't ready. At this point, he had a super mature conversation along the lines of. ""I thought I'd share my work summary so far with you so that we are both aligned on my contributions."" At this point, I'd mentally rolled my eyes thinking it'll be a vanilla promotion pitch.   
    
However, he proceeded to give me a reasonable lay of the land and took the feedback I gave attentively. Then he pulled the coup. He asked, so now we both agree on his role, ""Tell me what else do I need to do to get the next role?"". At this point, having gone through the journey, I realised that I had a hidden bias arising out of his ""supposed"" inexperience. He is a high performer and ahead of his peers in terms of contribution. I was being an subconscious ageist!

ey2gg6e,t1_ey26wna,2019-08-25 13:11:52,TwoXChromosomes,"If telling them would do any good, wouldn't they have listened over the years that the question of advancement or title was asked? ;) The one difference I can see is that yes, now that it's being said on the way out, she can just flat out say ""I feel like you denied me the things I asked for politely and proved myself worthy of *simply because I'm a woman*. Is that the case?"" I would lay money it's just a case of good old unconscious bias. And yep, that's why. In that case, bringing it up might do some good for those people down the road. I think that's more likely than a direct plan to deny her advancement because she is of the uteriferous gender. 

I don't want to sound harsh or anything, but this sort of stuff has been a major league frustration in my life. There are a couple situations where I just want to lay that right out there and explain my side of it and flat out tell two particular parties in my past ""this is why it was all so bad, I'm going to explain to you exactly why this all went down this way"". The question I usually ask myself before conversations like that is ""will this be constructive?"" In this case, the catharsis and feeling of closure from just laying it out plain for them will probably serve as a good touchstone for her going forward. I said it, I moved on, I was confident and I can do this again if I have to. There is a small chance they will learn something, although I generally find if people are capable of learning from that kind of conversation they wouldn't do the dumb shit that makes the conversation necessary in the first place. 

In both cases for me, I didn't burn bridges or flip out like I really really wanted to. I was a pro and just got over and got on. In both cases, the people on the other side had a virtual laundry list of other people who felt exactly like I did. Which is why they either left the research group, left grad school early, switched advisors, or in the second case moved on from that workplace. 

I dunno. Sometimes I have had to balance the need to tell people against this simple question: *if this person was smart enough to understand me explaining the situation in detail and reasonable enough to change, wouldnt they have not been a dicknut in the first place*? When people can only magically see that maybe they should do it different as you're walking out the door as you have given them many chances to shape up and act right, they generally arent very likely to be smart enough to correct shit going forward. After all, the next time it comes up, would she have to threaten to leave again? ;)

Sorry. this particular subject is a real fn burner for me. I am still in therapy roughly two years later still working through some of these things. People who can only realize shit as you're heading out for the territories, fuck em.
