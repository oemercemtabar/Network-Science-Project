I suspect that this is much less true than is commonly believed. In most places where housing is unreasonably expensive, building is NIMBY-constrained.

Two things to consider:

1. Surely the field in which these students receive education matters? Medieval French literature is interesting, but does it measurably improve productivity? If all these extra students choose useless majors, the productivity does not increase.

2. You have to take opportunity cost into account. Studying at a university means that you spend about 10-15% of your career not working. If a person hadn't studied at university, perhaps they would have learnt a trade, or learnt on the job, or whatever; certainly they would have produced something during these years.

Your example is letting a person voluntarily work for someone else, in an exchange that makes both affected parties better off (they immigrated here most certainly because the alternative was worse, and the hiring individual clearly wants their labor more than their money), and does not take wealth from anyone.

How are those two examples even comparable?

And for what it's worth, as a Dem, the primary reason why I support expanded immigration, first and foremost, is because I think it will make the world better off. The issue is, a non-insignificant number of people are heartless bastards, so if you try to tell them that immigration makes the immigrant's life better, some people will say stuff along the lines of ""I don't care about their life. They aren't American. They can die for all I care."" From there, one must argue to those potential voters that immigration does more than help just the immigrant, but also benefits them personally. That's where lines such as ""Who would mow your lawn then?"" end up coming into play: They are a lot more effective than getting an indifferent person to humanize.

And then, of course, people like you come along, and grasp on to only the last part of the argument, and say ""Hah, I knew those Dems were just as heartless as the people they criticize. Look at them, they just admitted they are only doing it for the mowed lawns. Guess they don't actually care about the immigrant."" From there, of course, us Dems must backtrack and clarify that we care about the lives of the immigrants too, upon which the indifferent folks say ""Woah, first you were talking about how this would benefit me, and now you are talking about humanity and shit. Guess I don't care anymore."" And then we must backtrack again.

Economists have mixed beliefs about student loan debt forgiveness. It is basically a big give away to people who are rich, not to people who are poor, and economists tend to think the rich shouldn't get handouts. 

As well, your argument against student loan debt relief is the same one made by student loan debt relief proponents: you can boost GDP by consuming more. This is an argument often made, especially those invoking the Keynesian Cross. That isn't a model of economic growth!

The symptom is ""lots of people can't afford college"". Making tuition tax subsidized is treating that symptom. But the actual problem is ""college is really expensive, much more so than it used to be"". The better solution to paying for everyone college tuition is fixing the underlying problem and only paying for those few people who are truly unable to pay.

It's the same thing with healthcare. Medicare for all and/or single payer are treating the symptom of ""most people can't afford healthcare"". But healthcare in the US is one of the most expensive in the developed world. I realize it's a hard problem, and there actually has been at least some research on why this is, but I have not seen basically any proposed policies, by anyone on either side, that are designed to make healthcare ACTUALLY CHEAPER.

Ultimately we’re going to need to find a way to make the cost of doing business cheaper if we want to lower costs for consumers and I believe that’s going to come through relaxing a few standards.",BudgetPea,t2_1s77gxm1,3,0,reddit2

Theres a ""breach"" between the official exchange (about 80:1) that most people cannot access to (Except politicians it seems), the ones that can are limited to 200usd or equivalent in other currencies to which any expense in other currency even if its converted by the company like netflix, counts towards that limit and has an effective tax on it of 65%; Adding to that, anything you earn internationally is forcefully exchanged into local currency (to the official exchange, even cheaper actually because you are selling, and without the tax). Plus actual exchanges like the ones used in bonds or informally (which btw, some freaking how its illegal to exchange currency privately....) have a value that is over double the official exchange without the taxes.

What does that mean? That everything that could bring USD as reserves, be it import/export companies, including software companies and farm sector (which is a huge part of our economy) see their assets halved arbitrarely - not even counting taxes... -  while they have to access the new stuff they need to buy to, you know, keep the business going, at double the price they received (which also has taxes on it).

I mean, what could go wrong, right? /s

 Still some people are ignorant enough to defend this kind of stuff. I mean, iI get theres no reserves and that if they get freed they will go in an instant, but thats exactly because people  fear the local currenycy and theres a breach between the official (Rather artificial, because its kept under market value with public budget afaik) and unofficial exchanges. Besides is not solving anything either. Im not an economist, and I understand that hey are unaffected, and probably want people to depend from the estate to get the populism going and keep getting elected (in the rather stupid voting system that is ""popularity poll"" even), but this hurts the country itself, its completely retarded, and if you hear what politicians say during, after or before (doesnt matter) applying such practices, its also complete hypocrisy.

If something costs $100k and someone says hey I'll give it to you for $5k just bc you don't have enough, you just received something worth $100k for only 5.

Ignoring the fact colleges may artificially inflate prices for a minute, a ""waiver"" is just up front debt forgiveness. If 5 people pay 100k for a car then bigwig politician walks along and the dealership gives it to him for 5k for favorable laws or something, didn't they just basically give him income if 95k? He received a 100k asset for 5k.

Now with tuition let's say this is a big conspiracy to fuck students and put them in debt.

If that degree isn't worth 100k.... Then you don't have to get it? You don't have to go. You can go to a state school or a tech school or an online school and pay a fraction of that. Nobody's making you buy this overpriced piece of junk paper. And if it is worth 100k and they give you a discount, isn't that worth something?

Monetarist theory versus humanity (two open letters to Arnold Harberger and Milton Friedman)*, by a Chilean and former Chicago economics student who opposed the Pinochet regime.

The first part or so of Naomi Klein's *The Shock Doctrine* covers the history of laissez-faire economic policies implemented by fascist dictatorships (with the help of the CIA and US corporations) in the Southern Cone of South America, with emphasis on Chile. Klein is a journalist so it reads well but may gloss over details and isn't an economics book.

Joseph Stiglitz [reviewed Klein's book](https://tsd.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/reviews/bleakonomics.html) and adds some economic context:

>Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies. But Friedman and the other shock therapists were also guilty of oversimplification, basing their belief in the perfection of market economies on models that assumed perfect information, perfect competition, perfect risk markets. Indeed, the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes. They were never based on solid empirical and theoretical foundations, and even as many of these policies were being pushed, academic economists were explaining the limitations of markets — for instance, whenever information is imperfect, which is to say always.",wokewightwonk,t2_89bkn52m,6,0,reddit3

And I digress strongly, although  theres a limit to how many jobs there are during a quarantine (specially in a country like Argentina when it got to silly levels without much else) which means people need indeed help from the state, remember that  a) the amount of public expenses we have is ridiculous it can always be toned down. 

What is the problem? As you mentioned, people starve (part of it however is strictly due to the quarantine side of things done wrong) so of course the need to spend the public budget on welfare is much higher during the pandemic, but its not enough, so what do you do?

Obviously, cut taxes. Everyone pays a lot of taxes (if working legally) and this wealth tax is far from the only one that bothers the population. If food cost less is easier for the population to acquire it than to redistribute money on an already dwindling and poor economy, much much more if you take into account as I said before, the already exceeding tax pressure.

Yeah, sure, you would still need to give money to a portion of the population, but it gets smaller, both the amount of people and the amount needed. This, once again, beyond reestructuring public budget and understanding that less taxes does not mean zero nor it has to be that way forever.

But lets say it works, lets say its enough, everything elsse is ignored... you still loose a very profitable part of the population long term which may offset taking debt as a country even (you never know, and Im not sure what conditions we have in front of the IMF) and it sets an awfully bad precedent that ""stinks"" other investments away even more, as theres no trust.

gd1npo4,t1_gd1kdj3,2020-11-21 11:29:52,badeconomics,"Well, it'd require that you get your land to become, as a property, a certain level of productivity for it to be worth your investment. Consider this. Let's say that the property tax is 1.5% (moved it down by a factor of 10 so it's a bit less ridiculous). You own a piece of land evaluated at... say, $100K. You've built a property that's worth $200K, including the value of the land itself. You're paying $3K in taxes. But let's say your neighbor has an identical plot of land and upgrades and develops her property so that it's worth $600K, including taxes. She's now paying $9K in taxes. So $12K in taxes are being raised, in total, on $200K worth of land.

With a land value tax, you could also raise $12K by putting a 6% tax. Your question is: wouldn't there be a decrease in demand for land? My rebuttal, here, is I don't think so. Because while your taxes increased from $3K to $6K, your neighbor's *decreased* from $9K to $6K. But, the important thing is that you have a proper incentive to develop your land, because you aren't being taxed higher on the increased property value. So it does disincentives you to own land and just sit on it and do nothing productive with it (which seems like a good incentive structure to me)

This is useful for, say, a family that is debating building an accessory dwelling unit on their property.

And people who wanted to live in a single family home with a big lot can do so -- but they're paying directly for that lifestyle (which makes sense to me).",millenniumpianist,t2_z84dq,3,0,reddit3

Part of the huge economic growth of the 50's to the 70's in western europe and Japan was due to the fact that at the onset, everybody was starting pretty much from the same point, giving a chance to the industrious. The same occurred in China starting from 1980.

70 years of unbroken prosperity have increased inequalities up to a breaking point. Being born into wealth guarantees your future, while a full generation of young people in the US don't have much hope to get into adulthood having repaid their student's debt.

Your tax base will reconstruct itself with those who are successful in creating new wealth. Don't worry, they'll manage.


EDIT should clarify:

The goal of a uniform wealth tax ought to be to tax unproductive capital. The rate of this tax should be 1-2% yearly for an amortized return (over periods of centuries) of 2-3%. This way, if you manage to make your capital productive - for yourself and society -, you keep getting richer. If, however, you sit on your wealth and just live by, then you will slowly but inevitably return to the average wealth. Preserving the mechanisms of the free market, possibly getting rid of sales and revenue taxes which are big impediments on undertaking, and making sure the state can afford what it needs to feed, educate and take care of everyone.",thbb,t2_326tx,1,0,reddit3

If we relax that assumption and, say introduce labor market frictions i.e. there are no hitches or interruptions in the flow of labor from one job to the next, it is plausible that small wage cuts will not cause workers to leave a firm, therefore a firm gains market power in the labor markets and gain wage setting powers.

Skill is irrelevant if you are contributing to the economy and helping to make money and keeping the motor running, you are helping to create wealth. 

What is so wrong with wanting people to be fairly compensated at a baseline so they can afford to eat healthier, take their car to the mechanic and fixed it finally, maybe get a gym membership or pay for better childcare or be able to go on a trip with their kids. 

Why are we so obsessed with maintaining hierarchy that we want to make it an impossible shit hole you have to climb out of whilst trying to keep a roof over your head and not get sick and die. Picking yourself up by the bootstraps is an _oxy moron_ it’s meant to be contradictory, not inspirational. Literally go put on your boots and try picking yourself up by your bootstraps because _you can’t._


Corporations have made it impossible for workers to value their own labor. Uber, Amazon, they can afford labor at a wage that would keep people from slipping into poverty, but they just don’t _want_ to pay for it. Well, the rest of us don’t get to control the price of the things around us, yet we’re required to pay it otherwise we can’t have it. 

I’m sick of the argument that raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy and small businesses. 

Want a small business? Well, if you want labor you have to work towards being able to afford that, you don’t get handouts and cheap labor. Sorry, tough luck. 

Too bad it’s not seen this way and working class people are vilified for wanting to be valued as human beings. Why do poor people have to get fucked sideways and live on a knifes edge? They didn’t do well enough in their first 20 years so fuck them for the rest of their lives i guess. 

People  like Ben act like it’s not a zero sum game when it comes to acquiring wealth when you’re at the bottom, someone else having money doesn’t prevent poor people from making more money, 

But they’re the ones who treat it like it’s a zero sum game! Paying people more for their work isn’t going to ruin the economy and make you poorer either, and if it does than you lied about it not being a zero sum game.

I feel like almost too much value is placed on ""skill level,"" as if unskilled jobs are easy. Unskilled jobs can require physical strength and endurance, a willingness to put up with unpleasant environments and experiences. Is there no value in that?

There's the old story about the mechanic.

>A guy is having some trouble with his car, so he takes it into the mechanic. The mechanic sits there for a moment and listens to the car. He takes out his wrench and turns one nut a quarter turn clockwise, and suddenly the car is running perfectly. ""That'll be $500,"" the mechanic says. ""$500‽"" the owner says, ""all you did is turn one nut. I could have done that!"" ""You're not paying me $500 to turn the nut, you're paying me to know which nut the car needed turned and how far.""

So that's a story of skilled labor, but you can flip this for unskilled labor instead.

>A guy's driveway is falling apart, so he hires a laborer to repave it. So the laborer comes in with his truck, and a big asphalt mixer, and a bunch of tools. After only an hour to demolish the old driveway, and three hours to lay out all the new asphalt, he hands the bill to the homeowner.
>
>""$1,000? All you did was swing a hammer and shovel stuff onto the ground, I could have done that!""
>
>""Yes, but you're paying me to put up with the asphalt fumes, to be strong enough to do it all in only four hours, in the hot baking sun, and to guarantee I did the job right the first time, so you could do something you'd rather do during that time instead.""",Kichigai,t2_31nm3,43,0,reddit4

Isn't this Ben's MO. Like, no joke, didn't he write in his book all the bad faith tactics he employs to ""destroy"" liberals or whatever?

 [http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how\_to\_debate\_leftists\_and\_destroy\_them.pdf](http://iii.thruhere.net/misc-files/how_to_debate_leftists_and_destroy_them.pdf)  

>Rule #10: Let The Other Side Have Meaningless Victories. This is a parlor trick you can use to great effect with your leftist friends. Leftists prize faux moderation above all else; by granting them a point or two, you can convince them that you aren’t a radical right-winger at all. After all, everyone can admit both parties are terrible! 

Bad faith

&#x200B;

> The left is wildly intolerant of religious people and conservatives; that’s why they’re interested in forcing Christian bakers to cater to same-sex weddings. They are anti-intellectual diversity, particularly in areas of American life in which they predominate; that’s why they stifle conservatism on campus and in the media. And as for social justice, if social is supposed to be opposed to individual, then social justice is by definition unjust. 

Not understanding the other argument, equivocation (""social""), misrepresenting the other side, ignoring the paradox of tolerance (it is true that tolerant people may not tolerate intolerance, this is not an internal inconsistency)

> the left won’t argue openly for what they would prefer: forcing people to practice medicine for patients deemed worthy by the government.

>What Ben is essentially claiming here is, if you are poor, or need more than one job to pay for necessary goods, that is your fault. What Ben is saying is that workers have incredible amounts of market power and should be able to either 1) select jobs that pay them a wage sufficient for this basket of necessary goods, or 2) demand wages sufficient for this basket of necessary goods.

Looking at/for market power in employers has almost nothing to do with what he is claiming. Shapiro's claim may be wrong and insensitive, but he's not saying it's entirely ""your fault"" (that's just standard leftist reactionary smear tactic to what conservatives are actually saying, and has no place here): he's saying that, the tools to increase one's skill and productivity level are readily available **enough** for just about any mentally-sound poorer person to avail themselves of.

Again, my hunch is that that is not entirely true; but the type of evidence necessary to falsify this claim is clearly not in the existence of monopsonies or undue market power (which should also hurt even more skilled workers, if to a lesser extent); but would have to come in the form of showing that those who personally made the efforts and sacrifices to educate themselves (e.g. take out loans to go back to school) and other very-hard-to-measure factors like ""hard work"" and engagement into that process, still fail to gain skills and promotion most of the time.

Ben Shapiro knows that it's harder for poor people to do this than for people born well-off (who you know, easier risk taking, don't have to worry about living costs while you educate yourself, etc.)

Most of Shapiro's statements are just not worth the time to respond to...but this critique is simply not worthy of the standards of rigor for /r/BE...this belongs in /r/politics.

Imagine that your alternatives are a) move to where there are better jobs, or b) starve to death. This makes moving to where there are better jobs a very compelling option.

Now add a welfare state. If you can't find a job in the place where you already live, or a job that pays enough to support a certain standard of living, the government will provide a subsidy that allows you to get by. You might still choose to move! But choosing not to move no longer results in starving to death, which makes it a much more attractive option than it would have been in the first scenario.

Note that this is true even in a third scenario where the government will give you a subsidy if you stay and a bigger subsidy if you move. You might entirely reasonably decide that the subsidy you get if you stay is enough.

Another possible explanation, of course, which doesn't necessarily involve the welfare state, is that even in places in the US with low wages, wages are high enough that people don't feel a compelling need to move in search of higher wages. Rather than being too poor to move, people in these areas may be rich enough to stay.

My main point, though, is that the ""too poor to move"" story is hard to reconcile with the observation that even poorer people are routinely making even more difficult moves, so that's unlikely to be the whole story.

But the above is a terrible, terrible way of phrasing this. ""Markets decide wages"" is much, much more true than ""firms decide wages.""

He has been very critical of the apparent rise of the alt-right, racism, and antisemitism.

I think he has been pretty good about criticizing Trump at appropriate times, as well as praising him when he has done things that are consistent with Ben's values.

As for Ben's values, I find them to be quite consistent. He has certain principles, like violence is never okay in a civilized society, unless in self-defense. He has applied this principle many times while covering instances of protesting and rioting, no matter who is protesting and who is being violent.

Agree with his political philosophy or not, he does a pretty good job of laying out what he believes are the boundaries to government power. That would take a while to explain, but I remember finding these discussions very interesting when I first started listening to Ben, since conservatism/libertarianism was very new to me.

His general views of how people should treat each other has inspired me to be a more upstanding citizen, and more polite. I used to be a bit of a troublemaker when I was younger, committing minor crimes, but now any crimes, minor or not, that are bad for communities disgust me.

That's pretty related to his views on the importance of strong communities. He says religion is among the strongest ties a community can have, but since I'm not religious myself, I don't fully agree with him there. But he did make me see the importance of community in a different way.

As much as many people dislike his almost exclusive focus on personal responsibility on economic issues, he has motivated me to be much more financially responsible, and really just responsible in general.

I'm just not sure how you can interpret his words as anything other than a statement about mostly past and somewhat present personal responsibility for one's skillset and hireability or ability to start a business or provide for oneself in some other way.

Conservatives tend to chalk up everything to choice and personal responsibility...that's their whole schtick.
People on the left tend to always disingenuously interpret conservative views on choice personal responsibility as selfish, uncaring, ""fuck you, got mine"", which just isn't true, and they chalk nearly every outcome up to social factors completely out of individuals' control, past choices don't matter...that's their whole schtick.

That is where Ben Shapiro is coming from.  He's a smart enough person to know that a poor person has fewer and less-favorable options in the present, than does a wealthy person. Your critique is silly and just plays into the equally wrong thinking of Shapiro's political opponents that personal responsibility is no factor at all, and poor people are completely at the mercy of evil capitalists exploitation of them and the market at large.  It does not enlighten because it does not seek to understand and to falsify on the actual terms and context that subject is operating under.

Edit: his [recent show addresses](https://www.podcastone.com/episode/Ep-840---Solve-Your-Own-Problems-The-Government-Wont) these interpretations of what he said (in response to Kamala Harris saying that no one should *have* to work two jobs), right at the beginning, and basically confirms exactly what I'm saying: that he sees that the market is imperfect and things are harder for poorer people, but that this doesn't mean that present options are zero, or that taking multiple jobs, in the present or past, isn't in many cases exactly how to get ahead.

Decades ago you had to actually qualify for a student loan, so if you were poor, you had a much lesser shot of going to college than you do today. I know that as economically minded people we typically view cost as a barrier to entry, but when 18 year olds can go out and borrow six figures in one day for college regardless of financial background or status then it's not really the same thing as a typical barrier to entry in terms of accessibility.

>And educational requirements for a lot of jobs is relatively new, so there was a time where a person could move up just by being lucky or having some ambition. 

Economically speaking, I don't think that educational requirements are a bad thing. We live in a much more specialized economy now and that specialization has resulted in increased productivity and innovation. 

Also, suggesting that people can no longer move up by being lucky or ambitious is a pretty ridiculous assertion, though I guess you can get away with saying it because there isn't an empirical way to measure it or debunk it.

exd064e,t1_excwx0t,2019-08-18 21:32:33,badeconomics,"What's the evidence that people don't manage risk perfectly responding to labour demand? Well, sticking with the subject, we couldn't use data indicating QoL increases from geographic movement/immigration since on average people only move once the prospective utility increase overcomes their risk aversion. So I don't have data to enrich the conversation.

However I can tell you at places I have worked, headhunters are not valued for the ability to convince people of a prospective opportunity, but rather identifying which networks need to be made aware that such a position is available. Entirely anecdotal unfortunately, although I've seen that in common across SEA.

People become geographically fixed for a number of reasons that appear to expand the mirage of short term utility in lieu of professional development and status. There is often a sunk cost fallacy involved.

How many people do we know where someone turned down a promotion to a new location for an SO only to be broken up with and burn a year waiting for the hiring window again? That was sub-optimal. They made a decision about an easily replaced title, SO, for a job that would have increased their social status and made them a better prospective partner aside from every other QoL that came with it. Risk existed on both sides of the scenario and they chose wrongly.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I don't know how to show the scenario in data. There are many unsignaled job opportunities, particularly out of network, which is most jobs abroad. Technology gets very close to providing frictionless labour movement, but it isn't quite sufficient in minor economies where skilled labour demand can be very high. Visa free travel, green cards, telecommunication interviews, data sharing, all of these things contribute to ease of labour movement.",,,1,0,reddit4

fm3cl3c,t3_fsskb4,2020-04-01 05:31:38,badeconomics,"I'm going to go slightly off topic here, as the incel phenomenon is something I find fascinating. I agree that incel theory is odd and has a huge number of issues with it, but, if we look at the phenomenon, there exists a rational explanation to why incels exist. 

&#x200B;

Let's look at the data:

 [https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/](https://quillette.com/2019/03/12/attraction-inequality-and-the-dating-economy/) 

&#x200B;

 

>A data scientist representing the popular dating app “Hinge” [reported on the Gini coefficients he had found](https://hingeirl.com/hinge-reports/whats-the-biggest-challenge-men-face-on-dating-apps-a-qa-with-aviv-goldgeier-junior-growth-engineer/) in his company’s abundant data, treating “likes” as the equivalent of income. He reported that heterosexual females faced a Gini coefficient of 0.324, while heterosexual males faced a much higher Gini coefficient of 0.542. So neither sex has complete equality: in both cases, there are some “wealthy” people with access to more romantic experiences and some “poor” who have access to few or none. But while the situation for women is something like an economy with some poor, some middle class, and some millionaires, the situation for men is closer to a world with a small number of super-billionaires surrounded by huge masses who possess almost nothing. 

&#x200B;

Or in other words, if you treat ""likes"" as currency, then the inequality in sexual opportunity on hinge is significantly higher then the US economy. 

&#x200B;

In criminology, there exists this idea called strain theory. Strain theory states that society puts pressure on people to achieve certain goals, and when these goals cannot be achieved, people are pressured into five common ways of coping: (stolen from wikipedia)

&#x200B;

>Conformity: pursuing cultural goals through socially approved means.   
>  
>Innovation: using socially unapproved or unconventional means to obtain culturally approved goals. Example: dealing drugs or stealing to achieve financial security.   
>  
>Ritualism: using the same socially approved means to achieve less elusive goals (more modest and humble).   
>  
>Retreatism: to reject both the cultural goals and the means to obtain it, then find a way to escape it.   
>  
>Rebellion: to reject cultural goals and the prescribed means to achieve them, then work towards replace both of them. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at it through the lens of the incel community:

&#x200B;

>Conformity: ask out a large number of girls, follow all the guides on the internet, and hope one of them will go out with you.   
>  
>Innovation: just hire a prostitute man...   
>  
>Ritualism: I can't find someone willing to date me/sleep with me, but I got a friend at last!  
>  
>Retreatism: the /r/mgtow idea. Who needs women anyways right?  
>  
>Rebellion: Who needs sex when you got hentai? I prefer 2d girls anyways!

&#x200B;

If we look at incels through the lens of strain theory: Society is telling these young men that sex is something desirable, and that everyone else is doing it. Therefore, their inability to get laid is creating strain. This drives those men to communities for innovation, ritualism, retreatism, or rebellion. 

&#x200B;

During times of high economic inequality, we aren't surprised to see the emergence of various radical, heterodox, economic extremists. The Jacobins, Bolsheviks, and Chavistas all appeared during times of extreme economic inequality. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, during times of extreme inequality in sexual opportunity like today, is anyone surprised that we're seeing heterodox social theories pop out of incel and/or foreveralone communities? 

&#x200B;

In a sense, it doesn't really matter if the theories don't make sense. I'm going to sound like a communist revolutionary here, but for large swaths of society, ""orthodox socialization"" has failed them. So yeah, they're grasping at straws to explain why the typical advice others give them has failed.",Uptons_BJs,t2_f6gr6,260,0,reddit1

One such case, is when there is an auction for an item that comes in multiple types, where the buyers receives multiple signals. In that case, the seller can be better off not revealing the type of the item.

I don't know what incel theory has to say about it. But its easy to imagine ways that one could send out multiple signals in the dating market: telling Republicans you want to date that you are a Republican, while telling Democrats you want to date that you are a Democrat, telling Christians you want to date that you are a Christian, while telling Jews that you want to date that you are Jewish. If incel theory does allow for W to send out multiple signals, then its entirely coherent. If it doesn't, then there are still other ways for the linkage principle to fail, like when the private information of the buyers is correlated, in that case, its possible for the seller to capture the entire social surplus for themselves, just like Incels think in this model[https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf](https://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/GameTheory2003/Readings/KlempererSurvey.pdf) Maybe there is some other way to prove Incel ideology incoherent. However, you have failed to prove the incoherence of Incel ideology by relying on the Linkage Principle, because it doesn't apply in all cases. I think that what you have actually proven is that Incel's believe that mating markets are auctions in which the seller (the woman) extracts 100% of the social surplus. I don't think that any of them would dispute that. Edit:  On closer inspection, the bit about correlated private information said that there is a way for the seller to extract all the social surplus that they would get as if the bidder's private information was public. In the example they gave, the linkage principle still holds. That being said, there are still other ways the linkage principle can fail besides the one that I have outlined.

It's optimal for W, before the start of the auction and *before knowing the signal*, to commit to revealing her signal once she receives it.  But there is no point at which an actual, individual woman could make commitments to potential partners before knowing her own value.  Rather, the commitment would have to exist implicitly and collectively, as a cultural consensus that people should release verifiable information about themselves, such that people who decline to do so are probably trying to hide some flaw.

But even that only makes sense if the information is *verifiable*.  If an auctioneer's claims can't be verified (and are not trusted for some other reason), and there are no long-term consequences for lying (not true in reality but can be assumed for this model), then there is no incentive for an auctioneer not to exaggerate their claims as much as possible.  This is true even if the auctioneer's item really is of high value!  In this case, it would have to look something like (...ugh, this is so embarrassing to write...) women agreeing to allow potential partners to interview their associates about their personality or something, rather than just making claims about their own personality.",,,13,0,reddit1

No... the real premise is that if you are an incel, you can not have sex, even if you want it. Prostitution is illegal, and no women of your age range (and maybe out of your age range) will date / fuck you.

That is the real premise of Incel, not that a dude doesn't have game.

""signals are positively correlated with values.""

I disagree. Some signals are correlated with values, but in younger people, genes are the most important value until women hit about 30 and then they start to look for marriage material because they realize that genes can only get you so far.

fm4wkmq,t3_fsskb4,2020-04-01 17:28:33,badeconomics,"Women are hypergamous. It means most of them will always go for the top 10% of men, or at least try to date significantly higher value men than their own value (value based on looks, money, status, etc).

This means that if you gave all men more game. It would make no difference. As hypergamy is entirely based on hierarchy. If everyone gets more game, the hierarchy stays the same.

That is scientifically proven to be true.

Incels understand hypergamy. But the problem is they believe that value is only obtained through looks. Since you can't grow taller, widen your jaw or regrow your bald spots, they think they are doomed be remain low value males and never get into the 10% that women desire.

Value and hierarchy amongst men is not decided only through looks. It's also decided through intelligence, via wealth and social status. Wealth and social status can be acquired through intelligence and effort.

That is also scientifically proven to be true. Women, unlike men, are not ONLY attracted to looks.

For some reason incels refuse to accept that you can climb value hierarchy through social status and wealth (ie effort and intelligence). Instead they choose to do nothing and dwell on the fact that good looking men and women go through life on ""easy"" mode, and refuse to make any effort as a moral stance against this ""inequality"".",cannotbecensored,t2_5n0xijif,-5,0,reddit1

What are the incentive structures faced by creators of dating apps? and... to what degree are creators of dating apps incentivised to help their users find relationships or successful outcomes? 

- Given that they are free apps, supplemented by optional opt-in pricing schemes, they are absolutely incenvitised against this. If two people meet on Tinder and then form a long-term relationship, thats customers (and potential revenue streams) that are lost. Additionally, given the business model of app-based products these days, they're incentivised to maximise user traffic (more user traffic = higher IPO share price).

- Conversely, if they were completely ineffectual then nobody would use them. 

- I suspect, though given the matching algorithms are private its impossible to prove, that for men - the incentive is to provide *slightly* sub-desired matches on a drip feed minimal enough to keep them on the app, but there to tease them into purchasing the subscription service.

This needs to be padded out a lot - but this sort of emerged when talking to an old housemate who worked in tech and wanted to create a dating app, and we realised that actually, you don't want your users to find relationships.

The revenue incentives are completely disconnected from the customer incentives. An app or website where you only paid on the event of a successful outcome would be a lot better in terms of satisfaction for most men, I'd wager",HasuTeras,t2_aqp2d,16,0,reddit1

fm5k2hp,t1_fm3cl3c,2020-04-01 20:53:31,badeconomics,"There are a few things here that I find odd.

1. Is Gini coefficient a good summary here? If the top X% of the population have Y% of the likes (uniformly distributed within each high/low segment), then the Gini coefficient is Y-X. If the top 50% have all of it, then G=0.5. If the top 20% have 80% then G=0.6. In the second case, which is supposedly less equal, it's possible that a larger number of people can pass some minimum threshold of relevance (e.g. entering a relationship). I'm not used to thinking about Gini in a matching context, where everyone essentially wants a single high-quality good and extra choice may have sharply diminishing returns past some point.
2. If men are expected to initiate, then you might expect men to signal interest more often than women, who only send out the signal selectively. That's not quite the same thing as who they would be interested in if the other person initiated (e.g. women like their top 5, men like their top 20, both underlying lists concentrate equally). The link doesn't work for me, but is there similar data for responses? How well does the number of likes correlate to finding a relationship? Do women usually go out with people they liked, or someone who liked them first?
3. Is this consistent with other more direct data on preferences? My impression from my own conversations (and I believe some OkCupid study awhile back) was that men largely agree on which women are most attractive, while women have a larger spread. I though the situation was something like the example I gave, where more women get a *high* volume of attention, but more men can expect strong interest from a moderate number of people.

&#x200B;

IE: a 1 year old is expected to know how to sit quietly and not throw a tantrum. A 6 year old is expected to know how to listen to a teacher and pay attention. A 10 year old is supposed to know how to play well in a team, a 16 year old is expected to have undergone their first interview, etc, etc. 

&#x200B;

Socialization is not really intentional for most people. Sure, your dad might sign you up for hockey so you can learn good sportsmanship, and your teacher might assign group projects so you can collaborate, but kids don't intentionally go into these things thinking ""I should work to absorb social norms"". 

&#x200B;

Yet if you're 20 or 30, and you're extremely socially awkward and incapable of functioning normally in society, something must have gone wrong in the socialization process right? The socialization process that seems to work for the majority of society seems to be failing huge swaths of people. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes people have good explanations as to why they never picked up social skills. IE: ""I had a learning disability, so I was home schooled and never had the opportunity to hang out with neighborhood kids"". 

&#x200B;

When you go to incel subs, sometimes you might see is people who turn this failure of socialization into resentment. Either towards a specific individual like ""My mom was a helicopter parent who never let me hang out with neighborhood kids"" or society as a whole ""I moved to \[location\] as a teenager and I didn't speak the language, my classmates bullied me for it"".

And even if it's not a college town apps connect you to ppl closest to you so you'll still have an advantage. Women so seriously outnumber men at most colleges now that being a decently attractive guy in a college town is a once in a lifetime sex pass if you put in the effort. 

The gender disparity has an even greater effect because based on stats I've seen female students are much less willing to date ""townies"" than male students. Men at an elite liberal arts school get to poach not only from their gender imbalanced school but from townies and less elite nearby colleges too. Whereas women at an elite school care much much more about their partner also being at an elite school.

Someone wrote a great article a couple years ago describing a study on dating economics comparing a pretty male dominated school (Georgia Tech) and a very female dominated school (Sarah Lawrence). Despite the male students at Sarah Lawrence espousing much more pro feminism and pro women attitudes than their GA Tech comrades they basically treated the girls they dated like disposable trash compared to GT students who comparatively cherished their girlfriends. The reason wasn't that guys at GT were better it's just they couldn't afford *not* to be better. The gender imbalance made promiscuity unlikely and thus led to much stronger relationship building behavior by guys at GT. They studied Valentine's day at the two schools for example. At SL Valentine's day was no big deal whereas at GT women reported their boyfriends making them breakfast in bed, buying expensive gifts, dinners, etc.

Also at a Uni you basically just have to compete against looks of other guys at same school. In the bay area you're competing in an area completely unique in the amount of super successful young men.

This is an interesting take. I'd say online dating increases exposure, but reduces dimensionality dramatically.

Online, you're restricted to a few photos and a paragraph of text. This means your ability to appeal to the opposite sex is truncated. 

In real life, we have various options to display our potential as mates over a wide range of timescales. Online, you have only two ways: be physically attractive (and photogenic) enough to stand out in a functionally infinite group of men, or be charismatic enough to write something that stands out in a similar way. 

Additionally, a more open dating market, in theory, might create benefits from the top down (where we describe ""top"" as ""most attractive in any given scenario): 

In a closed-off village of 100 people, where social expectations are that you find a partner and procreate, everyone is incentivised in the same way. 

Since resources are relatively scarce (there are only a handful of desirable males) we should expect fierce competition for those males. But we should also expect, once they are off the table, that market participants will readjust their expectations in-line with the remainder of available outcomes (eligible bachelors - or rather, bachelors that look more eligible once their far more attractive peers are out of play). 

Driven by social pressures, people will look for matches to make, enabling less-attractive men to find partners. There will obviously be a bottom to this process, but it clearly extends far beyond the top 2 or 3 men in a village, otherwise we would see enormous levels of celibacy in small, isolated, communities. Historically, we don't see that. I would even speculate that we see the opposite - people in these locations settle down and partner up in greater numbers than urbanites. 

Opening up our little village to the rest of the world is likely to disenfranchise sub-optimal males in the same way that globalisation has disenfranchised a large segment of the working class. 

That hot barmaid Karen who works in the local pub isn't left choosing between the 12 unmarried men in her community - she can travel to big cities, download Tinder, and explore other markets for better outcomes.

For the absolute most attractive people, this creates enormous benefits: not only do they no longer run out of people to bone, but they can also find partners that are as attractive as they are - wherever they may be. 

For the next few tiers of people down, it is probably also beneficial - once they would have been stuck with the best-of-the-rest... now, they can explore other markets for better options. 

Eventually, though, you get to Smeggy David, whose hands are always inexplicably moist, and give off a faint whiff of sardines. Smeggy David has probably been disenfranchised by this romantic globalisation. And the worst thing is - he's probably only half way down the attractiveness-ladder.",leworthy,t2_2956ceaz,9,0,reddit1

> Well you know that wages have been flat except in the upper 1% since 1973. 

This is not true.  

I suspect that Peterson is looking at *household income*, not wages. Household income has been constant, largely because of changes to the composition of households. See [Where Has All The Income Gone](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/where-has-all-the-income-gone) for details.

I'd also suggest looking at [Autor's Inequality Among the 99%](https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/96768), which shows that we have seen increases in wages for the population with college degrees, while those with HS degres or less have not seen changes (or slight declines)

> Why? Well, it's easy. What happens when you double the labor force? 

This is the Borjas gambit. Peterson is looking at how women entering the labor force in partial equilibrium, but has forgotten that they would also consume more. 

> What happens? You halve the value of the labor. 

Peterson seems to think that Y=W*H (GDP = Wages x Hours). This is 1.) incorrect. 2.) causing him to reason from an accounting identity, assuming that GDP is fixed.

> So now we're in a situation where it takes two people to make as much as one did before. 

This is not true. Labor productivity is increasing. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MPU4900062

> So we went from a situation where women's career opportunities were relatively limited to where there they were relatively unlimited and there were two incomes (and so women could work) to a situation where women have to work and they only make half as much as they would have otherwise.

Peterson is missing that women largely moved from unpaid in-household to paid out-of-household production. Hours worked has actually been remarkably stable for women over the last several decades.

Cheaper labor also means more freedom to substitute labor for capital for the firms that can do so, leading again to an increase in productivity.

Also, lower prices means increased quantity demanded, it also means a higher real wage for all workers.

Peterson ain't no labor economist, and has perhaps given another little example of how mavens should beware when stepping beyond the bounds of their own professional expertise.  But this is hardly an unknown fault among *economists* either ... need one give examples?

I really don't understand the urgency so many feel to label JP an across-the-board hack, when he is clearly informed and uniquely persuasive in some areas, just because he doesn't understand labor economics.

I mean, Krugman when venturing beyond economics has produced some true whoppers, but those who call him an *across-the-board* hack are not anyone I'd want to be associated with.  

Damning intelligent people up, down and sideways with *glee* for their finite faults is part of the resurgent tribalism that is costing us all.

dzft2f6,t3_8lcexw,2018-05-23 11:57:24,badeconomics,"Sorry for the noob, it’s been a while since I’ve studied economics.

1. There’s a question of taking of jobs and consuming when women join the workforce, but is there also a parameter of value creation through entrepreneurship? 
More entrepreneurs tend to be men, as men take more risk. This creates a product, jobs, value etc etc
Will the difference in ‘innovation’ lets just say, between the 2 sexes see a change in how job availability of work or price of products grows? 

2. Do men and women consume or create value equally relative to work done?

3. Correct me if Im wrong but if demand increases and women join the workforce, then wages should increase? But what if demand is static and women join the workforce? Wouldnt wages go down?

4. To build off last question has demand been increasing across the spectrum in every industry, or have we seen certain areas with a good mix like say accounting have a slower rise in salaries?

On top of that I see a lot of trying to depict those who agree with him as some kind of second-class trump supporting chauvinistic idiots. I'm surprised to see it on this subreddit to be honest. 

A side note on the bolded text: it is true that wages can fall in some sectors with the entering of women into the work forces, although it is unlikely to have that effect on average .

Well, if women leave the home and work now they need cars and transportation, so we have a massive boost in automobiles, repair services, part manufacturers, tire companies, all of that. The one car family becomes the two car family, and that alone is a massive demand increase. 

And the tasks that women completed in the home were real work that now is either done by both in their free time, or often, outsourced.

Instead of a woman making dinner every night, restaurant after restaurant, delivery after delivery place appeared. All of those jobs. All of that money. 

Instead of women cleaning clothes fastidiously by hand, dry cleaners and expensive washing machines became popular. 

Instead of raising young children, daycare services and services for children got more popular.

Now it's routine to hire a maid to come by and clean your home. It's routine to have pay babysitters and nannys. It's routine to pay extraordinary amounts for daycare.

He is a clinical psychologist and a lot of his work on self authoring program to overcome depression and anxiety I do find to be empowering. When combined with his articulate lectures I find his work on self improvement at times to be poetic, logical, and genuine. His self improvement lectures might not resonate with everyone. 

As far as his other views on college campus politics, economics, and postmodernism, I take with a healthy skepticism. He brought somethings to my attention in regards to certain actions by university administrators I find concerning. But its something I need to explore further before I can come to a conclusion. 

The reason I think he resonates with young men in particular because he is seen as a someone willing to stand up for them. I think young men might feel, whether justified or not, marginalized in certain aspects of modern university and societal settings and he is seen as a champion for them.

dzgjsez,t1_dzfygr4,2018-05-23 18:58:26,badeconomics,"I think there are alternate ways of fueling demand compared to less at-home-production. 

Don't you think it would be a better society 

. if the currently less at-home produced goods were produced at home as we will produce health and well being oriented goods(rather than profit oriented) for our consumption and the surplus produce can be aggregated by e-commerce or other marketplaces(they can be profit oriented) and sold, thus providing money to households and to marketplace businesses but only now households earn the extra money, have also entered the workforce in a different way and are keeping stuff healthier. This whole ecosystem can be supported by enforceable contracts. 

. Also since we are producing certain foodstuffs and other home oriented stuff for ourselves, more income is now disposable and we can pay for a lot of stuff that is being consumed for free(apps like Facebook, Games, etc.). If we were willing to pay $2/month  for Facebook, that would translate to billions of dollars of revenue which they can earn instead of selling our data and earning from ads. 

. The stuff that cannot be produced at home like hardware, software, vehicles, petrol, etc. can be produced by businesses. 

Higher family income and a consumer mindset is required for demand. Just having the money but not having the desire to buy all those things will not fuel the demand. Overall I have a feeling that this whole everybody earning by working at small businesses /corporations /etc. is part of the ecosystem that fuels the consumer mindset.

can you explain a bit more? i still dont understand. the study's argument is that household incomes have declined because the number of people in the households who are earning incomes has on average declined. yet pew states that there are a lot more households who have 2 people earning income than before. so on one hand we have a study which states that a lot of dual-income households have switched to single-income households (i.e. now there are less dual-income households) and on the other hand we have pew which states that there are more dual-income households. this is a contradiction, is it not?  

which sentence is wrong in the above explanation? 

> There have always been two workers in the household. But the advent of the washer/dryer/refridgerator/vacuum/textiles/IKEA have dramatically reduced the workload associated with household maintenance, such that many women entered the workforce.

so with a single income, it would be easier for a family to live now than 'back in the day' because of technology like washer/dryers that make household maintenance easier? please correct me if i am misinterpreting what you are saying. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,7,0,reddit2

Peterson is popular partly because he criticizes social justice activists in a way many people find satisfying, and some of those criticisms have merit. He is popular partly because he offers adrift young men a sense of heroic purpose, and offers angry young men rationalizations for their hatreds.

dzepywz,t1_dzeo6rs,2018-05-22 21:10:27,badeconomics,"I think I've got this, so let me take a crack at this.

Household incomes have declined because the number of people in a given household isn't as large as it used to be, on average. In plain terms, people tend to get married/co-habitate with a spouse/long-term significant other at older ages, or you live with your parents for longer (which would qualify as a family household rather than increasing the number of earners in your household. At least that's how I'm interpreting it). So if more people are legally single or in a family household for longer, than the number of people in the average household decreases as well. 

So in the terms you outlined, the average wages of the individual have increased, but the average number of people in the household have decreased. Thus, the gains of the individual don't quite outstrip the delay of adding/loss of a second earner to the household.

And your second point is a bit off. A household replaces the domestic labor of a homemaker with a washer, dryer, etc., but that stuff costs money. Which should theoretically be seen as income earned by the formerly domestic spouse who is now free to earn from their labor at a job. But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).",ToastedMayonnaise,t2_bpdts,9,0,reddit2

You can test a woman’s preference in men. You can show them pictures of men and change the jaw width, and what you find is that women who aren’t on the pill like wide-jawed men when they’re ovulating, and they like narrow-jawed men when they’re not, and the narrow-jawed men are less aggressive. Well all women on the pill are as if they’re not ovulating, so it’s possible that a lot of the antipathy that exists right now between women and men exists because of the birth control pill.

i still don't understand. 

you seem to have dodged the fact that pew implies there are a greater number of earners in each household on average than before. we see this with the rise of dual-income families and the decline in single-income families. 

also, i dont understand what you mean by this:

> or you live with your parents for longer (which would qualify as a family household rather than increasing the number of earners in your household

are you saying that people nowadays tend to delay working in favor of living with their parents? or that they work while living with their parents? if it's the latter, i dont see how this wouldn't be increasing the number of earners in a family household. 

> or in a family household for longer, than the number of people in the average household decreases as well.

i don't get this either. are family households not a part of the broad category of 'households'? if more people are living in family households than before, that will correspondingly increase the average just as much as it is decreased by people not living on their own/with spouses. 

> So in the terms you outlined, the average wages of the individual have increased, but the average number of people in the household have decreased.

yes, this is what the study states that besttoursers linked. i just dont get how this doesnt contradict the claims made by pew. 

> And your second point is a bit off. A household replaces the domestic labor of a homemaker with a washer, dryer, etc., but that stuff costs money. Which should theoretically be seen as income earned by the formerly domestic spouse who is now free to earn from their labor at a job. But nowadays people will just buy all those domestic appliances, regardless of whether you have that second working household member or not. So it's replacing the domestic labor of a spouse with appliances, which comes from the earnings/wages of a household that are decreased because of the point I outlined above (lower household income due to fewer wage-earning members in the household).

i don't quite understand how my point was off. isn't what i said largely similar to what the implied conclusion is of this above paragraph? how does your explanation prove in a different way than mine that it is easier for a single-income family to live now than it was before?  

or are you disagreeing altogether with the conclusion posited by besttrousers? im not sure if you are arguing that it is easier or harder than before for a single-income family to live. ",yo_sup_dude,t2_opc01n0,11,0,reddit2

Since I am not a Peterson follower, my exposure to him has been limited, and I have only seen several videos of him speaking on YouTube, which is how my impression of him was derived. Perhaps what I saw were notable exceptions to his other, far less articulate material. Perhaps the examples highlighted in the op-ed were exceptions to an otherwise articulate man. I have no idea.

Some easy habits to start that can help you build your confidence. Try going for a walk to your grocery store, and buying some food you can cook yourself instead of getting burger king. Avoid stuff that can just be chucked in the microwave, but things you actually need to cook from scratch. You can look online for easy recipes for beginners and find something that looks good. 

In your non screen time, you can also set an hour a day to work on job applications. If you have never had a job, it can be hard. I would start with basic jobs like busboy of shelf stocker. If you are intimidated, you can find a job where you only have to work one or two days a week, to build up your confidence. 

Also, you gotta start taking care of your higene. Show yourself that you matter by treating yourself well. Every morning you need to brush your teeth and you need to shower and use deoderant every day. This is not negotiable, this is a part of being an adult.

This is a few things to start small with, and you can work your way up to more responsibility when you feel more confident. I also reccomend making a schedule/ to do list to help you get things done. As a suggestion for tomorrow's to do:

1. Wake up
2. Brush teeth and shower
3. Make breakfast at home
4. Spend 1 hour creating a resume and apply to at least 3 jobs online
5. Look up an easy recipe to cook for lunch/dinner
6. Walk to the supermarket and buy food for for lunch/dinner from recipe list
7. Walk home
8. Cook lunch. Wash dishes after cooking.
9. Tv/Computer/Gaming time until dinner
10. Cook dinner. Wash dishes after cooking.
11. Tv/computer/gaming time until a reasonable bed time
12. Brush teeth and go to bed

Kidding. Dude you don't have to change your interests. You like swords and anime. That's fucking fine man.

TLDR: Get a job that puts you on a schedule that fixes your sleep, start slow with exercise, and write down how you're feeling. A letter to yourself.

What you need is a healthy lifestyle adjustment and balance. Like the top comment says, become the hero. 

I'll say proper sleep and physical activity will be the biggest contributors to positive mental health improvements. Once your mind feels better everything else in your life will start to improve.

You'll care more about your body when you take care of it, you'll care more about your future when you feel like it's worth living in it.

Start by finding a job you can stand that puts you on a healthy schedule. I had a friend in a similar situation and he took a job working 7-3 and just being in a regular schedule was huge for him.

You don't need to cut out anime but you need to make sure you aren't binging it hours on end and neglecting other things. Work is a tricky one right now with the pandemic so don't go too hard on yourself. Start small, fast food places area always hiring and are pretty entry level, no shame. Preferably you'd look a job that lets you have stable hours each week. Routine is key. Also learning to accept you can't live in comfort 100% of the time and sometimes we just have to do things that suck. Sooner you accept that the better. If your attention span sucks, try meditating. If you feel unhealthy, start going for walks, ride a bike, lift some weights. Cut out fast food and soda. Trust me when you hit 30 you'll start feeling all the bad decisions you've made in your body.

gpi1w3j,t3_lwfext,2021-03-03 04:43:28,selfimprovement,"This is a guide to life that I have gathered over the past couple of years.  


(DON'T) Avoid these 5 vices, but have an exception for some of them.  
1. Video Games - Allow yourself once a week to socially play, DO NOT play alone  
2. Porn -
3. Drugs - Unless its psychedelics, they help you open up your mind.  
4. Fast food - unless there is absolutely nothing to eat, its time to change your diet up, start counting your calories my friend.  
5. Social media - unless you're building a personal brand/ business, stay off it.  


(DO) Attempt these 5 things (Matt D'Avella's tips, Things I wish I knew when I was 20):  
1. Take responsibility - Create a schedule and stick to it  
2. Confidence builds by doing - the only way to build lasting confidence is to complete that schedule you set out for yourself.  
3. Travel more - build experiences up  
4. Document more - capture this moment in time  
5. Use moisturizer - optional if you have bad acne, I assume you do with eating fast food.  


4 Ancestorial wants - Have a main thing you do for every category, maybe a second thing depending on how bad you want it, this is what I currently do.  
1. Health - Weightlift (Health is wealth)  
2. Freedom (financial) - 9 - 5 & Youtube side hustle (money lets you have the freedom to do what you want.  
3. Love (and be loved) - Hangout with friends, date more (This is basic human emotion)  
4. Purpose - Make Videos about my life/ideas. (This is what gets you up in the morning)  


After all of that, have a direction to go towards in life, my current life direction is to make videos about my life/ideas, learn to rank/monetize my videos and make my Youtube hustle my main hustle so I can quit my job. In 5 years it's probably going to change but aim at something right now. What I would suggest is finding what you are passionate about and seeing if it is monetizable.

gpi4gmk,t3_lwfext,2021-03-03 05:10:46,selfimprovement,"Don’t overwhelm or cloud your thoughts with the knowledge that you need to overcome many, many obstacles in order to get to where you want or need to be. It is SO, so, so easy to derail your ambitions, goals, and plans by not taking baby steps and recognizing when to reward yourself. 

If you are accustomed to waking up at 1pm everyday, make a goal to wake up at noon tomorrow. Sounds trivial, right? Almost too easy. It is important that you work up SLOWLY to the 5 or 6am routine, otherwise you will burn out VERY quickly.

Also, progress is not linear. You will not consistently meet or satisfy your expectations all of the time. This is perfectly normal - so long as you are willing to try and try again, you will NEVER fail.

My other piece of advice is to have a fundamental trust in self. You are a complete stranger, but I already know you have immense potential just by you demonstrating self awareness (i.e. realizing you’re in somewhat of a mid life crisis). I hope you recognize this potential in yourself too, because you can wield immense power with a strong sense of self.

Lastly, read. Reading literally anything (manga, or fan fic, even) will make you a more well rounded person. It also allows you to escape from reality in a way unlike social media, TV, etc. does.

1) Physical Health, Diet, Hygiene

Start getting more active, even if that means just starting with going for long walks. 

Clean up your diet, try to stop eating fast food, junk food and anything processed with refined sugars. You are what you eat. A healthier diet will help with weight loss, energy levels and you’ll just feel better. Your body is probably addicted to processed unhealthy food. This first couple weeks will be the hardest, but after eating healthier for a while you will adjust, and your cravings for unhealthy food will lessen. 

Commit to showering every day or two. Hygiene is important for many reasons. For sure get into the habit of showering.

Also make sure to brush your teeth twice a day. Oral health is super important and something you will regret in the future if you don’t keep up with it now.

2) Job/Career

Its totally okay if you don’t know what to do with your life yet, you don’t have to. One of your early bigger goals should be completing your grade 12 education and getting your high school diploma. At 27 with no job experience, getting your highschool diploma will be pretty crucial to get for entering the job force. 

A part time job is something you could also look into. Anything really, just something where you can gain some basic job experience, take on some responsibility and earn some money on your own. 


If you can afford it I would also really consider a therapist or counselor. Someone who can help you on this journey and work through and fears or issues you might be facing.

I would also probably tell your mom you want to take on more responsibility. Unfortunately it sounds like she has been enabling you to love how you have (probably out of love for you more than anything) She could maybe help you learn some skills (basic cooking, laundry, etc) and encourage you along your journey.",,,1,0,reddit3

As demotivating as this sounds, this thought really taught me how to accept your own wrong-doings, and now to blame anyone else, like before this, I really blamed everyone for example, I used to blam my teacher for not explaining things correctly, blaming my vus driver to leave early, hell, I even blamed the weather for my cold, even when I ate like 20 Ice-creams a day before, blaming people for you leaving high school, I did that when I left my tutions back in 9th grade for the same reason, took me years to realize I always fought back that made me prime target of bullying.

Man, by the time you’re 30, you’ll be a completely different person. 
Just start with small changes. (Not eating burger king as breakfast should definitely be one of them.)

I would recommend starting with these little steps:

-drink a glass water when you wake up and before you go to sleep

-wash your face when you wake up and before you go to sleep

-take a walk around your block after supper (especially after eating, you probably won’t be in the mood but it’s just one block, just ten minutes or so)

-dedicate 30 min/week to clean a part of your house (it’s just a little over one episode, if you think about it)

-cook your own food just once a week (it can be a super simple one-pan dish if you’re not into it or don’t want to do too many dishes afterwards)

These are just very small steps but trust me, you will start snowballing in the right direction as soon as they turn into a habit. And it won’t feel like you have to sacrifice anything at all. 

Here is what will happen with just those tiny changes:
The water will help your body get rid of the nasty stuff you consume, you’ll feel more awake in the morning too. Combined with washing your face, your skin will start glowing and you’ll smell nicer. Compound the 30minutes of cleaning over a couple of weeks and you won’t recognise your room/house soon enough.The walks, aside from the obvious factor that they offer a minimal amount of exercise, will help with digestion and keeping your weight in check and will also help you mentally. They will also motivate you to shower more.

Once they’ve turned into a habit, implement an equally easy set of small changes. Do this over and over again. Before you know it, you’ll be a new person (although you might not believe it now) and it won’t even have felt like you had to put too much effort into it! 

Just don’t start with “now i’m going to exercise 2 hours a day, read five books a week, throw out all my collectibles, never play a game again, only eat salad” etc. That’s a mistake i personally kept making for years and it always backfires.

I also love the suggestions of treating it like an anime arc!

Ps. Swords are cool. Whatever you do, keep them. I’m 25f and have them as well. Especially proud of my Ichigo’s bankai replica. It’s not wrong to like stuff like that.

Being bullied to the point of dropping out is most certainly a trauma and a big one at that. Covid has paved the way for video/chat/phone therapy. It's all I use. There's nothing like being able to be in your personal space where you are comfortable as opposed to sitting in a strange office. A therapist can talk with you and get to know your situation and offer simple ways to turn your life into what you desire. Check out sites like Better Help or Talk Space. They offer chat therapy which may be a great start for you.  I deal with horrible social anxiety. To the point I have anxiety attacks just going to work or going anywhere there will  be crowds. Because of that, I don't have many friends. It's something I'm working on and trying to find people like me who just need a small group of good friends. I'm also into the occult, which as you know, makes it a bit harder. 

I know I wrote a lot and you have probably been bombarded with comments, but I just wanted to say that I think you are doing great. You've recognized and admitted you have a desire to change. That's a huge step. The biggest one actually.

You said you are really into gaming, any chance you have a VR headset? There are a tons of games and experiences to really get your mind right.

As far as jobs go I’d look into something tradeskill or sales oriented if you can stomach how tough it’ll be to overcome any social anxiety you may have. I did this 7 or 8 years ago in the car business and I’m glad I did. Idk where I would be if I hadn’t sucked it up and just tried my ass off. If the sales thing doesn’t sound good anyone can learn coding online and get a real job making real money, continuing coding education is essentially free online so the sky is the limit there.

In other words, believing in yourself is the first step to where your journey starts. 

Like what the other comments say, you are the main character of your story. Google “a heroes journey” and it’ll show you the concept of every single protagonist’s fight for a better version of themselves. You’ll face challenges and obstacles but you’ll come out stronger than before.

Through your journey, you’ll fail a lot of times. Don’t take this the wrong way, it means you’ll have many no’s before yes (like job interviews declines), you’ll have lazy days or bad days where you’re just not in the right mindset to achieve your tasks AND THATS OKAY. There’s no timeline for your journey as long as you try your best. No distractions, just do the work and all that experience you’ll gain no one can take away from you.

I know this because I’m 31 and i also like video games and anime. I also have other bad habits that are taking a toll on my mental health, which is also disrupting my sleep and currently unemployed, so i understand your struggles.

1) Change one thing at the time (and start with baby steps) :  
\- having a sleep schedule  
\- take a shower every days.  
\- do something productive for 15 minutes everyday (or 10, or 5 ) like learning a skill, cleaning, reading a book, doing sport, going outside...

the important thing is to start with something small but that you're able to keep doing every day.

2) have a goal : 

You told us what you have today, and that you want to change. But to know what to do, you need to set your goal, first.  Then split it in few smaller actions you can take to reach it.  
you want a job ? is it possible for you to finish your college with online school ? start to find little jobs to have something to put on your resume ? 

3) take care of your mental health : 

you cannot really force you to live another life if you don't solve the roots of your issue because force can only lead you to more hate toward yourself, and everthing will be HARD. as you said, you've been bullied. is it possible for you to see a therapist or seek helps ?

It's just another thought that'll put you back into that negative feeling that drains all motivation. I'd really recommend looking into mindfulness meditation, there's a really good app on the app store called ""Waking Up"" that has been super helpful for me. If that doesn't appeal to you I'd look into stoic philosophy. Some great ideas in there. 

Besides that, try journaling your progress/thoughts as you move forward and setting up a basic list of tasks for the day in it, only as much as you know you can handle. It takes humility to realize that you may only be able to commit to a very small amount each day, but it's still good to build that trust with yourself. Slow, steady, incremental progress is more powerful than a lot of people think, if you can build one new habit, whether it be making your bed every morning or spending 15 mins a day on a hobby, it'll compound over the next couple of years. Also yeah, from my experience 4chan is full of ego-brains and poorly integrated people so I'd avoid that. Anyway, just my two cents. Good luck man!",,,1,0,reddit3

Things that have helped me in the past change my mental health is to set a regular schedule and keep it(its easier to keep a schedule when you have responsibilities like a job or children) go to bed at a reasonable hour and wake up at a regular one (like 10pm sleep 7 or 8am rise). I also recommend you get a physical(county health can help if you have no insurance) to check for things like a vitamin d deficiency (sounds like you may not get alot of exposure to sunlight) or other issues that can be affecting your physical and mental health.

Start small and try little changes in all major areas of your life every day: health (mental and physical), hygiene, education, social, financial... Don't be discouraged, if you fail to meet your goals some days. Just be better the next. r/NonZeroDay may be a place to start. Document your progress.

1) Shower. More.

2) moderate your consumption. You dont need some fancy diet that cuts out x foods or whatever, you just need to eat less. It will suck at first, you'll be hungry a lot, but your stomach will adjust to the portion changes.

3) any exercise is good. Start with walks and hikes, go swimming, or pull a ""rocky"" and go up and down the stairs a lot. You'll build momentum, a body at rest stays at rest, but a body in motion will stay in motion. There are humdereds of thousands of workout videos on youtube that just use bodyweight, you dont even need a gym.

4) get that GED! You can do it online for relatively cheap IIRC. From there you will have 100x more options to find a passion and career.

5) find people on a similar path. It would be great to have someone to talk to about this and support you along your way.

I have had to very slowly learn how it works but that means that I only know what to do in a very limited set of situations. People give all this advice on how to meet people but never any specifics.

People say you can meet people at the gym. Ok, I go to the gym quite frequently, but how does the meeting people part work. What do I say? When is it appropriate to say something? How do I make sure not to bother people that don’t want to be bothered?

Or they will say to join a club. I’m in a club and chat with the other people every time but I never do anything with them outside of the club and I don’t know how that happens. I assume I need to suggest something but when would that be appropriate? What should I suggest? etc

Other than not knowing what to do, I don’t think there’s actually anything wrong with me. I’m happy with how I look, the few friends that I have managed to make (due to those limited situations where I do know what to do) seem to enjoy spending time with me so I think I have an ok personality. It’s not even being shy either. I really enjoy talking and spending time with people. I am just really bad at getting things started and the unfortunate thing about being a guy is that it’s entirely on me to do that.

All I can do is keep trying to figure things out. Every day I think to myself, what experiment can I try today.

Also I have an experience to share that sums up several of already mentioned points. 

My ex, but in a way the love of my life. He is or was my best friend.
But damn, was he hard to catch. Heavily independent. Never prioritized time with me. And did not share anything that was on his mind. Even as friends now, I have to pull out of him what’s on his mind. It’s really funny. At some points I feel like we’re soulmates and neither of us know anyone like we know each other. But then again, he’s so closed off that I feel like I really don’t know him at all. 
He’s been an amazing friend. Been there on the spot to literally save me on several occasions. 
I feel so secure around him. And sometimes I even feel like I am more ME when he’s around. Don’t know how else to describe it. 
But.. the downfall. Is his closed mind. Sadly, I’m giving him a bit of a cold shoulder these days. I’ve tried reaching out asking what he’s up to, but whenever he replies it’s literally like yes/ no. He’ll never share what he’s doing or even if he’s done something really interesting - I’ll literally have to ask that specific thing otherwise I’ll never know. 
Like this summer he had a really bad bike accident and had to go to the ER. I didn’t know that until I saw the knee would (when it was scab ready to fall off). 

Please, please share what’s on your mind. Your SO would love to hear about your day. Even if you didn’t do anything interesting. 
I guess that’s the story I tried to share. Hope it gives some insight :-) 
Oh yeah, and he’s just a tad taller than me, and that never bothered me at all (I’m 161 cm) also he never showed any issue with his height - but what do I know, he never shares these emotions or thoughts, hehe. 
But the good part about him being this type of quiet is he’s seemingly calm. Always calm. It makes me calm. I love it. 
Now I’ll continue waiting for my bestie to actually communicate with me. It can take weeks before he texts me.. and I’m here dying to tell everything I’ve been up to.",Vast-Seaworthiness-7,t2_7gxt2a8k,19,0,reddit4

hol3pky,t3_rg9ox0,2021-12-15 01:09:20,selfimprovement,"Here’s a couple things:

- get off the Internet and meet people face to face at activities/events (not date) that interest you. Good chance you’ll be around women you are more likely to share things with. Communicating online with women is a fool’s errand because online interaction is rarely genuine. 

- chill down on the texting and actually talk to each other (phone call, video chat, a walk in the park). The whole opening up to others is important but doing it only through text is wack. The nuance you need to “calibrate” the communication is lost when too many people have no clue how to communicate their ideas and feelings well over text. (Frankly, I’ve never understood how texting someone you like is okay but that shit wouldn’t fly if you’d write someone you like a letter. Someone please explain the difference to me)

- ditch the outcome-based mindset when it comes to “succeeding” with women (I’m not gonna lie: “succeeding with women” has an ickiness to it I can’t describe). Human beings and our interactions can’t be calculated and measured like goals. Some times gut feelings can be the best way to go when interacting with women. If you’re gut feeling about someone was off, don’t sweat it. You can’t blame yourself if you’re just going with the flow and not overthinking how you’ll make a woman you just met into you wife in 60 seconds. (But to keep it real, that’s easier said than done for some folks)

- dampen your expectations - be honest with yourself about the women you’re pursuing. Some men create their own grief in this area because they keep chasing after their “dream” woman while completely ignoring the possibility their “dream” woman will reject them.

Found my number, and we started talking for a few days until I asked her out. Long story short, we ended up together for a couple of months, I do believe that I did my best to make her feel good with me, dinners, flowers, long walks and conversations in the nights, laughs etc
Until, whiteout any explanation she ghosted me , I texted her and called her for 2 days, asking if everything is OK, only it get complete indifference. Not a single response. I lost my mind for 2 months because firstly I was really worried about her, maybe something happened to her, and secondly I was hurt. Anyway, after 7 weeks she called me back and the excuse was that she had to work many hours, so that's why she didn't respond to any of my calls back then. I was quite cold with her to be honest, but she pretended that nothing happened. To end my story, it's been 4 months since she appeared again in my life, trying to reach me by calling me and texting me almost every single day, and I might reply once in a week.

hollqj6,t3_rg9ox0,2021-12-15 03:26:01,selfimprovement,"Traditionally men puting women on a pedastoll had nothing to do with a man's insecurity.
It came from several traditions. Chivalry was one. The Catholic churches reverence for Mary being another. Cultural traditions also played a part. For a woman to get a husband, which in the far past all wanted, a woman in most cultures had to be nicer, sweeter, kinder, more loving. Which reinforced the idea women were better, higher and should be put on a pedastool. These traditions entered into culture as a whole and so people are raised with them 
The other factor is that, in most cases, there is a special bond with ones mother. Father's tend to be more pushing and mother's more accepting. It's often seen as men's love is conditional, a mom's (and women's in general) is not.

hola6q4,t1_hol3pky,2021-12-15 01:58:27,selfimprovement,"I really appreciate the part of your comment about the outcome-based mindset!

I think that when people in general, not just men, have this thought that they ""want a partner/SO,"" it's important to realise that that is a strategy, which is not the same thing as a need. So it's important to identify what the need(s) behind that is(/are). I think it's important to understand yourself on a slightly deeper level first, so this way you can understand why you want what you want and I think this can be a better source of motivation. It also helps you to make sure that you are pursuing things for the right/healthy reasons. 

I think the idea of ""succeeding with women"" makes it sound like we are essentially all the same and if you follow a specific set of rules or instructions/do a number of certain things then you will ""succeed."" When of course, in reality, each person is different and there is a lot more complexity and nuance to people. I can't speak for all women but I can certainly say that what I look for more than anything else is to be treated just as a normal person; for a man to be able to see me through the lens of being a person, not the lens of being solely a woman.

How did you originally come to believe that women were magical special people (in your words)? Did you have sisters or a mother, and did they seem magic somehow?

Mostly, I want to understand how people get to that point if seeing another person as on a pedestal. I don't really understand it, other than for people I know well and deeply love - but I can list off all the reasons that they are awesome and worthy of a pedestal. If it is just someone you don't know, why the elevation? Did you ever consider that the people you elevated might not be amazing people worth elevating? (I mean, most people are awesome when you get to know them, but ...)

I volunteer as a guest handler at a local geek convention because I don't get starstruck, meaning I don't freak outbthe guests. People are people, and even celebrities need to eat / whatever. They are just people. So, perhaps this whole thing just mystifies me. I don't understand it, but I would like to.

I also have a giant extended family. My mother has 12 siblings, and she is one of the eldest. It means my oldest uncle is roughly the same amount older than my mom as my youngest uncle is older than me. I grew up with people of all age categories as family, men and women. Someone was an Aunt or Uncle because of who their parents are not because of their age, and sometimes your aunt could be into the same stuff you are. I know that this odd upbringing means that I don't have any fears or qualms about having friends who are MUCH older or MUCH younger than me. I see people as people, they are older/younger because they were born at a different time, and that can't prevent friendship. I also see gender the same way. They stand to pee because they were born male and identify as male, I don't because I'm not. I have gender fluid and nonbinary cousins, a person is a person. I'm bisexual, so even physical attraction is not gendered for me - I'm attracted to the person, and would still be if they changed gender. I have things that I find physically attractive about each gender, but it isn't the gender that draws me in.

But (and this is a big but) at the end of the day, there's things like physical intimacy I cannot give myself, things only women can give me.

Due to the way dating works (compare things like Match % on Dating apps, or compare how often men and women get asked for their phones numbers while being out and about) there's a huge power disparity between men and women when dating and to me  it feels like they sit on their proverbial thrones and judge me (and every other man) against everyone else  they ever come across about whether someones worthy of their affection or not.

So, I guess in very aware that everyone is different but also everyone is the same, and I don't know how to out myself in the shoes of people that forget that everyone poops.

My absolutely terrible coping mechanism is to just remind everyone that I poop. And that it smells really bad. You know, in case they were unaware.

holr6om,t1_holp8oo,2021-12-15 04:10:04,selfimprovement,"I don't think I'm super healthy. I did have a very happy childhood, but not without troubling incidents. I don't have a fear of starting relationships (well, that's a complicated statement, but mostly it stands) I have a fear of abandonment, which comes after you are in a relationship with someone and see each other as equals.

I haven't had a healthy adult relationship in my life, mostly because I had one really long unhealthy one. And to say I don't put people on an emotional pedestal, what I mean is that I don't find them intimidating or out of reach, or godlike. (I do compare some sexy people to gods but I mean it as a description of peak physical attractiveness, not as a deterrent to talk to them. Lust doesn't make me shy. Haha.).

I empathize strongly with most people, but to the point where I spent many years wanting to believe that my emotionally abusive, gaslighting, cheater and habitual liar of an exhusband was working on treating me better. I knew that he had a rough childhood.

I understood why he did the things he did, and I thought he understood how they were destructive in the long run, and that when he said he was working on it and that he could see they weren't sustainable behaviors that he would work to be better rather than just to lie better. I didn't stay because I was afraid to leave him, I stayed because I didn't want to throw something away that I felt we could build on together. I didn't stay because I worshipped him, I stayed because I saw he was human and in pain and (I thought) trying to learn better coping mechanisms. When I realized that wasn't the case I felt used and stupid, and maybe you could say I put him on a pedestal by believing him, but I can't imagine a relationship where you don't have faith in the person next to you.

The pedestal thing I see is in men not being able to talk to a pretty woman, or a smart woman, or whatever because they are intimidated by her without even knowing her. They can't even approach her to say hi because they get too flustered. That sort of a thing confuses me.",make_me_a_good_girl,t2_1iqie3cd,2,0,reddit4

hon7wud,t1_hommowb,2021-12-15 14:01:40,selfimprovement,"Thank you for this perspective!

Another bit of context I should have added is that I am a woman, but I have never been asked out. I have never, as you put it, ""had my number asked for when out and about"". I have initiated all of my (few) relationships. I've never been hit on when I'm alone at a restaurant, bar, or event, whether I'm dressed ladylike or casually in jeans and a t-shirt. I've never had someone who I wasn't already fucking or dating buy me a drink or pay for my stuff the way I hear guys rage about ""having"" to do for women.

So, part of me not understanding the pedestal thing is that I'm pretty sure I've ever experienced being on it, beyond the match % stats you mentioned for OLD.

There's a good chance that I have some personality flaw that I don't see as a dating deal breaker, but which others do. I have male and female friends, I'm bisexual and not intimidated by talking to random people. I just don't draw people's attention that way, I guess. The more I learn about the things other people experience during dating, the more I hope to be able to pinpoint what it is I'm doing wrong so I can work on it.

hqqzl3u,t1_hqp3xv5,2022-01-01 00:36:04,selfimprovement,"I haven’t tried any of these yet so who knows if they will work. What I’ve heard from a lot of people is if you have people that you message but don’t hang out with, just pretend that you are already friends with them and suggest things to do as if you were suggesting them to someone that you already often did things with. Another helpful one is creating groups chats. It’s not often possible but if you do happen to be in a class or club or something where you’ve met a few people, throw them all into a group chat. It probably won’t work but if you are lucky, you won’t have to do so much work because there are multiple people.

I haven’t yet heard anything more about dating or meeting new people outside of the situations I already know how to deal with. I have heard that a good way to transition from someone you only see in person to someone you chat with is to try to remember something from a conversation that you could comment about later and then send them a message about it the day after. I tried this recently with a person who was talking about music they liked, so I sent them a message asking for music recommendations the day after. It seems like sending friend requests you can do out of the blue though if you can’t find them by searching or looking at friends of people you are already friends with, I’m not sure what to do. In this case we were in a facebook group for our club already so I could look at the member list.

I hope this is at least somewhat helpful. I’m still figuring things out and I need to try these things out. They are probably easier said than done.

My goal for 2022 is to be less worried about making friends. Not as in don’t try, but just not be worried about whether any specific interaction goes well. Just treat it as practice. This seems counterintuitive but I think this is what people mean when they say not to try too hard. They don’t mean not to try at all, just not to focus on any one interaction and worry about if it will go well. This will be very difficult for me to do but I’m going to try. I also need to try talking to a lot more people and just going for it and not worrying if I mess things up. Of course I say this every year and it ends up being way harder to do than I imagine in my head since I am quite shy.

Through my experience, once someone finds out you’re taken or are not romantically interested in them, they no longer care to listen to you as a person, a coworker, a boss, anything. Women are viewed as something to be seen and not heard.

I don’t know about other guys, but for me growing up it was the women who had all the power to pick and choose who they wanted out of the gobs of men who would date them. The men would date almost anyone and the women would only date their perceived “best”. I think this instills a pedestal mentality that women are above men since we plebs must beg for a chance to take one of the fair maidens out for food.

Growing up and realizing that being a quality person and man regardless of any woman turned out to be the thing that I had always needed to do.

I want to add some more context:

I'm 34 years old and have been in only one 3 month long relationship in my life. That was 8 years ago, back when I was drug addicted and pretty miserable. The relationship itself was kind of strange because of that as well. I'vee had no success whatsoever dating and trying to find a relationship since I got clean 7.5 years ago.

So I'm sure my perspective is pretty skewed.

I've just recently had a female friend of mine tell me, she joined a new sports team and had 2 team mates of her ask her on a date and then a few days later had someone ask her number while she was shopping, so I was probably wrongfully generalizing from that.

homb5ly,t1_hom2yka,2021-12-15 07:33:55,selfimprovement,">the women who had all the power

I saw this, too, but it was the pretty girls with the vapid gossip that got all of the attention. The ones who would agree with anything, laugh at hikes they didn't find funny, fuck someone out of obligation or because they wanted a shiny new whatever the fuck.

I was skinnier then, still built like a tank, but I had almost equal numbers of male and female friends. I was told I was ""like a brother"" by a number of guys, and they would often ask me to help set them up with my pretty friends. Now, for context, I am aware that I am bisexual now, but at the time I thought all women objectified and lusted after other women. I mean, women's magazines have just as many sexy lady pics as mens ones do! Maybe I gave off asexual or homosexual vibes, I dunno. But it was never me that anyone wanted to chase. Maybe I needed to dress more feminine. Maybe I needed to not be such an awkward nerd chick. Maybe I was too opinionated and fiery. I dunno.

It seemed like I was invisible to the guys who saw me as their buddy. Someone they could open up to, and then laugh and say, ""shit, sometimes I forget you're a girl. You're too easy to talk to, haha"". I didn't understand why being easy to talk to meant I wasn't able to be someone they were interested in. Or how not wearing make-up and de-emphasizing the female aspects of my body with baggy clothes and men's straight leg pants made me less sexy when I was naked (though clearly they weren't even thinking that far ahead).

The pretty girls did have all the power over the boys I knew at that time. But the boys had all the power in the world to slow down and see that they had an amazing friend who cared about them and shared their interests without faking it and had a crude sense of humor and could tell a dirty joke. It was frustrating as hell to have a make friend that I deeply cared about, whose mom knew my name, who I went on camping trips with and hung out with... to have him come up to me, shy and embarrassed looking, sweaty palms, and shifty eyes, and then he'd ask if we could talk away from everyone else.

I'd let myself get my hopes up, thinking maybe this was it. Maybe I was finally somehow able to break through their stupid definitions of what a girlfriend should be - hot and not much else. Maybe I was finally going to be able to let them know that Ioved them without ruining the friendship. Maybe I was finally going to be told that, instead of just hanging out like brothers all the time, that they wanted to *date* me, to take all of our shared interests and philosophical conversations about life or the universe or science or comic books or whatever, take all of that and turn it into an unstoppable relationship filled with shared passions and hobbies.

And then they'd ask me if I could get Cheryl's number for them. Or if I could find out if Sarah thought he was cute. Or whatever.

The bad thing about getting my hopes up was always having them dashed. The good thing about finally seeing myself in their eyes as just a friend, never anything more, as genderless and unattractive as their bros was that somehow each time it was a big enough shock that I didn't cry when it happened. I nodded, I agreed to help, I played my part, did as I was asked, and then walked home in the same stupor. I'd go to bed and just lay there, numb, knowing that I meant the world to them as a friend, but that I would never be more than that. I didn't have whatever it took to make them see me that way. 

So, while the pretty girls may have had the power to choose their dates, the boys had all the power to ignore the nerd chicks like me who were sitting right next to them. Those experiences really solidified the wrong ideas that my mom had taught me about how women have to choose between being pretty and being smart. It showed me that I would never be visible to the boys that I loved, thus I wasn't pretty enough to choose to be pretty. So I ""chose"" to be smart. The one guy I dated in highschool briefly was from another school, had run out of chicks to bang there, and wanted a dirty chick from another school to make his ex girlfriend jealous. It worked out for both of us once I realized I was just a means to and end for him, if he was going to use me I could use him too. Eventually we just... Stopped. I think he got his girl back, the pretty one he really wanted all along.

It helped when I got to university and was mostly surrounded by other nerdy people. It was easier to feel like I might have a chance, especially with massively skewed male to female ratio in my department. Still, I asked out both of my university boyfriends. The one that broke up with me made it clear that I was too much X and not enough Y for him. The one that I left, in the end, was my emotionally abusive ex-husband that I should have left years before I finally did.

I get it. I do. You feel powerless, you feel like there's got to be something wrong with you, or maybe you just need to be fake, or maybe you're just not cut out for a relationship, or maybe you're just better off alone anyway, hey look at all these hobbies you've picked up!

It sucks being the last one to be picked for the dodgeball team, or whatever. I don't hate men for not being interested in a relationship with me. I marvel at the women that somehow manage to be so desirable that they have people flirting with them even while they are married. Female friends complaining to me about how they got more free drinks at a bar, or how some date didn't take them to the nicest place in town when I've never had a drink bought for me by someone I wasn't dating or fucking, and I always have paid my half of everything on a date.

Shallow, sure, to want to have that once. But frustrating to hear the complaints of the pretty friends and have never even had the experience. To *be* that. To *feel* that, even for a day. To know how to be effortlessly desirable the way they somehow are... Yeah, I dunno. It isn't a thing I will likely ever have. I don't blame the pretty girls or the skirt chasers. I just accept that I won't be one of them, for whatever reason, and try to not dwell on it too much, try not to look at myself and try to find the faults that must clearly be scaring people off. 

I'm sure that my exhibitionist tendencies come from me chasing that feeling. I've always had a high libido and a dirty mind, and I know I've always thought about sex a lot more than anyone ever has thought about sex with me. But to feel desired, to feel like maybe somewhere I could get someone to stop and look at me, really LOOK at me... I'm not dead yet, but by the same token, the older I get the farther away that feels. There's just a point at which you say, yeah, I don't think anyone is gonna take a second look my way, even when I'm dressed to the nines. I blend into the background well.

And that's okay. We don't all get to live the life we want to. But we get to choose how we live the life we have.

>They aren’t yours, they’re just yours right now.

This so much, yes. One of the most illuminating articles I read about the misogynistic male perspective on possession of women was on The Daily Beast (can't include a link here, sorry) back in the Gamer Gate days, and it was called ""Your Princess Is In Another Castle"". I had never thought of women as prizes, but that article helped me understand the mentality and understand how media stereotypes had fed into it for years. I had played those games, watched those movies. I didn't see myself as a prize because I saw the entertainment as stereotypes, not reality. But when seen through the lens of ""this is how you get someone to like you"" it made a lot of twisted sense.

This is all the more amusing because I have a service submissive side of myself that craves ownership and being possessed, while the more independent and rebellious side of me rejects the idea that another person can even be possessed.

If nothing else, I think we can all agree that humans have made a big complicated mess out of sex and relationships, where animals seem to just do what they need to in a moment. It looks so easy.",make_me_a_good_girl,t2_1iqie3cd,9,0,reddit4

Ha, well, I've just found poor substitutions and convinced myself that it is enough to survive on.

Want to have that ""bed is warm because someone else is sleeping in it with me"" feeling? Heated mattress pad on low.

Want to have that ""someone is spooning me (big or little or both at the same time)"" feeling? Have three regular pillows, a body pillow, and a big squishy stuffed animal arranged in your bed so that you can let yourself feel like you are being held / holding someone in your sleep.

And something my therapist taught me - you CAN hug yourself, and you can rub your shoulders and whisper words of affirmation to yourself and it isn't crazy. Give yourself a big ol bear hug and whisper ""I love you, <name>"". Or, ""You did really well today, in proud of you"", or whatever else it is you crave to hear from someone else. Yeah, it can make me cry out of the sadness of having to do that for myself, but at the same time it can make me feel powerful to know that I CAN do that for myself, and that a partner(s) in my life isn't the sole source of that comfort, but rather that they can be a big cherry on top of my already awesome sundae.

I put notes like ""you've got this"" and ""hey, sexy!"" on my bathroom mirror, or near my bed so that I see them at random times of the day, as you might randomly receive a positive word from a partner. I have an alarm set for the end of my work day that is called ""Revel in the now, celebrate the successes of this day""...

Blah blah more sappy stuff, but my point is that yes, I totally agree that there are things that are easier and more fulfilling when done with others, but there are ways to get yourself part of those needs met on your own.

I'll check it out, thanks. Music can be a powerful source of inspiration and confirmation that you are not alone in your feelings. While you are selflessly loving the world, don't forget to turn some of that sunshine on yourself, okay? :)

Thanks for the offer of DMs. I've had some experiences go really south in DMs, and so I prefer to just air all of my dirty laundry and joy and pain and everything in between publicly. Something about private messages makes people think you owe them something. I've had people go from polite and welcoming to insane threats to doxx me and ruin my life after switching to private chats and finding out that I had no plans to immediately move in with them (slight exaggeration, but only slight). I've also had incredibly compelling relationships with people from the kink community develop over private chat only to eventually get ghosted when they have seen that I love and accept them for who they are, even if I don't know what they look like or have never shared physical pleasure with them. So... Yeah, too weird for me or too deep for them, but private chats have not helped me live the life I want to lead any more than public chats do. If that changes, I'll let you know.",make_me_a_good_girl,t2_1iqie3cd,1,0,reddit4

I always try to post to these kids that dating and growing up is not something you instantly know how to do. The first thing to do when having trouble with the opposite sex is to look at your own behavior. How are you approaching women? How's your hygiene? Bathing is necessary, especially when going through puberty. 

Women are just as different as men. We're not all of one mind. I have never dated a man with visible abs. I'm 41/f. I go for men who make me laugh, are responsible, and genuinely good people who get to know me. Plus brains and self respect. Really!

This is the god honest truth, but I would never be with someone like Andrew Tate, even if he does have money or whatever. He's not *my* type. He's not the type of a lot of women, and that's totally normal. Certainly some women love him, and that's great for them. But I'm not them. You are not Andrew Tate, you are your own individual person with your own pluses and minuses that you shape over a lifetime. Figure out who you are. There's certainly nothing wrong with emulating someone else, but make sure to emulate someone who is a good human being. 

Because even if you're getting women left and right as a devotee of Tate, are you actually getting what YOU WANT? Those are the peeple who will use you for your money, your body, or who you know.

Women that reframe everything as that it has something to do with sex should NOT even be thinking about the idea of incels, much less interact with them.

They have far bigger issue to deal with that they should fix first.

You should accept yourselves. Everything about yourselves.

Stop reducing yourselves to just tools for sex. Stop feeling inadequate because you feel like you're missing something. You're missing nothing. You are as much as anyone else.

You thinking you are just tools for sex will just make others perceive you as such.

Show more of yourselves. Don't be afraid of expressing all of you.

Honestly, if you think that men will think less of you, because you're a whole person, you just don't know men.

You can say incel ideology but it wouldnt stick if dudes didnt relate to it and so many dudes wouldnt be dedicated to believing it if they werent seeing proof of it in their lives. I think the internet made it extremely hard to meet women unless you are stupidly attractive and then any way to meet women traditionally irl was killed or made extremely difficult unless you are super sociable and in college or something. Then mainstream media and social media started painting guys having any attraction to women as evil, disgusting, and creepy, and that women want them to not exist, women do not want guys to talk to them ever. In fact, there was a recent thread on askreddit, a very large thread, asking what women would do if men didnt exist for 24 hours and you can see how so many of them responded they would see it as a positive and live happy for those 24 hours. Just to give you an idea of how gender relations are going. I dont believe this is feminism, i think this is just how women naturally think, they just naturally fear men which turns to hate. Only time it doesnt is if the guy is stupid attractive.

I see this in real life, most men i know are single tell they hit like 30 or so and even then its not written in stone. That is not normal. That is the sign of an extremely stressed society. This isnt going to end well for anyone if this starts becoming the norm. You will absolutely see a rise in political extremism because military aged men are not going to sit and waste their lives pencil pushing and flipping burgers. Many are gonna look around and see they have nothing to live for and join something to change that. I think the internet failed a lot of people.

I agree they should improve for themselves, and being their mental point of origin WILL make them more attractive. However, to completely disregard sex or relations with the opposite sex is immature at best. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be with another person or get laid. However, it’s the very questions they ask and lack of confidence they inhabit that ironically makes them less successful with women.

There's this image that you have to work hard, have a perfect plan and self confidence in your endeavors by some magic young adult age to get the desirable status, any latency is somehow extremely detrimental.

On the contrary you are still psychosocially, morally, emotionally and cognitively developing at these ages. For the vast majority of people this is the age you should be learning about yourself and the world in a responsible, aware and self driven sense, at the same time it's also the period where you should be aiming to introspect some of the errors that maybe happened in earlier years, most of us didn't have perfect upbringings, and often we have some flaws which demand some of our own agency to be a better person. If success is your goal, that period should be about priming yourself for success, not just pursuing success itself.

I see sooooo many people caught up in this idea that it's ""too late"" and they just stagnate, they resign, they reinforce the idea in their mind.

j1saxw1,t1_j1s1m9d,2022-12-27 00:29:07,selfimprovement,"In all seriousness, I think for some men, especially young adults, the attractiveness of ones partner is like a major insecurity as it's been associated with your ""value"" as a person (your charisma, looks or wealth). So there's this perception that settling with someone who is average or not super attractive, is conceding to yourself that you are of subpar value. To the younger, more egoistic individual that can be a hard concept to come to terms with, combine that with some *questionable* characters spewing nonsense to feed their developing adult mind and you have a recipe for questionable beliefs.

Now there's a much more philosophical conversation in there, what makes something valuable is it extrinsic or intrinsic? etc. Not that I ever see anyone go there.

However I think there's some things which get perpetuated on a wider level, number one is I don't think it's really okay to look at the people attached to you as an extension of your own merit or self, viewing woman like that is just odd, it's almost a bit objectifying, kind of looking at it like a car ""Well I need to get more money so I can get the better looking one to show off my status"".

At the same time, we have a loneliness epidemic, and there's tons of people that don't even look for the most ""attractive"" women, they are just failing in the relationship scene, for many different reasons and for a lot of people, relationships can be some of the most important facets of their lives. I think this is another primer for questionable beliefs, vulnerability-stress model if you will, but I think it's also not worth dismissing such woes, especially not in self improvement, because the answer can be something very general like hygiene, or being a better conversationalist, tackling these before they go on their introjection tirade is key.

The reason why men fall into incel mindset is really simple.

They listened to *too much* advice from other people. They tried *too hard* to be what others wanted them to be.

But if you listen to the poison that men listen to today ""try to be delicate and don't harm"" too often, it will make you paralyzed from taking action. Eventually it will make you like being harmless.

But the thing is, men just cannot be harmless, or they will take no action. And that behaviour just isn't attractive.

Then as they let that poison turn their thoughts into negative ones, something inside them tells them ""this can't go on.""

So they start listening to even more advice, now mostly from ones that tell them how to take action.

But since they are now operating from a really poisoned mindset, everything they do when they take action is a wrong action.

So they get a negative feedback from even that. This keeps confusing them, and they just don't know what they are supposed to do anymore.

They then start thinking that ""maybe it's not my fault, maybe it's them that are the problem, why the hell are they so difficult.""

Aaand so it goes. Now they don't care about your advice, because they believe you are the problem.

...

What they should do is unlearn all their learned behaviour, and start listening to their own instincts.

Then they should start building on top of those instincts with *their own* experience. No outside advice. Zero. It's all confusion.

Attraction is not supposed to be that complicated. If it was, we would go extinct long ago.

...

Talking from my experience as I had internalized hate against women and then did my best to unlearn all that noise.

I still have long ways to go though. I still need to gain a lot of experience.",,,-1,0,reddit1

The difference is now for the first time in history women don’t have to be dependent on men to live anymore. They’re able to have a husband or boyfriend as just an extension of their happiness. We weren’t allowed to have credit cards or even buy houses not that long ago or go to university for anything other than nursing or teaching. Thankfully we don’t have to depend on men so we can have choice in men and standards. We can go to university, do our own thing, and get into relationships later on in our 30’s when we get ourselves settled and independent. So the men that normally would want to be in relationships in their young 20’s… well there’s less women that want that. We also don’t have to put up with shitty men anymore. We can biologically have babies into our 40’s. Like why settle for some man at 20 years old when I have many years to figure that stuff out? 

It’s a societal shift. This isn’t a stressed society lol.  Women not wanting to date is FINE and we’re just going to get more and more self independent… also… we don’t hate men nor are we scared of them. Where did you get this idea? Men are pissed they are equals and don’t have the upper hand. 

We are failing young men in the at fact that having fulfilling relationships with other men for some reason is “gay” or “not masculine”, when in fact it’s completely fine and we should encourage it. Women get to have those kinds of friendships with other women, which is another reason why we don’t desperately want men because that part of our life is fulfilled. Men don’t have much emotional intelligence sometimes, because guys didn’t need to. They just needed to provide. If you read these posts of men upset they can’t attract women they only really talk about how they have a house, car, good job. Cool, you’re doing the bare minimum of adulting.

Relationships aren’t there to solve your depression and happiness. These men complaining are like 20-25 years old. It’s not 35 year old men complaining. They focus their entire value on the fact they don’t have a girlfriend. That’s fucked. No generation of men is being failed. They’re failing themselves by putting their entire value on the fact their penis hasn’t been inside a vagina.

Men are being told they should not be themselves, because it's a potential threat to their peers. It's done from since they were extremely impressionable, since they were toddlers.

There is really nothing they can do about that, just hope that their mind cares less.

So then they internalize that as that if they are harmless, all will be good, because why would other people lie?

But women aren't attracted to harmless men.

Also, being harmless means you're incredibly influencable, so it's very easy to lose control even inside your mind and fall into negative thoughts.

And so when someone with that mindset finally finds a courage to approach, rejection.

So they try a couple more times, only rejections.

That's just a massive failure on society's part.

And it makes me feel incredibly disturbed about the fact nobody talks about that.",,,1,0,reddit1

As less men are true to their biology, this problem will only worsen.

Being harmless is really bad for the person. It means they have pretty much no control over themselves, because any action could cause some harm to someone else.

If you're not in control of your mind, it will just spiral down.

Today's society really makes it as easy as possible for a man to not be there. And if he is there, it's not a man capable of stopping that well enough.

It's like it's saying that men are just not welcome, but instead of making them leave, it makes everyone become their tyrant, so that they ""leave"" themselves.

Sometimes taking a bunch of people with them.

But that's still just so that it can be even easier for society to control men. As now men are internalizing ""I would never hurt someone"" even harder.

We already are seeing a rise of fascism, globally, and i believe a large reason of that is because lonely men do not ""gain emotional intelligence"" they gain a gun and get in groups and storm government buildings, men biologically do not care what a woman thinks, her thoughts and emotions are second to the survival of the human race and if a massive chunk of guys cant have families anymore, fuck, cant even have relationships anymore, they are going to say, you know what, fuck this, and then you get groups like the taliban and isis and patriot front and whatever other far right religious groups we've been seeing spring up in waves over the last twenty or so years. This is something i am sure kings knew since every single major religion on earth puts women at the bottom under men. And why throughout history womens rights were rare in a lot of places. When you have large populations of single men, you get this. Its gonna get worse, especially if the internet is allowed to continue, women had equal rights in the 80s and 90s and this shit wasnt happening en masse.  

Its something ive been thinking about for a while. How women have hated a large portion of men and werent allowed to talk about it. Like i look at old family pictures and think about how many women in those pics had no choice at all, and fucking furiously hated the men they were around, and just lived with it.

Nice, so you'll have a ton of military aged men in their formative years being isolated and alone from the thing that for generations was normal and a coming of age ritual of sorts while you sleep around. Like i said earlier, this incel problem is going to get so much worse, i think its just going to make politics more extreme. Already has, idk if you are paying attention at all.

>We can biologically have babies into our 40’s

If you want an increased chance of complications and birth defects and autism, yeah you can, its not good though

>It’s a societal shift. This isn’t a stressed society lol. Women not
wanting to date is FINE and we’re just going to get more and more self
independent

This is absolutely the sign of a stressed society. Laughable you arent seeing this, the next few decades are going to hit you like a truck with how extreme things are gonna get. Women can live and be independent. Men wont. Ive heard this sentiment a lot and i dont even live in a big city. Also i got the idea of you guys fearing men from the near constant barrage of wishing men werent in public and saying you dont need them. Like you just alluded to by saying women will be more and more independent as time goes on, aka, no need for men. Stop lying, the mods are asleep apparently. You can say what you really feel. 

> If you read these posts of men upset they can’t attract women they only
really talk about how they have a house, car, good job. Cool, you’re
doing the bare minimum of adulting.

Where the everliving fuck do you live where this is the ""bare minimum of adulting"". The 1950s? Are you over 35? In my generation(gen z) They make up less than 2% of the housing market(i couldnt find a solid statistic that said what percent of them own a home) and the median salary is $33,800 which is, keep in mind,$600 above the poverty line. Idk what kind of car a lot of people my age own so i guess yea that bare minimum. I feel like if you are a guy my age, who owns a home(BY HIMSELF, which is super super fucking rare, literally never met a guy who lives by themselves and owns a home) and has a good job(over $60k a year) you are doing wayy over the ""bare minimum"" I doubt you even hit that bar at 25.

What you do instead is exploit your ancestor's suffering so that you can have a short term fun from it. In fact, you completely go the opposite direction. You mentally break men from birth by conditioning them to be completely harmless.

You could have stopped the cycle of hatred. But all you do is make men hate you now.

The problem is that this just won't work long term, as those men were willing to procreate with those that were not above them. Women will just not do the same. They feel absolute disdain towards a man that is below them.

But since you pretty much set up men to fail, you will have nothing to procreate with.

That's where it ends. Game over. Humanity is extinct now.

Glad you're enjoying your the good feels. :)

Or, you could stop the cycle of hatred right now.

In another comment I mentioned the vulnerability-stress model, and you'd be right in this regard, as you have a vulnerable demographic who are exposed to these major sources of introjection, never forget that introjection is an ego defense, so when you have an age group who are often still insecure or timid in their own identity or persona, who then sees successful people in similar age groups presented in a mode which is all about comparison, that can be a little bruising, and introjection is a very common response to that.

The problem with condensing big achievements in a short period of time, is that it forces it into the daunting department. If the time scale for ""I want to make lots of money"" is 10 years, then that's 10 years you have to split the large goal into progressive smaller realistic but challenging goals, whereas in 2 years it essentially becomes one singular goal of massive proportion. 

I think what people often also miss in the sensationalisation is how people got where they are, a lot of people are primed with generational wealth, but for the more normal folks, time is key, you don't have to work ""hard"" per se but you have to work towards something consistently, studiously, and make room for failure, as that's the part of the experiment where you learn what doesn't work.",Petaurus_australis,t2_ce8xki40,25,0,reddit1

So most of them are pretty much just left to their own devices until it's really hard to unlearn, and then almost nobody bothers.

You have to show them from a young age that what they believe is wrong and prevent it.

I really don't think that making them unlearn one by one is the best approach though. There would be far less suffering if people just removed the cause.

Then those men would actually have a far bigger chance to develop to be mentally healthy and actually be capable of living.

All they can do is lie their way a tiny bit to feel at least a slight human connection. But even that is just a lie.

Of course they are intolerant. They have completely different experience.

You aren't even alienated that hard compared to them and you're already pretty damn intolerant. So why wouldn't they?

Why the hell do women always think that men have it equally as hard as them and that they're just lazy.

A lot of women that became trans realized that life is suddenly harder. And they're not even really that accepted to a deeper level by men since they are still viewed as ""too easy to break"" so they don't apply much pressure. And when they do, the person just chickens out.

No, this is not women failing them, this is society failing to properly raise an entire generation of men and the internet doing it for them.

Do not, ever, open up to a woman about what's troubling you if it's something bigger. They will listen in the beginning. They will show compassion.

Then do it a bit more and they start looking at the weak points in your psyche. They start attacking those. They think this will make the man realize that he's thinking a bit unhealthily and snap out of it. The problem is that this just makes the man's psyche crumble, because they opened up too late and now nothing is really holding together well.

I know it's them trying to help.

It works well on small problems in the psyche. It's just that men were never meant to be led to fall so hard in the first place.

This is what happens when a man cannot open up since childhood, while at the same time being fed the poison from society's teachings.

However, I do not believe that modern way of trying to fix that is good at all.

When you're told that you can open up now, it's still mixed in with multiple different other teachings that may or may not contradict each other. It just builds on top of that confusion and makes everything even worse.

Taught to remain a virgin, marry, have no higher education because it wasn’t needed, have babies, cook, clean, diet to remain skinny,have sex on demand, remain silent and do what your husband wants. That is all we were ever supposed to want out of life. Across multiple cultures, races, ethnicities, countries, continents. The fact that any of us want more than this is not the problem. There is a gender war because a lot of men don’t want to be equals nor let us make our own choices.  Every little inch we have we have had to claw for it and everyday someone wants to take it away. If things were freely given to us when asked  the world would be a lot different. The fact is women, feminism, had to come together to take what we wanted. 

There are lots of great men out there that love and support strong women, I can acknowledge “not all men”. But those of you that continue to blame women are the saddest and most pathetic people out there.

Fine. Let's go with your incredibly interesting perspective.

Your women ancestors suffered. Now you want to use their suffering as means to gain as much short term benefit for yourself as possible. To do that, you have to make men suffer as much as possible. Now, since it's different genders, all this will do is make you want to date less and less men. Even those you think are great will have mentally destroyed children. So eventually you'll have no one to date.

Congrats on making humanity extinct. You win....nothing.

And don't tell me that ""women and men are equal right now and men just can't take it"" bullshit. Right now, at this very moment, regular men are so far below women on social hierarchy that the difference is not even funny. And they are born that way. They cannot make it be equal unless you let them.

But you think you're already equal, and that men are just lazy.

There are women that impersonated men that said it's far worse for men. There are women that became trans and now they say their life is harder (and that's even though most men don't fully accept them because they ""are easy to break"" so they don't push as hard. When they push harder, they just chicken out.

Also, it's completely different. Yes, if we go out of your comment, you could say that women were told they can't do anything but be baby factories. That's still better than what it feels like to be a man today.

>Why is this loneliness of men an issue of any sort other than personal growth requirements for men if they want to be seen as dick carrying members of society?

The issue is that we're in an increasingly digital age where traditional social meetups are becoming less of a norm. Humans aren't built for sitting in their rooms the whole day, mindlessly scrolling on a smartphone and not having enough social and physical interactions. A phenomenon which is becoming the norm.

Yes, loneliness is required for self actualization, but humans are still social creatures who need some form of social life to not go off the deep end. Sexual relations are arguably just as important. Like I said, humans like all other animals, have a biological inclination to procreate/have sex. That's not incel talk, that's a fact.

>Young men used to be much lonelier, you could only meet women in your town back in the day.

Good point. But like I said, modern technology and our sedentary lifestyles have led so many men and women to have worse social lives, less desire to sexually compete and become lonely. 

It's a combination of multiple things.",malonepicknroll,t2_1zu46dqb,1,0,reddit1
j1ve0x6,t1_j1t967z,2022-12-27 18:10:12,selfimprovement,"Quite simply, while men are the only ones capable of improving themselves, it’s societal expectations that put them in that situation in first place. And while we used to have to interact without help from the internet, that was also a time when people would interact in person far more often, meaning you were far more likely to meet potential partners in your day to day life. Now most interactions are either practical or heavily scheduled and structured so it’s far more difficult to meet random people who won’t immediately run away anxiously.

I would imagine a lot of women are in fact lonely but society puts a lot of pressure on them to wait for a man to approach them as opposed to seeking out interaction themselves.

To put things simply, if someone wants to improve themselves, does it matter if they currently have an incel mindset? The purpose of self improvement is about picking up new mindsets that are more beneficial to society and individuals. And the only barrier to “fixing” Incel culture is the fact that most incels don’t want to change in the first place, but in this scenario the subject is usually willing to make a meaningful change in their behavior because they’ve determined that their current mindset is not conducive to their happiness",Firelite67,t2_5q0ombq6,1,0,reddit1

There is an element of truth to that no doubt, but the problem is that incel men goto extremes--as if that's the only thing women want and are looking for.  

The mind of these incels perceives the dating market to be an oversimplified caricature of what it really is.  If they were muscular tall and rich, they would have everything.  Personality wouldnt matter.  Acknowledging women as sentient beings gets tossed out the window--why?  Because if they had the body, height and wealth to make it happen women would just flock to them regardless.

So because they see only the oversimplified caricature, they judge themselves by that alpha male metric.  It's not fake at all to them.  It's so real it defines their very existence.  Elliot rodgers killed people because he didnt get what he thought was his due, given his looks.

Then they end up competing against other men instead of competing against the girl's needs,  trying to match up and provide positive support to facilitate mutual growth.

I just told an incel in another forum;

The rules of the competition  when you play it with women's ideas in mind are: you have to be better at respecting her autonomy, valuing her, providing her with positive support, and valuing personal growth than what **she** expects out of men.

Think of this. We have a society that says men are superior to women. ""Happy wife, happy life."" IE women are super emotional creatures and their emotions control them. ""Women. Can't live with them, can't live without them."" IE I wanna fuck women but not deal with them afterwards. These phrases are littered through the English language. 

Not just these phrases either. When a guy sleeps with 10 women he is seen as ""Da Man."" And when a woman does it? ""Slut."" While, in today's age it is true women have more rights than say they did in the 1950s it's not accurate to say women have ""Arrived."" They get paid less than men on the same job. They are treated like sexual objects a lot of the time in shows and movies. So on so on.

The message is, women are less than men. They need to be serving men. While a good portion of people now a days can see through such bs there are those who are still stuck in the past. They see a woman in a tank top the man thinks he has the right to fuck her on sight. Though there are laws. There are people who will look down on them for doing that. 

This creates a duel battle in the brain between seeing women in this old way vs the modern day where women are seen more as people. (Depending on who we are talking about.) 

And they get lost. They get lost not knowing what path to go down and some of them maybe lured into the incel life because there will be men who are like ""Me too buddy. Me too."" Or they may just be naturally shitty people and believe they are better because they have a dick.

From a young age, I felt abandoned by the world and harbored resentment towards those who seemed to have it better. I questioned why society seemed to value certain individuals over me, based on what I believed were superficial factors like appearance or wealth. My early life was tumultuous; I entered the foster system shortly after birth and was eventually adopted, but not before facing abuse in multiple homes and at school.  
  
By the time I reached my teenage years, I was at my breaking point. Despite being an awkward kid, I did my best to treat others with kindness, yet I rarely received the same in return. It was disheartening to see the very people who mistreated me receive preferential treatment from authority figures. This led me to develop a strong sense of hatred for those around me, as they seemed to tolerate or even enable the cruelty I experienced.  
  
Over time, I came to the realization that the world often doesn't prioritize the well-being of young men. But instead of blaming women or any specific demographic, I now believe that we, as humans, have a long way to go in terms of empathy and understanding.

Every man knows he is capable of so much more. This is innate to the masculine and will either drive us forward or cause us to seek a way to distract ourselves from it - most do the latter. 

""Redpill"" used to be a more ambiguous term which could mean anything from dating multiple partners at once to following traditional religious doctrines. Nowadays, it's more-so a man's version of feminism.

That being said (and reddit will scrutinise me for this), there ARE biological factors that drive and separate men and women. Yes, believe it or not, we are biologically and evolutionary different.

At any given moment, men are targeted for their sexuality. Most people roll their eyes when I say that.

First thing, the fact people roll their eyes at male problems is part of the problem and why many men feel disenfranchised -- because it backs up the ideas that men's problems shouldn't be taken seriously.

Second, you cannot use social media, or go to the gym, or watch a movie, or go out for a walk, without being sexually provoked. Those ""local girls near you"" adverts exist for a reason. 

Should we as men have the choice to not have our evolutionary drives used against us?

Is it not men that pornography is predominantly targeting? Would Onlyfans exist if men didn't have such sexual imperatives? 

These are just a few points from the redpill male POV.

The problem is that the redpill doesn't help fix the problem, but rather, perpetuates it. Sleeping around with women, while wanting them to have low body counts. It's kinda ironic. 

Redpill is pretty much men saying ""fuck this shit"" and not caring about the opinions of women. It is a response to Feminism, which funnily enough, is a response to weak men. 

Hyper-polarisation isn't good for any party.

jjf76e4,t3_13bx92m,2023-05-09 02:41:13,selfimprovement,"Imo I think it's because the self-improvement industry is dishonest and mostly driven by traditional white conservative masculinity. Many incels aren't just white, but also POCs who have personal traumas and cultural traumas from being told their manhood is bad. All of this manifests into a sort of internalised emasculation (characterised by cynicism, social isolation, bullying victims, addiction and so forth), preventing healthy personal growth. The stigma of it makes it worse, like a form of cultural victim blaming.

You may not realise it, but a lot of POC men are starting to heal from these stigmas faced by white feminists. They are simply a byproduct of being neglected by a white narrative-driven society. Most of these dudes aren't genuine misogynists (although some are) but have trauma that requires proper therapy. There are other things like racial discrimination within dating and so forth - just ask black women and you will see what adversity they have to navigate just to find a decent partner.

Self-improvement is missing a key component: diversity of knowledge and experiences. Not everyone is neurotypical, not everyone has the privilege of not dealing with societal disadvantages (like internalised racism) or having all limbs intact and so forth. Authors need to get off their naïveté of personal growth from creating this facade of radical individualism and realise this: the world is very cruel and discriminatory and requires constant change. That's why I like authors like Robert Greene, he shows it like how it is as well as other authors such as  Bessel van der Kolk (creator of 'The Body Keeps The Score') who dig deeper into the layers of mental health and self-improvment.",Tough_Opinion_9305,t2_85mt8txe,0,0,reddit2

jjgnymp,t3_13bx92m,2023-05-09 12:41:59,selfimprovement,"i think there's a two-pronged answer.

the first answer is that it's easy to radicalize people when you give them a scapegoat for their suffering and people who benefit materially from ideologies based on the subjugation of women know that. think of all the men who have built their entire careers on misogyny.
they know they've got an in with angry, lonely young men who want to find someone to blame for their circumstances.
they target audiences that are traumatized, mentally ill or otherwise vulnerable to cult recruiting tactics, and they sell them the keys to universe through whatever ideology that will get them to line their pockets.

either the world sucks or you suck or women suck, but don't worry, these people have figured it out and got all the answers.

the second is that it's a direct response to feminism and the progress we have made in recent years.
the misogynist exploitation of women (through the unpaid labor of child-rearing and housekeeping, among other things) in the past was made possible by lacking equal rights for women.
making women largely dependent on men through forbidding them from owning land, holding down jobs, divorcing or having their own bank account made it so very mediocre or even reprehensible men could trap women in relationships where they were emotionally neglected and often verbally or physically abused. 

these men have seen the articles about women's rising standards as societal, systemic misogyny is addressed and women are given the power to self determine whether they want to be housewives or career women. they know that equal rights mean that women have the power and the ability to escape their exploitation and abuse of them and they resent that.
their ideal world is one where women are the property of their fathers and then their husbands.

these men subscribe to incel ideology to avoid any responsibility over their own lives, and because they want to live in a world where they have the power to exploit and abuse women because they feel entitled to them.",fungistate,t2_m56itr6h,1,0,reddit2

People idealize the things that are easy.

The problem is that it's not realistic for all men to obtain. You cannot grow taller. You can't all of a sudden change your facial structure to match society's ideal.

And there is the crucial social aspect that these manospheres overlook. But that also takes effort and people want what's easy because they want to be like the men who have it easy. And who doesn't right?

1.  In real life, I don’t think that either the “red pill” believers or the man haters are all that common. There is likely a strong positive correlation between how much media one consumes and the perceived prevalence of these competing extreme views. When I’m online or watching the tube, I am left with the impression that there is a large population of narrow minded women who despise and blame men no matter what, and that, on the other hand, there is a large group of men who have taken a narrow minded approach in responding to this threat by pushing a view of women as lessor and subservient to man. Then I think about all of the many people I actually interact with in person, from all walks of life, and I can’t really think of any who takes either of those positions. 

2. Self improvement framed as a defensive undertaking will fail. Other people, their perceptions of you, their desires to defeat you, etc. should all be irrelevant to true self-improvement. Improve yourself for yourself. The rest will follow. Whether you are a “victim” (man or woman) is irrelevant. The narratives, social structures and your standing within those structures will always be fluid and ever-changing.

Most advice on this is super vague like ""Go Outside"", ""Talk to people"", ""Talk to women"", ""Be better at conversation"" etc. The thing that can change lives the most is having better social skills but how do you start? You can't just go outside and talk to random strangers, especially not women because they (rightfully) have their guards up against other men.

Being ambitious, fulfilling goals, and not making the pursuit of women the main focus of life is already something well-rounded adults do. That’s the point. 

Every time an incel defends themselves, they always tout these tenets of their ideology as some sort of groundbreaking revelation or new theory. Literally nobody has a problem with those things. 

It’s the false sense of superiority you derive from putting down women and other men that’s the issue. Let me put it this way: I’ve never met a man that had any success with women or their career talk about other peoples “value”.  People that you would regard as “high value” don’t really think too much about other peoples value. They are balanced with life and don’t need to devalue others in order to cope with their insecurities.

It's blame society. It's all ""society these days sucks, you have to realize that and exploit this fact"" bullshit. It approaches it from a negative angle and reenforces the social or mental problems the person has. The basic concept entirely surrounds this from the start.

But don't worry you'll be posting pepe clowns and saying clown world in no time while improving nothing about yourself. And all your interactions with people will be fake, and people will come to realize this very quickly as inside your mind you are basing all your interactions from a negative angle and negative assumptions.

It's a depressive worldview that doesn't match reality.

I have a very ""red pill"" friend. Known him since grade 6. Literally NOBODY wants to deal with this dude anymore. I'm the last one. Now he found a friend he literally met through this shit he hangs out with all the time and this guy has the doomer personality of Alex Jones. Claims to have swallowed the red pill but can keep a job as well as the average /r/antiwork user because if it's not perfection, based on his societal delusions, it's not worth doing for him. And that's the insight to a ""redpilled"" person's life. Both these people blame everything on others. Whenever they were confronted with their assholish behavior they always say some shit like ""this is the way things are now"" and talk about how they have accepted it, blaming others for their mental problems and hangups. That is the worldview and if you don't see the inherent problems with that worldview then you won't understand why it's not healthy. Meanwhile those of us not like this are all living fulfilled lives and have decent jobs and relationships.

It's fucking sad how this redpill shit destroyed this guy's life and i've seen it a lot. I will not allow anyone to post it as if it's self help. It is the opposite. It's taking the doomer pill if anything.",quietvegas,t2_vex45ki9,54,0,reddit2

I noted that in the post, you have to be aware that you are two independent people in a relationship building a system of interdependence.

It's not gross to accommodate someone's wants and needs in the best way you can?

**you both bring something to the table, and you each mutually provide positive support to enrich eachother's aspirations and well-being.

the latter is more about simping and being overly helpful and ingratiating towards a woman just to get in her pants.  aka being a 'nice guy', buying her shit, agreeing with everything she says, and expecting her to sleep with you.

OTOH, attracting women the right way involves making yourself more attractive physically, and in terms of social skills, presence, wealth, etc.

jjftv1e,t1_jjdszqg,2023-05-09 06:25:15,selfimprovement,"It is interesting that this issue is pervasive beyond just incel and extremist communities. It points to something much more fundamental I think.

I recently became a father and the experience has been an enlightening one for me. I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on how I wanted and want to raise my child. That process revealed a lot about my own values, but it also revealed a ton about how my own parents raised me and to larger extent how most of my generation was raised (millennial). 

My parents had a severe lack of emotional intelligence. I had emotional issues, primarily anger, that my parents just never talked about and almost pretended like it didn’t exist. The term for this is emotional neglect. It’s very difficult to pinpoint because it’s a result of parents not doing something like simply acknowledging your feelings. It took me a long time to figure it out because I always felt a degree of trauma from my childhood but I could never name it or identify it, because how do you put a name on the absence of something you didn’t know should have been there in the first place? It took 30 years but this discovery was pivotal for me as it allowed me to begin the healing process and make progress on my own behavioral and emotional issues (shoutout to CBT).

Bringing it all back around, this information has completely changed the lens through which I view the world and especially the United States and it’s unique myriad of problems. The Silent Generation, boomers, and Gen X (to a lesser extent) have raised multiple generations of children based on a foundation of bottling your emotions up. I see it all the time with the parents of millennials - they refuse to discuss emotions and they avoid any kind of interaction that is emotionally stimulating. It worked for them because, I believe, their generation lived in a much simpler world with much less external pressures to deal with. There is so much more to deal with today. Income inequality is out of control. You can’t afford to buy a home. The internet and social media are constantly distorting reality and create these wild expectations for people. Everyone is becoming more and more isolated and there’s no community anymore. There’s a never ending list of problems that are all multiplying how much of an emotional struggle it is just to maintain a mediocre lifestyle. And to top it off politicians do virtually nothing to address it. Which is not surprising to me!

The most basic tool for overcoming emotional hardship is to be able to identify and regulate your emotions. To have parents that don’t even acknowledge your emotions is to not know unconditional love. This creates people who are not emotionally independent and are unable to love themselves unconditionally. 

Sadly I think this is where a lot of people especially in right wing bubbles start to get misled. It’s very common for a lot of these folks to espouse the importance of the “nuclear family” - which was most common between the 50s to 70s. Proponents of the nuclear family revere that era as a golden age of American Society. This obviously ignores the fact that it actually wasn’t that great for anyone who wasn’t a white male. But I think they have it all backwards - they are confusing correlation with causation. The nuclear family worked because life was much simpler, society was much less divided and much more homogeneous, there was still a strong sense of community, and of course Reagan hadn’t become president yet. The emotional pressures of society were not nearly as potent as they are today. If the nuclear family was so great then it wouldn’t have resulted in the society we have today. Which it did, or at least it’s impact was not great enough to keep us from getting here and so it’s illogical to believe it can be a solution here. 

I have hope for the future though. Younger generations are starting to figure all of this out. New generations of children are being raised differently and I see it more and more. Ignorance cannot survive the light of knowledge.",b0und13ss,t2_huh8vegi,11,0,reddit2

I had the same exact point in both posts, competing to facilitate mutual growth together like I mentioned in my second post.

P1 ""play it with women's ideas in mind are: you have to be better at respecting her autonomy, valuing her, providing her with positive support, and valuing personal growth

What servitude? Valuing someone's autonomy, or was it the part where I said women want to be viewed as people with needs independent of other women? Or maybe it was because I said you should provide positive support to a girl if you want to develop a relationship with her?

 It goes without saying that this is both ways, I was talking about a relationship where there are TWO parties? If you are a man seeking a partner, you have to expect the exact same things from her. Autonomy, respect, support, her own position on personal development.

I am not following what you are saying. It's like you are willfully ignoring the nuance that comes with relationships bc they aren't one sided EVER.

gih6fcg,t3_ksik1k,2021-01-07 22:38:29,selfimprovement,"I think comparing yourself to others is pretty much a natural process. You can’t stop it. When humans lived in small tribes it was pretty important to compare yourself to others. You couldn’t just „be yourself“, you had to be stronger than others to survive. If you were the weakest member of the tribe chances were pretty bad for survival and reproduction. 

So I think we can’t really stop this process. And I don’t think it is really bad. If you look into your social environment and see that every is becoming successful but you, it is a good motivation to get your ass up and work. Or you could just accept that you aren’t as successful as others. It’s no shame, maybe you have different goals.

The only problematic thing is if you start comparing yourself to people that you only know from social media or tv. Comparing yourself to the most successful people in the world is toxic to your mental health. 

Another issue is comparing strengths . Everyone of us has strengths and weaknesses. If you compare yourself to someone and see that he is good at XYZ, chances are you aren’t. And it isn’t important. Because you have other qualities. This is important to realize. Everyone has his talent somewhere.",,,4,0,reddit3

You're stuck at that dead end job. You have no idea what you'd like to do. All a sudden, you notice a friend/acquaintance is working on their dream job: they've always wanted to be a painter and now they're doing art exhibitions. 

You can look at it like, ""damn, she gets to fulfill her dreams and I don't?"", Which does you 0 good.

Or you can look at it like, ""well, if she's managed to do something related to her passion, so can I. It's possible to do things you love, so I'll use her example as inspiration"".

Thinking about our compulsion to compare ourselves to others is really interesting!  

Have you ever considered the possibly that maybe it's human nature to compare ourselves to others?  And maybe the key to preventing that from being harmful  is to try and reframe the conclusions of our comparisons and to not try and stop ourselves from comparing in the first place?  

For example,  instead of trying to convince ourselves that the act of comparison is unhealthy or that the people we are comparing ourselves to are secretly miserable, what if the right mindset to have is to understand that comparing ourselves to others we feel equal to is natural and OK, but that it's ALSO OK to NOT be the absolute best in something (if that's the outcome of your comparison)?  Maybe It's OK to be top 50%, or even ""just not the worst""?     

Might it be possible that being OK with, and able to reframe, the outcome of comparing yourself to others may be a more achievable path for those that struggle with this, as it doesn't try to suppress our natural tendency to compare?

Some guy next door may own a supercars but they are proalu in debt for life. It's about priorities and how confident you are yourself to see the reality as it is and find a base for your own growth.

Please, do not let these projections provoke negative emotions in you. Instead, learn to be more confident and focus energy on yourself. You may not be as successful in a material realm (for now), but you surely can become a good example to others. Let's say you begin to seriously work out and see results cathing up with time. Some friend may see you as a good example and get inspired by you or will become a partner for achieving goals together.
Maybe you will save enough money to buy that dream car or house, but will you need to flash it in front of others knowing how hard it was to earn every penny?

Also, the most inspiring cases of success are the ones focused on making the closest environment better in some way or helping the community you are a part of. It's not all about the money and you can surely find a purpose for your skills (social, technical, etc.).

I sincerely hope you find a way to drop this menatility of being a failure. Think twice. I am sure you are capable of something good.",Silber4,t2_10zjdr,14,0,reddit3

It made me go through the deepest feelings of loneliness and despair, and realize that I'm still here, on the other side, regardless. It woke me up to the fact that I, and no one else, am responsible for my life (apart from obvious external circumstances).

The world is dark and merciless, as others have said, but I feel like it's always been. Nature is not benevolent; being sensitive is hard as shit. Things are not the same as they were, that's for sure. But there's an opportunity there too, not only something to be afraid of. What you make of this feeling is what matters. I'm determined to stay optimistic as much as I can. Dwelling on everything that is shit brings what I see as unnecessary suffering, and I'd like to avoid as much of that as possible lately.

I'd like to add that social media exacerbates this feeling you speak of. I've been feeling better since I deleted Instagram and limited my time on Reddit. I've been spending my free time studying, learning German and playing videogames with my sister. It's vital for me to exercise, however lightly, to go outside and just look at a tree or something. Being plugged into a screen all day destroys my mental health.

I say that because I admittedly don't follow the news that much, and that might be influencing my perspective. I'm just not strong enough to keep up with everything that's going on. So I try to stay occupied, spend time with people I like, and find refuge in my everyday routine.

Think about it - we all (most of us, anyway) have a little device we look at for anywhere from an hour to ten hours a day. Some people have a better handle on it then others. But most people use it to some extent, and probably have some form of social media on it. What do we see on social media? New content every 10-20 seconds? As fast as you can scroll? Remember when Facebook used to be just your friends, and if you stayed on long enough the news feed would just end? 

Caught up on Facebook? Here let’s open Reddit. All done there? Better check my email for the 30th time today. Nothing good? Well here, let’s open the web browser… maybe browse *insert favorite brand* website, I saw in my inbox they have 20% off right now. 
And whoops, an hour has passed. Oh well, I’ll just quick open YouTube and watch a video then get on with it. Whoops, it’s been another hour. 

Ever notice when you click on “comments” in pretty much any app, the majority of the first ones you see are usually negative?

j3l8ja8,t1_j3kks4a,2023-01-09 09:32:23,selfimprovement,"Since you brought up astrology, Saturn actually went into Aquarius in March of 2020. Saturn as an energy doesn't mess around. In Aquarius, it turns it's energy into the collective and brings to light any weak areas that need strengthening. It requires one to put aside the ego for collective wellbeing -- a very common motif throughout national and international affairs these past few years. 

However, this year, Saturn will make it's way through Pisces starting in March. In this sign, our dreams will materialize, with spirituality combined with the earthy sense of Saturn. On the contrary, the dissolution of structures will also commence. Again, bringing to light any weak areas that need strengthening -- this time through a spiritual lens. 

What most people also forget, is that Pluto is currently a large part of the current state of affairs. Right now, we are in the Pluto return of the United States. With Pluto having reached that same degree three times last year (last one in December 28th). What's most interesting to me, is how things will change once it reaches Aquarius in March. With Pluto, the planet of transformation, in Aquarius, the sign of revolution and progress, change is guaranteed and will be for the greater good.

So expect major changes to occur this year. Change will always be uncomfortable, especially in the name of shadow work. Which is exactly what's happening on a national and global scale: the shadow side of society is being brought to the light and reckoned with. The shadow that has been hidden for far too long. 

It's interesting what will happen when Saturn is in Pisces and Pluto in Aquarius. Use that energy well.",Alxayx_miimanu,t2_6cznsl4p,22,0,reddit4

Covid on the other hands, i feel changed the world forever atleast from a technological perspective. For example, it heavily popularized the concept of working from home. Even now, i observe people working hybrid throughout the week. Many startups around the world have resorted to maintaining virtual workplaces to cut back on costs. This concept was definitely not popular or as wide spread pre covid 19. Covid also popularized digital currency, at least in developing nations, through apps like g-pay and such.

Cold calling doesn’t necessarily need to mean you throw all that away. For sure stay away from dating apps but just walking up to a random person you find attractive and saying hi? 

It just all depends on the person you meet (and the person you are yourself). If the person you meet doesn’t seem interested at all or doesn’t see to respect your respect/hard work/dedication/etc then they simply aren’t worth your time. 

The difference between throwing it all away and having respect for yourself is if you keep talking to that person. If you keep talking to the person who doesn’t like you then you’re only hurting yourself.

A good majority of women have nothing to really offer to a man ""besides sex"" compared to what he brings to the table as long as he's an actual dominant man who takes charge of his life 

When a man already is rich and successful, why is he going to wanna add a woman who either 1 is going to be a headache in the long run or 2 duke him with a ""oops forgot my birth control I'm pregnant"" or divorce ""got most of what YOU worked for"" teheheh


Same goes for women who are at this level

Once you hit a certain level of success, why would a woman wanna add a man who is probably gonna be a pain in the ass for her.

It's all about odds and statistics....MOST PEOPLE suck and think they are ""King or Queen"" when their just the town whore mental case.......


Statistically speaking.......you are pretty much guaranteed to waste you're time, and possibly lose what you worked for...

I ""and I know alot of others also out there agree"" am good on that.


Ps, I've had the BADDEST most beautiful women on this planet....it's true, they hotter the crazier......but sadly noe in days even the ""dogs"" have horrible additudes and have nothing to offer.

So really, if it came down to just sex.....if I felt that inclined ""which I won't""

Being rich/successful means that there’s going to be a lot of shitty people just trying to use you. 

If your fine living the way you are (which it seems you are) then that’s fine. 

But if you do want to find “true love” it’s going to be hard. And wether it’s worth your time is up to you (although that’s a little skewed as if you never experienced it before you won’t know what your missing out on). 

Finding someone who’s loves you for who you are (and not for money or anything else like that) is not easy. It’s almost exactly like you described. But once you do it’s like none of that even mattered. 

Of course there’s the chance you find your “dream woman” and then it goes to shit and the cycle repeats but, such is life.

jwa1hxy,t3_15re10z,2023-08-15 12:52:09,selfimprovement,"Hey! M22 here. I may sound like I fall on the red/blackpill side of the fence on this issue, but here are my two cents;

I would say the reason that young men tend to be attracted to areas of self improvement compared to young women (or women in general) is primarily because of the fact that we don't have as many stable forms of support as women do (be it societally, socially, etc.) to bolster our self esteem.

That's not to say that women don't deal with their own set of issues - they most definitely do, but when it comes to things such as emotional support from friends, family members and any form of validation in general, men (at the very least young men) are lacking in that. This can be proven by the fact that women tend to have more friends, receive more compliments, etc. Men sadly do not.

With all that's said and done, I don't think this is the fault of ""third-wing feminism"", I think it's a multifaceted issue, but I would say one of the primary causes of this are the standards that men are held to (by both men and women) in addition to how men treat one another. Most of my male friends don't want to know what I'm going through and don't care to listen.

I've also found this behavior exemplified by my own direct family. People such as my mother don't care much to listen to what I'm going through and generally implore me to just ""get help"" (which I'm not against, I am seeking out therapy). 

On the flip side, if my older sister is struggling with something my mother is more than willing to be a pillar of support. That isn't to say my mother doesn't try to be of help to me when she can be, but I notice she has a greater unction to do so with her rather than me. It's frustrating.",wanttoridemybicycle1,t2_5r15gy6w,2,0,reddit2

jwatnl8,t3_15re10z,2023-08-15 15:55:59,selfimprovement,"I've found that us women tend to quietly process things on our own or seek various avenues of support & problem-solving way more often than men do or even realize we do. I know men complain about being dismissed & attacked on their end, but we women experience it a ton as well so many things are just silent burdens. Our struggles get dismissed with cliches, labeled as ""unstable"" for having human emotion, blame-shifting for what other ppl do to or around us. It's fking tiresome. It's the exact reason why we have a tendency to say ""I'm fine"" because feels are treated like burdens no one wants to deal with those days. As others have mentioned, we do have spaces though.

As far as not being able to click with men or feeling unsafe, that's totally normal after a toxic relationship. It's just a sign that you're not ready yet which is 100% okay. Keep working on your self-improvement, meditate, practice lots of boundary work, utilizing coping skills, show love to yourself, get into your passions, dance like no one is watching & hone your sniffer to spot those red flags. Eventually you'll find that place of inner comfort & appreciating your own unique badassery. 

You're definitely not alone either. I was single & celibate for 5 yrs after a 14 yr relationship that ended in a 5 yr VPO. I made a lot of progress in those 5 yrs & I honestly haven't cared if I end up single forever. Companionship would be nice, sure, however having the freedom from daily psychological abuse is priceless. I only just started stepping back into the dating world this yr, tried an app & just no lol. Funny enough, after I got off of it & settled back into the idea of just being alone, several guys I had chatted with before & never got to meet sought me out again, offering to work around my schedule so they can treat me to lunch. They may amount to nothing long-term, however it gives me a chance to socialize more, boost my confidence a little in a healthy way & practice feeling comfortable in the presence of men again. 

Don't listen to the tropes about age either. I fell down the rabbit hole of red pill crap & man, it fked with my head, my confidence & my trust issues for the longest time. A bit of a setback really. ""Single mothers are bad"" & ""you're unlovable after 25!"" But you know what? If someone can't see you as a person because you've aged out of their preference? Fk em! They're not your type of person either. The irony? Every woman is going to age out of their preference eventually & not everyone can be a Leo DiCaprio or Hugh Hefner. We all have baggage, but the important this is how one deals with it. There are plenty of other guys who actually appreciate maturity, independence & genuinely value respect. The rest simply don't matter. 

I'm about to be 38, rock my silver stripe & have flaws for days, but I've been experiencing a lot more chivalrous & very respectful behavior than not lately. Not entirely sure if there's a shift in men's mindsets, if I'm giving off better vibes from a couple yrs ago, maybe a combo, but something is there & it ain't the fact that I'm pushing 40.

If you want to be happier, you're going to have to actively change you're environment and the choices you make to reflect both to others and to yourself that you are happy. Part of this is some weird thing about ourselves, if we don't believe ourselves to be happy people, or feel guilty about being happy, it's just not going to happen. 

Self care is a top priority, you need to treat yourself like you would treat someone you cared for. Hygiene, gym, and diet (not the amount but what as well!)are key for physical appearance at any age, better to just accept that and try your best. Don't forget to treat yourself too, we can't work forever.

You have to try things your going to fail at, with enough attempts you will succeed. At some point you will prove to yourself change is possible. 

Therapy also helps, we need help vocalizing the right words to describe how we feel, and we can create a path forward despite it. 

Financial advice I can't give, but there are certainly people out there who can advice, it just might take some searching 


Self improvement is for anyone! I have a theory as to why more men are drawn here, but it's more of a vibe I've gotten from the sub, not much more than that. 

I think it's a desire to be useful, not for anyone else, but for ourselves. Variety of reasons someone gets to that mindset, there are some kids here that shock me with this realization at such a young age. In my case, I lost so much control in my life that I became disillusioned with a lot of my beliefs. I could barely function, and ended up getting sent to a psychward, where I met people who still had hope in so much worse situations than me. Some of them truly mentally ill, but still trying to be understood in the world. And I realized then, that I couldn't do a damn thing to help them because I couldn't even help myself. If I wanted to give these people real help, aside from simple prayer and advice on a situation I had failed time and time again, I needed to become a person that could help myself and help others. 

How could I tell someone there was hope unless I created that for myself? How could I ask someone to like me if I didn't like myself? And that's when I stumbled onto this journey. 

Generally speaking, I think men aren't useful to anyone unless they are good at something. Most women though are valued by capable men, and some will be cared for. I at least, want to create a world where my partner never needs to face these challenges. That may be selfish of me, but I wouldn't want anyone to face these struggles.

I'm a Male and can't agree with this. Ofcourse you don't get any stable form of support if you are the problem, but that's also a think that only comes to light if you self reflecting about this. Did I might hurt or insult someone, is an Opinion unpopular? or why don't I get as much support on certain topics?

> This can be proven by the fact that women tend to have more friends, receive more compliments, etc. Men sadly do not.

This is an assumption not a fact. I heard from my sister and female friends that big friend groups are rather surface level friendships with lots of intrigues or people talking behind of the others back. Ofcourse that's an assumption as well based on what I heard from women directly. They also have close friends but very few.

I talk about my issues with friends and my sister as well. Sounds like your friends don't want to be very close friends. If you can find others who care more about you and your feelings, but return this as well.

&#x200B;

I want to make the point that although black/redpill ideology is pretty toxic and fucked up because of the means and ends that it entails, there is a ton of truth to it that I don't think women particularly understand. It is not the points that these ideology's often make that are wrong (some are undoubtedly) but it's how it's all carried out. 

&#x200B;

For example in its early days, all this redpill bullshit was about clarifying how to be more successful in a nutshell. Improve your health, improve your career, improve how you look and how you come off to people, gain social value so that you can win people over- all vitally important things for attracting anything in life. The problem was that it became borderline sociopathic and used for immature ends. 

&#x200B;

We do live in a world where it is incredibly beneficial to know about the dark side of how our social systems work. You would be naïve to not understand how this game works if you were a man especially, and almost destined to fail if you didn't play it to a large degree. 

&#x200B;

Women play a very different ""game,"" and although both of these games of how we can become more valuable to society for BOTH men and women are foundationally unfair and brutal, the redpill shit, as corny as it has always been to me, illuminated some of the deeper aspects of the games we play and how we are valued especially as men in society where the ""game"" men play is much more nuanced.

The thing no one told all these redpillers is that emotional intelligence, awareness and empathy are maybe some of the most desirable traits up there with a 6 pack, a nice job/material things and social competence for women who actually want a partner. 

The issue wasn't that redpill ideology is wrong, it's ugly and used wrongly usually, but it always has held many truths for being a man, if you don't understand that you don't understand men very well. The problem was that red/blackpillers were usually only interested in getting laid and becoming more socially dominant rather than actually becoming a better person and having a more fulfilling life. 

It comes from immaturity that the ideology gets fucked up, much like many movements. I think you could make the same argument for feminism. It's not that feminism is wrong, it's that most radical feminists are using it wrongly and the word and the means/ends of feminism has become completely tainted.

feminism is supposed to be about equal rights for both genders by definition. It has always been about making things just for BOTH genders. You'd never know this from how modern feminism is carried out. It is not about making things better for both genders, and there are obstacles for both genders that need lots of work- I've never seen a feminist stand up for men's rights, who have arguably just as many societal hurdles as women, just in different ways. If feminists truly cared about what it meant to be a feminist they would be rallying to help men as well. That's about as clear as it can be to me that feminism has failed. And modern radical Feminism seems more interested in taking men down a peg then making things better for both sexes. 

I think you're being super dishonest if you truly think modern radical feminism hasn't devolved into an anti-man narrative, which was my point.

both ""movements"" turned to shit from intentions that were originally understandable. 

I view the 2 groups similarly.

However, even when you look throughout history the feminist movement was NEVER about helping men because we live in a patriarchal society where women often get the short hand of the stick when compared to men(in terms of wages etc). So your whole argument about why feminism has failed isn’t valid to begin with. Also even in modern feminism, it’s still about giving women equal rights, it’s just taken a turn of advocating for more female independence and freedom of expression which some people have a problem with and why they think it’s been hijacked. Nothing to do with women incels at all. So it seems to me that you’re understanding of feminism was incorrect which is possibly why you came to the conclusion that the modern feminist movement is similar to red pill ideology.

It has always been about making sure men and women are treated as fairly as possible. That has historically taken the form of advocating for women because women have obviously been treated unequally in our world. 

You are also subscribing to the belief that it is purely a movement to treat women better because the definition of feminism has changed. There are many feminists who understand just how damaged men are in this conversation as well and would sacrifice to support them- yaknow, like treating people equally and trying to advocate for equality.

If you don't think that women AND men get mistreated heavily by society you are very wrong. There has never been a successful movement for male empowerment, and yet men are arguably struggling in just as many areas in life as women are. Feminism should be coming to the rescue of these men as well as empowering women. But modern feminism is not about equality as it always been historically. It is mostly self interested and I can tell by your words you fall into that same selfishness.

This discussion was not supposed to be about feminism however, and it's kind of ironic that this conversation about a space where originally men were being empowered (before it turned to complete garbage) has devolved into a purely feminist conversation. 

Name one successful movement strictly for men. I'll wait. It doesn't exist even though men arguably need way more help then women in many regards (I don't think I need to tell a woman how badly socialized, miserable and destructive a lot of men are.)

But I definitely could've handled the interaction better, and it's for that part that I apologize. I'd have a really bad taste in my mouth if things were to end here, so allow me to ramble, for a bit.

It's good to know that you're undergoing therapy, at the very least. May it successfully lead you to what you seek. I'm aware at how shallow that sounds, but I mean it, and there's no way to wish you well in this situation without sounding pretentious.

There's probably also zero advice I can give that your therapists haven't given already over the years of treatment, let alone any that would make me come across as less ignorant. I do want to be helpful, but that'd just add insult to injury, so I'll just stay shut. Just, for the record, I don't wish for bad things to happen to you. I may not like who you are currently, but I don't want you to come to harm. Those feelings aren't mutually exclusive.

I remember now, around a year ago I had a pretty toxic argument with a person similar to you (but wayyyyyyy more angry and seemingly devoid of empathy). After seeing a few rants on their post history, though, (I know I should stop doing that, it's a dirty move) it really dawned on me how trapped they were feeling and how they were ultimately just searching for happiness, despite doing and saying some really fucked up shit along the way. So I left them an honest, down-to-earth message wishing them well, and hoping that they'd achieve their goals.

I'd gotten comebacks and insults to every reply until that point, but it surprised me when that message didn't get any reply. That was the end of our conversation. This is almost definitely pretentious, but I like to think my words left at least a tiny imprint on them, or gave them a flicker of hope, if only temporarily. Selfish of me to think that, I know, but what can I really say. This apologetic tone I've had in this entire comment is probably pretentious too, I know that as well. But it's the best I can really do, and I can't think of anything else. I'm trying my best not be offensive, but you don't have to excuse me. I'm kind of overstaying my welcome here, anyway.

Anyhow, I tried searching up their account a few months after the incident, to see if they were doing any better or worse, but apparently their account was suspended, and still is to this day. I might never know if they're doing good or not, heck I don't even know if I deserve to know how they're doing. I can just hope that they're alright.

I... honestly don't know what the point of me telling you all this is. But I hope you were able to get even a tiny bit out of these ramblings. You're doing much, much better than that other person was at the time, so at least take pride in that, I guess.

There's really no telling what that person is doing nowadays. Hopefully they are doing well and they just deleted their account. 

This was not shallow or pretentious. I appreciate you coming back. And I understand where you're coming from. Trust me I of all people really do understand. I know I'm a negative person. Really negative. I can't see good in just about anything. It's a major character flaw that I am trying to change. A character flaw that I've been dealing with for 38 years or longer I mean I was raised this way and I'm 50 years old. 

A major problem in that is finding a therapist that will actually challenge me. That will actually tell me what's wrong with me. Or tell me what I'm doing wrong. It feels like they're all walking on eggshells around me and there are scared to tell me what they really want to tell me. Or they don't have a clue what to tell me and they just sit there. I must be intimidating. 

This might help a little bit understand where I'm coming from. 

One example of what I deal with. 

I'm crying this morning right? Been up since 2:30 a.m.. My brain is spinning out of control. 
Currently there's a lot of stuff going on around the house that's making me stress pretty hard. 
So I'm chatting with my mother this morning at 6:00 a.m.. 
I'm telling her about stuff that's going on and what I need to do. 
She comes at me with. ""You'll never find a partner that you're happy with, ever"" 

Say what??? 

Who in their right mind tells their own kid this? 

This is one tiny example of what I deal with constantly around here. 

I'm not sure if she was trying to help or what. 

Basically what it comes down to when she said this. 
Was that I would make a terrible housewife because I don't like being a housewife. 

To which I replied. 
I actually like being a housewife if I'm being taken care of. 
Mentally, financially, and physically. 

Meaning I need some support mentally. 
I may need a little help financially here and there. (For  the most part I can carry myself)
And yeah some physical touch would be nice. 

I will clean the house all day long if I get those three things. You can work, You can help support me and I will take care of everything around here. 

But that's not ever the case is it? I'm non-stop cleaning and picking up after someone that doesn't want to do any of those three things for me. 

Anyways.

jwh1k3e,t1_jwfun5p,2023-08-16 19:23:14,selfimprovement,"Well uh damn this conversation took a turn I didn't expect. I really appreciate you responding to me, too. Looking back I did use the word ""pretentious"" one too many times but I read a long rant on a sub for depressed lonely people once that made me really cautious of not coming across as an ass to people who have issues under their belt.

Like for example, when it comes to the well-wishers who don't actually do anything to help besides... wishing well. Or those that pop in to say a quick ""have you tried <xyz>"" thinking it will help solve all their problems even though <xyz> was one of the very first things amongst dozens that the advisee had tried.

The rant also talked about how people get defensive and say ""I was just trying to help"" when their suggestions get rehected and all, which is annoying to deal with if it happens too often.

Anyway, that aside. I understand wanting someone to challange your beliefs, I've been there too (albeit for different reasons). It's a really empty feeling, and you end up feeling intellectually unstimulated. Your situation also has the added nuance of people seemingly stepping around issues and not telling you what you don't want to hear.

I don't really know you or what your specific issues are, but it seems to me the crux of dealing with the main symptom (negative responses) is to practice ignoring impulses, is that right? I don't have much experience in coping with impulsivity, though there's a few things I know of that have personally helped. You might know of them already, but here they are anyway:

One quote/mantra that really saves me from engaging in unhealthy discourse sometimes is ""He who is silent, is saved."" Its brevity gives you something to think about. Silent, when? Saved, from what? Those are for the reader to decide.

Another thing that's helpful sometimes is suddenly putting the interaction into perspective. Does saying this really matter? What will happen if I don't, vs. if I do? Is it really worth the effort? I lose all energy to say anything when I think this way though, it can be a bit of a double-edged sword at times.

Something that helped me in an argument recently was using a premade statement to prevent a tangent. I was about to blurt out an emotional response, but somehow I paused and instead said, ""do you really think that's an appropriate thing to bring up right now?"". That made the other person quiet down, and we returned to the main topic. Notice how I said ""appropriate thing"". Place the onus on the thing, not whether it was appropriate of the other person to bring that up or not.

Another tip I've heard works but haven't put into much practice yet is to apologize *immediately* after you realize you've done something wrong, even if right after the fact. It feels douchey, like, you've JUST messed up and now you're expecting the other person to forgive you? But in actuality, even if the other person doesn't forgive you then and there, it calms them down immensely, allows them to digest what just happened, and forgive you in a shorter duration of time than if you had just let it simmer.

One thing that's hard to stop doing is making a disagreement about yourself, and honestly I don't know how to fix it. It's hard to explain what's so wrong about it in the moment, but what I've noticed is that it escalates and derails a conflict, widening the scope of the issue into something much larger when it's really not. It shifts the focus of the argument away from the actual problem that was being discussed, and lots of feelings get hurt in the inevitable semantics to come. Often, the other person gives into frustration and may say things they don't really mean, or agree with your remarks as a comeback.

I haven't studied the phenomenon, but I'm pretty sure it's born out of self-pity. Being aware and letting yourself acknowledge that your situation sucks is healthy, but using it as the reason things aren't going your way is where the ""poor me"" starts to kick in; you start to blame things that don't go your way onto ""the universe hates me"" or ""you guys must have something against me"" or ""nobody wants to see who I am"".

It's a viscious cycle to break out of, and I wish I had tips to help you out on it. Recognizing the behaviour in the moment is a huge first step though. Allow yourself to go back on statements, and come back to talking about what really matters. The apology tip is useful in conjunction with this.


Anyway. That's all I have for now. After talking to you like this, you seem like a genuinely heartfelt individual. I'm sorry for judging you so soon, or rather, not thinking about the implications of what my judgement revealed. This comment is ridiculously long, so don't worry about responding to specific points, an overall reply is still fine.

I don't mind reading long replies at all, quite the opposite actually, but I don't want you to spend more time than needed or do anything that'd burn you out. We can also talk elsewhere if you want.

I totally get you! What something was written in mind with and what it specifically means to you will always be slightly different, and that disparity is part of what causing the feeling, I think. It's really interesting to me. You can never truly realize your thoughts in full completeness, just hope the other person is able to ""land"" that jump of meaning. Good communicators make those gaps smaller and smaller for each other. Bad communication is basically when you're given obscured information, long jumps if you were to go with my analogy :>

Focus on being friends with yourself and treating yourself like you would anyone else you liked. That’s true healing. We learn how to value others above ourselves in order to survive as kids.

I don’t believe that survivors of this kind of abuse are inherently going to be unhealthy partners. I don’t think we contribute to toxic dynamics by allowing ourselves to trust and believe in the wrong people. We deserve to be cherished and loved and safe with ourselves and with someone who will respect us. It might take a while to heal, but every potential partner out there also has flaws. What makes a good partner is being someone who recognizes the traits that are unhealthy within ourselves, and works actively on them. It sounds like you’re doing that, and you’ve already got some amazing communication skills and self awareness. I’d love to have a partner like that. It’s really important to be aware of the signs of toxic and abusive people, set firm boundaries and feel comfortable enforcing them before getting back into dating, and the process of finding partners afterwards can be a long game. I still haven’t opened myself up to that yet either, but I don’t believe this trauma causes us to be unworthy of receiving love in the future.

I actually think philosophy and educating my world view is a huge part of starting to have my own opinion and speak up when someone says something i consider wrong.

About the conspiracy part. You just have to watch documentaries on some really evil things humans have done and that will do it. But this can also lead to me feeling very depressed and that's not so productive.

I made a spreadsheet for myself with the columns: My behavior/traits, Examples, Possible explanations, and Path to improvement. For example, I have been a very shallow adult, judging people's values by their looks, their achievements, and their social status. I realized that my parents and the adults in my community only praised me when I did well in school and earned trophies and kept myself pretty to attract a man.

My husband had CPTSD and was physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused and he’s on medication. He and his trauma therapist literally and truly cured his CPTSD. My friends are all traumatized and fucked up by their parents and upbringing. They have not seen therapists and try to rely on books and other non professional resources. Guess how they’re doing? Not great. We’re in our 30s and none of them are in good relationships. I have a lot of personal and professional experience with mental health issues and family trauma. Books and podcasts aren’t personalized enough and a lot of people need specific treatment plans.

OP may benefit a little from non professional resources, but she’s got too much going on for it to really make a difference enough for her to truly be in a healthy relationship. I know as someone who also dated and got really fucked up mentally, emotionally, and physically by narcissists and abusers for years.

I’ve never really been able to see “bad people”. I’ve always been an extremely open and trusting individual, I struggle to see people as anything but potential energy capable of anything once they are able to break free from their mental struggles, and we all are struggling on the inside. To get out of one’s own mind and live in the moment, not worrying about your past or future, is one of the things I’ve always struggled with the most but man, when you’re able to just be grateful in the exact moment you’re in, it’s like clarity and the fog is lifted, if only for a moment. 

Identifying toxic behaviors is something I’ve had to put a lot of effort into as well, I try not to label people as bad or good, but toxicity exists in all of us and if we can identify our own toxicity, and in others, we can work on our own problems and help our loved ones work through theirs as well. 

Anyway that’s my rant lol, you’ll definitely get there and it is not a race. Identifying the toxicity in yourself and others is one of the best practices you can engage in along with mindfulness in my opinion, good luck to you in your journey and I hope I don’t come off as condescending, I feel like I can relate a lot though, as if I’ve been there, honestly me being a male and you being a female probably makes a huge difference than I am unaware of and I apologize.

I stopped feeling obligated to do favours for people and said no if I actually didn’t feel like it and said yes if I genuinely wanted to. 

Not suppressing emotions all the time if something pisses you off don’t try and hide it behind some passive aggressive behaviour just let it out.

So, it talks about how to release the trauma stored inside you - through things like massage, yoga, exercise, etc. - this is a gross understatement of all of the knowledge the book offers. Also, the thing that makes it really effective is that I went through therapy at the same time. Did a lot of journaling.

I like my therapist now, though it took me over a decade and thousands of dollars spent to find them, and they don't specialize in trauma. 

My friends and I are not doing very well either for the same reasons, but the reality I bump into very often and would like to highlight is that hardly anyone is, outside of the most affluent of people. 

I could go into it but this is a dark time and it is especially for healthcare in the usa.

What I should have said is just that I think your phrasing might not be helpful for everyone, because the majority of people who read this might not ever in their life have a chance to even try. So saying that anyone of us who can't access that method of help isn't capable of a healthy relationship is somewhat saying mentally ill people of a lower class should feel bad or like failures for wanting to date, maybe?

And people DO and will date, even if they aren't healthy, and for unhealthy reasons, but free resources can give those of us that can't afford good treatment from a good dr. in a good state perspective at least. For example there are podcasts that could potentially help people recognize and avoid narcissists, or contextualize their abuse through sociology.

They could absolutely live their lives without going to the doctor, they could never check their insulin, they could try and reduce their carb intake on their own. But without testing, doctor visits, insulin, etc. they will never be as healthy as they could be with it and they’ll probably lose a couple limbs or stroke out. 

OP NEEDS therapy with what she has going on. People don’t simply overcome parentification on their own. She needs to go through reparenting which only a trained therapist can do for her. She can try on her own but like… there’s a reason therapists are trained for it. It’s way too painful and scary to go through on your own, and it’s a skill that needs to be taught correctly. OP can absolutely date but until she get this sorted out her relationships are going to continue to suffer whether or not she’s with a narcissist, and from her post it sounds like she knows this.

I didn’t say she needs to see a trauma therapist RIGHT now, I said she needs to. Even seeing a therapist for a few months is helpful.

For example; my mom would sometimes crawl in my bed starting at age 7, crying and wanting me to hold her. It scared me, but I did it. I spent most my life caring for my mother in these ways. It makes you angry, confused, scared and even disgusted sometimes because of how she’d intrude on my personal space and life. There were zero healthy or average boundaries, ever. The rest of my family knew her illness & did nothing. They let her be that way with me and demonized me for failing at it. 

For those like OP & me, there is hope of recovery. I grew up to work in pediatric behavioral health & am now a specialized private nanny (less stress/burnout). I don’t talk to my mother or that side of my family & am eons better for it. I had to learn how to be a functional human being with a lot going against me.

The rise of the aforementioned are closely tied to the increase in use of social media (I can't link studies here but you can find many if you google), and it's important to not look at just these specific subcultures, but to recognize the pattern of niche subcultures and polarization happening across the board everywhere as a result of frequent social media use.

I think its not helpful to suggest that everything is within our power. Acceptance is within our power. Learning to accept other’s agency. Learning to let go of bad expectations. Those are good things. 

Telling people that having really good social skills or confidence will allow them to have everything they want is not realistic or helpful.",heliokeel,t2_aqa5pykf,3,0,reddit4

You are being hella biased just because you are part of the average/ above average.I am also in the above average i would think so i got no issues with dating, but i do believe your statement is pretty trash.

In a pool of 100 people doing the same thing, there can be only 1 top one, 1 will be the worst.Nothing you can do about that, no matter how hard that person on last place will try to improve, he might get to 2nd worst place but then someone else takes his place as worst.There will always be single people that by no means are defective in many departments, just not as good as the rest.

Same with the dating pool, some folk just got the bad genes or from a competitive standpoint are in the lower spectrum.Put in everyone's personal prefferences/body types and all that and the gap only grows larger.You might say there are almost equal ammount of women out there for the ammount of men, but then my point of preference comes in, so that's why not everyone couples up.I mean, gonna sound rude, but you wont really take that chick that is a 3 and acts like trash, just cuz she is the only one left? or the 10 chick that is a dead fish persona? Hipotethically speaking.

From a realistic point, we can look worldwide or just at the USA.50% of adults are single, 50% are deffo not redpilled or weaboos. And a lot of them probably want a partner but can't find what they need or be accepted for what they are. (even if fine, but just the lesser pick)And of that 50%, 18% are 4ever singles, while the rest are divorcees or whatever other reason.  
You gonna tell me 18% of the country is red pilled? For the 4ever alone guys n gals.  
That's a big number.

Can also compare other countries, but its kind of a similar issue everywhere.",Liu_Xiang,t2_fkytr,1,0,reddit4

1). Men especially mid aged have it tough if you are not in the top I would say 10-15%. The is not much for you in line .  I hsve to defend this all the time.  Go to your listings how many men posted yesterday?   How many women ?   The women have so much to choose they can’t even write them back.  This is the truth I have find it with women it’s fact.

2) women rarely say ya know I’m not feeling it I’m gonna move on.  Usually from my experience they find some small thing blow it out if our portion and make your fault.  This leads to some sour grapes. 

3). Women whine cry have threads about all the horrible things that happened.  He lied about his age ?   At least they are doing something,  I truly believe they are more powerful.  They can win a custody battle with a drug habit.  Get you arrested with a sentence.  The crowd won’t argue.  Even most men will approve .  They don’t want to be sexist pigs which more or less is the choice here.  It seems every time they are at odds.  There they are driving their golf balls 20yards ahead of us.  

It’s so easy to throw shit at mid aged white males.  But make a ordinary personal ad go try your luck.  How are we supposed to feel.  Yes we feel   We are targeted for cash at every single turn on line .  Fake dating sites penis pills women trying to do the old gift card or pay pal scams for whatever reason.  Some have a gift registry like for a wedding for you to unlock their hearts?  To say this field is slanted is like saying the Harlem globetrotters might lose today.  It’s that lopsided.  I only wish they would enjoy themselves and quit bitching about us.  Be a good winner stop telling us we needed to lose .  Abd if we do we have “woman issues “.  Or “pouty little baby’s “.

You have SO many options/avenues to better yourself, and someone will find the things you chose attractive.

Snowboarding and (playing) sports are hobbies. You learn, grow and progress in the act of doing them. Painting, singing, learning an instrument, rebuilding a classic car, etc.

Video games and anime are entertainment. You passively consume your time, gain no real quantifiable improvement from participating, and ultimately have nothing to show for it other than your ranking.

I'm not trying to be a dick here, but I read this and immediately thought ""If she posts about relationships at all then guaranteed her posts contradict this"" 

This is always what women say to men who are struggling romantically but it seems to rarely be backed up by their actual actions. And honestly, that's fine, people are attracted to what they're attracted to, but it doesn't help these people to give them an idealized version of reality as opposed to just reality.

Not trying to call you out, just illustrate the point I was trying to make with actions usually contradicting the advice. I know I can't know the full story or anything like that.

You've got guy #1 who considers you his best friend and who apparently has been emotionally supportive for years and generous financially and his family has been kind and caring towards you. Has professed love for you twice over the years.

>But no, I am simply not romantically interested in him, and will never be.

Then guy #2 who you are actually attracted to.

>""crushing"" on a person I barely know for months

>there is no chance this person and I would have a loving relationship

>I can't even speak openly to him - and he judges me hard

>the traits I love about him ... assertive; shameless; reckless; ""open"" (says what he thinks).

>he comes off judgmental regarding women (hence, me); and I am scared of being judged by him

>he's already distanced himself from me

Although I don't really see the contradiction with guy #1, as I am simply not attracted to him - this post (mine and also OPs) is not about how to attract a certain woman which you choose; but how to ""attract"" persons in general, and being authentic is a huge thing in that. Guy #1 who is in love with me but whose romantics feelings I don't share hasn't been authentic and has been ""working"" to get me although I clearly said no very early. That's chasing and it doesn't work; also, it is unattractive. I didn't know that I'm basically not interesting for him unless he can be in a relationship with me. He is a classical ""nice guy"" as in the phenomenon, and there's a huge difference between genuinely authentic and kind persons and ""nice guys"" who are nice as long as they can hope for a (sexual) relationship.

&#x200B;

I did make my own experience in ""chasing"" too, which would be guy #2, which is a crush - as opposed to ""being in love"", hence I've been posting about this here a lot to figure out what's going on. I haven't been forcing myself on him as I knew it'd lead to nothing, I have been secretly crushing (and viewing it as my own emotional issue due to how unrealistic the idea was) and trying to deal with that here, so it really doesn't have anything to do with dating, or love. (I rather meet and get to know people IRL when I'm doing my city trips)

Can't even say I was ""attracted"" to him, I was idealizing him not even knowing who he is. It was all online, I don't know if he is physically attractive or not. (although, his plus was clearly that he's authentic in what he says. he never lied. guy #1 did a lot.)

Also, I come from an abusive family which (gladly I am aware of) sadly makes me feel more drawn to more abuse. But due to being aware of that I also know that this isn't what I am genuinely searching for when looking for love. I do crush for it; but I won't indulge; as I'm still in the process of healing.

&#x200B;

So yeah, to understand why guy 2 was more ""interesting"" to me: he always spoke the truth. Whether I hurt from that or not, he was reckless about it. As long as people are not being ""honest assholes"" (add insults to it) but just \*saying the truth\* (like you ""call me out here"" :)) it's all good. We need truths. We need them anyway, but they're extra helpful in relationships, to maintain them.",,,11,0,reddit4

Which are very important real life skills and help you navigate a shit ton of situations every day. Gaming helps with speed of thought-reaction and a lot of swearing. Not to mention that I don’t know of anyone who’s addicted to books but gaming addiction just like internet addiction and any addiction is a thing. There have been people who’ve killed or died because of it. If you spend upwards of 6 hours a day on gaming alone, you’re probably not just engrossed. But it’s also a matter of social views. People who read a lot have historically been the smart people. People who play games a lot are viewed as childish lazy bums. Which in the case of addiction it eventually checks out. And when it comes to anime, there are plenty of people who begin to lose contact with reality. Think Bovarianism but in “waifu” mode. Also the degree to which you become engrossed audio-visually theough anime and games is much greater or at the very least very different than when you do that with books. Gaming is more entertainment and it’s made to be that way. Which is why you can withstand to spend hours doing it while reading requires a great deal more attention and counscious effort which translates to more intentional use of mental resources so it tires you out faster and you often pause to think or get lost in thought about this or that idea, you make connections, you produce new thoughts as a result. Your brain is working by itself. You need breaks to relax your eyes as well. In games there’s a lot more action and a lot less of your brain doing all the work. Video games are more beneficial when it comes to team work (if it’s required), socialization I guess or hands-mind coordination, things like that.

The training I underwent to improve in first person shooters is akin to some kind of mental bootcamp. Anticipating tactics of other players, learning to react faster and faster while moving your character faster and faster requires intense coordination. The thing is: while it was sometimes fun, it really felt like training. I was tired and drained after a long session, as bigger achievements (like longer kill streaks and more impressive kills) became achievable and I was improving. I found that after stopping that training, I have retained all the benefits mentally. I'm physically sharper in real life thanks to that, not just hand-eye coordination but processing speed and I even have more physical energy.

h0vs4r2,t1_h0q9g0i,2021-06-07 06:29:49,selfimprovement,"No... it’s because if you’re a man with a huge belly and half balding in a relationship with a woman who’s pretty, thin and well kept and smiles at you and holds your hand, you have to be something of a person if you got someone that’s more attractive than you. Same goes the other way. On the rare occasions that I saw it, a woman who was less attractive with a man that was clearly more attractive, she was a very good, very fun and vivatious person and that’s her charm. It’s not all about looks for *some* people. Because people have eyes and I can very well see when someone is more attractive than someone else, you can spin whatever narrative you want in your head indefinitely to protect you from the truth and absolve you from any responsibility by passing it onto everything else that moves, but at the end of the day, you obsessively clinging onto those concepts and to this bitterness and attributing “UNATTRACTIVE” as the label for your identity, will only fuck you up and no one else. Self destruction by the textbook. I’m not speaking as someone who’s above you and at the same time who’s never had to deal with this kind of hardship. I’ve been that person. And as that person, nobody ever gave me the light of day. Because I sucked. Who wants to be with someone like that. I didn’t. If I had to be with myself, I would have ran. That’s what broke it to me. You should think about that. Or don’t. No skin off my back, I don’t care either way. You make your own choices, you reap the results. Also women aren’t just seamingly more attractive. On average, almost all females put enormous amount of time and effort on their appearance, style, makeup, hair, even when it’s supposed to be a relaxed day, you have the “efortless” style that’s anything bit effortless. We constantly worry about “marketability”. Obviously you’ll have a population of humans that look better on average because they constantly stress over it and it’s the death of you if you don’t, people don’t give you a second look romantically (relationship wise) if you’re not all prim and fresh out of the box as a woman. I got very different reactions even in stores when I was done up vs when I wasn’t. People are more rude to you cause they think you’re a low confidence low level animal if you’re to think about it insinctually. On average (I said on average, not your case specifically, before you project) guys don’t give as much of a shit about their looks and appearance wise they put exponentially less effort. Throw a t shirt on and a pair of jeans, some hair spray, deodorant, wash your face, optionally a watch and you’re good to go. All the men I’ve ever known are like that and many of them do even less than that. A lot of married men don’t even buy their own clothes, or don’t know where they have their clothes from because their wives are clohing them like they’re little kids. And the same men complain about this and that about dating. My dude. We’re all monkeys. Some of us give astronomical shits about how we do things, how we look, when and how to time things, how to cater to the other person’s feelings without discounting our own. How to make a good inpression. Like the list is endless and it makes me crazy just to think about it. So I won’t. I feed, clothe and make myself up the way I like and try and be decent as much as I feel I can and I catch more people like that. But if I don’t, I move on. I’m alright with the idea of never finding someone too. The natural world isn’t perfect, happily ever after is (a lie) either sheer luck or a lot of work and I know that not everyone gets it. And I might not either. Especially if I don’t know what it looks like to recognize the opportunity if it does appear. Your indication is whether or not you have people that actively want to be around you who aren’t your family and aren’t romantic interests. If you don’t have that, then it’s probably you who’s the problem. If you have that, then it might be the people you’re chasing are the wrong kind etc. But clearly, that’s not the issue, the issue is that you’re living in a parallel universe from the rest of the world where there are factions of the population called normies, chad and stacies I presume and where all is lost if you’re not a fucking greek god (which news flash, 95% of the population isn’t and the Earth is still overpopulated so go figure why that is. People have sex. That’s why. Non greek gods people. All over the place. It’s you, believe me) If men were so scrutinized by looks as you claim, we’d all have been extinct by now because they certainly don’t break their backs with caring. There’s a reason for why men ostracize each other if they care too much about their appearance. It’s because it’s been an exclusively feminine trait up until the 21st century. And people still think about it that way. The popular thought is that it’s masculine to be a basically sweaty hairy monkey who grunts. Ok. You won’t get any of this anyway so I’ll wrap up.

h0nwfjc,t1_h0moyxn,2021-06-05 07:40:25,selfimprovement,"I’ve been thinking on how to explain what I had in mind so I hope this comes out coherent enough. People who have failed in life by society’s standards present a very specific set of behavious from what I’ve observed. Some cope with it by employing certain defense mechanisms that idealize their way of living as being superior and how society is rotten so they’re somehow doing something great by not participating in it but deep down it’s a way to compensate for feeling inadequate and lost. Some are just in deep depression over feeling helpless. Basically they try to justify their failures (and poor personal care) in certain ways and if you get involved with them, shove them down your throat. There’s definitely some developmental issues at play and they cannot adjust. I think this is what I had in mind. Regardless of what’s happening in their lives, they are not viable partners and it is very obvious why it would be valid to reject them. A lack of a chronic sense of responsibility is usually at play. I am talking about a very specific sector of the population, not depressed people who can barely function and have basic human skills but can’t use them, just to be clear. But at the end of the day, yeah, you’re right, you don’t know how and why some people end up being so messed up and you do feel for them. But it’s not your responsibility to insert yourself in a mess and bear the scars for or with them. At some point people either learn to be responsible for themselves or they don’t and they usually don’t end up well and that’s heartbreaking.

On average, females rate age, education, intelligence, income, trust, and emotional connection around 9 to 14 points higher than males on our 0–100 scale range. Our relative importance analysis shows greater male priority for attractiveness and physical build, compared to females, relative to all other traits. Using multiple regression analysis, we find a consistent statistical sex difference (males relative to females) that decreases linearly with age for aesthetics, while the opposite is true for resources and personality, with females exhibiting a stronger relative preference, particularly in the younger aged cohort.""

jf03hjo,t3_12c0ou5,2023-04-05 02:26:17,selfimprovement,"The isolation can actually be a good thing. Let me explain. How do you think people connected before social media? Before social media, for over 3000 years people actually met up and hung out. The problem with social media is it gives people the illusion of connection but you still feel lonely as ever. People are depressed more than ever because of this medium of communication that was only recently invented. 

Why do people feel lonely? Loneliness is an emotion your body produces in order to get you to seek community. It’s the reason why any emotions exist. Emotions are just mechanisms biology has produced over billions of years to aid survival. The idea is you in ancient times you had a higher chance of survival being with a tribe, as any organism left on its own had a high risk of mortality. 

In todays age, you will not physically die from loneliness as you once would have. You die a metaphorical “long death” because your body is sending you these negative impulses and emotions and you have no recourse in rectifying them. In the wild one would probably inevitably perish due to lack of resources. 

But what does this all mean? The feeling you’re feeling is your body’s “alarm” for telling you to seek community and companionship. So adaptation is required at this point. Start hanging out and socializing more in real life situations. Go out, meet people. Make new friends. It’s how the world satiated that feeling of loneliness before social media. It seems like that idea has been long forgotten that humans are not supposed to only connect through screens. 

If the lack of social skills is preventing this from happening (not trying to assume), those will have ti be learned first. However do not see the feeling of loneliness as a bad thing necessarily. Yes it’s bad if you don’t do anything about it. But there’s a reason why the emotion exists and it’s your body’s way of telling you, you need to get out and talk to people because being in a group of 2 people is better than one.",FiftyNereids,t2_uklkp,64,0,reddit1

If anyone dismisses you for not having it, are these the types of people you want in your life?

You are currently learning self soothing skills as well as how to build real, meaningful, in-actual-life relationships. You won’t rely on bragging, or only doing things if you can post about it. You’ll be able to enjoy the moment for you. 

What you’re describing is all short term, and the benefits of living your life to the fullest without worrying about others is going to extend throughout your career, your personal life, and all the relationships that have yet to come.

At the same time, I deleted/went through the following of several other social media-like accounts of mine (reddit, tiktok, youtube) in the same manner, and where i felt like it was better to just delete the app/account, I did so (tiktok).

Its not always easy to stop scrolling on instagram, but normally if i am scrolling for too long, I'll meet the end of ""my"" feed and it says im all caught up or whatever and I try to stop scrolling before I get all caught up but in case I dont, I use it as a reminder to get off my phone and do literally anything else

again, its not easy, but its also challenging to not have social media at all. imho social media presence is very important in today's society (society🤓), but you have to be able to moderate your usage.

I’m a shut in 18 year old girl, i haven’t seen my friends since 2021, 2 of them it’s been over a year. None of them reach out to me, some have cut me off because i’m too depressed even though i never burden them or trauma dump. 
The only friends i had were online; but they turned out to be toxic and horrible. It often haunts me. Besides my parents and siblings i am quite literally alone. I rarely connect with people, i’m often ignored or brushed off if i start a conversation. I know people are busy though and have lives whilst i don’t, so i never hold it personally. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt though. 

I feel so disconnected and alone - but due to my lifestyle all i do is dwell on the internet, and i’m a pretty vulnerable person.

But I will say, we, as humans, never were supposed to be paying attention to people's ""stories"" consistently throughout each day. I think, that in my situation, I only use instagram/snapchat because I am a single male. Other than for business purposes, which are very valid purposes, I really don't feel like there's any true value in it.

At one point in time, I did a really smart thing and made multiple instagram accounts. But let me tell you why this can be genius. I had a personal account, followed a thousand accounts, skateboarding, music, friends, fitness, etc. But, even though I love skateboarding, I don't necessarily want to see it all day everyday. Or, I don't really care about certain sorority girls posts, muting is now more of a thing. 

But, compartmentalizing a health instagram, was an amazing move. I learned so much about food, fitness, health, etc.. and I didn't get bombarded with irrelevant posts. I would CHOOSE to see the type's of posts that the particular account was geared towards. 

But, in your situation, personally, if you're doing fine without it, I would workout, learn new skills, get certifications, figure out how to integrate ChatGPT with 3rd party applications. And legit focus all of your efforts into making REAL legal tender. Otherwise, you're just helping SOMEONE else make that money (Zuckerberg, The google guys, etc). If you can leverage social media to make money. Then do it. You don't need personal accounts.

But as far as your personal social life, I hated COVID. I changed my life ZERO percent. I chose to go out and talk to people IRL vs sit in my home in fear everyday. I am a skateboarder so I have a ""counter-culture"" mindset in a lot of ways. But see the purpose to laws and people's rights. I'm no anarchist. But the reason I include that is, I didn't let COVID stop my life one bit. In fact, I had deleted it all again when covid struck. And it took about 2 years to regain all of my real life connections as my only followers.

But skate, surf, snowboard, hike, go to the bar one night, create a business that helps people, learn e-commerce, real money, real relationships, are WAY more important than you being on instagram for 2hrs a day with 0 tangible value in return.

This way it still “keeps u in the loop” of exchanging socials but keeps u mindful in your media usage. My own personal issue with the scrolling and other apps is 1. Time management and 2. Comparison and insecurity.

Honestly, all I have to say to this is it's for the better, bro. You made a good choice, please know that. It definitely is obvious to know that you are isolated especially when statements are made that only those with social media would get, aha. However, I'd much rather have a small group of actual people as friends vs hundreds or thousands of people who wouldn't even remember that I died. Furthermore, I'd much rather have real relationships than those only for social media. Real connections, ya know?

When I DO get brushed off or dismissed for not having social media, I audibly think ""Thank goodness, I nearly wasted my time."" Everyone is free to do as they wish, but those who are chained by social media who bash others for not also being chained? Yeah, I'm very happy to be dismissed by them:) Having a conversation without either party looking at their phone for 5 minutes is absolute bliss, honestly.

My advice is to pay more attention to your surroundings and to the people you talk to. NOT to say you don't. It's just that while everyone looks at their phones, you can see the Present all the more clearly. Sounds roundabout, but trust me.",bluebamboo9,t2_ewmwmyvq,1,0,reddit1

I can't stand Facebook, just logging onto that site makes me cringe every single time, and I only use it for business purposes and are hardly ever active. 

What's going on in my life is nobody's damn buisness and I like to keep it that way. Could really give a rats ass what everybody else is doing also.

I only use Messenger to keep in touch with certain people, and that's it. Twitter is the worst of them all and I'm so glad I totally quit that place. That platform will always showcase the very worst from what the world has to offer.

The problem with SM is that they hardly represent real life and you rarely achieve anything but just wasting time and energy.

Thus, whenever I go out in the city and walk around normal people, I actually see the world for what it truly is, not what people on SM make it out to be.

SM can be just fine as long as you manage to maintain a healthy balance but I'd much rather just be social in the REAL world instead.

Try using SM for a year and then just go on a vacation to another country for a month and then see how you feel when you come back home. Chances are you'll never ever want to be on SM again.

If you utilize social media, learn to do it in a way that *benefits you.* Unfortunately, the internet is an echo chamber. People are looking for confirmation that they way they believe or the way they feel is shared- and it creates a safe haven for that. The issue is, even when you're looking at positive content, there will be comments that are incredibly negative. For example. I always feared getting cheated on. I would read subreddits with hosts of stories of people cheating, and every fun and happy relationship post on instagram was *filled* with comments about how it's all a lie, how they'll be cheated on, etc. It lead me to form the opinion that it was basically inevitable. And that any odd behavior should be seen as a red flag. I had to recognize that it wasn't normal. Not everybody cheats, not everybody will hurt you, and it's not really the end of the world if they did. So I stopped reading those subreddits, and I started liking and saving posts that were motivational, or about breaking down behaviors that I have that do more harm than good. It is not easy to do. But social media can really just be what you make of it. My feed is better, I don't post, and all I really do is scroll instagram and share videos between my partner and I. These people on instagram don't have perfect lives, and nothing you find on there is worthy of impacting your self-esteem.

If someone wants to stay in touch, they will, through text, phone calls or email.


This is such a weird take. You're just creating extra steps for people to contact you and somehow concluding that if they're not calling or emailing (lol) they don't care. It doesn't mean they don't care. You've just removed yourself from their normal sphere of communication. 

I understand if someone doesn't want Instagram, doesn't want Facebook. But this ""if they really cared they would call"" is something I don't vibe with.

I require my managers to start with a diverse slate and we later track where things land.  That said, the managers have very explicit instructions, HIRE THE BEST CANDIDATE!!!! PERIOD!  No excuses!  If they don’t hire good candidates they will have an underperforming team and I’ll put them on a performance plan.  That’s the real world.  

So can you get a conversation being diverse, yes you can, of course.  You do get a bit of a pass to start, that’s truth.  But from there if you don’t present yourself well, have quality effort, and impress us, you DONT get the role.  That’s it!

What you tell your friends.  “Fuck off, not my fault I’m a stud!”  They are hating because you nailed it and landed a great gig.

1. attempts at humor can go badly at the best of times
2. saying insulting things that you don't actually mean is a common sign of friendship (at least among the young white Americans I'm friends with)
3. As part of number #2, people will often intentionally say the things that others would avoid as a way of showing that that thing isn't an issue to them. Think calling your fat friends ""fatass"" or making a joke about a one-eyed guy's depth perception or calling a cripple friend's high-tech wheel-chair ""the cripple caddy"".  What is ""too far"" depends on the people involved and what they believe, there isn't a single standard for all people.
4. People who haven't experienced something often simply have no way to understand it, so if you don't point out that something is hurtful even when you know it wasn't intended as such, you can't expect them to understand the way you feel.

Also, remember that letting things like that go signals to them that YOU like THEM and that white people (like everyone else) don't like it when they feel they are being treated with a different set of rules than others would be.

White people (like me relax) sometimes make insensitive jokes about race simply because we have no shared experience there at all so often don't know realize something may be offensive. Not an excuse just an explanation. Personally I'm aware enough to not say something like that at least haha.

Otherwise likely they're just jelly. Are you friends black? If yeah then they're 100% jelly I'd guess.

Try to figure out if they were joking. It's still wrong but obviously if they were thinking they were just making a dumb ""guy type"" joke (like a harmless put down in their minds) it's just a matter of clarifying that's not something you joke about.

Depends on your friends. In my closest friend group (me and my ""day ones"", so to speak), I can freely let someone know if something they said rubbed me the wrong way and they'll readily apologize. We all developed this weird way of confessing our true feelings by acting and talking like little children to each-other but we've been friends since grade school so your ""friends"" you mention may be a different kind of friend group.

At the end of the day, I would just straight up tell them that what they said really rubbed you the wrong way and say some of what you said in this post. Just be dead serious with them. Some might be like just chill man it was just a joke, others might apologize, either way whatever happens you let them know how you feel. If they like you less or are less friendly work on finding some better friends, haha.

Maybe you’ll enjoy their perspectives and comments, or maybe you realize you enjoy your other friends honesty more. Yeah, it was completely an unnecessary joke(?) by your friends.   At the same time, it shouldn’t be such an insult to you. If some one is a master and good at things, then they don’t need to show off in front of their family, friends, co-workers, etc. They know the audience knows.  You chose to laugh it off too. Next time this happens, take the opportunity to react maturely and tell them no or move the topic to ask about them. Either works and they’ll realize their jealousy is on their blame too.  

2.  You might find out other people also got those “private messages” whatever they want to admit it or not. Sometimes managers really want to ensure the employee has a good impression when they first got hired. Keep in mind that, but at same time remember you got past the most hardest challenge of being accepted too!

3. In all, I think you really should be directing your type of questions more to you. Not what can I do with these people, but what can I do with my own life. Not as an insult, but focus on yourself and you’ll find yourself staying happy.

My last contract they said it had the potential to go perm, great benefits…etc. I didn’t expect to hear back from the interview portion for the contract yet they call and said I had the contract. Something felt “off”. I mean “why me?” That was my thinking vs saying why not me. 7 months later I go perm, benefits and 401k plan crazy awesome, never dreamed I’d have a remote role with this salary sitting on my ass on the couch working 2hours a day on salary. When I was hired the team was 97% white. Totally different than what I was use to. I felt totally off and immediately thought “am I a diversity hire for them to meet their numbers?” Well guess what?

If it wasn't then the fact that you don't get mad about it doesn't actually matter. Does that make sense?

It can get out of hand, and some people really do use it as a way to demean others while hiding behind the ""I'm just joking"" barrier. It's impossible to know the true context without being a part of the group and knowing the other participants. Part of being accepted into a new group is learning what is ok and what isn't. I guess thats true for any group really.

In truth, it's always easiest to be friends with people who are your racial/cultural match for exactly these kinds of reasons. But part of being friends with others who are different than you means learning to adjust to different ways of doing things.

Telling them basically what you posted will let you know which thing it is.

Because that means you’re chasing women on the basis of looks but getting upset when/if they reciprocate that physical judgment. 

From my experience, women are way more forgiving and accepting of a man being out of shape than the reverse. Have you expressed any interest in women around your own size? Women who would be able to relate to your experiences?

As for your general feeling toward women, just remember that both men and women are individuals with their own standards and expectations. No one is obligated to return any sort of affection just because a person was nice to them. 

I can understand that it’s frustrating if people are being rude to you. But I think this is the perfect opportunity for you to focus on yourself.

In this way this anger and resentment is circular for you and is fueling itself. Individual women and ""friends"" have rejected you and you have logged this as women don't want you and when you punish yourself into being thin your gonna punish them then too. That sounds like a great way to end up feeling unhappy and lonely in yourself. 

Have you ever considered that you may be looking in the wrong place for the problem. What type of people are you friends with.. sounds like they are shallow and not worth investing time into. With regard to the women you say won't look at you.. can you say honestly is this all women or are you already preemptively excluding the ""fat girls"" you think it would feel good to take your ""revenge"" out on. Or another possibility is could your attitude and bitterness be already coming through to others and causing them to view you negatively. 

I would say focus on yourself. How to make yourself happy. How to be kind to yourself. How to be thankful that you have a body that is healthy enough to allow you to workout.

Relationships and dating are not that important. Its important to protect and provide for one once you have one that you’ve committed to. And when it comes to sex,  i can promise you this, no “bar hookups” that your coworkers are getting are fulfilling. Truly, they are lying if they said they are fulfilled. If they were, why are they always chasing it? They NEED the ego boost because that number of partners is all they have for building confidence. 
You know why i’m confident? It isn’t my dating or hookup history, its my wealth if knowledge in my field. Its being respected by colleagues. Its building something that came from YOUR brain and it making the world just a tiny bit better. Its seeing places not many in your circles will ever see. Seeing a sunset on Waikiki beach on a Friday and seeing a sudden firework display that they do every friday.

So sure, you can hang your laurels of self value on how many or how attractive a woman you can hook up with is like your friends, or you can rise above and value gaining experiences and knowledge. Guess what happens when you’re a humble, yet well read, well travelled, interesting kind of guy?
Panties drop. Trust. 

Build your confidence with bricks and steel beams of self-pride, not wet kinetic sand of one night stands like your friends do. At some point you will cross paths with someone who lets you be your natural, gross, goofy self. 

My wife was a coworker once. I married her because i can be legitimately, no cap, 100% myself. The way i would be around my cousins. When you find one where you reeally feel that way, thats the one you should consider a committed relationship with.

I was an overweight ""nice guy"" and developed the same resentment towards women you have. 

""I'm smart. I'm polite. I'm courteous. I'm generous. I'm thoughtful. How could they not want me?""

Because whether you realize it or not, you have a conscious or subconcious sense of entitlement from being nice and not only can they sense this, but your true intentions of just trying to get laid start steering all your actions. You're not even being who you want. You're being who you think you need to be to get laid.

So eventually, I became the ""bad boy."" Lost weight. Did drugs. Started openly serving myself. Talked to people like I didn't give a flying fuck about their feelings. Basically a narcissist. Women started coming at me from every direction.

But not quality women. I was so distracted by getting attention from women that I didn't even care about the quality of women that I was attracting. Long story short, trash attracts trash, and I found myself just as miserable as I was before, if not more.

You need to find the happy medium between nice guy and bad boy. Be genuine with people. Do things you like. Don't do things that you don't like. Be honest with people. Be who YOU wanna be and not who you think THEY want you to be. You will develop a natural confidence and a natural personality. You aren't going to attract every woman, but when you respect yourself, you will start attracting women that respect themselves AND you. On top of that, they will genuinely like you for YOU and not someone that you're TRYING to be. And YOU will like you for you.

Basically. Just live honestly and stop trying to impress everyone. Accept that not everyone is going to like you. But when you live honestly and confidently, more women will like you than those who don't and you will find a quality woman.",Efficient-Poet-3048,t2_n65uwiak,45,0,reddit3

I’m sorry but this isn’t a weight issue. 

It’s a self esteem and misogyny one. I can guarantee your male friends are 100X more judgmental of fatness than any random woman you’re projecting this onto. 

**The fact that you want to make women feel how they’ve made you feel - even though you recognise *you are the only person who made yourself fat- and being fat is why you dislike your life* - says enough.**

You just want a reason to blame people for not having sex with you. If you were a fat gay man, you’d probably have blamed men. If you were a fat straight women you’d have probably blamed men. The issue isn’t “them” - it’s you.

Your attitude & belief that women are different than men, more judgemental, and owe you sex is probably why you aren’t getting laid. 

301 lbs at 6ft1 is pretty great. I’ve dated guys that size - and I’m under 120 lbs, 5ft7, female, runner.

Their body wasn’t why I’m not with them anymore - their behaviour is. 

**Your body is probably not why people don’t want to fuck you. Your personality is.**

Again **would you want to have sex with an overweight woman who complains on Reddit that men don’t have sex with her?**

**would you want to have sex with a woman who wants to take out her weight issues on men - because they won’t have sex with her?**

Loosing weight for a healthier hearth
Loosing weight to be a better person

As for advice, maybe focus less on trying to get laid and more on making friends with women. Creating platonic relationships will help you when it comes to courting women. Make friends (male and female) who have common interests with you. You’ll understand women better, and other women will see that you aren’t only talking to them because you’re trying to get in their pants. It just seems desperate and unattractive. Generally, women don’t find it very attractive unless they’re immature or shallow. And who knows, many relationships spark from friendships. But if it doesn’t happen with a friend you like, it’s no big deal.

Women aren’t treating you any sort of way by rejecting you. Rejection isn’t necessarily a bad or a mean thing for someone to do. They’re just saying “no” which is their right.

You can do it man, 6months of hard work and discipline and you won't know yourself!

The bitterness and anger you feel inside is something you can let go of, It will improve your state of mind and in turn change the way you are perceived by others.

If you havent found the stoicism subreddit then i highly recommend it. One of the teachings in stoicism talks about how you can only control your own actions. So don't worry about what others are doing, just what you're doing!
  

Humans make a split second judgement of others as soon as they see them based purely on visual traits, it's an evolutionary thing to identify threats, potential mates etc. This can affected by cultural norms and to a lesser extent other factors as a person grows and matures.

So what am I getting at?

These people that you feel bitterness towards may very well be judgemental assholes/bitches. But at a deep biological level we all are, we all make judgements at an unconcious level and it influences our reactions if we want it to or not. It might just mean that we have a shorter attention span or temper when it comes to people we dislike subconciously.


It might feel good in the moment to be rude or try and get some revenge for all those years you've felt ignored or rejected.

But imagine for a minute you act like towards a woman or man you don't know, someone who if you had just been your good natured self, could have been the love of your life or a best friend.

Make a concious decision to treat people better than you've been treated. Try making your corner of the world a nicer place to be and you might be surprised who will want to share it with you.

j44kq2e,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 02:58:44,selfimprovement,"Something I'd like to point out, which is really overlooked from just about all perspectives, is that women aren't everything. And sex, too, is not everything. I get how hard it is to see through this, I'm a guy and deal with it too. It's something just about all men deal with, being strongly attracted to women and having this insatiable desire to be with them, fuck them, even have desirous feelings of ownership over them. And It's made worse by men in society attributing parts of their value as people and as players in the social hierarchy using their contact with women as an evaluative tool to boost themselves in the eyes of others. But, if you think about it, is that how you want to live your life? What sounds more appealing to you, attributing your self-worth to the validation of someone else (woman or not) or attributing your self-worth to your own personal accomplishments/achievements? When I put it this way, it makes way more sense that I should develop my confidence and satisfaction in myself, and in life, based off the accomplishments of my own work, me alone. Because at the end of the day, wouldn't you rather fail and have yourself to blame, than fail and have someone else to blame? 

I think a good place to start is by reminding yourself that women are just people. And oftentimes, they honestly suck. Just like some dudes, just honestly suck. Some are good, of course! But you never really know just by the way someone looks. So don't let the way a woman looks alter your perspective of her. She's just a person. Just like you.

It's important to live your life this way. Self-reliant and independent. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying not to have friends and not to rely on people from time to time. But the point I'm addressing is that we men have a tendency to rely on women for our ultimate happiness. Again, they are just people. And you're a person. And we are all lucky to be people and alive. There's a world of such a ridiculous amount of opportunity and endless information and exploration to be discovered and experienced. It's amazing that we get so caught up in women. Not just women, though. There's plenty of things that can pull our attention to an obsessive and addictive level.

Everyone always says that you find love when you least expect it. To me, this is pretty solid evidence to support the claim that you should live your life not worrying about women and not worried about what other people think of you. You should live your life concerned about yourself. Do what makes you happy. If you want to lose weight, do it for you.

I think switching your mindset from relying on female contact for your happiness to relying on your own actions for your happiness is akin to breaking an addiction. So, it won't be easy, but you can absolutely do it. Maybe living this way you'll eventually be able to appreciate women for just being there, because at that point you won't want them, because you've got yourself which you've built up to be your own solid rock.",ogMcDeltaT,t2_hhu70id,3,0,reddit3

While therapy is quite expensive, I'd recommend looking into graduate student therapists who offer free or heavily reduced fees. Reach out to MFT programs in your area and see if they can refer you! There's also a great documentary on Netflix called Stutz about Jonah Hill's therapist.

I’m older than you; old enough to be seeing people who are carrying extra weight developing health issues from it. Joint problems, cardiac problems, etc., and they require medical intervention that’s inconvenient and expensive. You do not want this! Our knees are carrying a lot of pounds per square inch.

Lastly communication. If you are insecure tell them. If you have a good day tell them. No woman is able to read minds. Communication is the key to any type of relationship. Good luck.",Howlitsugar,t2_v5om9jxs,2,0,reddit3

The first step in change or growth is being aware of what you are wanting to change in the moment and redirecting your thought processes. Meaning, when you think that way about women, about your body, acknowledge it, do some thought stopping. Tell yourself, I know this is how I thought in the past, but I want to be different this time.

I was in a serious relationship with a very fit man in my mid 20’s. He was also pretty wealthy, and his family was fantastic. He cheated, screamed at me, insulted me, threw things at me, and after 4 years together, proposed to me with a repulsively expensive ring. I said no, and we had an ugly ending. 

Flash forward a few weeks after the break up and I find myself being consoled by one of my good friends I had met at work who happened to be obese. We got closer and I assure you it wasn’t a rebound. We ended up doing activities together and being intimate and moved in together. This lasted a year, not because he was obese, but because he kept saying he wasn’t good enough for me, would go out and get drunk with friends who weren’t obese and were using him ( I never cared that he went out with friends and never insulted them but it was obvious that he was their wing man and they didn’t want him held down by a woman) and he ended up just dragging his feet and drinking. His self defeat and self loathing lead to our relationship ending but he was and really still is, the love of my life. He didn’t have money. He was funny as hell, he was sweet, super intelligent and and fun. I wanted to get married and have kids. He didn’t think he was good enough and ended up proving himself right. 

My husband was around 100 pounds thinner when we met. He gained slowly when we dated and gained rapidly once we married. He’s now addicted to food, he has a plethora of health issues and it’s impacted our sex life. I’ve pleaded with him through tears to get help and he won’t. It’s not vanity. It’s that I’m terrified and he’s not the same person. 

So I hope this gives perspective. There are women out there who don’t give a care if a guy has a  6 pack and a bunch of cash.

My advice: 

* **Healthy Eating**: Instead of ""cutting"" foods out, try ""crowding"" them out. 
   * Add veggies to everything you eat. Want chicken fingers? Give yourself permission to eat them, but you gotta eat them with broccoli. Or a salad. Or whatever veggies you prefer!
* **Goal Setting:** Instead of pursuing some ""external"" goal like ""Losing XX pounds"" or ""Getting in a relationship,"" try pursuing a ""behavior"" goal, such as ""go for a walk for 30 minutes every single day"" 
* **Self Confidence**: Learning the art of charisma (Charisma on Command on YT has some amazing vids), developing new skills and interests that YOU enjoy for the sake of doing them

And finally, women: **Start by pursuing friendships with women instead of relationships**. 

Start with women you ***aren't attracted to***. Get to know them, understand what it means to be a good friend to a woman, and be curious about what life is like from a woman's perspective. 

The more you understand and get to know women platonically, the less bitterness you may feel toward them, the more you'll be able to relate to them, and the more success you'll have in dating.

As a woman, it can feel unsafe to acknowledge a man who is showing attraction towards you, but whom you are not attracted to. You may not want to give mixed signals or lead him on. 

My hope is that by pursuing friendships with women that you **don't** find attractive, you won't give off that ""I want to fuck you"" energy that is frightening to most women who don't reciprocate the feeling.

Speaking from experience, I’d be willing to bet that a lot of your issues with women come more from your issues with yourself than anything else. There are plenty of overweight people who find love, and you can be too. You don’t have to change your body to be worthy of love, and the best way to attract healthy affection is to be willing and able to give it. So while you’re in the process of working out your body, work out your mind and heart at the same time. You’re hurting right now, as many of us are. You’ve been bullied and mistreated, and the only thing that you can do about it that will have a tangible, lasting influence is to put the opposite energy into the world. Practice being what my friend called “tenaciously optimistic.” Be good to people not in spite of what you’ve been through, but because of it. Read some books about public speaking, active listening, empathetic listening, etc and apply some of those techniques to talking to people at work. Ask people questions about themselves. Get to know people. Get to know yourself. When you look in the mirror in the morning, don’t walk away until you’ve picked out three things that you genuinely like about yourself that day. The first time might take a long time, but every day will be shorter than the last. Learning how to get others to open up, how to make them feel comfortable and safe around you, and how to love yourself will do more for both your own happiness and your sex life than revenge could even come close to.",Unionthug2049,t2_jzvzl8ut,2,0,reddit3

j466stj,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 13:15:40,selfimprovement,"Oof I know a thing or 2 about feeling bitter or resentful towards others. In my case it wasn't (isn't towards the opposite sex) but moreso towards people who rejected me in life for various reasons. I was first sad for a long time then that sadness turned to anger and bitterness. Now I'm working to get out of the anger and stay out of it. It's been 2 years' work but I am in a happier place now.

My advice would be to practice mindfulness and meditation. You kinda need to train your brain into a different pattern of thinking. So let's say you get triggered by something and feel the bitterness rise and the negative thoughts start. You will need to then confront the thoughts and the **underlying beliefs** behind the thoughts and counter them with compassion and healthier belief systems.

**For example:** You're out and try to approach a woman who then rejects you. You then feel triggered by this and feel the emotions around bitterness arise. Mindfulness allows you to identify that you're being triggered right now. When you confront the bitterness you sit with yourself and ask what limiting beliefs are playing through your mind. In this case maybe the limiting beliefs are that she rejected you because of your weight, and that you are always being judged for your weight, and therefore you feel like you are unlovable because of your weight. Now when you confront it ask if these beliefs are 100% true: (addressing them step by step)

**Limiting belief 1:** *""She rejected me because of my weight""*
She could've rejected you for various other reasons that have nothing to do with your weight; maybe she has another guy she's interested in, maybe she doesn't like guys with (insert hair colour) hair, maybe she's having a bad day and just didn't want to be approached. Maybe she's insecure and feels like you're above her league. Maybe she likes guys bigger than you 🤷🏾‍♀️ Who knows?! But it's harmful for you to always assume that it's your weight and that the fault is with you. And let's say she did in fact reject you because of your weight, does that mean that every woman feels the same? No. We know for fact that there are many larger men in loving relationships out there.

**Limiting belief 2:** *""I am always being judged for my weight""*
Yes many people very likely do and will judge you for your weight, but not everyone will. You need to hold out space for those who don't care about that stuff. They exist, and you must keep telling yourself that. There will always be a subsegment of people who will judge you for something, whether it's your weight, your height, your looks, the way you speak, walk, etc. People judge; haters gon' hate and potatoes gon' potate. Focus your energy on the non-haters.

**Limiting belief 3:** *""I feel like I am unlovable/no one will love me because of my weight""*
This is probably the core underlying belief behind all insecurities. Is this true? No. We see women everyday loving larger men. There are women where weight/body size does not matter at all. Keep looking out for those ones. Yes maybe that isn't a big cohort of women, but they do exist, you just need to find your one.

You continue this exercise for all your triggers, and with daily meditation and mindfulness you can train your brain out of these thoughts.

The thing with limiting beliefs is that they lead to us behaving in ways which are counterintuitive to what we want in life. So you may want a relationship but you don't approach a woman because of the limiting belief around feeling unlovable or unwantable - you kinda cockblock yourself in the behaviour you exhibit due to this belief. So a lot of the work will be confronting the limiting beliefs and changing the limiting behaviour that comes out of these beliefs.

I recommend you start a daily journal for your research findings, and on top of this start a daily gratitude/self-love journal to list all the things that you love about your self and your life. List 3 daily and you'll see a massive improvement I your mood and feelings of bitterness, and also generally how you show up in the world (as a bitter person or as a happy one). And be kind to yourself always ❤

Good luck!

As far as those feelings, they need a reframe: Look, you THINK you're dealing with women's reactions, but what you're actually dealing with is SELF hatred of your own body. Even your post gives you away: you want to feel better only once you lose the weight. It's not healthy to wait to be happy only once some far off condition comes to fruition.

j46q0uk,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 15:34:12,selfimprovement,"You are bitter towards women because they remind you of your own feelings of unworthiness. 

There is a phrase I live by (there are many, actually, but this one pertains to your situation).

""We don't see people as they are, but as reflections of who we are,""

Every person you meet you see through the filter of your own experience.  So you've come to equate women with the idea that you're not worthy of love. Your resentment of them is really a resentment of yourself.

Until you are able to take responsibility for truly loving yourself,.no outside person will ever be able to fill that void.  So you have to practice loving yourself first, no matter your weight.

As part of that love, it may lead you to taking care of your body in new ways, but if you never lose a pound, you are still worthy of love. Your love for yourself needs to be UNCONDITIONAL.

Take action because you love yourself,  instead of withholding love every time you perceive failure.

One of the best ways to start shifting this is called mirror work.

Look at yourself in the mirror, and tell yourself ""I love you"" and then stand there and allow yourself to receive it. Repeat for 5 minutes a few times a day so you can sear it into your subconscious. 

It is extremely uncomfortable for most people at first, but it's so beneficial. 

Reach out if you need support or more exercises to try.

When you pursue women, do you expect the rejection? Are you trying to somehow punish yourself maybe?

Men and women have different values: men usually focus more on physical appearance and children, women focus more on monetary value so as to care for those children. 

What if you couldn’t provide due to obesity related diseases? Does your weight have anything to do with your mental? It’s weird but I feel that women can sense a lack of stability a mile away, survival I guess.

I’m not saying you yourself aren’t of worth, but it’s a little naive to think people are going to just look past everything else. I don’t expect a man love me for me, that’s what parents or children do. I expect a man to love me because I look good and can have children. My personality is a plus.

j46vosz,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 16:10:10,selfimprovement,"I think you need to look at how some of the (ig sometimes stereotypical) behaviors of how men and women interact with each other came to be. 

Women are more often chooser with men they don't know because it has historically been, and even still can be, very physically dangerous for a woman to get involved with a bad man. 

Not only that, but women have historically had virtually no other option but to carry a child and be very vulnerable for 9 months if they got pregnant and picking a partner that was unhealthy, weak, unintelligent, etc could easily result in the death of themselves and their child. 

Obviously now we live in the modern world, but the women who survived to pass on their genes were the ones who were careful and hesitant about choosing a competent male partner. You can't blame women for being picky. 

On the other end, men have usually had to 'compete' to get the attention of the females. This is both good and bad news for you. 

The bad news is it WILL be harder for you to find a female partner than it would be the other way around, and even if you were in shape and a chisled Greek God, you are still gonna be competing against other men for almost any woman you set your eyes on. 

The good news is that there is a vast amount of different ways you can compete like being funny, or smart, or strong, or athletic, etc. 

Guys pretend to act sweet or nice to women to get something from them all the time they have spent their entire life being skeptical of 'the nice guy' cause especially if what you're wanting is a relationship and you feel this bitter about women, chances are you aren't actually nice. You obviously want something from them (sex/relationship) and you obviously have resentment toward them as described in this post. Women can see straight through that. 

The obvious advice to give you would be to exercise it'll help you look better, feel better, be healthier and build confidence around women with virtually no downside other than 30-60 minutes of your time per day. 

Outside of that, try just interacting with women without trying to get with them for a bit. Crack some jokes, work out any awkwardness you might have with being around them, spend some time around them without trying to get anything out of them, and I'm sure you'll start to understand both what they want and the ways you can compete the best.",Packathonjohn,t2_oybr3,1,0,reddit3

The way I moved past it was to study philosophy. I ended up finding zen Buddhism’s. Most think of it as a religion but in reality it’s a philosophy. 

One of the things I learned from a combination of zen teachings and stoicism is that no one owes you anything. What’s going to happen is going to happen regardless of how much worrying you do. 

Worrying about the future or ruminating about the last will only cause suffering. The only thing that’s real is right now. So when she looks at you that way allow yourself to suffer in the now but then let it go completely. If you don’t you invite your own suffering. I know it sounds like I’m saying “just get over it.” But I’m not. If you study the precepts of Buddhism and meditate you will find the inner peace I’m describing. 

From another perspective, if you know (and believe) others are entitled to their preferences then you wouldn’t get excessively (<that’s the operative word) hurt by rejection. On the reverse side of that statement if you felt entitled to the attention of women you’d feel anguish about being rejected. I’m not so sure about this one just guessing as I don’t know you personally. I do know that this was what was going on in my head until I made myself believe what I “knew”.

Hope this helps. Good luck with your weight loss goals. If you have the ability to get your hormone levels checked you should ask your doctor for a testosterone panel. The way you described your weight (high then low then high) it seems to me you have hypogonadism (low T) if your doctor is progressive they may prescribe TRT.

Girls I liked, just mocked me and wanted to good looking guys. I also resented women for a long time, for making fun of me, not wanting me for my personality and looks. 

From 12 to now I have been on my self-improvement journey. Not hating, but loving people. Finding peace in my mind, which I am still working on. The harsh truth is, girls like a good looking guy. And when you are fit, shredded, you have this Halo-effect. It just true. My personality hasn't changed much, but now I am lean and my jawline shows more, my vbody shows, men and women, give me so much more positive energy. 

So yeah, I am here to say you are perfect and all this boo-hoo. The more you drop fat, the more people would respect you and will be pleasant to you, well that was what I have noticed. You go from talking girls = creepy, to talking to girls = ""ooh, you fuck boy ;)"".

My friends think I am a fuckboy now, because I am now decent looking and talk to girls. While if I DID EXACT the same thing when I was fat, I was the creep. In fact, my female friends told me that when I danced with them in the club (I met them in the club), they thanked me for not being creepy. I just went to them and danced, well guess what they would've thought If I was overweight. 

A girl I dated with, I met her thru the gym. I just went to her, and talked to her. I spooked the shit out of her, and 2 months into dating we kinda talked how some men are creepy and I thought ""Oh, sorry about that"". She said I wasn't creepy. Well imagine me being overweight.

This is the halo-effect. Is it fair, no. But see this as a motivation. The more you loss those fat, you more your halo-effect would show. Yes it takes time, and effort. It took me 10 years. And I am still not there yet. I might need another 3 years to have this fuckboy body, which I am indeed aiming at. Not because I want to fuck girls, just a personal goal you know.

My sister married an obese man, even though she’s a thin sexy fitness instructor. She poured all her love into him for years. He just died of obesity related illness. It stings. Should we blame you for being an obese man, leaving her a sad widow? At some point you need to shift your blame away from women. Blame reality. Get revenge against reality. Blame the truth. Get revenge against the truth. As long as every sting you feel is caused by women, you will always want to hurt them and they will always want to run when they realize this.

I’d say, if you’re feeling bitter, remind yourself that it’s your fault you look like that, and their decision to not sleep with you is a reflection of your choice not to take care of yourself. No matter what kind of a person you are, in dating, much like food, the first bite is with the eye. 

As you spoke about your revenge by “only dating size 0 women” it sounds like you’re looks focused as well. So just remember men and women are just people, you only have yourself to blame, and if it matters so much then change it and they’ll look at you differently",Seachomp,t2_hey5sefn,1,0,reddit3

In terms of weight loss, I’m not an expert at what can help you sustain the weight loss and I’ve had my fair share of dieting troubles too. I’m currently on keto (wk 2) and I’ve been able to lose significant weight. You can try it and see if it’s sustainable. But for weight loss I think ultimately the point is to keep trying different things until you find something that you can do in the long term. For exercise and working out, suggest you find a public sports or community center and join their team so there’s some accountability and you can meet new people. There should be free options or ones where they aren’t super competitive

On the women point, to put it bluntly I think most women are hard-wired through DNA, social media brainwashing, and centuries of evolution to have preferences. If you take it to that viewpoint, it’s not necessarily your fault if someone doesn’t find you attractive - just think of it as a binary thing. We women are going through similar struggles all the time based on all the Instagram/TV programming to look skinny and fit. We are struggling too.

I don’t want to say that you shouldn’t focus on losing weight and exercise because I think getting into shape will help you tremendously. But when you take a more objective view and frame it as a goal that will reap tangible benefits, maybe that will help. But please don’t turn into an incel lol cuz then you won’t get anyone at all and will probably push people out of your life. Don’t give up!",RaindropsOnRooftops_,t2_9f9h4ckt,1,0,reddit3

It seems like what you're experiencing with those feelings are ""intrusive thoughts"" and I've struggled with intrusive thoughts as well for a good part of my life. 

CBT might help. In very simple terms, it means basically changing your thought pattern by recognizing the thoughts you have, acknowledging them and why they appear and that the feelings of hurt you have are valid, but then replacing them with a more rational thought.

It is much easier said than done and it takes a while for you to start really believing and seeing changes.

Maybe try replacing those thoughts with something like ""women are unique individuals and the actions of the group around me do not reflect everyone.""

I know the feeling of wanting others to hurt the way they have hurt you, and these feelings and thoughts do not make you a bad person. It's how you act on those thoughts and feelings. Trying actively to replace those thoughts, even if it doesn't work at first, is an action that shows you that you are not your thoughts.

Also I would definitely recommend trying to find some groups or clubs of people, maybe volunteering might help? Being around other people with same interests?",LonelyRolling1,t2_cowjj6hk,1,0,reddit3

j44hu5a,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 02:37:32,selfimprovement,"Hey OP, I think many of us men have been there. For me, I felt resentment and frustrated because I felt I had been sold a lie my whole life. I went to school. I tried to make women like me. I listened to the cool music and did the things I was supposed to do in life, so why wasn't I successful with career/women/confidence? Mostly, it was because I needed to get out of my own head, but I couldn't. It was too easy to spiral and have things set me off.

For whatever reason so many people run into these issues with ourselves and we need something to blame, especially if we are fed up with blaming ourselves inward. I have found several hard truths that I had to accept to mature and grow to move forward and I hope you will find some of these helpful.

* There is actually no one to blame. Not even yourself. There is no bad guy to go after. There's just you and other people. I was raised with the thought that everyone is out to get you and is after things you have, when in reality working with others makes everything better.
* You can't love or accept anything if you don't first accept you. Think about Billy Joel ""I love you just the way you are"" and make it about yourself. You have to accept your flaws. You are a human, you are not a robot. You are a unique, living being capable of so much and you are in control. I resented so many choices I made and it destroyed me until I accepted them as a part of my own, personal journey in life. I ended up in bad situations, but I had to be able to look back and say ""the good is I now know what I want and can make better choices for me in the future.""
* You are powerful because you are the driver in your life and you make the choices. Often life feels uncontrollable and like you can be stuck. You never actually are (outside of extreme cases, like prison) and you are free to make choices. Maybe you can't quit your job, but you CAN make a choice to build your skills to find a better job.
* This is the hardest and probably the most important one that took me the longest: You have to frame how you view yourself in a positive way. I always used to look at myself at how far behind I was from people I wanted to be like. People who made tons of money and careers I wanted. People who had houses, wives, and/or kids. People who seemed to live lavish lives (most social media will mentally destroy you btw) where I could barely afford my apartment rent.
* You can't expect anything to change immediately, but you can goal set for the year. Your goals are progress and it's important to set the expectation right and celebrate the small victories. It is so easy in the world to get impatient and expect things to immediately revolutionize everything. It's the minor tweaks and changes that turn into habits that have a ripple effect for the rest of your life. Just like over time you formed a habit of thinking of women as lesser, you can change it back but it is a one-day-at-a-time self-realization and self-correction that will move you towards the things you want.

Some other useful things I can think of off the top of my hear are when you meditate, focus on affirming the positives in your life and the love you have for yourself. I couldn't even tell myself I loved myself and I struggled to find positives for a long time. It's definitely not a sprint, it's something you work at and you take notes on yourself to learn about you more.There's all kinds of self-help books you can also read that helped me get where I am today, but these are the biggest lessons learned and I hope these can help you too.

When you accept and love yourself and have started to go down the path where you feel like more of a complete person YOU want to be, you'll be amazed by where you end up from how you started. I will you all the luck in the world and I'm happy to hear you want to improve.",tkbillington,t2_11wiqn,1,0,reddit3

j44ke2y,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 02:56:13,selfimprovement,"For what it's worth I think this sort of viewpoint is extremely common and it goes all ways across any gender lines. If you're unattractive, even in non-romantic, non-sexual contexts, people treat you like you're worth less. And when it comes to a straight man, women treating you worse definitely stings because your body and instincts don't reset to just not be *attracted* if you're not *attractive.* And it's about way more than just sex. Chances are you've gone through a lot of unrequited love in your life. Meanwhile you have probably found a good number of fellow males who have no real problem with your appearance and treat you like you matter. And this goes from all the way to close friends to strangers you only have one pleasant interaction with, chances are the majority of those good interactions were with men and most of the ones that stung most were with women.

My advice is, do your best to look your best, because you have at least partially learned your lesson on how shallow people are. We're pack animals who don't want unfit members dragging our tribe down. People don't wanna accept it but it's true. Lookism is the scientific term.

Also I will say, don't expect results overnight. Or in a year. Or in two years. It's a looot of hard work to get a fit body if you've never had it. Learn to enjoy it. Do the suboptimal workout and diet you find enjoyable over the optimal one you will only be able to stand for a short while.

Since you are looking to become attractive to women I suggest putting on a ton of muscle and becoming as physically powerful and unstoppable as you can. You have probably seen a lot of guys without abs with obviously gorgeous women. This is not because women don't care about looks but it's because they're not lying when some of them say they don't mind a bit of belly on a guy... but typically the rest of the guy is good-looking and most importantly, big. My own pet theory is that if you are at least a head taller than a woman and more than double her body weight while at a healthy body fat percentage, her chances of being attracted to you increase dramatically. So what I am saying here is that mere weight loss is probably not going to be the magic bullet you may be hoping it is. But that just means you need a couple other ones.

Don't neglect your neck, forearms, shoulders, and calves, as well as your core... everything really, being attractive as a man is all about being the whole package or nearly so. A lot of it is about being powerful, physically and socially. So you will need to work on your social skills as well. Those have likely been stunted somewhat due to disuse, which happens to a lot of people--probably even the majority of people, can't really be described as socially adept.  Women don't really want to get with fixer-uppers they want a strong confident established guy who makes their life better if they become his girlfriend/wife. However you may see women with tons of flawed dudes, even downright abusive, where these guys succeed is usually mainly looks and the projection of strength and success. 

Having gone through a lot of pain you may be looking for empathy and encouragement. These are not commonly the first things women are looking to give in a relationship with a man. You must go through life not with a woe-is-me attitude but of manly vigor and unshakeable invincibility, even if you are a vulnerable human like anyone else. Ancient women needed a man who could fight off predators and rapists, build shelter, hunt animals, lead exploration missions, raise children, and maintain harmony with his tribe even when disasters struck and survival in the wild was terrifying. Would a guy like that be afraid to ask a girl out or go out to a social event? Fuck no. Being able to do stuff like that would be easy and fun. From now on if a woman rejects you you must view that as a mistake on her part, even if you acknowledge your present shortcomings, because those are only temporary and your unshakeable will will carry you to leading an amazing life she would have been thrilled to follow you on. Believe all of this without any bitterness on your part. You're not going to live your life to prove anyone else wrong. You're doing it because you only get one life and you deserve an awesome one and nobody else is going to give it to you, you must make it. In many ways this will mean doing the opposite of everything you have been doing. They are truly tough habits to break. But, I think understanding how hard is, doesn't mean you need to *dwell* on how hard it is--that just makes it harder. 

You know what you need to do. Go do it every day. On the days you don't feel like it that's when it brings you the most benefit to do it. It's easy to work out on an awesome day when you're feeling great, your schedule's nice and open, the weather's nice, and so on. But doing what needs to be done on those shitty days where everything seems like it sucks, do it all anyway and that's when you know nothing can actually stop you. Don't even run some narrative in your head about your personal journey or whatever. Do these things so aggressively you don't even have time to talk yourself out of it.",Oberon_Swanson,t2_6y93r,1,0,reddit3

Hurting others will only hurt you (revenge etc). If you love yourself just a little bit everyday, before you know, you will be a lovable person! A loving person who works out, who is positive, and open....Someone who a girl might actually approach, and feel attracted to... On the other hand, well if you are overweight, expect lots of rejection, and well, eventually stress, and resentment towards that which you cannot achieve at the current state of mind.

j44nofp,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 03:21:27,selfimprovement,"Like a lot of people are saying here, you need to work on your mentality and self-esteem. When I was a teenager I was a few stone over what I should have been and got mocked a lot for it. The stuff that stung most was when people would react the same way you've perceived, giving me disgusted looks or legitimately laughing at the idea of dating me. I felt so lonely, completely unlovable and disgusting, like the ugliest person in the world.
It takes time and making genuine friends to feel more comfortable in your own body. I know it's hard since you feel lonely, but you need to stop thinking about having sex with women or dating them, stop basing your own value purely off sex appeal. Try to make good friends, or try talking to a close friend if you have any about how you're feeling, ask them to remind you of your goals when you're feeling down and demotivated (though it's very important you try for yourself and don't rely on them).

Also, I'm not assuming this about you, but I've met so many men (and women like me) who straight up don't know how to take care of themselves hygiene-wise. That's a massive turn-off for others, not even in a romantic/sexual way but in a general potential to interact with you more way. You could be a conventially attractive ""10"" but if you're not washing regularly, brushing your teeth enough, wearing clean clothes, people won't be attracted to you in any sense. I'm into chubby/obese people, as are many others, but if someone doesn't look after themselves there's no attraction. When I was a teenager no one had taught me to take care of myself. It's embarrassing to admit now but I only showered a few times a week, at one point only 2 times when I was really depressed - you may wonder how someone couldn't just get that you're meant to wash more, but for a lot of people, especially young people, their parents assume they would ""just know"" or are neglectful. Looking back I think being unconventionally attractive and overweight was only part of the issue, and probably the main reason I didn't have any romantic luck was because I probably looked like I didn't wash. By the time I'd entered my twenties I was still heavier than I wanted but I was working towards my goal and I felt comfortabke in my own body, wasn't even thinking about dating until my boyfriend and I started. Even if you think you're keeping yourself fine, I'd advise looking up how to be hygienic and take care of your skin. You might be surprised.

My parents are immigrants who moved to the west during the 90s, throughout the last 3 decades being here they were heavily discriminated against. Not given much thought despite projecting their voice loudly. Doesn't fit in anyway so it's always been difficult to integrate into a culture that doesn't invite you in.

So the last decades they've been here they resent this country and the people in it.

Guess what happens.

They teach their own children to hate where they're born in. Hate the neighbors' kids, hate the school, hate the system and don't even think to integrate. And it causes us to be underdeveloped and under-socialized at a very young age.

It wasn't that discrimination isn't at fault to cause them to become bitter people, it was how they couldn't look past that, making it harder to be accepting loving people, and in turns raised poor attitudes towards hardship.

Don't let bitterness take over dude. I'm dating an obese man rn, and as harsh as it is to say, I don't like him becoming obese. All my life I've been self-aware of the foods I eat so I have no sympathy for people who destroys their health like that. It doesn't take 6 months for obesity to kick in, it took 5-10 years of ignoring your health to cause that.

But you already know that. And from the look of your post, you also prefer woman that aren't obese anyway, so there really isn't any double standards going on.

I think to recognise and challenge yourself when you get those thoughts could help. Ask yourself if its really fair that you're having this thought, talk to yourself with an outside perspective. Or learn to let your thoughts go, don't spend time with it at all. Just blow it away, those thoughts are not worth your time kind of idea. - I'm not sure If these will help at all but it's worth a shot.

Im sorry you've been treated so horribley. As a plus size woman with my own different but kind of relatable experience, I can assure you that there is a whole community out there who adore big men. Im also sorry that you're not treated better by work colleagues and friends - maybe address the issue with them. You deserve people in your life who will treat you equally no matter what.

Second, if you want change and have it stick you need to consider the HABIT LOOP and FALSE HOPE SYNDROME. I’m a little high but I’ll explain briefly and you can look up more details. 


HABIT LOOP: Cue, routine, reward. Cue could be getting home after a long day, routine could be sitting on the couch (being sedentary) and eating lots, and reward is that it makes you feel better. For the habit loop you need to change the routine. Instead of being sedentary go for a short walk, anything to replace the routine to get the same reward, that’s the focus. You can apply this in many areas.


FALSE HOPE SYNDROME: Set unrealistic goal, initial success, ultimate failure, faulty attribution, rinse and repeat. Most likely everyone on the planet has fallen into this, myself as well. The biggest thing here is setting an unrealistic goal (for most people they set a goal of where they want to be), they have a bit of success but the goal is too lofty so failure occurs, then you say oh because of “this” I failed and I can do better next time, no you can’t. You need to set a goal 5 - 15% of your baseline activity level, this is the range where it is possible to stick to the goal.


I worked with an elite athlete who suffered from false hope syndrome and for her goal all I had her do was go to the gym, change into her gym clothes, and leave the gym. After a week of this, she realized how silly it was to get to the gym and just change her clothes, she was thinking, well I’m already here so I suppose I should workout. From there the workouts were super short to not overwhelm her and over the next few months we very slowly increased the duration and intensity. 


A habit takes roughly 6 months to take and if you stick to what I’ve said here I promise you will see desirable change. But please do not set an unrealistic goal, it’s the biggest mistake most people make, set something so simple at first it’s impossible to mess up. Good luck",Huddunkachug,t2_11g032,1,0,reddit3

I am in love with a guy who is overweight and it doesn’t bother me. From experience I have met men and women who looked very desirable from the outside but once I got to know them, due to their personality, they turned ugly. Human nature is to search for this ideal image, media also plays a big part. They program us to think certain people and body images are to be sought after. Spending time with a person and getting to know them is a much better way to find a partner. Clubs and Bars are not really a good place. Focus on working on yourself to improve your wellbeing, don’t focus on getting a ripped body. It matters what kind of energy you put out, not f your mind is in a negative state, people can sense it. Start by first being kind to yourself, take care of yourself, you will see how people will treat you differently. I have been through lows and highs with my weight and I’m finally accepting and loving myself, I am actually seeing changes in my own body and how people respond and notice me a lot more. I did not loose a drastic amount of weight but I have learned to pay attention what I eat and why I’m eating. I used food as my comfort or drug whenever I felt stressed, sad or depressed. I am slowly learning that I can eat an apple if I crave sweet instead of a doughnut. My point is start paying attention to what you do on a daily basis and when you do certain things, this will make you aware and help you stop or change bad habits. Don’t focus on loosing weight rather start taking walks at the local park. Try and add some kind of activity, bike riding, walking, dancing exercise, small changes.

I'll also echo what a lot of other people are saying, that many women won't necessarily rule out dating a guy because he's obese. All sorts of people in all sorts of bodies manage to find partners-- even if you were to stay obese for the rest of your life (and it sounds like you won't!) you will still have a chance at a relationship. Sure, being conventionally attractive helps to attract *more* people, but not better-quality people. I think the solution here is to work on your own confidence levels-- if you walk around insecure and not expecting anyone to take interest in you, that will most likely show in your body language and facial expression and come across as unattractive. Understand that you have a lot of reasons to take pride in who you are-- not everyone is able to make a commitment like losing a significant amount of weight! That's hard work!

I Understand the feelings of resentment , I feel this away about men but more specifically narcissistic men who seek woman to dominate. I watched my father womanize, beat and hold a gun to my mothers head. He also beat our dog causing the poor dog to have his leg amputated. He use to drive intoxicated with us in the car when we were kids. Each time she went back to him even after she once ran away to a shelter and we stayed there for weeks ….Outside of the home everyone loved him, took his side as he pretended to be a victim of his own self sabotaging ways. He had depression and untreated mental health issues. He had a hard life filled with poverty and moving from home to home. His father was an alcoholic and he too became one although he was a functioning in the sense that he ran his own small business.

I encourage you to heal your wounds and confront your demons. We don’t pick where we are born. The behavior of our caregivers has a major impact that May only affect us years later… I never told my father how I felt about his actions. After his death two years ago, all the thoughts of anger and resentment flooded my mind to a point where I have zero respect for weak characters.

Strength isn’t the denial of feelings it’s the ability to confront them and then try to set the ball in motion to try heal ourselves so we can have a healthy last few years on earth. The only life and memory we will have is based on this life. My father could never confront his thoughts. Reflection was an allergy. I commend you for at least having the courage to self reflect and understand your thoughts.

I’ve chosen to join kendo practice to channel my aggression. Counseling/therapy can only help to a degree, more importantly its to find people who are supportive …. And most importantly care about yourself. The three most important relationships in your life will be the one with your body, relationships with others and then yourself…. Once you nail all 3….
Things will fall into place. No one can care about you, until YOU care about you. 

After my dads death I aggressively lost weight, went for blood tests and heart scans to be proactive and started cholesterol meds. I only eat one meal a day.. unless it train. Anger is a beautiful emotion….. it’s the emotion that drives CHANGE. Leverage it…

Wishing you all the best on your journey … may we strive hard to fight our way through trauma and pain, to at-least have a better life than the ones in the past.

This kind of attitude can lead to harmful behavior and can prevent you from forming positive relationships. The first step in overcoming this bitterness is to acknowledge that it exists and to take responsibility for it.

It's also important to understand that obesity and attitudes towards women are not linked. Obesity is a health condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Having a negative attitude towards women is a separate issue that needs to be addressed separately.

One way to start overcoming this bitterness is by educating yourself about women's issues and perspectives. Reading books, articles, or watching documentaries that provide a different point of view can help to broaden your understanding and challenge any misconceptions you may have.

Surround yourself with positive role models and supportive people. Seek out friends or family, who will support you in your journey and help you to see things from a different perspective.

Also acknowledge that weight loss is not always easy, and it may take time to see results. It's important to be patient and to not put pressure on yourself to achieve unrealistic goals.

It's important to focus on overall health and well-being, rather than just weight loss. This may include things like getting enough sleep, managing stress, and building a support system.

Weight loss is not a one-size-fits-all solution and that everyone's journey will be different. It's important to find a plan that works for you and that you can sustain over the long-term.

The most important thing is to be kind to yourself, and to not let your weight or body shape define your self-worth. Treating your body with respect and kindness will help you to improve your health and well-being. 

Work on yourself and your own self-esteem. Negative attitudes towards women often stem from feelings of insecurity or inadequacy. Engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as exercise, therapy, or volunteering, can help to boost your self-esteem and make you less likely to harbor negative attitudes towards others.

Change takes time and effort. It's important to be patient with yourself and to not expect immediate results. The journey towards overcoming bitterness towards women is a process that requires time, commitment, and a willingness to learn and grow.

I don’t think love can always be so fickle although it can be often. But I know lots of overweight dudes in happy relationships assuming because they are happy themselves, are in a good headspace, have decent values, put equal work in to dating as well as maintaining relationship. 
Because reading your explanation for it almost always makes you lose out in this debate when you already have the narrative that all women hate obese men, they are all fickle. If that’s the case, then I guess yes, no solution? The only solution I guess would be to lose weight and be the desirable looking kind of bloke that you envision. Again a solution. But not a guarantee. I would challenge you to try this and then I think you’d maybe see that the problem all along wasn’t the weight. 
But again, I get this is an issue for you, if you so, maybe make the compromise to try lose weight, make it a goal, and you’ll probably find that your confidence doubles because not only do you feel more adequate physically, and thus I get the validation from per se. But more importantly, you’ll feel better for yourself for addressing the problem yourself, rather than, I guess, trying to blame half the population of the world for, and I stress, not their issue whatsoever.",,,1,0,reddit3

There’s a huge difference between how women and men move through the world. Men who are attracted to women show interest. Women have to maintain a safety buffer. The more comfortable a woman is with a man, the more open she is to flirting or whatever.

So when guys get entrenched in this invisible feeling and grow bitter it frustrates me because what they *think* is happening is she’s looking at you and evaluating you based on her sexual preferences, then rejecting you. That’s not how it works. Unless we’re selling it or actively looking for it, women don’t jump right from “new person in the room” to “sex? Yes-no-maybe.” It just doesn’t happen like that.

Women who feel safe are more likely to feel attraction. Women who enjoy your company and conversation are more likely to think about enjoying your body. Women who have good vibes with you are going to want to keep those vibes going.

The first step to getting past this is to stop thinking you know how women work, what they want, and what their expressions mean. I can almost guarantee that some of what you’ve internalized as “disgust” and “rejection” has been neutral at worst.",fairie88,t2_92wfi5h1,1,0,reddit3

j45srm7,t3_10a8xtw,2023-01-13 10:46:14,selfimprovement,"First, women are people and not objects placed on earth to fulfill a man’s needs.  

Second, the harsh reality of life is it is survival of the fittest for every species that exists, including humans.

Third, nothing is life is free.  If you want something, you need to have the mental discipline and focus to get it.  Learn to “embrace the suck”, which is the acceptance of the discomfort you’ll go through to achieve your life goals.  

Once you’ve accepted the above, move into taking action.

Set realistic goals and establish an plan to achieve them.  Don’t just write down, “I need to lose weight.”  Write down something measurable and time bound and break it into smaller more achievable goals.  For instance - “I need to lose 1 lb a week until I reach x number of lbs.”. It’s measurable, realistic, and establishes smaller goals you can focus on that over time will get you closer to your larger goal.

Beyond a plan, create a corresponding routine that you follow every day.  The routine is the integration of your plan in your daily life, which means you need to organize each day so that you’ve blocked time to focus energy on your goals.  If you don’t do this, you will struggle to reach your goal, as it requires daily commitment.

Research and understand how best to execute your daily routine.  It’s the strategy and tactics you need to put in place so that your actions achieve results. Losing weight is not simply exercising or dieting, it’s caloric deficit at its basis.  You need to  burn more calories than you consume everyday, so come up with a combination of both exercise and diet and use a tool like my fitness pal, to measure your daily caloric intake.  

Measure your daily progress based on the progress/completion of your action.  Measure your progress toward your smaller goal at the end of the timeframe you set (I.e. 1 lb per week). 

Don’t beat yourself up if you make a mistake or fail to reach a goal.  Instead think through what you could have done better and where you might need to optimize.  For instance, if the exercise routine is too complicated, simplify it to fewer exercises, knowing the underlying goal is to burn calories.

Once you’ve achieved your larger goal, come up with a strategy to maintain it moving forward.

Lastly, focus on only 1 or 2 goals at a time, as your time and energy are finite resources.

In the end, losing weight alone will not instantly make you attractive to all women. Again, your not entitled to anything in life, nobody is.

- Your weight.

- Your self-esteem and feelings toward women.

Your weight problem likely stems from the fact that eating food is one of the primary ways you make yourself feel good.  In that sense, you are much like a drug addict (speaking from experience here).  What is your pattern of eating like?  Do you have a tendency to binge eat?  Do you eat well past the point that you're full?  To the point where your stomach hurts?

Your self-esteem and feelings toward women are more complicated.  Talking through it with a therapist will help you to change your thought patterns to be more positive.  It works (speaking from experience here).",SmashBusters,t2_d758t,1,0,reddit3

Second) understand everyone gets rejected. Women and men both get rejected and turned down for many superficial and petty reasons. 

I would maybe look into finding platonic female work out buddies on the same journey as you or a female trainer so that you can develop healthy relationships with women out of support. 

Lastly, yes society treats obese people terribly and I see that clearly. However not every single person is like that and will treat you as a person despite your body.

I agree with the above posts encouraging you to lean into empathy, and seek therapy if possible. The main reason I wanted to weigh in regarding your situation is to encourage you to look at your obesity as a medical condition and not a personality flaw. While behavioral interventions certainly are an important aspect of attaining and maintaining a healthy weight, it's becoming more and more clear that there are biologic causes of obesity as well which need addressed. I recommend you explore weight loss medication options with your primary care provider. In particular, I would recommend discussion of a trial of saxenda or similar medication. Saxenda now has an indication for long term obesity, and would likely be covered by your insurance based on your BMI alone. This medication has been very helpful for myself, as well as many others I know. If it's not available or not covered by your insurance, there are other options available as well. Best of luck to you on your health journey. One more thing: most women are looking at the full package in a partner, and are less hyper focussed on physical appearance than men. If you want to become more attractive to potential partners, work on developing other aspects of your person which can be very attractive to women. Things like being intellectually rounded, being a good provider who can be generous with resources, having an excellent sense of humor, and being empathetic and skilled at managing relational stressors in a healthy manner are all qualities that will make you much more attractive to women, and will de-emphasize any physical shortcomings.",psychescalpel,t2_ch4jg,1,0,reddit3

I used to be a small sized woman and then after my first child I gained a lot of weight that I was unable to get off and continue to gain weight. Then after my second child I did the same thing. I went from weighing 100 lb to 400 lb. And it wasn't just the weight gain that caused my problems it was my attitude as I gained the weight toward myself and others. I tended to believe that how I viewed myself is what everyone else thought of me which was not good. And with that my attitude changed how I responded and interacted with others again not a good outcome. With a lot of sweat, tears, self-examination, and putting into practice what I would read and what others would tell me about myself. In comparison losing the weight was a lot easier than losing my attitude and myself loathing I had. Once I started to love myself no matter the size I was and accepting myself as I was in my appearance then I noticed that others treated me better because I was treating myself better. I think that if you can find the help you need and accepting and loving yourself you will find others will do the same. I know how do I do that there's plenty of suggestions here on books you can get at the library, you live in a big city I'm sure you can find the help you need for a therapist on a sliding scale for for free depending on your income.

Hate towards others is essentially hate to life or hate to yourself.

You could even try subs like r/semenretention, r/noFap or r/noporn etc, if that may be a thing for you.

You treat them like you would if you had been with women your whole life. You choose girls you are attracted to and emotionally bond with, those who are good to you and deserve your respect and time. 

I have always been skinny. Too skinny, in fact. As a female, I was also judged and laughed at for being “flat” and “barely a woman”. I worked so hard in the gym to start having curves and eating so much I would get sick. I relate to the struggle of wanting to fit in with standards that I wasn’t built for without hard work. I put myself through hell to be what society wanted me to be. But at the end of the day I realized that the only person I was looking to make happy was myself. The validation and the attention meant nothing if I didn’t believe what they were telling me or if I needed them to continue to always remind me that I was good enough. 

Self love and your own confidence in who you are as a person, not what you look like or where you’re from, is what good people truly look for in you. That’s where love grows, off of the love you have inside and who you are and what you have to offer. Good and confident people who will help you grow are self assured and overall happier because they require nothing but themselves to be happy. They are not “missing” parts of themselves because they know they are beautiful exactly as they are, regardless of what is believed to be lacking or too much by others. You will meet people and the less resentful you are at them for what OTHERS have taught you to believe, the easier it will be to connect with them. Find peace, love yourself, and all will fall in place thereafter. Some cringey Facebook quote I read awhile back said “your vibe attracts your tribe” and it’s honestly so accurate. What energy you radiate, pessimistic or optimistic, will be reflected back to you by your environment and the people around you. Allow yourself to feel, validate, accept, and change your emotional reactions and your mindset in order to grow in to the best version of yourself to attract even better people in your life. You will find people to love and support you through the hard cycles you keep repeating internally and eventually these habits will be easier to break.

This was so much longer than I intended but I seriously wish you the best. Don’t beat yourself up for how you used to feel and think because today is a new day! This is going to be a big emotional maturity milestone for you which is exciting because that means this is a new chapter for new opportunities and feelings!

I always like to have this mindset: despite being big (I am considered morbidly obese), I know who I am as a person and those who see that will come to me. 


Maybe start with more of body positivity and healthy mindsets? Look at yourself in the mirror everyday and say something along the lines of: 

- I am handsome 
- I deserve happiness and love 
- I am amazing 
- my body is a temple that I am building from the ground up
- I may not be where I want to be but that’s okay, I am happy where I am and I’ll be happy the next day. 



Trust me it’ll sound silly saying it the first few weeks but it does help in tricking your mind for a good minute that you are what you’re telling yourself before you fully believe it and show it! 

Self love and seeing yourself in a good light is a good place to start. I was told this when I used to go to church (I’m not sure your religion and this doesn’t involve religion necessarily): people will see you how you want them to see you despite everything else. If you show people that you’re handsome, working on yourself, social, laid back, etc- they’ll gravitate towards that and see you that way. 

If you show people that you’re reclusive, angry, grumpy, negative, etc- even if they didn’t see you that way in the beginning, because you’re actively showing that you “should” be seen this way- they’ll start believing what you’re feeding them.

j44gwxw,t1_j438aki,2023-01-13 02:31:08,selfimprovement,"Agreed. Obsessing over getting laid / attaching your value as a human being to how much you get laid is a huge turn off. I have tons of guy friends who are overweight and in very meaningful relationships. Nobody owes you shit, OP. You're not entitled to anything, and that kind of entitled attitude is likely what's turning off the ladies.

There's also the matter of the girlfriendzone. It's like the reverse friend zone - it's when a man treats a woman automatically and sometimes belligerently as a potential partner even though she has not expressed interest or has flat out said no. Women don't like this. It's disrespectful of boundaries and comes off as desperate. Often times, it also results in unwanted creepy behavior. I'm not accusing you of this btw. I'm just saying that if your only intent with all women is to hopefully fuck them, they will likely smell that a mile away and avoid you. Remember that every woman has learned to detect creepy behavior from a very early age.",whatarechimichangas,t2_fwx3di2,217,0,reddit3

The top comments under these posts always say something along the line of this and I find it pretty frustrating because it’s like we’re all dancing around the major elephant in the room, with “oh it’s your attitude,” or “you need to stop trying to get laid and look for a life partner.” Just be straight with the dude tell him he’s fat he will have more success once he loses weight as long as he keeps trying and his attitude on women will most likely correct itself once he falls into a relationship if he start interacting with women more and keeps the same attitude that’s when you maybe take a step back and work on your outlooks and attitudes. But it’s almost impossible to have nothing but bad experiences with a group and keep an entirely positive outlook on them, as long as he knows that logically he’s wrong then that means that these position will naturally correct themselves once he starts have positive experiences with women.",throooooow6372,t2_5gnezjiz,-6,0,reddit3

j45w1s2,t1_j42yads,2023-01-13 11:27:36,selfimprovement,">Hi, food can be for comfort or in an effort to fill up something that is missing inside you. (From lots of therapy) I've learned I can't easily regulate my eating when I'm going through something.. sometimes disordered eating (too much, too little, things I know to be the wrong thing) can be the first sign to me that something might be going on that I haven't spotted. 

>In this way this anger and resentment is circular for you and is fueling itself. Individual women and ""friends"" have rejected you and you have logged this as women don't want you and when you punish yourself into being thin your gonna punish them then too. That sounds like a great way to end up feeling unhappy and lonely in yourself. 

>Have you ever considered that you may be looking in the wrong place for the problem. What type of people are you friends with.. sounds like they are shallow and not worth investing time into. With regard to the women you say won't look at you.. can you say honestly is this all women or are you already preemptively excluding the ""fat girls"" you think it would feel good to take your ""revenge"" out on. Or another possibility is could your attitude and bitterness be already coming through to others and causing them to view you negatively. 

>I would say focus on yourself. How to make yourself happy. How to be kind to yourself. How to be thankful that you have a body that is healthy enough to allow you to workout. I'm guessing at those stats you are stronger than most beginners in the gym and can push some weight, that kind of thing. As soon as you have a better relationship with yourself everything else will fall into place. Good luck. (Hope this doesn't sound harsh, it isn't meant to be)

And I get it OP, the shame can feel overwhelming, But the call is coming from inside the house, and the shame is coming from you. I've seen so many obese guys go into the dating pool, lament to me about not getting the attention of fit women, finally relent and start looking at women their size, and end up in incredibly fulfilling relationships. The initial attraction wears off even with a model-level-hot partner and all you're left with is the emotional connection, and guys, if you like playing video games and making chicken fingers, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ENJOY BEING WITH A WOMAN WHO GETS UP AT 5 AM TO GO ON A HIKE, you're not going to like the protein smoothies she makes in the morning. You're not going to like the look on her face the 129th time she asks you if you want to go for a run and you say no. You're denying your true personality to get something that someone else has told you is valuable. And intimate acts don't feel better with thinner women, if you get my drift. 

&#x200B;

OP, one TANGIBLE way to change your outward feelings is simply to expose yourself to images of larger people. Literally one week of looking at images of larger people, in any way you can pursue it, makes you more acceptable of that size. Like, literally start looking at catalogs or instagram accounts of larger people of both genders and you'll naturally grow to accept the size limits.

I don't hold it against people and when I do feel good about myself again, I'm still going to treat people like I do now...like people. 

We get so caught up in our own heads that we can't really see how people view us. What I take comfort in is knowing that when I remember people or things about people I admire is in how they made me feel, not by what they looked like. Plus, people don't think about you nearly as much as you think they do. And if people aren't inviting you places because of your size, then I might reevaluate your relationship with them. 

Focus on becoming happy with who you are at every stage of your weight loss. You'll find someone, but not if you're harboring resentment no matter what size you are.

Plus, as a woman, I don't particularly like the buff gym bro types. I like a little dad bod. Honestly, imperfections make people beautiful. I wasn't attracted to my college boyfriend at first, like at all, but he made me feel good about myself, and the more I got to know him the more his imperfections just became a part of him.

The first step is recognizing the problem, which you have. Why it's a problem, which you have. How it affects you, which you have. Then comes the complexities. That starts with self awareness. How would you like to be treated? Is generalizing fair? It's easy and makes life easier itself but is it fair?To put it bluntly  do you think that looking at life as a victim or looking at circumstances as a hurdles to overcome and become a better person, is bette? Am I just reacting or am I doing this to become a better person?

There's a lot of what's and why's.

This would be very good exercise for you, to filter that resentment and transfer it to a more positive and constructive response to what's going on in your life. Challenge yourself to be the opposite of the people that have mistreated you. Prove to yourself ,you're better than them by overcoming this hurdle and not letting the anger and resentment take over. It's easy to let it, it's more courageous and requires strength to not retaliate but to show how to be the better person.

Talk to your family and friends about your issues, here on reddit, really anywhere. Growth/improvement starts with critical thinking and asking yourself the tough questions. I do it everyday. I'm not perfect in the slightest, I make mistakes but I reflect on my actions and analyze them. 

I think you know the answers to your questions, you just have to commit. It's not easy being the level headed, compassionate individual ( theres internal conflict sometimes thinking you could have taken tevenge but you quickly realize, what good is that?)but when someone sees you as that person, it may influence them to do the same.

OP seems like a genuine, thoughtful guy, and he’s openly sharing his guilt in these thoughts toward women.  We don’t control our thoughts.  We control our actions.

This man is intuitive, and he actually has the awareness to recognize these thought patterns.  That alone speaks volumes to his character, not to mention his *intentional* efforts to seek help and change those patterns.

Ironically, the people who shit on him the hardest were the women on this sub focusing in the fact that he has a sex drive like any other animal on the face of the earth.

The fact is… society had rules, and our biology has mandates that may be impossible to consciously override.

The point is, it’s not simple. To suggest that this man’s biggest issue is his offhand mention if his natural human sex drive and complete disregard and even disdain for his struggle is baffling.

Women and men are two equal forces in a complex society, and there’s no place for the hatred of women or men.  In fact, that romanticizes the power of gender when the interwoven evolutionary *system* is to blame.

That said, it’s true that unattractive men can and do develop strong relationships with attractive women.  Look at Sartre for example.  Unfortunately, Sartre was basically an asshole to women, and they effectively used each-other.

I can assure you that obese women are facing the same issues. Like, being ""the good friend"" to the men in their lives but invisible when it comes to romantic relationships. And yes, with that can come this certain kind of bitterness. 

When you lose weight and you no longer carry the social stigma of obesity there will be times when you're asking yourself (maybe only in the back of your brain, but anyway) if this or that person would have treated you the same way some years ago when you were obese. Would they have talked to you? Or would you just have been invisible to that person?

Choosing not to feel bitter can be as simple as letting it go in the moment because it's poison and shift your mind to something else. For me that thing is gratitude. When you feel bitter, stop and think of 5 things you're grateful for, write them down. You will feel better and you'll bring more gratitude and less bitterness into each day.

I’ve done multiple prolonged fasts and the skin tightening is true too because your body goes through a process called autophagey when you don’t eat for a few days. “Auto” is Greek for “self” and “phagey” is Greek for “eating”. When your body goes into autophagey mode, it eats the stuff you don’t want or need (like extra skin). Autophagey also stops you from getting cancer, diabetes and dementia and the person that discovered it in humans won the Nobel prize in medicine in 2016. 

Fasting is not a “crash diet”, it is a way to activate DNA code that only comes active when you fast for days. When you fast a few days, your body also produces anti-aging hormones,
Stem cells and BDBF (a substance that protects your brain). Fasting makes you live longer and look younger as you do it. It also saves you money but that really doesn’t matter compared to the health benefits. 

Your ancestors and mine were fasting for thousands of years before fast food and theories on calories in/out became a thing in your mind. The body you inherited uses fasting as a tool to clean yourself and heal yourself and yes - prolonged fasts eat skin too. 

My solution is free and fixes the problem down to the cellular level. Further more after a prolonged fast, your body produces more muscle receptors which makes it easier to gain muscle when you hit the gym.

j43r2fk,t1_j43pala,2023-01-12 23:29:09,selfimprovement,"I know about feeing faint. Been there. 

The faint feeling is caused by not supplementing with electrolytes in your water.  If you just drink tap water for days, you will feel terrible. Buy fasting salts off of Amazon and mix the salt in your water - it’s basically like drinking IV fluid. Sip the salt water as you go and chase it with tap water if you don’t like the taste. 

Your body needs salt to conduct its processes so supplement with electrolytes on all prolonged fasts where you intend to go beyond 3 days.  If you are going less than 3 days you don’t need salt.

**bonus**
After your 1st 3 day fast your metabolism will be higher by 15% for the next 6 months because the autophagey eats your low functioning mitochondria and your body replaces them with high functioning mitochondria that use more energy. You will burn more calories just sitting around.

Sometimes you just need to write train of thought type stuff to get your stopped-up angers out. I often would start by writing what I was angry about for as long as it took me to feel lighter, then I would switch to some things I was more grateful for in my life, then I would finish by writing some affirmations. This whole process could take an hour and lots of crying, but it did help me get out my feelings and start having a better outlook on life.

Also, if you're overweight from food consumption- eating as a coping mechanism- you can attend overeater anonymous. If you've used any *other* substance to cope, you can attend AA. If you have any family members who struggle with addiction, you can attend Alanon- adult children of alcoholics (for anyone with any family who struggles with addiction). 

Group therapy is VERY effective and often completely free. 

Now, the logical part of your brain is right- revenge will not make you a good person, but it WILL make you a bad one. You avoided saying that, and I'm not trying to be mean, but I am being real with you. If you let your anger and bitterness control your actions and you give yourself permission to be horrible to others, you will have become your abusers. Do you really want to make someone else feel the way you do?? 

Your other option is to lean into empathy. I was abused as a kid and I NEVER want someone to feel the way I felt. I do what I can to uplift people because I know what it is to have nothing going your way and no one on your side. Being the person who helps others through hard times makes me feel hopeful that I've made someone feel *better* and drawn them towards the lighter side of life. 

Don't worry about women right now (also, don't call us females- its dehumanizing) and focus on your own journey. If you're doing this ""to get women"" you're not doing it for the right reasons. Yes, having a relationship is important, but change lasts when you do it for yourself. Not to get noticed, but to feel better: have improved health, like the way YOU look, save money on clothes, etc. 

Take women off of your radar until you feel better about yourself. Just, don't make that an option or priority- because as it stands, you're not ready for a relationship, no matter how much you want one. You need to work on your mindset far more than your body, and if ""in your heart, you want to hurt them the way they've hurt you,"" then you're not looking for a relationship. Not a healthy one, anyway. And no one deserves to be with someone who wants to hurt them.",lexi-thegreat,t2_4e6al7im,48,0,reddit3

It works well for me with general conspiratorial thinking/jealousy/bitterness/irritation etc. though.

I read one comment saying ""this mindset gets women killed"" and it's textbook slippery slope. Most of the comments berating OP are collectively building a highway straight to redpill.

No one is perfect, and just like anything else, dating has a learning curve. Often times we see failure as something to be ashamed of but that simply shouldn’t be the case. Failure is proof you tried, and more importantly, it shows that your eventual success is due to your ability to learn and grow. I think that’s why people associate “bad boys” with getting girls. Because “bad boys” are normally far more confident in themselves and don’t need gratification from another person.

I mean yeah shes my friend but I didnt do a brake job on her truck for free, but I didnt charge her very much either, it was easy and was just happy to help save her some cash.

All in all thanks for this OP, you actually made me feel a lot better than I have been lately.

I \[21/M\] feel like i'm in a painful transition phase at the moment, I can confidently say that I have those good qualities, however I get frustrated that I barely get dates even though I want to be a in a long term relationship. I'm also frustrated that if I don't proactively pursue a girl, i will get nowhere and nothing will happen, whereas if I'm more active about it I will most likely face many more rejections (which is quite demoralizing as I've done and tried it before), that's being needy which the post goes against and will most likely get nowhere. I'd like to add that I'm not unattractive, I get a lot of gazes from women/girls but it hasn't amounted to anything. E.g) I was on a popular street in my city yesterday that has a lot of pubs/bars and got lots of heads turning, but that positive attention and ego trip conflicts with me because I don't know what the fuck to do? I recently dyed the top half of my hair half blonde to add a flair to my look which has helped. Ironically I have confidence, calm and can be a guy in charge in life threatening situations or when shit gets real as I've dealt with a lot of those growing up (abusive parents, running away from home twice at 17 and 19). I think my childhood and teenage years have shaped most of my maturity, which is a good thing, but at the cost of being a toxic overthinker and not being abel to relate to things with friends my age; hence i get along better with people that are a couple of years older than me.

I know that women owe me nothing, and vice versa, but ashamedly at the back of my head it's still bitter that they get to pick and choose (and no I'm not talking about casual sex) while I go through constant heavy phases of loneliness, even after having a good day or a good time with friends. Ironically most of my friends are girls who have said I'm attractive but not their type (which is fine), I have guy friends as well, I take care of myself, dress well, gym, hobbies  and 2 jobs. Logically, I know that all of those things don't entitle me to dates or a relationship, but emotionally it can get pretty lonely because I have so ***many chips on my shoulders that need time to be broken down (having shit parents that I had to cut everything off from, so no positive biological family relationships make it worse as I'm healing from all that shit and there being no safety net, I've also had to cut off a toxic previous girlfriend recently where we were on and off for a few years, so i'm not inexperienced in a relationship/sexual context).*** Back to dating however, I'm working on framing my ""problems"" as something that I'm inexperienced in, so failure is inevitably part of the process, learned that one from Dr. K on youtube.

The best things I know to do is to shut the fuck up, stop overthinking and take a risk if a situation arises, get out of my comfort zone as much as possible when it comes to girls (but not to the point of ironically being needy), continue with therapy and the gym :')

Edit: My coping mechanisms are currently just cycling through hip hop/rap songs (travis scott plug) especially at the gym that keep me in a good bumpy mood, trying to go the gym everyday, trying to find time to get back into gaming with my online friends too should also do me good.",Astronommy,t2_1saoxmfm,3,0,reddit4

I’m going through a breakup right now, getting away from a woman I’ve been with for several years. When we met, I was only just starting to outgrow my nice-guy tendencies. We were perfect for each other because I feel like, at the time, she might have been the female nice-guy counterpart: a depressed, emotion sucking vacuum who was desperate for attention. Over time, I started to grow up, to mature both emotionally and intellectually. She did not, and now I realize that this girl who was once my world really only remained in that place for my own self validation.

ggfwr7r,t3_ke7t7c,2020-12-20 04:22:32,selfimprovement,"Good advice but it's somewhat naive and not always practical.

For instance, chill guys (like myself).
When talking to a girl, NO...
I dont have anything to say about your tshirt. 
I shouldn't have to challenge you.
And I shouldn't have to stir some drama to look ""manly"".

That being said,
you're giving women too much credit, forgetting that sometimes they're also at fault.

If I approach a woman politely, it's NOT my fault that she misunderstands who I am. I'm not a spineless simp just because I didn't tease her with and was too mature/agreeable during the approach. That's what friendly well-adjusted people do...smile and not come on too strong. Politely approaching someone != niceguy^tm, that's on her. She doesn't even *know me* well enough to make that call. She's rejecting her idea of me. I have boundaries and will enforce them as see fit. I won't be challenging for the sake of it.
Also, not being suave when hitting on her doesn't mean that I'm a humorless asshole (I have my charming moments!). Humor is not forced. I'll say a neat story when/if it comes to mind. It's just bad luck if I have nothing special to say when talking to her.

Also, you would think that it's better meeting girls through a hobby (like you said). Not always. You can drone on about parts of the hobby that she's not interested in. Not have the right charming voice. Not her type. No superficial status/not a ""leader"" in some community related to it. Etc.
Plus it can be a good thing not to date someone who shares your hobby (why would you date yourself?). You shouldn't have to limit yourself just to people who share common interests.
Good thing mutual physical attraction often overrides most of this shit (until the actual date though lol)

Girls make false assumptions soo many times, it's just funny.
Lookism is another factor i.e. people assigning (often stereotypical) personality traits based on how you look smh. 
I can't tell you how many times girls act patronizing (""aww"") when a nerdy looking guy approaches her. like tf? That *human* is sexual too and can fuck you good. These girls can be in straight denial (solution: be a buff nerd lol).

Second, I think that male sexuality is demonized. That's why ""desperation"" can be subjective. There's a reason why players get upset when a girl won't ""put out"". All this work courting her and no ass?! lmao not happening. James Hustle of GNN had a story like this. 
Now before you accuse me of ""niceguy"" behavior being entitled to sex and other misandrist crap, look at it closely. This is the reality of the sexual dynamic. Guys have to play by her rules to get sex. Entertaining her and controlling your lust for a long time is a lot of work. Slight desperation WILL be a side effect. You're going to get blue balls if you don't push for sex soon enough.

Ironically, charm is a sexual strategy like when you said:
>""I don't think you and I are going to work out, we should call it quits now' (after she reveals she doesn't like Nando's)""

This sounds VERY pickup artistry, exactly like what angrypicnic or todd valentine would say lol. Hypocritical much? ""ill conceived lazy seduction approach"". Classic push pull. And this isn't even true wit/observational humor, you just made up that scenario.

Lastly, niceguys arent necessarily unsucessful with women because they're nice and ""desperate"" for sex.
You can get lots of sex if you're a nice guy, provided you're also charming (ie have game, entertaining stories), goodlooking, and have your shit together.
BUT looks and charm aren't always attainable. I know in this tiktok/ig era we think that anyone can ""glow up"" but for 80% that's just not true. Survivor bias. Most serious introverted men can't *just be* the life of the party (unless they act fake). Can't tell that many cool relatable stories if you're a homebody either. It's also hard to truly be goodlooking if you have an ugly/average face. Getting swole might even work against you eg being that ""butterface guy at the gym"". Test your shot (you may get lucky), but self-improvement has limits.


Most of all, sex is important. Nice guys (or any guy for that matter) shouldn't be stigmatized for wanting sex with who they find attractive. It's the sad truth but there's winner and losers in this pursuit.
Funny how you can have the perfect personality yet STILL get rejected for one limiting thing e.g. your looks. Logistics. Cockblockers.
You can have your cool when you get rejected, but you can't pretend that it's not disappointing. This is also why girls don't take sexual rejection too well. It's time that the double standard of ""being pouty for sexual rejection = loser"" comes to an end.
Not getting laid will ALWAYS suck (especially after investing so much time into the dates). Emotions are natural, shouldn't feel shame for it.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

These *good man* traits don't make up for that.

We're all somewhere along a path of human growth, and this is just how yours looks so far. It's an unpleasant truth but no one gets through life without causing someone pain (including yourself), whether deliberate or not. Process the shame, don't let it continue to eat you up inside. Mourn it, grieve it, whatever you need to do to let off some of the intensity. You could pursue growth as a way to distance yourself from shame.. and you can also grow because you are practicing advocating for yourself, because you are building love for yourself, because you know you want to (and deserve to be) in a headspace where you are so solidly grounded and self-aware that your interactions with the world and other people comes from genuine love, compassion, kindness and not out of entitlement and a need to fill an emptiness.",stickysweetastytreat,t2_1sz1dct,16,0,reddit4

gg2qzkb,t1_gg1our5,2020-12-16 21:59:20,selfimprovement,"I agree with you but I would also add (slightly off topic) that women/girls from a young age are encouraged by society (whether consciously or subconsciously) to lean more towards ""bad boys"" until they often learn the hard way that ""bad boys"" and nice guys are not the sort of people that are good partner material. Ever heard someone say to a girl, ""if a boy pulls on your pigtails or is mean to you, it means he likes you""? This is where that ""bad boy"" attraction ultimately comes from. If he's showing what are basically red flags even at a young age he's seen as more attractive. I should know, I had a crush on a ""bad boy"" in my teens simply for that reason and I know I'm not alone. That being said, it's not young boys' fault as society is telling them that the only way to show they ""like like"" someone is to be mean to them. But yes, you're right, generally people grow out of it as they mature and realise that isn't how the real world works.

Keep it light. If you've gotten to know their interests a little, you can play on that a bit. 

Example: I'm a big car guy, and I recently learned that an older friend liked a certain brand. Maserati, for those wondering. They're prone to issues, though. I was able to follow up later by showing her a posting of one of the models we both liked for only $8k($120k new in 2008). I just joked with her and said ""It's tempting, right?

Think of when young girls get teased at the playground from boys or something and people say “oh he just likes you” so girls take bullies as affection sometimes. 

Also young girls watch how their fathers treat their mothers and learn to be treated like that. So if the father is verbally or emotionally abusive to the mother that is how the girl will internalize love/affection. 

Lastly when people feel ignored or rejected from some thing or someone, they will want it more. Everyone is like that. 

Most of those points people mature or grow out from or they date the “bad boy” and learn from their mistakes.

A good guy will respect your decision, and maintain a healthy relationship that avoids a few key things:

1) Dwelling on those feelings. It is definitely possible to move on, sometimes it takes time or a shift in perspective.

2) Reminding you of their past feelings.

3) Harboring and outwardly displaying any misgivings they may have felt upon initial rejection.

Handled like this, you should be happy to see your friend make decisions that make her happy.

Failing that, as life and emotions are complicated and messy, at least make her aware of the complication in the way you feel. Don't cut contact completely, if you can, take a cooling off period and try to continue being friends.

You may need to work on building your feelings self worth, often rejection feels as harshly as it does because your self worth was inadvertently tied to the opinion someone had of you.

This is very important, as I've had a guy who said he was in love with me and we became close friends, sometimes more but he always expected something more and just had this idea of me that wasn't me at all. He was very nice and I tried, but you can't really feel loved by guys like that, you can never feel seen by them. And the fact that they think they ""deserve"" your love and time just because they love you a lot and do nice things to you is such a huge pressure on someone. He should've been clear about what he wants ""I either want you as a girlfriend or I won't touch you"" etc. Like Dan did with Blair in Gossip Girl, that actually got him the girl. Or try to get to know her first before falling in love just because she likes the same couple of things as him (which is more about him and his ideals than who she really is) He didn't really love Summer because he never knew who she really is, never listened. And we never got to see the guy Summer married at the end, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't like Tom.

He believes meeting ""the one"" is the only way he can be happy and projects that onto Summer. But love is not about constantly being happy, it's not about what is good about the other person. It's about knowing everything horrible about them, their fears and traumas and wanting to be with them anyways. He even days ""I love how she makes me feel."" Women can feel this, he doesn't love her he loves how he feels with her. It's all about himself. 

When she opens up to him and days ""I've never told anyone this before."" his reaction is ""I guess I'm not just anybody."" I mean, seriously? She opens up to him and all be can think about is still himself? I'm sorry but most women would not want to be with Tom. Even the screenwriter says ""He doesn't know anything about her. He just sees what he wants to see.""

I mean, when she says she doesn't want a boyfriend he just screams ""I say we're a couple, god damn it"" he feels like he deserves to be her boyfriend just because he took a punch that she didn't even ask for. Just accept she doesn't want a boyfriend and move on. He didn't have self confidence or self worth to begin with, it's not Summers fault if he has less after she leaves.

Ask her out early if you find yourself developing feelings so a rejection won't be detrimental.

I think my argument applies in situations where two people are forced to spend time together, but it mainly applies in situations where a friendship develops first. In some cases, men hide their attraction to women and act like they want to be friends until one day they suddenly reveal their interest and end the friendship if their feelings aren’t reciprocated. I imagine there are women who do this too. I don’t think it’s fair to forge a friendship if you’re secretly trying to merge it into a relationship. To your point though, if there was no illusion of friendship before expressing interest, there’s certainly no obligation to keep putting effort in afterward.",lunchvic,t2_4syiafzd,1,0,reddit4

gqf584a,t1_gqbevr7,2021-03-10 06:29:24,selfimprovement,">This is very important, as I've had a guy who said he was in love with me and we became close friends, sometimes more but he always expected something more and just had this idea of me that wasn't me at all. He was very nice and I tried, but you can't really feel loved by guys like that, you can never feel seen by them. And the fact that they think they ""deserve"" your love and time just because they love you a lot and do nice things to you is such a huge pressure on someone. He should've been clear about what he wants ""I either want you as a girlfriend or I won't touch you"" etc. Like Dan did with Blair in Gossip Girl, that actually got him the girl.

Alright, I mean this in the nicest way possible but you sound like a giant dickhead. ""I either want you as a girlfriend or I won't touch you"" What's stopping YOU from asking that either? If you don't feel a certain way about somebody, you should be expressing it directly instead of expecting a line from a TV show. Also, the fact that you are comparing real life to an exaggerated TV show is ridiculous, to say the least.

I've seen several instances of that during my time in college. Guys dating girls and the girls awkwardly trying to break it away instead of just straight up telling them that they aren't ready for commitment. Honestly, it sounds like you didn't like the guy and you liked that he made you feel good about yourself but didn't like the larger expectation (which you could have clearly told him as an ultimatum).

The same happens in the movie which is what pisses me off so much. She takes absolutely zero responsibility for him obviously being upset and in a relationship where he is not getting what he needs. I don't know about you but if my girlfriend is upset about (say, children, family, or career), then I would just leave her instead of prolonging the suffering.

You can't just conveniently wash your hands of a friendship/relationship problem without even addressing it properly until it reaches an ultimatum stage. You have no idea how many women I know who conveniently do this while shattering the men they leave behind.  It's like they want to keep up this whole facade that they're really nice people but it's all bullshit and they're terrified of confrontation.

>He didn't have self confidence or self worth to begin with, it's not Summers fault if he has less after she leaves. It's not someone else's responsibility to make you respect yourself more.

&#x200B;

That's just the thing. He DID have self-confidence. She tore it apart by not putting her foot down and leading him on. I appreciate that she dumps him at the record store but she should never have come back into his life (conveniently without any regard for his feelings), lead him on once more, and take him back home. That's just plain cruel.",RainmaKer770,t2_hdg65,1,0,reddit4

And I'm the one sounding like a dickhead, alright. 

Sorry but if a woman tells you up front she isn't interested and you keep pushing your limits, trying to make her feel she ""has to"" like you or that she would be a fool if she didn't, you can't really blame her if she goes through a period of ""what if?"" before realizing you can't really force someone to like someone. Actually, I believe they would become a couple and end up together if Tom wasn't as self centered and didn't saw Summer as the object of his desires and ""the one"" and instead tried to actually listen to her and get to know her. Both the actor and the screen writer kept saying the same thing. 
Also, they were never a couple. He had no rights to expect her to behave how a girlfriend would. That's probably another reason why she left. Instead of playing the victim, he needs to reflect on his mistakes and not do that again next time but of course he didn't so probably the same shit happened with Autumn. 
And no, he didn't. He was the type of hopeless romantic who believed he couldn't be happy without finding the ""one"" (says exactly like this in the movie) and he projected all of those unrealistic romantic ideals onto a beautiful woman she saw at work. She didn't care whatsoever about who she was or what she wanted.",kawaiibutpsycho,t2_31ilu4i4,2,0,reddit4
gg2wvod,t1_gg2um43,2020-12-16 22:48:30,selfimprovement,"Let me clarify—

Healthy love develops slowly, so it should be easy to say something long before your feelings have built up to a level that would make friendship too painful. If you find yourself in a situation where your feelings have made friendship impossible, you should consider that you might have a problem recognizing, communicating, and managing your own emotions. I think a lot of men in this boat actually keep their feelings secret and hope the friendship will naturally merge into a relationship, which isn’t fair either.

Infatuation can develop quickly, and maybe this is where people are getting hung up. If you’re friends with a woman and suddenly realize you’re in love with her, without noticing any building feelings along the way, that’s its own big red flag.

It is necessary to tell the other person your feelings whenever they develop. BUT most “nice guys” have the issue of lack of self esteem, and keeping emotions in check. FOR THEM it is almost always necessary to cut contact (through letting the girl know why they are doing this) in order for them to grow so they don’t latch on this girl through a friendship as my whole point is that feelings and infatuation are difficult to get rid of when you aren’t emotionally trained for that.

gg1xhjn,t1_gg1uszv,2020-12-16 18:08:53,selfimprovement,"In general, women don’t know why they want what they want. That’s because attraction is largely unconscious. That’s not to say that women are completely emotional and men are completely logical. But women’s attraction tends to be based on emotion, while men’s attraction tends to be more visual. These are just generalizations, of course. Men don’t really know why they want what they want, either.

But if it’s true that a woman is attracted to a man based on how he makes her feel, then the best thing a man can do for himself is to be non-needy—what OP calls a good man, rather than a nice guy. That means being outcome independent (not trying for a particular end goal—trying too hard is bad), having an abundance mentality (there are plenty of women out there, so rejection isn’t a bad thing—it frees you to find someone better), and being non-needy (paradoxically, when you truly don’t need a woman in your life, that is when you’re most attractive because you exude non-neediness).

Women are drawn to men who aren’t desperate and who stand on their own. When those men choose to invest in women they find worth their time and effort, those women find themselves irresistibly attracted because women are turned on by being desired. Women are also attracted to vulnerability, kindness, and a whole bunch of other qualities that pickup artist types who focus on “alpha” qualities don’t have any clue about.
