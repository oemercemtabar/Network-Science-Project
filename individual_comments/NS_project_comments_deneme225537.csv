k9wwr6i,t3_17yu7m6,2023-11-19 17:57:20,science,"I think what this largely misses is that the draw of the new medications isn’t necessarily that they blow the effectiveness of the old meds out of the water, it’s that for many people, they’re a lot lower on side effects. 

Amitryptiline can make you feel really sedated, have dry mouth and other side effects. Beta Blockers flared up my asthma awfully, I couldn’t be on them. I’ve never been on topiramate, but I’ve also heard that the side effects of that one (nausea, brain fog, etc) can be absolutely brutal. 

I am NOT knocking people who find these meds effective and find the side effects minimal or tolerable. Different strokes, different folks, etc. Hell, a lot of people HATE Lyrica, but I’ve been on it for chronic (body) pain for over a decade, with my only side effect being some slight weight gain, and it’s a miracle drug for me. It makes a huge difference.

k9xlm94,t3_17yu7m6,2023-11-19 20:41:47,science,"As a person who takes a lot of medications, there have been a few reasons why I’ve chosen the more expensive brand. 

Generics are fine if they have the same active ingredient, which is the case 95% of the time. 

But when you’re like me and gotta take a dozen pills a day, comfort is an important factor in quality of life. 

Sometimes cheaper pills are large, and literally difficult to swallow because they have a “rough” texture. 

I have actively chosen some specific brands because through my experience, it was worth it to pay the extra 00.01¢ per pill for a much more pleasant experience to swallow it. 

Not because I thought the “brand” name pill was “better” or more effective. But because it actually made a difference to the quality of my day. 

Taking a paracetamol once in a blue moon because you might be feeling unwell doesn’t compare to somebody that needs to take a literal thousand pills each year. It’s like torture by a thousand tiny cuts. 

Which is another analogy I can make. 

I don’t mind needles or taking blood. I’ve done it a million times… but that’s another point. After a while… when that nurse enters your room for the fifteenth day in a row with that dreaded look on her face “need more bloods”

And my spine tingles because I just can’t take another jab. 

Long story short; “accumulation”

One little jab; fine. One little pill; fine. 

But you have to take a thousand jabs or a thousand pills; the smoothness or size begins to have a huge impact. And I can categorically tell you, some pills are easier to swallow than others (even if they have the same “active ingredient”)",,,2,0,reddit2

By all means: if it helps you that's great, at least if you don't get the usual side effects that can make life almost as little fun as migraines (have those too, occasionally).

I'm honestly puzzled that this - very interesting pharmacologically and chemically - drug is constantly pushed as a remedy for pain. A 30% reduction in pain is significant but far from useful if you are unable to walk and get bad side effects from it.

Obviously I didn't read all the literature (there's a lot) and everyone is different. It's just frustrating when M.D.s keep trying to sell you the same, for me, crappy drug that doesn't even show much effect in studies.

k9y3pzu,t1_k9xninq,2023-11-19 22:46:04,science,"It turns out that my migraines are triggered by histamine. 

Over a lifetime, I would go to the doctor and complain, and they would say: ""Well, I can't do much for migraines but you need to eat healthier and exercise more, and lose some weight.""

It turns out that literally all of the healthy food I like is extremely high in histamine, and also the body naturally releases histamine into the bloodstream during exercise. So, the healthier I ate, the sicker I got. Histamine also causes water retention and bloating, so it appeared as if the healthier I ate and the more I exercised, the more weight I gained, and the fatter I appeared.

Trying low histamine foods appeared to make no difference at all. It appears that I am so sensitive to histamine that the tiniest amount just f.cks me right up. So for me, the only thing that worked was throwing out everything I have learned in a lifetime of amateur studying of nutrition, eliminating ALL FOOD, and starting over with just two or three very low histamin foods, and slowly adding in one new low histamine food per week. Only then did my body very clearly tell me immediately what it objected to. I immediately stopped all exercise and became a complete slug; exercise often made me sick, but I thought it was necessary.

When I did this, I immediately started feeling much better within days. Within weeks, my ""IBS"" appeared to be cured. Within a month, it was clear I was losing weight, which appeared to be mostly water retention; the bloating mostly went away. Within six months I had lost 20 pounds with no exercise, and my clothes hung off me.

I went from ""why do I have a migraine"" to ""why is my eye acting up like I'm about to have a migraine"" and then I noticed, by fluke, that I'm also starting some digestive issues that show up a day or two later. 

Once I took the digestive issues seriously, or just fasted for a bit, the eye symptoms would halt before getting really severe and I stopped getting migraines entirely once I found that slow/blocked digestion was the source.

Humans are so strange?

The article is written by a PR organization and those are not usually worth the electrons used to display it. There is no peer review for claims made in press releases. There is not data contained in the study itself to support the claim in the title. Notably, I also don't recall the study even mentioning cost as a metric for analysis.

 Their conclusion was ""In conclusion, responder rates to the different drugs ranged from 30% to 50%, and there were large differences in retention and effectiveness among the drugs. All drug groups and drugs studied reduced triptan prescription fills. Overall, the results showed favorable response of CGRPabs, amitriptyline, and simvastatin over beta blockers, while topiramate and clonidine were associated with poorer outcome.""

""worked as well"" is also not a metric the study identified, but generally speaking the CGRP ranked better than others on most of their plotted data. I read this all very quickly so it's possible the data can be looked at in a way to support what is being claimed. But the researchers did not do that as part of the study.

I'd watched a UK medical documentary on psilocybin therapy where they like to picture the brain as having 'hard' or 'plasticized' tissue in areas with traumatic memories that we are both overthinking and yet not resolving. 

When the brain is administered psilocybin it begins to soften up and this presents an opportunity to actually start thinking about targeted trauma with new information and feelings, which 'updates' those traumatic memories so they aren't such a time sink/roadblock/mental detour.

The 'softened' state as they call it also lends itself to people who want to try to find new habits since the plastic effect tends to create ruts for mental patterns that are hard to smooth out so that you can form better paths to suit the ever changing world/who you are as you age?",joanzen,t2_68nn3,2,0,reddit2

From my experience there’s a lot of macho-signaling, and they tend to be averse to the socially liberal stuff. 

I’m sure if you polled them on economic issues they’d not be as right leaning, but the Democrats have followed Republicans down the austerity, outsource, and privatization path since the Clinton era and all that’s left to decide on are cultural issues.

> Biden’s plan would build on proposals already introduced by House Democrats and would resurrect several Obama-era policies. Biden supports Democratic legislation that would allow employees to unionize by ""card check"" — the informal collection of authorization forms from a majority within a proposed bargaining unit. Current law gives employers the right to require a formal secret-ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board; Biden’s plan would make card-check the default method, something that unions have long sought.

> Biden supports the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, H.R. 2474 (116), which would, among other things, enhance the National Labor Relations Board's power by allowing it to levy punitive fines against employers who violate labor laws; today, the agency is permitted only to collect back pay. House Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) has called the PRO Act “the most comprehensive legislation in recent history to strengthen workers' right to organize and bargain for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions.” Businesses oppose the bill, arguing that it would give unions too much power.

> Biden pledges to form a “cabinet-level working group“ with representatives from labor unions that would, in the first 100 days of his administration, deliver a plan to “dramatically increase union density and address economic inequality.”

In general white people seem to be more motivated by economics, there is likely a bunch of reasons for this, but one could be that since they dont feel victimized in any way by another demographic, its just not as big of a factor in who they support.

&#x200B;

Because of this, when the democratic party tries to distance itself from things that are apparently ""unelectable"" like anything that sounds too socialist, pro-union, or otherwise not capitalist enough, the economically motivated white supporters get turned off. I feel like since economics are a bigger factor they are more likely to be further left economically of your average democrat.

Couldn't figure out the companies they worked for considered them as nothing more than labor and their relatively high pay and working conditions were brought to them by their union and the companies would love to take it away and they weaken their own union by their lack of support for other unions as well as their votes for anti -union candidates.

 I always felt that most the LE and prison guard types types loved their union but pretty much hated all other unions and would not hesitate to break heads of any real union members. A lot of recent construction union members I've met do seem to be whacko Trumpists but others seem to have figured out Donald like most well off people and most republicans hate unions and want to destroy them. Not too unlike a lot of the older members of my old union...hated the union...voted anti-union politically but wanted the union to somehow keep improving the pay and working conditions while voting for anti-union candidates. For a while in my old union we were getting more younger people that did see the relationship between the union and their pay and working conditions and supported not just our union but others. But recent events make me think that due to the cost of getting trained in my old field it seems to be drawing a lot of people that their family tends to be very anti-union. But I should admit that my own family was anti-union but it didn't take me long to figure out that the union was on my side and the company wasn't.

But even while I was working and seeing more younger members that were a bit liberal I have to admit that I have never seen a member of my old union at any local (Portland OR} multi union event.

Sometimes that DOES happen where the Union runs the business out and he said that was the case. You can’t expect the company to pay you money they don’t have/aren’t making. Especially if now due to labor strikes and unionization, the company has to cut corners in terms of quality to create their products, which damages sales. If you’re not selling anything or you’re pushing out cars that require dealership service under warranty, you’re losing money and as the company loses money and you simultaneously ask for more money and more benefits that the company can’t possibly pay, you’ve essentially “Unioned” yourself out of a job. Off they go to exploit workers from another country.

However I truly believe my career path should have a union to not necessarily benefit US but our customers, being hospitals. There’s too many under qualified workers in my field and some unions require that you have some certification before you can be a part of that union.

I was going to take your word on this part, but then I read

>You also understand wrong about contributions: Yes, they are entirely voluntary. If you don't contribute, you voluntarily lose your job.

You know that's not true. I'm sure you have some anecdotal evidence you'll whip out in response, but to suggest this is standard union policy is straight up lying. DUES are required, PAC is voluntary. 

So yeah, if you want to source that first comment (Specifically in regards to spending dues for political purposes) I'll gladly read it. A quick search (which I admittedly haven't vetted) suggests the laws vary state to state, with some that explicitely forbid union dues going to political purposes, and some others requiring consent from the dues payer to do so (and possibly other scenarios in other states).

https://www.cga.ct.gov/2005/rpt/2005-R-0232.htm

This article is dated 2005, but the Summary reads ""States have taken a variety of different actions to prohibit or restrict deductions of union dues for political purposes. Several have banned the “reverse check-off” practice, enacted so-called “paycheck protection” legislation, and encouraged greater disclosure of unions' expenditures. A “reverse check-off” allows money collected as dues through automatic payroll deductions to be used for corporate or union political activity unless the employee signs a statement that he objects. Conversely, “paycheck protection” laws commonly require unions to obtain upfront, written approval from individual workers before they can spend dues on political or other non-workplace-related activities. ""

This is just conjecture, but something tells me these laws haven't been relaxed in the last 15 years as corporations and republicans continue to attack unions.

Here's another anti-union website explicitly explaining how your PAC and Dues works

https://www.nrtw.org/illegal-pac-funding

Here's the pertinent section - ""It also is unlawful under most circumstances for a labor union to take funds from dues money and transfer it to a federal PAC or to use such funds to give cash directly to a candidate for federal office. If you have evidence that your union is taking money from union dues and transferring the funds to a federal PAC or directly contributing funds to a candidate for federal office from its general treasury, you may contact the Foundation for legal assistance.""

Though this article isn't specifically dated, the copyright at the bottom is dated 2020, so one can assume it's fairly up to date.",Cygnarite,t2_tvjt,3,0,reddit3

I think that society would default back to feudalism, or primitivism. But what I *think* is meaningless, because it's based on abstract reasoning and conjecture. There's no historical evidence to support my claims.

I am very interested in learning more about the laws that govern the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical antibodies. Specifically, I have two questions:

1. What are the rules governing 'copy cat' drugs in this space? Multiple companies, for instance, have PD1-targeting antibodies (immunotherapy) in their pipelines. So clearly a 'target' is not sufficient to warrant IP protection. What is then? And do you see this evolving in the coming years, as antibody therapeutics gain more traction in the industry and clinic?

2. Unlike conventional small molecule therapeutics, making 'generic' (or biosimilar) versions of antibody therapeutics seems much more challenging -- the biology of antibodies is just so complicated. How similar will generic versions of antibody therapeutics need to be to gain approval, and do you think this will be easy to achieve given the intense manufacturing demands that go into making these molecules? Finally, since manufacturing antibody therapeutics is typically more expensive than manufacturing small molecules, how will that impact the rate at which biosimilars are brought to market and their price?",SirT6,t2_g2kb5,13,0,reddit4

2.  They exist already and are in clinical use.  There are two biosimilar antibodies to TNFa on the market in Europe - will soon follow in the US.

I went back to my current company and informed them that I was thinking about this other position and would much rather stay if they could match the salary.

They said they would see what they could do.

After a while I realized that even if I stayed at the same salary, I would be happier with remote work.  I went back to my boss and told them that I turned down the position. My boss said that he appreciated my honesty but wasn't going to tell the higher ups that and would still push for raise.

The.company could have smaller offices and pay less to heat their existing offices, spend less on resources (e.g. fewer chairs, desks etc), and both employer and employee could save money in the long run. Home working (for jobs where it makes sense) is an easy ""win"" for both sides of the employment dynamic.

However, because it was thrust upon so many so quickly, we often don't have the mindset and a lot of the costs seem sunk - e.g. you've already provisioned your offices with equipment and now you have large offices that you have to pay to heat.

Ideally, you could cordon off some of the office and lower the temperature there. You could turn excess equipment into a spare stockpile, to avoid needing to replace breakages for years to come, and offset that against future budgets.

On a larger scale, the big companies could even lease out wings/floors of their larger offices, now they aren't as necessary to smaller companies, who want a small office somewhere. Presumably you'll already have parking and other facilities installed, so huge saving for them, and easy money generating opportunity for the existing business.

What I'm getting at is if you want to work remotely you need to seek out these jobs yourself.

It's not.

Assume current pay for all is $1000 for the week. A ""pay cut for people who don't come in"" will result in some amount less than $1000 for those that don't come in, $900 say. By contrast a ""pay raise for people in the office"" will not reduce the $1000 for those that don't come in. They'll still get $1000 (assuming they don't come in at all).

This doesn't need to change if the scheme is implemented ""over time"" (your original qualification).

Under both scenarios there will be a pay differential between those that come in and those that don't.

Yes, public companies are expected to maximize revenue while reducing costs. No, it doesn't (necesarily) mean that perpetually increasing growth takes priority over anything and everything else. 

There are tons of mature, established companies whose shareholders no longer expect growth *because* it already happened and carrying on at the same clip *is* impossible. They operate with entirely different priorities than a company focusing on growth. People buy shares in these companies (commonly referred to as blue-chips, a term you've likely heard) because they pay dividends to their shareholders, not because shareholders have any expectations their market cap will significantly increase.

With that said, I'm sure you're also aware of inflation. If your company is growing at the same rate, of inflation, it is ""growing"" in nominal terms, but is the same size in real terms. So yes, it's fair to say that for a company, ""negative growth = bad"", but that can be true without the implication that explosive growth *at the cost of everything else* is somehow the ultimate goal.

Can anything grow forever? No. Does anyone expect it to? also no, for the obvious reasons you already mentioned.

Because men work 10x more hard labour jobs than women. And guess what, that's not always a choice. Have you ever cared to see what happens to women who have the ""audacity"" to apply and work in hard labour like construction, warehouses, ships, sewage, garbage disposal, factories?

Jobs like that are living hell for women, anything horrid you can imagine happens to them there, from degrading comments, to sexual harassment, to wage theft, to unpaid overtime because ""they need to work as hard as the men"" even if those same conditions don't apply to the men at all. And if anyone complains they're accussed of being ""too soft"" for the jobs. The culture is also toxic in the exclusion these women face both inside their job and outside of it. The treatment these women receive from other men is horrendous, calling them ""dy*es"", ""tr*nn*es"", She-Hulk etc. Even other women will join in on the harassment in a desperate bid to fit into a patriarchal society and be seen as more agreeable and valuable.

Society is rotten to the core, where women are locked out of entire fields of work, treated awfully inside and outside the workspace if they somehow manage to break into the labour force and then blamed for everything bad that happens to them while also being blamed for being quitters if they check out, all while women as a whole are being blamed for not participating in work fields that utterly despise them. And as if that all wasn't enough they're not even paid fairly or allowed to complain in any manner.

You are genuinely in the wrong in every manner and capacity, not only because your take is awful, insensitive and delusional but also because you would rather disregard every single woman's testimony as ""over-emotional"" and ""false"" rather than accept that society needs fixing.

Nobody is even asking you to do anything about it. I won't drag you to the protest or ask for donations. You won't even have to as much as write a ""Go girls!"" on a half-torn post-it note before calling it a day. All you have to do is face the facts, check the stats, realise you're wrong and never spout a lie again. Seems reasonable....",TastyRancidLemons,t2_t6otv,6,0,reddit1

It's quite a shift switching from something which has standard, replaceable parts, long support cycles, precise and detailed documentation and, although not entirely free from faults, competent support willing to do prompt repairs and replacements to...

Well...

A slab of warm plastic which may or may not have any computing power but which you're stuck with anyway.  And when it breaks you get to keep both pieces.

Anyway, pro-tip:  If you're looking for a notebook computer, don't go for the shiniest one you see at Best Buy.  Look around for a two year old off-lease business model from the same manufacturer.  You'll pay a quarter of the cost for 90% of the power and 10% of the risk and hassle.

ghotetq,t3_ko85r1,2021-01-01 08:48:27,science,"**Abstract:**

Informed by moral typecasting theory, we predicted a gender bias in harm evaluation, such that women are more easily categorized as victims and men as perpetrators. Study 1 participants assumed a harmed target was female (versus male), but especially when labeled ‘victim’. Study 2 participants perceived animated shapes perpetuating harm as male and victimized shapes as female. Study 3 participants assumed a female employee claiming harassment was more of a victim than a male employee making identical claims. Female victims were expected to experience more pain from an ambiguous joke and male perpetrators were prescribed harsher punishments (Study 4). Managers were perceived as less moral when firing female (versus male) employees (Study 5). The possibility of gender discrimination intensified the cognitive link between women and victimhood (Study 6). Across six studies in four countries (N = 3,137), harm evaluations were systematically swayed by targets’ gender, suggesting a gender bias in moral typecasting.

Here is my own, more detailed summary of the six studies:

**Study 1** involved 300 US residents, roughly equally split between men and women. They were presented with a short text describing scenarios of workplace bullying from the victim's perspective. The test subjects were divided into groups, each group presented with a different version of the basic scenario. The versions differed by the gender of the perpetrator (male vs. female), and by the labels used for the parties of the conflict: the description either used neutral terms (""Party A/Party B""), or more emotionally loaded terms (""victim/perpetrator""). There were thus four versions in total. The gender of the victim was not mentioned in the description. The test subjects were then asked about their recollection of the victim's gender, and about their feelings towards the victim.

The participants generally assumed the victim was female (about 76% overall). This assumption was amplified when the scenario was presented using loaded terms (victim/perpetrator) rather than the neutral terms (Party A/Party B). The perpetrator being female also increased the likelihood that the victim was perceived as female. The participants assuming a female victim felt more warmth towards the victim, perceived the victim as more moral and less deserving of harm. Female participants were slightly more likely to assume a female victim, but this was only marginally significant (0.05<p<0.1).

**Study 2** involved a mixed group of 264 Chinese managers and 138 Norwegian students. The participants were shown three short videos in which people were represented by animated triangles. They were told the videos represented interactions between two opposite-sex coworkers, in which one party may have suffered psychological harm. In the first video, an orange triangle and a green triangle move from their respective ""cubicles"" into a common area, ""face"" each other by turning a vertex in the other's direction, then return to their respective cubicles; in the second video, as the two triangles face each other, green ""pokes"" orange by making a quick move in its direction without direct contact, and orange swirls backwards in response; in the final video, green pokes orange and orange swirls back as before, then orange ""retaliates"" by poking green twice, and green swirls upon each poke.

In response to each video, participants were asked to specify their perceptions of the triangles' genders, and to rate the amount of victimhood and perpetration attributed to each triangle. The study revealed that higher amount of perpetration attributed to a triangle predicts that the triangle is perceived as male, and higher amount of perceived victimhood predicts a triangle is seen as female. There was no significant difference in this respect between the two cultural groups (Chinese managers and Norwegian students). Female participants were more likely to classify the orange triangle as female and green as male; the authors suggest this may indicate women are more likely to assume male perpetration and female victimhood.

**Study 3** involved 219 Chinese managers. It presented a scenario in which both parties experience negative outcome, and as a result victimhood is ambiguous. The participants were given a text describing an interaction between opposite-sex coworkers: an ""overly friendly"" employee frequently stops by in a coworker's cubicle to chat, sends the coworker many work-unrelated emails, and once gave the coworker an unwelcome hug when the coworker came in soaked wet on a rainy day; the coworker then complains to company HR, and the overly friendly employee is fired. In some versions of the scenario, the overly friendly employee was male and the coworker female, in others the genders were reversed. Independently, in some versions of the scenario, the overly friendly employee was described as having a neurological impairment affecting his/her ability to read social cues. There were thus four versions of the scenario, each presented to a different group of participants.

The participants were asked to rate the amount of victimhood they attribute to each of the two parties. In the scenarios where the overly friendly employee suffered from a neutrological impairment, the complaining coworker's perceived victimization was unaffected by his/her gender, whereas in the scenarios without impairment, a female coworker was seen as more victimized than a male coworker. This finding was not affected by participants' gender. When rating the fired employee's victimization, male  participants viewed him/her marginally more victimized as a female than as a male (p=0.071), while no such bias emerged among the female participants (p=0.227). Comparing the victimhood of the complainant and the fired employee, it emerged that for male participants, in the ""complaining male vs. fired female"" scenario, the fired female was seen as more victimized than the complaining male, but no such difference emerged when the genders of the parties were reversed. No such effect was seen for the female participants. This contrasts with the previous two studies, where female participants seemed to show more bias than male ones.",vtj,t2_4vs09,125,0,reddit2

ghothf2,t1_ghotetq,2021-01-01 08:49:49,science,"**Study 4** involved 214 US residents. They were presented with a scenario in which two long-time coworkers, A and B, are attending a conference. During lunch break, as they are in a cafeteria line together, B drops a fork and bends over to pick it up. A says ""You must get a lot of practice doing that"". The joke offends B, who later complains about A creating a hostile work environment. There were four versions of the scenario, corresponding to the possible combinations of A's nad B's genders (in this study, the two parties are allowed to have the same gender).

The participants were asked to rate the amount of pain inficted to A by the joke, and the amount of pain suffered by B as a result of A's complaint; they were also asked to choose an appropriate punishment for A from a list of options, and to rate the likelihood of forgiving A in the future.

The study revealed that participants assumed female victims of the offensive joke felt more pain than male victims, and that female perpetrators felt more pain as a result of the harassment complaint than male ones. Participants also recommended harsher punishment to men than to women, and recommended harsher punishments to harassers of women. Female study participants assumed greater victim pain, suggested harsher punishments, and were less forgiving than male ones, regardless of the genders of A and B.

**Studies 5 and 6** were using similar setups. Study 6, conducted on 1599 US residents, was an extension of study 5, which involved 403 Canadians. The participants were presented with a scenario where 9 employees, all of the same gender, were laid off by a company management for economic reasons. The study manipulated the gender of the employees, and (in study 6) also whether they were working in a male-dominated occupation or a female-dominated one.

Participants were asked to rate to what extent the fired employees should be considered victims, rate the amount of pain they experienced, rate to what extent the pain was inflicted intentionally by the managers, rate the fairness of the managers' decision, and rate the morality of the mangers.

Contrary to the authors' predictions, female employees were not perceived as more victimized. However, when women were fired, the harm inflicted was perceived as more intentional and the managers as more immoral. When women were fired from a male-dominated occupation, the inflicted harm was perceived as more intentional than when women were fired from a female-dominated one; no such effect was seen when men were fired. Female participants assumed more intentionality when women were fired than when men were; male participants showed no such effect. Male participants, on the other hand, showed an in-group bias by attributing more victimhood to fired men than to fired women (p=0.02), female participants tended to see women as more victimized, but not to a statistically significant degree (p=0.221). This was the only case across the six studies when men showed more willingness to see men as victims.

**Overall**, the six studies show a consistent bias towards typecasting women as victims and men as perpetrators. The authors point out this may be partly explained by real-world experience, where men tend to be perpetrators more often.

However, the research also shows a bias towards assuming that female victimization is more morally reprehensible than male victimization under identical circumstances, and that male perpetration deserves harsher punishment for identical transgressions. The authors recommend that the bias-reducing policies that companies adopt in hiring and promotion decisions (such as blind review) should be extended to decisions involving complaints about mistreatment.",vtj,t2_4vs09,113,0,reddit2

For the first point, a current theory is that men and women shared more equitable roles in the ancient hunter-gatherer age.
Source: [CNN](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/04/americas/prehistoric-female-hunter-burial-scn/index.html)

For the second point, I will source my college world history class. Generally speaking, women are born with less strength, more fat, and greater endurance, while men are born with more strength, more muscle, and lower insurance. (Do not twist my words and make the argument that men are stronger and better than women. This generalization completely ignores physical conditioning and outliers, so it cannot be used as a valid argument to produce that statement.) When societies transitioned from hunter-gatherer to settled, the prominent needs became farming, construction, hoarding, and warfare. All of these, with the exception of hoarding, favor quick and intense bouts of strength with breaks in between instead of constant effort that requires high endurance. Because of this, men tended to be better suited to these tasks (again, assuming no physical conditioning is involved), and as such you see a lot of men fill these roles. It’s not because men were seen as disposable.

He also removed some blatant “math” errors the previous boss had put into the metrics. 
Management in my opinion is the one thing no one addresses in inequalities. The first manager was a “good old boy” the new one was half his age and is one of the politest, fairest people I have ever met. He has a numbers and statistical background that allowed him to see the inequalities inherent in the overall numbers, drill down and figure it out. No one had to tell him.

Second, the Government *not* doing something can turn out just as prejudiced as it doing something.

>Looking broadly at the ways women's wit has been condemned, ignored, and misread in western cultural discourse, Frances Gray in Women and Laughter, argues that there are roughly five ""basic and easily learned"" techniques to shut women out of comedy, deny their sense of humor, and therefore silence women's voices. These are all essentially tricks of misreading, of undercutting the intentionality and intelligence that are at the core of good comedy and replacing them with negative stereotypes of hysterical feminine behavior. These techniques are alarmingly still effective:

>1. Women are criticized for talking too much, with the implication that the feminine ideal is silence and acquiescence. When women take the stage and use their voices, especially in verbal forms of comedy like stand-up, they inherently risk being labeled loud, coarse, unfeminine, and pushy—in effect, being larger and taking up more cultural space than women should.
1. Women are marked as over serious and as killjoys to male bonding.
1. Women's comedy is dismissed as unintentional or artless.
1. Women's comedy is dismissed as trivial and not included in the canon of great comic actors that privileges aggressive and risk-taking comedy over relational humor and satire.
1. Women's humor can be reframed as anger and (paradoxically) humorless.

Pertaining to domestic and sexual violence, numerous studies have readily demonstrated rough gender parity with regards to both perpetrators and victims. There are also institutional and sociocultural hurdles particularly for male victims of such offenses. Male victims are much less likely to report or sustain their cases to conviction. 

[Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/)

>Almost 25% of the people surveyed — 28% of women and 19% of men — said there was some violence in their relationship. Women admitted perpetrating more violence (25% versus 11%) as well as being victimized more by violence (19% versus 16%) than men did. According to both men and women, 50% of this violence was reciprocal, that is, involved both parties, and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike.

>Violence was more frequent when both partners were involved, and so was injury — to either partner. In these relationships, men were more likely than women to inflict injury (29% versus 19%).

>When the violence was one-sided, both women and men said that women were the perpetrators about 70% of the time. Men were more likely to be injured in reciprocally violent relationships (25%) than were women when the violence was one-sided (20%).

>That means both men and women agreed that men were not more responsible than women for intimate partner violence. The findings cannot be explained by men's being ashamed to admit hitting women, because women agreed with men on this point.

There are strong scientific evidence to suggest that at least [1 in 6 men](https://1in6.org/get-information/the-1-in-6-statistic/) have been sexually abused or assaulted.

>Why these statistics are probably underestimates:

>Males who have such experiences are less likely to disclose them than are females.

>Only 16% of men with documented histories of sexual abuse (by social service agencies, which means it was very serious) considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of women with documented histories in the same study.
 
The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys (NISVS) conducted annually by The United States CDC continuously show gender symmetry with regards to the proportion of victims and perpetrators by gender. 

[NISVS 2010](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.

[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.

[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.

[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively.

However, some of the people most enthusiastic about reading and discussing this article have retreated to sides where they’re trying to use the issues that they’ve experienced or believe in on their “side” (for example women get away with sexual things in the workplace that men don’t) to invalidate what the other side might have been trying to say (for example, all of the cases of women coming out about suppressed sexual assault experiences over the past years). Which is not what you are trying to do necessarily, but what I’m trying to say with my original sentiment is that we would all make more progress together if we didn’t get so defensive and try to prove each other wrong and cancel out each other.

gi0hyho,t1_ghsd0ik,2021-01-04 00:19:29,science,"Thank you for that link. I read the article and checked the references for it, and gave this some more thought. I'm going to reformulate what I said, to be more parsimonious in the assumptions made and the conclusions drawn:

There are two deeds necessary to any mammalian animal population's continuation that *only* females can do: gestate and nurse. These two deeds are costly to any woman. All other deeds necessary to the population's survival can be done by willing and able people of either gender. There is only one vital task that only men, and absolutely no women, are physically capable of doing, and that's the provision of sperm, which is not a costly deed in the least. These statements are brute biological facts that are true for all mammals, regardless of culture. The end result is that if a woman is going to accept the considerable cost of time, energy, and physical safety of growing a man's progeny *in* her body (gestation) and then *on* her body (lactation), he'd better make it worth her while. Otherwise a sexual relationship between a man and a woman is in no way whatsoever an equal exchange of risks and benefits.

Now, where cultural and individual differences come into it, is the vast gamut of different perceptions of what constitutes a fair contribution, on the man's part, for the woman assuming the risks she does. There are a vast array of factors that go into this, not least of which is the culture's traditional strategy for survival on the macro level, based on the environment and resources available to them, and on the micro level, how the woman's family make their livelihood.

In light of this, I concede you this point: The Dilemma of the Disposable Male has a large cultural component to it, albeit a deep-seated one that will be hard to undo. When humans stopped being hunter-gatherers and invented agriculture and civilization, this represented a shift from a quality-of-life-focused survival strategy, to a quantity-of-life-focused survival strategy. This why when Dutch organizational psychologist Geert Hofstede identified this axis as one of the five major independent variables along which cultures differ, he spoke of ""feminine cultures"" (later renamed ""quality of life cultues"") at one end of the spectrum and ""masculine cultures"" (later renamed ""quantity of life cultures"") at the other end. It is this underlying cultural attitude of ""more is better"" that deems a man life more expendable than a woman's under trying circumstances, because [potential] replenishment of the population share lost is what matters, rather than helping the survivors of a population-culling event live well despite the loss of so many community members.

The problem is that from the invention of agriculture all the way through the industrial development of today's modern nations, quantity-of-life cultures have soundly outcompeted quality-of-life cultures, when it's come to world population share, and control of resources needed for human life to continue.

Sea changes in the state of human technology, the most profound that our species has seen since the invention of farming or written language, are now underway. Here's hoping that many of these changes will be the sort that allow quality-of-life cultures and cultural attitudes, a chance to thrive that they have not seen since the disappearance of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

To lay my cards on the table, I'm a gender-nonconforming heterosexual Anglo-American man with high functioning autism, raised by two parents who both almost chose (and continued to lionize) a monastic way of life, and were fiercely quality-of-life and less-is-more in their values. Because of my disability, I have a very hard time reading people and seeing things from others' perspectives. When I left home when I was 18, I failed to fully appreciate just how out-of-step with the world around me my values and personality were, and how hard it would be — in romantic, professional, and social contexts alike — to find people who saw me as a person of value worth having around. It's been an existential struggle for self-acceptance few I've met can truly relate to.

Meanwhile women only have a couple of thousand eggs and they dont produce new ones .

ghtfu5m,t1_ghse1jp,2021-01-02 10:49:49,science," You are failing to consider the very basics of evolution by natural selection which is that parents optimise for offspring that *reach reproductive age themselves*. Due to bipedalism and human brain size, our head-to-birth-canal ratio is larger than almost any other mammal. So as to not get stuck in the birth canal we are effectively born premature and our offspring take many years before they can survive on their own. Thus human males who father more offspring than they can care for have a worse evolutionary strategy than those who stick around long enough to see their offspring survive to reproductive age. 

This doesn't even touch on sexual (as opposed to natural) selection which is itself complex. You'll find more details here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00230/full

You want other people to make decisions for you?  I find that worse.  I really don't think you are thinking clearly, there is no way that they can know whats important to you.  That is why there are multiple groups submitting to government, not one behemoth.

>you can sing combaya but the reality is feminst at every corner are trying to undermine mens right

Seriously?  I am sure there are some groups and individuals that are singular and exclusionary in their approach.  I don't agree with it, I see it exists and I speak out against it.  You are fighting the wrong people if you see feminists as the enemy, thats like saying you see black people as the enemy.  Your target is waaayyy out of kilter.

There are many things that you can be allies with feminists over.  Maybe not everything (prostrate cancer versus cervical cancer for example, unless you push for more funding for all cancers, ie breast cancer affects men too), but I can't think of any feminist reform that (if written neutrally) shouldn't also help men.

I agree, things like giving men access to shelters is vitally important, and mens shelters are generally designed for homeless men, not men with kids.  They are not suitable for families and are not funded from the same pool.  At least in my country.

Sex against an individual’s will after the age of 13, referred to in this document as non-volitional sex, has been experienced by many more women (one in nine) than men (one in 30) aged 16–74 years; **over half of these experiences occurred when the people concerned were teenagers.**

ghsau8k,t1_ghs9rcj,2021-01-02 02:13:31,science,"These are the reasons from Women Serve Longer Prison Sentences After Killing Abusers

>Women Aren’t Supposed to Kill

>“We are desensitized to men killing,” says Nora V. Demleitner, a professor of law at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Virginia who specializes in criminal justice and sentencing issues. According to Demleitner, gender disparity is prevalent throughout the justice system. That’s just one of the reasons women receive harsher sentences for murder.

>“Women aren't supposed to be violent, and data indicates that they rarely are, compared to men. Women are supposed to reconcile, seek out others for help, mediate. The more violent the killing may be, the more do women defy this stereotype, setting them up for a high sentence.”

>The second reason: Victim-blaming. 

>Even though women are usually considered less of a threat than male criminals overall and receive lower sentences then men for nonviolent crimes like fraud and burglary—and statistics show women are less likely to become repeat offenders—when it comes to domestic violence, an outdated mindset still prevails. 

>“She must have done something to nary this type of response,” Demleitner says. In other words, Potter is at fault not only for the murder, but for the abuse that preceded it. Demleitner backs up Potter’s statement about being pushed to homicide. 

>“Women who are abused and resort to killing aren't just the victims of the abuser but also exemplify a failure of state protection.” She says heavy sentences for women after they kill an abusive partner may actually be the manifestation of our own frustration to protect survivors, and society’s inability to address the problem of domestic violence.

>The third reason women may face a longer time behind bars? Social context, says Demleitner. “The less the judge can identify with her, the more condemnatory the sentence may be.” More than two-thirds of state court judges are male, while the overwhelming majority of victims of domestic violence are female.",spacehogg,t2_e46ca,0,0,reddit2

 without some extreme technological reform i don't see this being resolved. even worse most advances in technology give individuals an easier way to present faux locations in the hierarchies. increasing conformative pressure.

 so if we're basing metaphysical 'realness' on the effect on humanity (because what else could matter) then gender norms are the most 'real' construct we have.

ghqn76k,t1_ghqfcje,2021-01-01 18:07:16,science,"Gender norms are indeed changing, but I am not talking about a lack of gender identit, just a reduction in gender expectations and a detachment of gender from sex. Making gender a less rigid concept overall.
Also, natural hierarchy is no longer useful for us, our social hierarchy is much different already from the one we evolved for and gender norms are less relevant than they have ever been. It used to be that men did most labour, especially the dangerous type, not because women were unable to, but because women set the limit for reproduction and are thus not expendable.
However min maxing reproduction is no longer a survival need, and in most civilized societies of today sex is mainly for pleasure and occacionally for reproduction. 
Gender norms no longer matter that much, gender doesnt need to be rigid anymore and it doesnt need to have any effect on social hierarchy anymore.

Im not saying there isnt social pressure to conform, im just saying that there is no need for gender to play a role in hierarchy anymore, because the original reason we had a link between gender and hierarchy is no longer valid (unlike on the past in which women were much more valuable, nowadays men and women are just as valuable for modern society)
Gender will always be linked and correlate with sex, most people have matching sex and gender, what a more rigid concept of gender does is allow for acceptance of deviation. A biological male that transitions into a woman is a woman, even if their biological sex is different. A woman that likes traditionally masculine stuff is still a woman, independent of the fact that she doesn't comply with gender roles. This doesn't mean she is not heterosexual either although correlation can exist, sexual orientation is not necessarily expressed through discomfort with traditional gender roles (affeminate men are not necessarily gay and masculine men are not necessarily straight)

So I do believe gender expectations will always exist, all I am saying is that they don't need to carry pressure anymore. Expectations should come from identity, rathen than identity being forced through expectations.

What I am not convinced of is whether these hierarchies are useful today. Why should I want more hierarchy? And especially why would I want to support hierarchies based on race, gender, sexuality, etc. when they make people's lives worse seemingly with no benefit? 

I get that giving the most productive people more wealth or status might be good for society (to provide incentives), but I don't see how maintaining gender as a cheap way of evaluating social hierarchies would really help that.

ghsvni9,t1_ghrid61,2021-01-02 05:34:17,science,"i think you misunderstood. its not a question of more or less hierarchy because hierarchy is how the brain evaluates whether a decision is good or bad. you cant really have more or less of your focal decision making tool. you need to arrange society with the understanding that hierarchies are how its members will perceive EVERYTHING. 

my argument was that gender norms were the result of societies creating clear route to climb hierarchies dimorphicaly for men and women. you cant just erase it. thats why people now see DEFYING gender norms as better in a lot of spaces. they perceive the hierarchy as working in the opposite way the traditional one did. if the goal is to remove the harm of gender norms they need to be replaced with something else. dont know if it can be done. but it would need to be as easily identifiable as ones sex or else, once again, something that is will take its place.

**TO SUM THE PROBLEM**: hierarchies are how you make decisions. when you feel you move up a hierarchy, you feel good. when you feel you move down a hierarchy, you feel bad. you make decisions in order to move up or maintain your spot and not move down. evaluating ones place on the hierarchy must be low cost with the result as clear as possible. few things meet these conditions (for the socio sexual hierarchy) better than ones sex and gender. as the signals are both obvious and clearly dimorphic (ie men in suit women in dress etc). if these signals are no longer deemed good for evaluation something else will take their place (ie reversing the dimorphism or making any dimorphic traits bad). **ERGO** you need some way to tell how good the way someone presents themselves is, and gender norms fit the bill way to well. 

the only solution i think thats remotely plausible (with todays technology) is to make it so the idea of judging ones place on the hierarchy is deemed as a downward move on the hierarchy. problem is theres no real way to move up such a construct (hence something will pop up that fits the bill) and i don't know how to trick a brain into thinking that perceiving its own model of reality is a bad thing.

Please try to remember that individual studies are trying to answer a very specific and discrete question that fits into a **larger discussion** of well-established theory.

The paper doesn't argue that race is the **only** factor in codeswitching or that no one other than black people codeswitch. Of course people act differently at work. It is *also* true that almost 3 decades of prejudice research has shown that certain groups face prejudice based on how they conform to the norms of white men (in Western countries of course). This is extremely well established and not at all controversial.

This paper is only asserting that when black people codeswitch they tend to be seen as more professional. The introduction also outlines a number of previous studies that show that black people pay a price if they don't codeswitch. 

From the intro of the full text:

> Previous studies have found that presenting (or pretending to present) one's authentic self enhances career outcomes and work-related well-being (Cha et al., 2019; Klotz et al., 2018; Moore, Lee, Kim, & Cable, 2017; Roulin & Krings, 2020), but members of marginalized groups tend to fare better when they adjust their self-presentation and manage other's perceptions of their stigmatized identity (Ali, Lyons, & Ryan, 2017; Roberts, Cha, & Kim, 2014; Roberts, Settles, & Jellison, 2008). 

and

> Perceptions of professionalism are enhanced when individuals share similar characteristics with a majority of others in their profession (Ashcraft, 2013; Essed & Goldberg, 2002; Hall, Hall, Galinsky, & Phillips, 2019; Ibarra, 1995). White men in Western countries have historically held the power and authority to shape the norms of professionalism given their overrepresentation in managerial, white-collar occupations (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Indeed, White men's values and norms come to ‘define’ the occupations that they hold (Ashcraft, 2013; Carton and Rosette, 2011) including their interests and hobbies (e.g., golfing), standards of appearance and dress, dialect and style of speech, and the prevalence of specific names (e.g., John) for individuals in professional spaces (Essed, 2002; Rosette, Leonardelli, & Phillips, 2008; Wolfers, 2015). Individuals from underrepresented groups may feel pressure to adjust their self-presentation in adherence to these norms so that they may access professional spaces and be conceived as a professional (Brown-Iannuzzi, Payne, & Trawalter, 2013; DiTomaso, 2015; Rivera, 2012).",ImNotJesus,t2_505zx,19,0,reddit3

A classic example is dreadlocks being ""unprofessional"".

Unfortunately Black people have digested these stereotypes their entire lives and also now are likely to hold them to be true. 

So if a Black person wears natural hair, speaks with slang common to Black culture, and doesn't dress in traditional (that is to say White) professional attire, then they will be considered less professional by both Blacks and Whites. 

A great example of this is Kamala Harris' family member at the inauguration. [Her niece's partner wore very rare and expensive Air 1 Jordans](https://www.gq.com/story/air-jordan-1-diors-inauguration) and was immediately criticized even by his own partner who tweeted ""SMH."" But why? If he were wearing a $2,000 pair of Louis Vuittons loafers no one would bat an eye. But because they're sneakers, he was criticized by both Blacks and Whites alike. I even had a discussion with my own mother about because she said he looked tacky and I asked her how she would feel if someone said Amanda Gorman (the awesome poet from the inauguration) looked unprofessional because she wore natural hair. 

This is unfortunate because as long as a person is able to communicate and work without being disruptive or a hindrance, then their hair, speaking style, and dress should not reflect negatively on their professionalism, but we society doesn't function that way.",hnglmkrnglbrry,t2_14x8xq,-24,0,reddit3

Edit: To be clear, the paper doesn't argue that race is the **only** factor in codeswitching or that no one other than black people codeswitch. Of course people act differently at work. It is *also* true that almost 3 decades of prejudice research has shown that certain groups face prejudice based on how they conform to the norms of white men (in Western countries of course). This is extremely well established and not at all controversial.

This paper is only asserting that when black people codeswitch they tend to be seen as more professional. The introduction also outlines a number of previous studies that show that black people pay a price if they don't codeswitch. 

From the intro of the full text:

> Previous studies have found that presenting (or pretending to present) one's authentic self enhances career outcomes and work-related well-being (Cha et al., 2019; Klotz et al., 2018; Moore, Lee, Kim, & Cable, 2017; Roulin & Krings, 2020), but members of marginalized groups tend to fare better when they adjust their self-presentation and manage other's perceptions of their stigmatized identity (Ali, Lyons, & Ryan, 2017; Roberts, Cha, & Kim, 2014; Roberts, Settles, & Jellison, 2008). 

and

> Perceptions of professionalism are enhanced when individuals share similar characteristics with a majority of others in their profession (Ashcraft, 2013; Essed & Goldberg, 2002; Hall, Hall, Galinsky, & Phillips, 2019; Ibarra, 1995). White men in Western countries have historically held the power and authority to shape the norms of professionalism given their overrepresentation in managerial, white-collar occupations (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Indeed, White men's values and norms come to ‘define’ the occupations that they hold (Ashcraft, 2013; Carton and Rosette, 2011) including their interests and hobbies (e.g., golfing), standards of appearance and dress, dialect and style of speech, and the prevalence of specific names (e.g., John) for individuals in professional spaces (Essed, 2002; Rosette, Leonardelli, & Phillips, 2008; Wolfers, 2015). Individuals from underrepresented groups may feel pressure to adjust their self-presentation in adherence to these norms so that they may access professional spaces and be conceived as a professional (Brown-Iannuzzi, Payne, & Trawalter, 2013; DiTomaso, 2015; Rivera, 2012).",ImNotJesus,t2_505zx,10,0,reddit3

Not all white people get better educations. Not all white people have a stable home life. And obviously EVERYONE has to change their behavior to some degree for work. That's really not what the term means. It doesn't mean ""all white people have it better than all black people"" or ""all men have it better than all women"".

The term is more trying to encompass and entire system of thousands of things that help certain groups and hurt other groups. And you can easily be in a group that both has some privilege's (like race or culture) and doesn't have others (like wealth or good location for certain jobs). It's hard for people to recognize the cumulative effect all these things had on their lives without SOME kind of label describing them.

You have to act differently. But you likely didn't have to change your accept, your likes and dislikes, and create a whole new persona. And when you let your guard down and act in a more natural way you probably didn't risk permanently damaging your prospects of promotion by tarnishing your image as an education professional in the eyes of some closet racist in management.

Now maybe none of that is true for you. That's why I said ""probably"". Because it's more about averages over groups. For MOST white people they only have to make a small adjustment to their behavior to work in an educated professional setting, and the changes you DO have to make were probably just standard ""show respect"" stuff you learned growing up. For a much larger portion of black people they need to make MASSIVE changes to their language, behavior, clothing, interests, and demeanors or face some level of risk in their careers.

>Within the female community, status is calculated differently. Generation and age determine status among female kin \[32\]. **By contrast, unrelated women enforce equality \[41,55\]. Unlike unrelated men, status is not earned through skills and allegiance to a large interconnected group** \[56,57\]. **Instead, a woman forms several separate, exclusive, one-on-one friendships within the larger female community \[41,58,59\]. Female friends prohibit competition by one another and other acquaintances by punishing superiority \[58,60\], requiring reciprocity \[59\] and exhibiting a low threshold for dissolving relationships when conflicts arise \[61–63\].** These prohibitions do not apply to relationships with kin, a spouse or affines \[59\].  
>  
>3. Principles of female competition  
Women compete to acquire resources for their kin, spouse and affines and a few trusted female friends; to protect their own and threaten other women's alliances, especially marriages, given men's greater interest in polygamy; and to prevent other women from reducing their family's market value and opportunity for status enhancement in the larger community \[64\]. Three principles appear to underlie female–female competition. First, to protect their bodies for lifelong child care, **women employ competitive strategies that reduce the probability of incurring physical harm through retaliation** \[9,10\]. **Avoidance of direct interference competition, disguising competition and competing only when there is little probability of retaliation, such as having high status in the community, all minimize chance of injury.**

The research also shows that conforming to the dominant identity comes with other costs because you don't match your expected identity.

White men in Western countries have historically held the power and authority to shape the norms of professionalism given their overrepresentation in managerial, white-collar occupations (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Indeed, White men's values and norms come to ‘define’ the occupations that they hold (Ashcraft, 2013; Carton and Rosette, 2011) including their interests and hobbies (e.g., golfing), standards of appearance and dress, dialect and style of speech, and the prevalence of specific names (e.g., John) for individuals in professional spaces (Essed, 2002; Rosette, Leonardelli, & Phillips, 2008; Wolfers, 2015). Individuals from underrepresented groups may feel pressure to adjust their self-presentation in adherence to these norms so that they may access professional spaces and be conceived as a professional (Brown-Iannuzzi, Payne, & Trawalter, 2013; DiTomaso, 2015; Rivera, 2012).",ImNotJesus,t2_505zx,7,0,reddit3

That's not the only explanation for workplace expectations differentially affecting different races.

First, note that ""professional"" is not an objective set of criteria - there are different expectations for ""professional"" in different regions (USA vs. France vs. Japan, say).

Next, consider that different cultures may have an easier or harder time fitting the expectations of ""professional"" in a particular region; for example, an American would have to adapt their behaviour more in a workplace in Japan than a workplace in America, and the opposite for someone from Japan.

Finally, consider that the USA has a tighter relationship between race and culture than many other nations.  Due to that, it's entirely possible that the most common workplace expectations for ""professionalism"" in the USA will be closer to the dominant culture (majority-white) than to African-American culture (majority-black).

The result of that would be that - *on average* - black Americans would have to adapt their behaviour more than white Americans to be seen as ""professional"" in the USA, strictly for reasons of cultural similarity to workplace expectations.


> who knows maybe i'm just jaded by people trying to find race issue's with everything these days

I agree with you here, which is why I think it's useful to try to disentangle race and culture in discussions such as these.  Something that is not affected by race directly can nonetheless have very different effects on different races due to underlying systematic differences in the populations involved.

Citing commonly known facts seems to be tedious. To your point, countering every anti-vaxxer with CDC statements and studies on how vaccines work is a waste of time. 

Asking for sources to obvious information seems to be merely antagonistic. Like plugging one's ears and saying ""I can't hear you"" when the clear counterpoints are made. On the other hand, asking for sources for a big claim that is not well known (e.g. ""this had been disregarded since the 70s""), is much more reasonable. 

I apologize if the statements were sincere, and not merely antagonistic (though this is Reddit, so I hope you understand where I'm coming from). That said, I do encourage you to take a quick look for yourself. My claim was such a large phenomena (I didn't claim a hidden conspiracy or niche point, I made a claim about hiring practices of the largest companies in the second largest economy in the world), that this wasn't a situation of ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" If a Google search turns up empty, I'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble for such a claim. It would be like claiming the earth is round and seeing nothing pop up. Would you ask someone to cite that the earth is round? 

Taking a look yourself also would help as a exercise in two things: 1. Actually being scientifically literate, and not taking my sources as fact (any anti-vaxxers can cite their sources), and 2. Actually practicing searching for the other point of view, and trying to learn something new.

If you account for cities growing, replacing areas of plant life with cement which reflects light rather than absorbs, desertification, and the deforested areas of the world removing anything that eats co2, you have an overabundance of greenhouse gases.  Reality is we are replanting forests and doing our best to rebuild them, but it can take decades until they are ready to truly contribute to eating into the back load of CO2.  One consistency is that we need to start putting plants around our houses and planting more trees around houses.  It's also interesting that there is bacteria that will thrive on CO2 that lay dormant in the glaciers so there is the chance they will begin to thrive if we can extract them.

Turns out you can solve all your problems by using [Methane](http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/chemicals/ammonia.html). Reforming with steam will generate hydrogen and carbon mon/dioxide, and allowing some hydrogen to combust with the remaining oxygen solves your problems. 

These reactions all occur at elevated temperature, so likely more methane will be combusted to provide some heat.

So whilst ammonia is somewhat generated from ""thin air"" (and water), it also requires significant input of fossil fuel and will emit carbon dioxide. ",ruetoesoftodney,t2_ycxun,1,0,reddit4

There are a few findings out there, most notably, the [Wayne Tracker/Exxon controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy). There are many more like this, but this is the most well known.

>Exactly how could they prevent someone else from pursuing innovation?

A few facets:

1. Financially, People don't work for free, there needs to be a driver, and usually it's financial.  
 - Oppose regulations that would be financially burdensome to fossil fuel industries. If something is by far the cheapest option, there is no market driver for innovation. 
 - Undercut and cheapen the energy source. Make Oil/gas/coal the cheapest option for energy. This comes by scraping the line of regulations and doing as little as possible. This was a huge problem in the 60s-90s. 
 - Fund counter-research. Cherry pick results and skew them in favor. 
 - Patents. Research ideas, patent them, and sue anyone who comes close to the ideas.

2. In the minds of the people
 - Fund anti-global warming or smear campaigns. If people don't perceive a problem, why would they innovate a solution to it?
 - Promote other energy forms controlled by the industries as 'bridge fuels'. Still dependent on the fossil fuel, but in a different form. 

I'd say you'd be surprised how effective disinformation campaigns are, but the evidence is fairly clear with the level of climate change denialists in political power right now. If you can sow enough doubt into people's minds, convincing them that just maybe there isn't a problem, why would they ever try to fix said problem? Similar with business funding, if there is no financial driver to innovate, why waste the capital when you could be researching something more profitable?",Pyronic_Chaos,t2_7mjeq,13,0,reddit4

dmydldc,t1_dmyatgg,2017-09-13 16:45:43,science,"I understand your argument but I must admit that it is hard for me to find constructivism in ""what if"" games.
That said, I also disagree with your argument. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read that the use of fossil fuels is the better option we have. Don't get me wrong I acknowledge the technological advances it has brought but I disagree that we must hold on oil because of it's past breakthrough. The question is: we are in a major environmental crisis, what's to do next? In this report, it is said that some of the biggest oil companies should be held responsible for the cost of damages dealt by climate change. It makes sense because of the proven misinformation they have generated. It never says ""they made climate change!"". it says that part of it is their fault. It is the combination of their actions and the inability of the public to know better (maybe related but I can't support it) and natural climate changes. More than anything, tax payers shouldn't be the ones paying (in totality) for the reconstruction.
Now if we want to be constructive, we must find something else. Maybe oil production does not have to be eliminated but we must surely change our relation to it. Our dependency on fossil fuel give these companies the power they need to mislead a whole specie. Isn't that a good reason in itself to realign the playing field? 
IMO, I admit that we must change our relations to fossil fuels, technologies and comfort. Growth is the only valued success in western society but I think we can do best. lets just reduce our needs in the things that are harmful for the environment, lets appreciate life as it is and the human specie as part of a greater ecosystem. Less consuming means less exploiting, right? Growth is not sustainable. We must concede the luxury we have tasted and work for equality because they can't coexist. Else wise, humanity will fall in a long and painful era of conflict, opposing greed to survival.

trying to affect change at this late of a date through carbon tax seems incredibly optimistic. It would take massive governmental oversight, and price fossil fuel far out of the reach of most consumers.

Seems more efficient (and oddly, maybe even less damaging to market economies) to jack taxes temporarily, nationalize the worst industries, and force nuclear, wind, and maybe temporarily NG for generation. Push EV hard, along with driverless AI. Nuke for shipping, tax the piss out of air travel (repeating some of what I said elsewhere). It's too late for me to dig up the emissions of those industries, but it's a substantial chunk.  

then find jobs for all the horribly inefficient, manpower intensive infrastructure that supported fossil fuel, 'course you would have to do that with either option.

We aint fixing this without either a draconian reduction in consumer comfort, or massive involvement from governments. Economic pressure through taxation takes forever (smoking still exists) and according to everyone here, we don't have forever. 

You are looking far to narrowly at just some economic equation. This is a world-wide *cultural* issue. Humanity is intrinsically capitalist. We are really good at it. We find loopholes and work arounds to government regulations 10 minutes after the final draft is printed. You can't change the population of the world quickly through playing with market economies.

If people knew the truth, yes many would have continued using fossil fuels but they'd also have reduced their consumption and modified policies to even further reduce consumption. For example, there might have been more support for a carbon tax, or for solar power, or for high mpg vehicles.

I think that is pretty optimistic. My entire point was kinda based around people getting off their asses and actually supporting and doing *effective* things. Bitching about oil companies does nothing. If you leveraged the *actual* damages they have done, they would all be instantly bankrupt. Can't have that! We aren't ready! So we play this masturabatory game of yelling at them and trying to get them to change, but not change too much, too fast. Is this really where our energy should go? yelling at non-human entities that couldn't care less? Is it really so important we beat a confession out of them while standing in knee deep rising sea level? I won't continue my points about our responsibility, it seems to fall on deaf ears here.

How about we accept the concept that corporations will put short term profit over long term human progress. Let's stop pretending to be shocked that an international company might be less than truthful about something that directly affects them.

As a side note, are you sure reducing energy consumption, carbon taxes, and high MPG vehicles will help? Seems like those concepts will only make sure the same companies stay in business for a lot longer. I am of the opinion that the hard push towards fuel efficiency saved the ICE auto industry, allowed gas prices to stabilize, gave oil industry some demand breathing room to develop new extraction techniques, and pushed back EVs until Musk disrupted the field.

It requires no strain at all. Look at what you wrote:

Your options are not ""go without"" or ""do nothing."" We need a price on carbon. Ask [just about any economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/climate-policy).

It would have helped tons decades ago. Fossil fuels companies have won just about everything they possibly could have won, and now they're getting phased out for economics reasons rather than environmental. We're at the point where we can build solar and wind (in some places) more cheaply than coal/gas/oil power plants. Battery tech has progressed to the point where electric cars start making sense; if the price drops a bit more as projected it will leave gas cars as a niche product.

In your other posts you're trying to imply people have a personal responsibility to sacrifice everything in a meaningless gesture -- you know a few people reducing their carbon footprint will do basically nothing, and that level of sacrifice goes against human nature. It's a global problem and needs to be addressed at a global level. Global efforts require many people working together, not a few individuals making a gesture.

The tech advancements and policy changes that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions could have happened a lot earlier, could have prevented a lot of CO2 emissions, if it weren't for the disinformation campaign.

If you stand by that article as being a reasonable list of assumptions, and not overly projecting data on the most complex system on the planet (besides the climate), then we do not have enough common ground to carry on a conversation.

 I am not opposed to the concept of a carbon tax. I am skeptical of its efficacy. No economist has ever projected anything with any sort of accuracy 10yrs out. It is laughable. I appreciate economists... They work really hard. Who seriously thinks economists can model any large scope issue? Most economists sure as hell don't. We aren't talking about projections about a very specific industry, with historically understood variables. You believe people can figure out how the entire world economy will look a decade from now, after introducing a brand new paradigm! Do you even read these links you spam???

My point in all of this is that fossil fuel consumption is a result of physics and economics.  It's the best choice for a lot of energy needs historically, and even today.  Given that that's the case, we need fossil fuels and fossil fuel providers.

While you can argue that these companies went over and above the call of duty to keep promoting their products in the presence of alternatives, that's just a rounding error on overall consumption.  People are quick to make unsubstantiated assertions that their efforts at (e.g.) US lobbying meant that we would be way different today if they hadn't done those things, and that's just not at all true.

dmzgtdb,t1_dmzes1r,2017-09-14 06:52:00,science,">  A more achievable goal seems to be developing technology to deal with the effects, rather than the cause as the latter is nearly impossible to determine and adjust in its entirety. 

The effects are increasing because the problem is increasing, so the demand and amount of demand to combat the effects is also increasing respectively. And in regards to cost, it's kind of like infrastructure I would say. The longer you wait the more it will cost. And just like with infrastructure, we need to simultaneously invest into it's maintenance while also investing into new methods to reduce the cost of maintenance within the future. The solution here isn't focusing on one or the other, it's focusing on both. 

But with that said, my argument towards putting focus on combating the causes over the effects would be centered around the idea of reducing the speed in which much of this is happening because that could very well give us the time we need to adapt to these changes in a way that is less chaotic and troublesome. Infrastructure and it's deterioration is predictable and manageable in that we know we can handle it at the rate in which it's deteriorating and we know that if we can't handle it, we can shift focus around based on priority without too much problem. I would argue that the effects of climate change are largely unknown right now, but also I'm unsure if the effects will be manageable in the same way as infrastructure. What I mean is, shifting focus might be more problematic and difficult based on the all-encompassing and unpredictable nature of the possible effects of climate change. But also, again, the changes long-term will also be less extreme and therefore need less extreme solutions if we combat the root of the problem rather than fruit that the problem produces. So I can't help but feel that combating the effects over the causes would be more of an uphill battle than otherwise. 

You also have to consider that there are many other benefits to be had with combating the roots of the problem over it's effects as well. For example, focusing heavily on renewable technology has a few major benefits. 

Environmentally speaking it would result in a far cleaner and healthier world for people to live in which has definite mental and physical health benefits, let alone that it would also help maintain balance in ecosystems in the general sense, which is beneficial not only to ourselves, but pretty much everything else as well, ranging from other animals to plants and more. 

Economically speaking it also has major benefits in the long-term because renewable energy sources are far more sufficient towards meeting our power needs with the *current* level of technology available (See: Musk's Blue Square), let alone the future levels of technology that will exist and will largely exist because of heavy focus within the immediate future. Another thing to consider is also the cost (long-term) to produce said energy is less than the current costs and so the cost to consumers would subsequently be less. So we can solve the world's energy needs long-term if not permanently while also providing ourselves with more affordable alternatives to current energy production technologies. And again, focusing on this technology would develop future technology at a considerably faster rate which would undoubtedly have benefits in ways that we can't even currently foresee. Self-sufficient vehicles perhaps? Who knows, it's hard to say, but that's often how much of this kind of thing works.

Politically speaking it would allow many nations to cut ties with certain other nations that commit wrong-doings but are ignored because of the demand and need for oil. This would also have the effect of cutting into the funding of their nations and the things they do. In this regard, I can think of a few nations where this would be very beneficial to no longer need to be so tightly involved with them. 

So with all of that said, I think it's honestly more beneficial to focus on combating this problem at it's sources rather than combating it's effects for a few different reasons. But I also just think that doing otherwise would largely result in more cost long-term because the problem would be ever-ongoing in a more major way, since we're not traveling at a fixed speed, but rather the rate of speed is ever-increasing.

And by the way, the projections into the future are almost certainly underestimates of its efficacy because the models don't (and really can't) take into account the increased innovation that a carbon tax is expected to spur. So rather than dismissing an entire field of study like a climate denier, consider taking a little time to educate yourself on the topic so you are not so ignorant, because this will not be politically easy and every extra person lobbying congress helps.

Now see, I've actually read the IPCC report, so I thought you might be fibbing. You forgot to mention the part where it says additional mitigation would likely be needed. But it is real easy to toss links up there and declare ""I stand in opposition with the IPCC"".

* NAS does *not* advocate a carbon tax only

* ""Economists with expertise in climate change"": Our findings revealed a strong consensus (69%) that the “social cost of carbon” should be greater than or
equal to the figure currently used by the U.S. government (only 8% believe the value should be lower).  I'm guessing your proposed carbon tax is the US gov one??? 


IPCC
>Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely and are highly sensitive to model design
and assumptions as well as the specification of scenarios, including the characterization of technologies and
the timing of mitigation (high confidence). Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately,
there is a single global carbon price, and all key technologies are available, have been used as a cost-effective benchmark
for estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs (Table SPM.2, yellow segments). Under these assumptions, mitigation
scenarios that reach atmospheric concentrations of about 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100 entail losses in global consumption—
not including benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side-effects of mitigation19—of 1% to
4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030, 2% to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050, and 3% to 11% (median: 4.8%) in 2100 relative to
consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century. These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage points over the
century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per year. Estimates at
the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inflexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions
required in the long run to meet these goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise
costs. Under the absence or limited availability of technologies, mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on
the technology considered (Table SPM.2, grey segment). Delaying additional mitigation further increases mitigation costs
in the medium- to long-term (Table SPM.2, orange segment). Many models could not achieve atmospheric concentration
levels of about 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100 if additional mitigation is considerably delayed or under limited availability of key
technologies, such as bioenergy, CCS, and their combination (BECCS). [6.3] 

I am stopping after this one...  ""economists with expertise in resource economics"" 

>Eighty-seven
percent of the panel agrees with the statement: “The Brookings Institution recently described a
US carbon tax of $20 per ton, increasing at 4% per year, which would raise an estimated $150
billion per year in federal revenues over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created
by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate would involve fewer harmful net
distortions to the US economy than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising
marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.” 

Whoa boy, did they ever tear me apart... I mean, that basically says ""Carbon tax will fix climate change"".

You are dishonest. You paste in sources either not knowing what they contain, or hoping nobody actually reads them. You said flat out Me being *skeptical* of the efficacy of a carbon tax put me in **opposition** to these groups. 

So, rather than distorting and spinning facts **like a climate denier** why don't you stop filling your posts with links until you actually read them.

My first impression of shale & fracking is one of dread. I'm trying to learn more about it, some big agencies of varying interests are saying it's a good step forward while others think it'll be disastrous.

As far as vested interests go, I'm not as worried, personally. I think it's better to build something that will be out-of-date before it's life cycle than to hang on to what you've got. I think that, while it's wasteful on a grand scheme, it can be a good economic stimulant, providing lots of skilled labor. Keeping the wheels turning, so to speak. If you were to know me for awhile you'd probably see Atlas Shrugged has had quite an impact on my views.

Generation really isn't my specialty (I work in protection and controls), but I don't know of any other source capable of:

* A) Supporting base load (Not wind or solar, on it's own, at least)
* B) Fairly Easy to Regulate Generated Power(Smaller NG and Coal are best - definitely not Nuclear for this.)
* C) Can be built quickly enough to allow for timely closure of coal facilities (Definitely not Nuclear, unfortunately. Not sure on times for Wind & Solar.)

My understanding is that fracking is fairly new - maybe we can find a way to reduce methane produced? Some sort of capture/filtration system? Totally out of my element in regards to that, but a lot of new processes get a lot better over time.

Part of me is bitter that the agriculture gets such a strong lobby, methane production from cattle farming is not that much lower than fossil fuel production.

Without knowing all the specifics, I think there is a *possibility* you could have made a better choice.

I will leave my conservation vs durability argument at home, just remember the debate is out there. 

What are your priorities with regards to environmentalism? I will guess and say you are probably trying to balance money, desire (which includes comfort, relaxation, etc), and being a responsible human. So there are lots of aspects to environmentalism, but we will stick with toxic pollution and climate change as the big ones. You have little chance of making informed decisions that affect toxic pollution on any measurable scale when it comes to stuff for your house, so we can stick with climate change.

Your most effective means of activism comes through your money, and it is finite. This by itself should cause you to judge things based on ""biggest bang for your buck"". We won't sacrifice comfort, well... because that sucks (and you really don't have to, if you are smart). This also complements the money concern, which is pragmatic.

Is a Geo the most effective way to meet those goals? Maybe... Probably not. Geos are *incredibly* expensive. Despite the marketing, there is nothing about them that causes them to last any longer than the ""cheap option"", a standard heat pump with electric back-up heat at a minimum efficiency. With exceptions, you will have to have 10-15 years of relatively trouble free operation to hit pay-off compared to a new minimum efficiency unless you have a gargantuan, horribly insulated house. The efficiency gets less important if the percentage of your electric bill that feeds climate control isn't big. 

So, lets pretend you spent 40k on a geo and a conventional, cheap HP system would have been 10k (likely 5-8, but we will be generous) that is 30k... 

Warm climate:

* Insulation. Stupidly cheap to do (non-foam) and huge effect on energy usage if you have an accessible attic. Foam is expensive, but would make climate control a small enough percentage where efficiency differences on current gen equip is negligible.

* Attic ventilation. A $400 solar power venter can pay for itself in 1 summer, 3-4 if mild.

* IR window film. Huge reduction in heat load in summer. Cheap.

Cold climate: (geo has a better edge here)

* energy audit with FLiR. Air leakage is a big load. 

* Insulation. Still cheap and effective.

* zone based load management. Not as complex as it sounds. You don't waste heat on rooms that don't need it for certain periods. 

* The biggest concern in a cold climate are the times temps are below 20f. that is when your air-air HP starts struggling and needs the expensive electric heat.

With exceptions, you can make a house pretty efficient with the money that would have paid for the geo upgrade. Efficient enough that the geo efficiency difference would take decades.

Geos are stupidly complicated for no reason (a separate rant)

There are very few techs who know how to work on them (equals expensive)

They are niche, and usually require OEM repair parts (equals *very* expensive)

They are niche, so their manufacturing has a larger footprint per unit compared to mass produced standard systems.

Since we have already equated your personal environmental power being most represented by your wealth, things that cost you money are bad for the environment.

This was like the first of 3 sections, and now I realize how long i've rambled... I have a problem shutting up.

In practice, most EVs are leased because that's how the money flows best, but EVs are much less expensive to consumers because of government subsidies.  

Your expectation of new technology is unrealistic.  There are reasons that fossil fuel cars are cheaper with longer range, and it's not because of any conspiracy.  It's just the nature of the physics.  For what it's worth, you probably can see EVs for sale next to other cars at dealerships most places, so not sure what you are talking about.

On subsidies, I'm not sure if I can explain it to you if you don't understand at that level, but here goes.  You subsidize something if you want more of it.  I.e. we give people food stamps if we want them to have more food, or we give a tax credit on EVs because we want more people to buy them.  The converse is roughly true; we tax cigarettes to discourage smoking.   Even if we don't want there to be less of something when we tax it, that's almost always the result, so taxes are the opposite of subsidies.  Money moves the other way than it does with a subsidy.  In a subsidy, you pay less, as with EV tax credits.   In a tax, you pay more.

It wouldn't really make much difference if fossil fuel subsidies were eliminated, but it would still be a loss of money.  It's like saying why shouldn't your pay be reduced 2% for no reason?  It's a small amount.  You probably wouldn't like it, though.",yes_its_him,t2_h07br,1,0,reddit4

The lake the house is on is very deep though and at a certain depth never gets below 45 degrees. The house also was built with a horribly inefficient forced air system that ran on oil.

The first thing we did was re-insulate the walls, windows, and roof. When the oil bill was still astronomical we paid less than $20,000 to have the Geo installed using the lake as its heat reservoir. It's really a brilliant little closed loop with no drilling required.

It's definitely an ideal case, but there are a lot of people who have the ideal case and don't know that this is an option because everyone only thinks about the drilling.",InfiniteJestV,t2_e6o6v,2,0,reddit4

If you were looking for a car and you visited a dealer and you saw that for every gas-powered vehicle there was an electric equivalent, which one would you choose? This hypothetical also supposes that there is equal infrastructure to support things like road trips and the like. This is the original analogy I was trying to make. People would choose the electric car right? Or at least most would. Faced with that choice, I'd certainly get an electric car. Hell, even if that car was a couple grand more and I could afford it I'd still go electric.

This is, of course, an idealized view and I wish it were the case and that's the point I was trying to make when comparing it to the whole ""blame the farmer"" argument. People have a choice when it comes to what food they eat.

Your original argument appears to be that these oil companies aren't to blame for anything because there is a demand for what they make. The fault is on the consumers that burn the fuel.

Again yes; that's probably a rational response at some level, even if they overdid it.  Did they materially suppress technological alternatives that were economically feasible?  Demonstrably not.  

You are saying you think people are willing to support efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption if they require no sacrifice on their part, i.e. the choices are in every way equivalent, rather than there being drawbacks to EVs, which is fine, but then you should apply that test to these corporations as well.  Why do you want them to make sacrifices, when people are buying all the products they can make, and the economy would tank if they stopped doing for even a week?  Saying they should do it for the public good is sort of specious if you don't expect consumers to make such sacrifices for the same reason.

This is just an exercise in blame if you ask me.  ""It's not my fault that I use fossil fuels...they made me!"", which is not really accurate.  It is your fault that you use fossil fuels, but they are often your best choice in many ways, so that's part of why you do it.  The sacrifice needed to not use them is too great.

I can't go around crying that it's everyone else's fault that the environment is in shit shape if I'm not willing to do my part as well. I hope that's not how I've been portraying myself.

Who *do* we blame in that situation? That person has to work, live, and get around, right? Should it be on manufacturers to make more affordable and environmentally-friendly cars? Should oil companies be asked to shoulder some of the burden of trying to put a clamp on all the carbon being pumped into the atmosphere? If so, how do we provide an incentive for them to do so? If not, should we do nothing and just let things keep going the way they are? Or, is there a third solution I'm not thinking of. Maybe that minimum wage earner should just ride a bike?

Finger pointing based on anecdotes, to wit: ""They sponsored research to try to make fossil fuels look good, so they're just like tobacco companies!"" completely misses the point.   That might make these companies tone-deaf in their PR or morally bankrupt, but that's not why we buy fossil fuels.  We buy them because there's no practical alternative, and the faux research didn't change that in any material way.

Some of you seemed to have missed that word. HIV infection in the United States is already significantly decreasing. While females who cater to heterosexual males make up the majority of prostitutes, injectable drug users and homosexual males make up the majority of people with HIV infections. How decriminalizing, which is different than legalizing, will cut HIV infection by a third really makes no sense. 

I'm talking about the U.S. specifically because everyone else in here seems to be bitching about ""morals"", ""puritans"", and whatever else they can muster up to allude that the U.S. is in a state of overwhelmingly religious rule when it's simply not the case. Please stop with the overly dramatic, teenager-esque comments.

Aside from the morality of it, which is purely subjective, the major issue that arises is in the ripple effect: It is much easier to hide an illegal operation amongst legal ones. So, we've got girls under 18 conning their way into being sex workers, girls of all ages being forced or coerced into it under threat of blackmail, human trafficking, ambiguity of rape/sexual assult charges, etc. Also, if everyone is running a bordelo, it will become difficult to ensure that regulations and standards are being properly kept.

In my admittedly unenlightened opinion, I believe that instead of allowing it en masse, sex work should have very limited licensing, must have a defined location with no more than 10 licenses per state (or per population %) and that there would be quarterly inspections where every one of the service providers are reminded of their rights and given the opportunity to privately issue any grievances to a licensing officer. Backround checks on everyone, extra STD checks (presuming STD checks are already mandatory), the whole works.

On top of that, workers must register with a state or federal body and go through a background check before they can do the job. This would be an absolutely necessary part of the process, not to shame the girl, but to protect against all that stuff I mentioned above.",essidus,t2_5ee5o,2,0,reddit1

It actually looks like DMSC has provided a cover for sex trafficking because the girls are too scared to say anything. The only thing that is going to stop the spread of HIV and other diseases is to educate people,especially women. Sex work is not criminalized in these poor countries in fact it is actually girls themselves that are the ones who suffer. I read one case where a girl had been sex trafficked and finally escaped and went straight to the police and you know what the police did? They raped her. ",TreatYoSelves,t2_dycwd,1,0,reddit1

* It's a barrier to otherwise successful HIV and STI peer education, prevention, and free & anonymous testing and treatment
* The outcomes of mandatory testing are counterproductive to reducing the rates of HIV and other STIs
* Testing does not reach the intended target group
* Testing is costly and inefficient
* Mandatory testing has proven to be a very difficult policy to repeal once in place

Sex workers are, as a group, way more educated about safe sex than the average person on the street. They are also way more likely to be infected by a client than vice versa.

In a nutshell, mandatory STI testing for sex workers is a ""solution"" to a problem that doesn't exist—one that reinforces prejudice, stigma, and shame. (Like mandatory drug testing for government aid recipients we've seen introduced some places in the U.S.)

Sorry to infodump on you here, but this is one of those things where I always said, ""Well, that seems reasonable,"" until recently getting totally and utterly schooled on it by a friend.

> Compulsory STI and HIV testing are coercive medical practices that violate sex workers’ rights to be free from degrading treatment, as well as their rights to bodily integrity and privacy. It can lead to increased requests from clients for unsafe sex practices based on the awareness that sex workers are required to be tested regularly. Compulsory testing also perpetuates unfounded stereotypes of sex workers as transmitters of STIs and HIV.
>
> Even where testing is not compulsory by law, targets for testing are sometimes set by NGOs, making the testing seem compulsory in practice. This alienates sex workers from health services and can lead to highly coercive programming and poor standards of care. In some countries, HIV testing is mandatory upon arrest and there are provisions, including in some states in India, to segregate sex workers who are found to have STIs or HIV. In many countries police will force sex workers to visit special hospitals where they have to pay for health checks. In some places, the health status of sex workers is registered in databases.

Excepts on the topic from a recent post by a friend who is a sex worker:

> Mandatory testing of sex workers, in whatever form, reinforces and reproduces the demonstrably false but very prevalent stereotype of sex workers as a vector of disease, as a source of social ills, as a social problem to be regulated in order to protect the rest of the population. It contributes to public discourses that prevent decriminalisation of our work, that encourage and facilitate oppressive laws, that prevent us from organizing as workers for better conditions. It treats us as, at best, victims, and at worse a kind of social scourge. It negatively impacts on our clients perceptions of us, many of whom routinely treat workers as if they are diseased and unsafe, when in fact we are generally the ones managing our and the client’s sexual health practice to minimize risk (our risk of exposure to STIs FROM clients, not the other way around, statistically speaking). This also makes our work harder and sometimes less safe (when clients are hurt us, it is because they are of a culture that tells them we’re not as human as they are. That culture is just as culpable as the individual clients. [...]
>
> In addition to the disregard for bodily autonomy and the right to refuse invasive medical procedures, mandatory testing policy says that sex workers can’t be trusted to care for their own health, that we will only do it if forced to, that we need to be regulated and managed in order to not be a risk to ourselves and the rest of the ‘normal’ population. It’s paternalistic and violent, and it angers me deeply. Nurses don’t have to have an STI check certificate in order to work (just as an example of another job involving transmission of bodily fluids). The general population doesn’t have to have a STI check certifcate to have casual sex. It’s highly discriminatory, and not backed up by research about transmission rates. It does damage well beyond the unpleasant and sometimes traumatic individual experience of having the examination.

While legalization looks nice on paper it might be far from reality. Prostitution was legalized 14 years ago and the stigma has not gone away. Amsterdam has a bad reputation now for being a haven for drugs and prostitution. I don't want to visit because of what my family and some friends might think. Also locals don't like having a red light district in the middle of their city. Would you like to live next to one?

While condoms are almost 100% effecting at preventing HIV from spreading during intercourse it's not as effective against other STDs. Prostitutes sleep with hundreds of men which is a lot less than casual sex with regular women. Also any prostitute that offers oral sex without a condom is risking a lot and there is no way for a client to know if she has offered that in the past and has stopped because of contracting an STD or the fear of contracting one. How often should a prostitute renew such a licence? Every month? This leaves clients exposed to STDs in the end of the month. Regulation can be avoided. What happens to prostitutes who are fired because they have contracted an STD or is unable to get a job at a brothel they like? Will they go underground? What is stopping them from going underground in the first place if they feel there is too much regulation? How easy or difficult would it be for a client to distinguish between a legal or illegal prostitute?

Some can even argue that prostitution is rape. While I do not want to discuss or debate this but the general idea is that nobody wants to be a prostitute and while prostitutes agree to have sex doesn't mean they actually want to. How many times can they decline a client because they do not want to before they get fired? If she is trafficked then how many times can she decline a client (assuming she can) before she gets beat? To put this in perspective which reddit might understand how many of your male friends want to suck cock for a living (gay men buy sex too)? A female prostitute can be just as repulsed as male prostitutes. Since this would be legal it means the government sanctions all of this. Is this really want we want our government to support? Is this how we want our government for us to see women as?

Reddit often likes to see legalized prostitution through a rose-tinted glass but there are so many issues with it which can't be answered by just saying ""regulation"" and hoping things will fix by itself.

While this is a biased article it might give you some perspective of how legalized prostitution can be.

The victims of the ban are men, in the sense that the ban serves to raise the effective price (in financial and emotional trade) that men pay to gratify their needs. But men do not speak up for themselves here because women will then administer the obvious penalty.

You must understand, when you point out that prostitution is physically dangerous work, your intended audience (the women who support the ban) considers that to be good news.

if you test positive for HIV than you quit being a sex worker and get treatment. If you're a construction worker and you get silicosis from having a faulty respirator then you should probably stop cutting concrete and go get treatment. Will some prostitutes go rouge again and hook even with their new diagnosis? Maybe...but that's going to happen regardless of any prostitution regulations in place. If they get caught on the side of the road and can't produce their licence because it wasn't renewed due to their disease, then that's punishable under the new regulations.

>also what about all of the addict's that hook? 

Addicts are going to exist weather you have brothels or not. If you're addicted to drugs you should probably be seeking help (which I know for most of them that's damn near impossible.) Point being, making it legal isn't taking anything away from those addicts. it's not like you're leaving them ""without a job"" because they are inadequate to apply for a legal position now. They will just continue to do it illegally if they want, and when they get prompted for licence, they will suffer for it. Making sex work LEGAL will give people the option to go somewhere safe for sex and not pick that fugly meth addicted HIV whore up on the corner of the main drag.

They'll no longer have a need for abusive pimps and will not have to skulk in dangerous areas in order to elude law enforcement. This will give women a lot of power and I believe that is the main reason people in politics will refuse to legalize prostitution.

Look at the adult entertainment industry, women rule the industry and are the main draws. Some will have bad stories to be sure but for the most part women certainly come out ahead. Some people actually ENJOY being in porn and do it with their spouses and or romantic interests.

Ultimately it comes down to choice, if your theory about desperation already exists then whether it is legal or illegal is moot. The only difference between it being legal and illegal now is that it is more dangerous and empowers criminal elements as a source of revenue.

Whereas if it were legal it would provide tax revenue, lower crimes (research has shown it lowers rape in the areas that it is legalized in), and gives women (and men) the power to decide who they do or don't sleep with.

Very rarely were sex workers appearing with STI's (significantly less than the general population) and the monthly testing was diverting funds, resources and time away from those that needed it. 

It is illegal to ask a sex worker to provide a service without a condom in Victoria and this is made clear to clients. I would suggest, from experience rather than empirical evidence that when standards are bought in the work becomes more of a legitimate profession and is taken more seriously. The testing allows sex workers peace of mind, is funded by the government and workers do not have to supply their personal details, the doctor will simply not supply  a certificate that has their working name on it.

Monthly testing is unnecessary but some testing doesn't necessarily stigmatize sex workers and from my experience is a positive. I expect other professionals to meet standards consistently and long term, sex workers are no different.

Of course having a requirement for the client to receive a test is extremely hard and would only make less people receive the help from sex workers.

So what can we do?

Well offer a series of help systems for sex workers, make condoms and such available to them. Make it illegal to require constant STI tests for sex workers (as an invasion of privacy), it would be as wrong as requiring constant drug tests (and yes I disagree with those too). Offer free testing to sex workers, as part of an insurance they have, also have this insurance pay for an STI much like you would with a work condition. They'd have to prove that they got the STI as they were working, this promotes that a worker may want to get an STI test initially, though no one would be able to know if s/he got it or not (it would only be necessary to prove that the disease wasn't previously existing).

And what if a prostitute is sick? Well you should assume this could happen either way: a client could infect one, and then the disease could be passed to you, all before the test was taken. Some diseases, such as AIDS or Herpes can be in remnant, undetectable state during test but become infectious when the sex act occurs.

No, but we should stop framing these arguments purely on how many people get a disease or how many people die. There several other factors that have to be included. Does legalizing prostitution end up driving (coercing) a lot of women into this profession? 

What about the social effects? Do men then start perceiving women only as sexual objects and do women start seeing themselves only as sexual objects? If so, what damages if any will this do? 

It's similar to those that argue that all drugs should be legalized. They say that people mostly only die because the drugs are tainted. However, completely legalizing it will mean much more people using hard drugs. Do people believe that more people on drugs would be beneficial to society.....some of these drugs are very destructive in how they control the individual. 

What trade-off are we comfortable....how much are we willing trade in physical/health safety for the potential destructive nature of whatever we are legalizing or decriminalizing?  Weed is relatively harmless (compared to other vices) so trying to fight that is worthless but something like heroin, well, I don't think a study that shows ""10% fewer HIV cases""  would really tell the whole story since heroin is highly addictive and destructive.

In heterosexual intercourse, overwhelmingly its male to female infection that occurs. It can happen the other way but its more difficult.

So that accounts for the transfer. Why the reception? Well, Homosexual Male sex is (and this is speculation) probably more likely to result in anal sex. Anal sex (and this isnt speculation but is from medical papers I have read) results in more cases of minor tearing than oral or vaginal sex. Tears allow for transfer of the virus.

All I have done is put together 2 facts and some speculation (From Male infection is more common and anal sex is more likely to result in small cuts and abrasions). I would like to hear a medical professional backing this up. But this makes a lot of sense to me.",albions-angel,t2_cgd2z,1,0,reddit1

The scale effect of legalized prostitution leads to an expansion of the prostitution market, increasing human trafficking, while the substitution effect reduces demand for trafficked women as legal prostitutes are favored over trafficked ones. **Our empirical analysis for a cross-section of up to 150 countries** shows that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect.

According to various studies, including one by the European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers (TAMPEP), 65 to 80 percent of the girls and women come from abroad. Most are from Romania and Bulgaria.

In regard to regulation, it makes it harder to punish the pimps involved in trafficking, because now only ""exploitative"" procurement is illegal, which is very hard to prove. Also, with the legal status, more and larger brothels are opening up, increasing the number of sex workers needed and thus increasing the preassure of ""importing"" them. There is also this:

> Axel Dreher, a professor of international and development politics at the University of Heidelberg, has attempted to answer these questions, using data from 150 countries. The numbers were imprecise, as are all statistics relating to trafficking and prostitution, but he was able to identify a trend: Where prostitution is legal, there is more human trafficking than elsewhere.

You can find the study [here](http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.405653.de/diw_econsec0071.pdf). Abstract:

> This paper investigates the impact of legalized prostitution on human trafficking inflows.
According to economic theory, there are two opposing effects of unknown magnitude. The
scale effect of legalized prostitution leads to an expansion of the prostitution market,
increasing human trafficking, while the substitution effect reduces demand for trafficked
women as legal prostitutes are favored over trafficked ones. Our empirical analysis for a
cross-section of up to 150 countries shows that the scale effect dominates the substitution
effect. On average, countries where prostitution is legal experience larger reported human
trafficking inflows.",kleinergruenerkaktus,t2_6eef0,1,0,reddit1

Which is true, but it's not something that legal prostitution will do *that* much against. Many of the people who set off 'creeper alarms' in people they meet are also going to set them off for sex workers.

All of which is horribly unfair to the person who can't be not creepy. I have an uncle who is autistic and deeply creepy (though harmless).

OK, we don't have any proof either way, but lets say for the sake of argument you are right. If you were to criminalise porn all that would happen is the willing participants would go away and resources would be spent chasing and prosecuting porn consumers who otherwise committed no crime. In fact, I can only imagine it would encourage trafficking since there are no willing participants to take up the slack.

Prior to legalization, Antwerp was overrun with trafficked women, violence and sexual tourists (Bilefsky). Over 4000 vehicles clogged the narrow roads as street prostitutes solicited their trade in broad daylight (Bilefsky). After legalization, crime rates plummeted by 44%, the number of trafficked women fell greatly and street congestion normalized (Bilefsky). So why did Antwerp’s experiment work where Victoria’s failed? Dan Bilefsky, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal explains that Antwerp’s success is a reflection of how prostitution was regulated. Bilefsky visited Villa Tinto, a 51 room mega-brothel within the three-block legal zone. In his article “The Belgian Experiment” Bilefsky noted how modern security technology was incorporated within the brothel. Along with advanced computer registration and numerous cameras, the brothel featured thumb scanners in every room, which had to be activated every hour by the attending prostitute or the power in the room would shut off. This ensured that prostitutes could not rent out their rooms to unregistered workers. Another measure taken by officials was making the three-block zone inaccessible by vehicle, taking away the profitability of street prostitution.  ",swimtothemoon1,t2_gooa1,1,0,reddit1

Say we have two hypothetical cities, each with 100 traffickers moving through the city each year. If City A is catching 10% of those traffickers, and City B is catching 40% of those traffickers, it is going to look like City B has higher rates of trafficking, because you really only know about the ones you catch.

All of this reflects exactly what I was talking about above. Quoting again:

> Mandatory testing of sex workers, in whatever form, reinforces and reproduces the demonstrably false but very prevalent stereotype of sex workers as a vector of disease, as a source of social ills, as a social problem to be regulated in order to protect the rest of the population. [...] It treats us as, at best, victims, and at worse a kind of social scourge. It negatively impacts on our clients perceptions of us, many of whom routinely treat workers as if they are diseased and unsafe, when in fact we are generally the ones managing our and the client’s sexual health practice to minimize risk (our risk of exposure to STIs FROM clients, not the other way around, statistically speaking). [...] In addition to the disregard for bodily autonomy and the right to refuse invasive medical procedures, mandatory testing policy says that sex workers can’t be trusted to care for their own health, that we will only do it if forced to, that we need to be regulated and managed in order to not be a risk to ourselves and the rest of the ‘normal’ population.

Doctors, for example, also work in a profession where they come into contact with a lot of bodily fluids. Yet nobody is arguing that doctors should have mandatory tests, because we trust them to manage their own health.

The issue has more to do with supply versus demand.  When solicitation of prostitution becomes legal, demand for prostitution skyrockets.  But the supply of prostitutes remains pretty constant and honestly the supply of women who want to become prostitutes is pretty damn low.

Basically what ends up happening is that the black market can leverage the legal infrastructure set up to solicit prostitution into an illegal market that can much better accommodate the demand of people who want prostitutes.  This is done by seeking out under age and vulnerable girls or importing women from poor countries.

Also everyone says they want highly regulated and clean prostitution, but if you look at the legal prostitution, it's not all that appealing... wearing a condom to get a blowjob, very limited and strict rules about contact (no kissing), having to get inspected beforehand.  It's basically just the strictest form of sex that's meant to get the customer in and out as fast as possible with the least amount of contact.  Yes these are all good things that should happen in a regulated and health sex industry, but they're not typically what people want out of their prostitute, so if a black market exists that provides really really desperate but young and attractive women who will perform certain acts without a condom, and willing to give the client the full experience... well let's just say the black market ends up being the ones who really profit from such a scenario.",,,106,0,reddit1

They are criminal organizations. And when they look for ways to increase profit, human trafficking is one of the ways to increase their profit.

That is also the reason why it doesn't go away from legalization. Because even after legalization, its still the same criminal organizations running the business they have been running for decades. 

You first need to get legal businesses to run brothels, businesses that do not want to get involved with anything illegal.

So, legalization may help in the long term, but is not something that should be done in the hopes of combating human trafficking.

It should be done because it is wrong to patronize women and treat them like children without their own brain. They are perfect capable of deciding by themselves if they want to work in this industry or not.",yaix,t2_5id0f,1,0,reddit1

cj8j86d,t1_cj8hro7,2014-07-26 19:21:28,science,"If a sex worker gets tested and has results showing she is clean, then clients would not think they are diseased or unsafe. Mandatory testing policy doesn't say that sex workers can't be trusted. It's a security precaution. Security precautions come from analyzing risks, not on an issue related to trust. It's a thin line, though. I lock the door to my room when I leave not because I don't trust my roommates, but because it is just an added security caution. 

Your last note isn't really relevant. There isn't a standard policy regarding legal sex workers and the results of their test. Whether or not the results of the test matters depends on what policy would be formed. I don't know how states like Nevada handle it, but I believe statewide policy would take different factors into mind compared to nationwide policy.

Sex workers needing testing isn't some sort of oppression. A perception of social scourge and victims is a cultural perspective. Right now it may look like that, but that's because right now the country kind of doesn't have a good opinion of sex workers. If they ever are standardized in the country, our perceptions of them will have already be different enough.

Sex workers to doctors is not a good comparison. Doctors aren't required to take testing but they have other rigorous policies to guarantee that doctors operating are clean and efficient. Also, doctors work in hospitals where they can be regulated. Sex workers can work anywhere. If you go to a brothel, things may be different though. My point is that doctors don't have mandatory testing but they have other many rigorous rules to guarantee they will be clean and efficient. Sex workers currently do not have those standards as they are not legal (nationwide) so they need to be subject to some sort of regulation. If prostitution ever becomes legal, it's not like the government will just say ""Have at it, do whatever you want at your own discretion.""

Mandatory testing isn't because we want to add pressure to sex workers or anything, it's to catch the ones that will be bad. It's like airport security. We're not using it to purposely waste time, we are trying to catch that one guy that will cause a problem.

According to economic theory, there are two opposing effects of unknown magnitude. The
scale effect of legalized prostitution leads to an expansion of the prostitution market,
increasing human trafficking, while the substitution effect reduces demand for trafficked
women as legal prostitutes are favored over trafficked ones. Our empirical analysis for a

Both prostitution and assisted suicide have the ability to give people legal leverage over their own bodies. I'm not saying they shouldn't be legalized; **however**, this is the obvious issue that causes reluctance.

Its actually incredibly exciting what the potential of legalization can do. For instance, if we legalize and regulate prostitution it will be a solid stepping stone to fully ""de-puritanizing"" our sexual views. Additionally, like the article refers to, transmission of STDs will decline.

Thats roughly 2-3 generations before mine (a 20 year old male). Such a drastic culture change as relaxing our views on sex takes a long period of time. This is very noticeable in our society and you can tell that we have been becoming more progressive on our drug views, sex views, etc.

The general consensus within America has become drastically more progressive since the 20s. For example, the LGBT community is now able to be **much** more open about their life style than before. Hell, we have shows that consider a ""modern family"" to have a gay couple in it. That's pretty progressive compared to what the US's beliefs were just 10-20 years ago.

Honestly, I think its remarkable that how times have changed. Yes we still have a long ways to go, but we are definitely making progress.

That's pretty straight forward, isn't it. Supply on the other hand can only increase so much, because even if sex work is legal, only a very small percentage of women considers it.

Legality of the subject. The same deal was with prohibition.

In the end of prohibition the amount of ""illegal"" alcohol seemed to peak, but the reality was that people reported it more. 

The reported statistics could imply this just as easy as the other spectrum.

> Except those involved in illegal trafficking would still be prosecuted

Of course. If a person thinks there's illegal human trafficking going on in a legalized brothel they can easily report for the authorities to check it. For illegal establishments they get reported and found a lot easier due to there being a licence that you need to have in order to practise said business.

Same thing is essentially happening with the marihuana being legalized in certain areas.

The difference between ""shy and awkward and harmless"" and ""shy and awkward and full of rage"" is one you're mostly going to have to guess based on their body language, the look in their eyes, emotive cues and a bunch of stuff that is hard to verbalize and thus has to be categorized under ""vibes"".

Many corporations give worker bonuses, and pay dividends to investors, *which are taxable*, which in turn 'zeroes out the company', meaning that it has no taxable income.  To re-emphasize:  the company 'pays taxes' on the income that it distributes to others, rather than paying taxes on its own income.

Soo.... If profit margin decreases, their incentive to increase total sales decrease...?

> Currently when their profit becomes smaller for whatever reason they scramble to find a way to get them back up, which usually means finding a way to get more consumers. 

... while, at the same time, when profit becomes smaller, they scramble to increase total sales?

Which one is it?

Is it that the incentives do decrease, but tobacco companies are somehow acting irrationally and in the opposite direction of the incentives?

To me it's not obvious that smaller profit margin would make economy of scale *less* important. Rather, my guess would have been the other way around. It could be argued that at a low enough profit margin, there's not a sufficient return on investment to sustain the business. And then the companies with the lowest profit margins will either raise prices or drop out of the market, reducing competition until the remaining companies have a sustainable profit margin (i.e. the companies who use economy of scale better, and possibly price increases).

Either way, as long as they are operating with a positive profit margin, they will always benefit from increase sales and will have an incentive to increase sales.

Does it help former coal miners in rural regions to have their jobs be replaced by hundreds of trained engineers in another part of the country?

The reality is that there are a lot of workers out there who cannot so easily be retrained for a new job. Some could, and would be willing to, but I think many would not be able to transition into these new jobs.

If this restructuring of the energy sector results in less unskilled manual labor jobs (and by unskilled I mean requires no education, not that it is easy or simple) in favor of more highly educated jobs, then that former group still ends up being unemployed as a result of this shift.

And while the article touches briefly on issues like many of these proposed new manufacturing jobs can be located anywhere because they are not bound by the presence of natural resources the way jobs in the fossil fuel extraction industry are, there are no guarantees (and I would say probably no reason) for why these proposed new jobs would appear in the same places - meaning the individual workers losing their jobs will not be able to work these new ones.

It seems like to me this is very much a top-down perspective of the situation, and the article fails to account for the human side all that much. The net profit of jobs will go up, and it will be beneficial for both governments and the energy sector as a whole, but it is still a less than preferable solution if the reality is that thousands of people lose jobs that will afterwards no longer exist, and thousands of *different* people get new jobs elsewhere.",bobosuda,t2_5958f,1,0,reddit3

Meanwhile the developing world is increasing their energy demands; rightfully so and their increase in quality of life is amazing. But unless we can get the world to drastically decrease energy consumption, we’re going to need to transition to all renewables incredibly quickly to avoid 2 degrees Celsius.

If the rich countries want the developing countries to decrease pollution as they increase energy consumption, they should invest and subsidize substantially more than they are.

Including the eventual carbon sequestration industry where we literally just produce energy to distill carbon dioxide out of atmosphere and process coal (and synthetic hydrocarbons for necessary applications), you're basically looking at the foreseeable future of human species to undo all the fossil fuel release in the prior 300 years. And that process can really only start after we first get rid of all of the fossil fuels, and build enough surplus energy production that we can use any significant amount of energy for this.

But the first step really is to improve our carbon capture processes. Improve the efficiency, and use the produced synthetic (carbon neutral) fuels to replace fossil fuels for those applications where you really need the densest energy storage besides nuclear power, and eventually we would be able to build enough collection capacity to make a dent into the CO2 concentration.

But it will take a long time. Let's say that most of the CO2 has been released within the last 250 years; I would say it might take at least ten times that amount of time to re-capture the released carbon.

So, a hundred generations might actually be low-balling it. And assuming one generations is approximately 25 years, that would mean 2,500 years.

Perhaps all those coal miners moaning about losing their jobs to climate change will actually be hired to *dig the captured coal back into the mines and seal it there*, like a bizarre time reverse story from Vonnegut.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,73,0,reddit3

Meanwhile they will completely ignore the trillions of incentives for renewables that are pretty much the only reason it exists as an industry at the scale it currently is. Sure there are certain areas where it’s very efficient, think some of the wind farms in areas that see sustained 30mph+ wind pretty much all year long, but the dirty secret with everything outside of traditional fossil fuels is that it does require a lot of subsidies because it will be compared to the lowest cost alternatives. 

I don’t get why Americans are fine giving so much money to renewables, often for horribly inefficient projects that just line special interest pockets, anyone remember Solyndra? I know large real estate funds that is all something like industrial warehouse space, or multi family housing, class A office space, etc, but then will randomly have some giant solar or wind power property in the portfolio. When you ask the portfolio managers why that’s there they laugh and say because they get a huge tax credit basically making the bulk of their distributions to investors tax free over the life of the fund, and they buy or develop these assets in states that guarantee some base level of purchasing of the electricity produced regardless of the true market rate. I remember seeing some back in the day where they literally built solar farms and never actually operated them, just wanted the tax credit and would plan to sell the equipment at the end of the fund. I think a lot of that has been cleaned up, at least on the ridiculous tax benefits we give out regardless of how much power it actually generates, but to think the renewable industry is good enough to sustain itself for be anywhere near the economic benefit of the fossil fuel industry is a complete joke.",ed_merckx,t2_6qtz2,9,0,reddit3

You're right that the money has to come from somewhere. Does it make sense to throw all the money in already existing equipment away?

h7c97by,t1_h7c57x8,2021-08-01 18:26:20,science,">Why not nuclear? Why wait to find a dense energy source when we already have one.

I was referring to applications where you need high energy density, but nuclear power is not practical for weight or safety reasons.

For large scale energy production, nuclear fission is an excellent choice, probably among the best available at the moment (opinions vary on what is number 1 at different times).

However: While nuclear energy is the highest in terms of energy density of fuel, the reactors to use that fuel in have to be quite large, both in terms of the actual pressurized reactor vessel, and even more mass in terms of radiation shielding (although if you live in Soviet Union, you might not get that luxury).

The reactor needs to be large because if you make it too small, the power output decreases faster than its physical dimensions. A reactor small and light enough to be feasible for aviation application would not provide enough power for an aircraft big enough to carry it, and the same holds true for automobiles. In other words, an internal combustion engine or a jet engine can have much higher *power to weight ratio* than a nuclear reactor small enough to replace it.

Because of this, nuclear power is not practical to use for aircraft or road transportation. The smallest types of vehicles where nuclear reactors are really practical are certain types of ocean-going ships: Nuclear submarines, nuclear-powered icebreakers, and nuclear aircraft carriers.

Anything smaller than that has to be powered by something else. 

Solar has too little power for vehicular use outside special tech demonstrators.

Wind is a good supplemental energy source for ships, has a long history for maritime propulsion, and will likely be taken advantage of more in the future. But wind powered cars are not likely to be a thing despite Veritasium's faster-than-wind propeller cart.

Electric vehicles are great! They don't have any emissions during drive, which makes them ideal for large cities that currently suffer from poor air quality, much of which is caused by noxious particles from internal combustion engines.

However, you can't really use batteries for aircraft because of two main reasons. First, batteries don't have nearly as much energy per mass (or energy per volume) as hydrocarbon fuels do. This means an electric aircraft would not have the same range as an aircraft powered by chemical fuel, or if it did, it could not carry nearly as much payload because most of the aircraft would consist of batteries, leaving no room (or lifting performance) for paying customers or cargo.

Second reason is that a battery pack catching on fire on a Tesla is manageable because you can stop reasonably quickly, exit the vehicle, and you'd probably be all right as long as the battery doesn't explode and cause a crash or render you incapable of exiting the vehicle.

If a battery pack catches on fire in an electric aircraft that is in the air, getting out immediately is usually not an option. You'd have to land first, and hope you can then exit the plane after the landing.

So, because of these limitations, internal combustion engine powered cars might see a 70-80-90% replacement by electric vehicles, especially in large cities. But people who need cars for longer distances, and especially in cold temperatures, will likely have to continue using cars powered by gasoline.

And for air transportation, jet fuel is going to remain the only viable option. Likely forever. What we will need to do is make sure that the fuels consumed by road and air transportation needs are not extracted from underground - rather, we will need to replace fossil fuels with carbon-neutral fuels synthesized from atmospheric CO2.

For that, we will need a lot of energy. Which is why we will need all available power production methods: Wind, solar, currently existing hydroelectric plants, tidal power plants, ocean wave power plants, nuclear fission power plants and - in the future - nuclear fusion power plants. We will need all of them, and as their capacity increases we can start dropping the use of fossil fuels, starting from coal which is the worst in terms of CO2 emissions.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,2,0,reddit3

I guess the question really is *what do you believe AGI means*.  Does it need to have *emotions* like a human?  Or just a machine where you give it vocal commands, it looks up a pre-trained agent from a large, cloud hosted repo, and that agent can do a specific task with human ability or better?

In America, over the past 40 years, hundreds of millions of people retired at 65 (or earlier) and quite happily lived lives going fishing, working on their hobbies, travelling and hanging out with their grandkids. Sure, there are people that hate retirement, but for everyone one of those there are two-dozen loving it. I'm 54 and I already have friends staring down retirement at 60 who are counting the days.

I just don't believe some magic light switch at 60 goes off where before that people's identities are ""lost"" if they aren't going to work to sort trash at the recycling plant and then once they are retired that loss no longer happens.

The other example is Western Europe, where many people quite happily take the whole summer off on vacation. Is their identity ""lost"" because they're not at a desk at the Ikea HQ?  No, I don't think so.",CohibaVancouver,t2_cszaq,8,0,reddit3

Three Mile Island was not a significant disaster in terms of loss of life. Chernobyl is a well-understood accident and simply not going to happen in a modern reactor, in modern times.

Notice how you didn't contest my figures on loss of life, because you *know* how massive the death toll is from carbon?

This is not an actual debate. One source of energy is pushing the entire planet off the edge, and kills thousands of people a day, mostly the most vulnerable and poor. The other has a few downsides, none of which are even 1% as terrible as the downsides for fossil fuels.

Remember, coal plants leak much, much *more* ionizing radiation, and they do it 24/7. If you are concerned about radiation's effects on individuals, *coal* power is the biggest offender.

I apologize if I sound strident, I really do. But it's unconscionable to me how anyone can seriously pretend that nuclear isn't obviously, demonstrably superior in every way you can compare it (with the exception of setup outlays). Fossil fuels needed to go 30 years ago, and anti-nuclear hysteria is one of the biggest obstacles to making progress with a cleaner grid.

Harnessing a river's flow by damming it is essentially a death blow to migratory fish population upstream of that point, and the effects from that can vary from minor to severe. Overall it's not good for biodiversity.

Additionally, methane emissions from rotting biological material on the bottom of reservoir lakes adds its own load onto the greenhouse gas situation.

In my opinion, building new large scale hydroelectric power stations with fully dammed rivers should not be done if we can avoid it.

Small scale, distributed hydroelectric power generators would be a much better choice, and possibly one where small power stations could provide electricity for local communities along the river, without blocking the river for fish migrations.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit3
h7bhoyw,t1_h7bc9xd,2021-08-01 14:53:18,science,"Solar has its own issues. I think the biggest one is that you only get 1.366 kW/m^2 of solar energy *at maximum*, and that's in a situation where the solar panels or collectors are directly pointed at the Sun, and never shadow each other.

The other issue is that the Sun is only visible from half of the Earth's surface at any given time, and gives light to each individual solar energy collector for about 50% of the time. And since actuated solar collectors are much more expensive than static ones, you usually see solar panels or collectors set up on roof tops with a rough optimization of what angle they should be pointed at.

Large areas covered with solar collectors or solar panels also seem to become deadly to local insect populations and vegetation. What this means is that large scale, centralized energy production with solar is unlikely to happen.

The best use case for solar is probably a distributed model of energy production for supplementing the daytime energy consumption of individual households. Either by solar collectors to utilize the heat of the Sun, or by solar panels to generate power. Although I would point out solar panel production has pretty significant environmental impact, and the efficiency of solar panels isn't the greatest.

Wind is good, and wind exists on both day and night and even though there's a variation in wind speed, by choosing the wind farm locations carefully, you can get good power for most days of the year.

Nuclear is great for its energy density and high safety record. The problem with fission is mainly the human factor of operation and planning, and secondarily the long term storage of nuclear waste.

Personally I think we are going to need fusion power until we can really start to sequester carbon on an impactful scale. But while we're waiting for that we have the resources to replace fossil fuels. I just don't see how we could have the luxury to afford to not use every option at our disposal.

What this means, in my opinion, is that the conversations about what is best carbon-free energy are a waste of time and effort. Wind, solar, and nuclear should not be seen as competitors. They should all be seen as equally important alternatives to fossil fuels.

There might be people who don't like wind, or hydroelectric, or solar power, and certainly a lot of people dislike nuclear power, for some deserved and many very much undeserved reasons.

I don’t think unawareness of our low level biological functions is strictly required for general intelligence, even if there may have been a evolutionary benefit. Artificial machines however don’t have the same natural selection pressures or physical limitations that humans do.

Consider memory as an example. We humans are pretty bad at remembering precise details or large volumes of information, so instead we keep records.

The *reason* for that is that today (and to greater extent in the past), everything required to live/live in reasonable comfort requires the efforts of *other people*.  A roof over your head? Someone has to build the structure, maintain the structure, gather the raw materials, guard the property, insure it, put out fires, and so on.  You need medical attention?

Revenue neutral tax and dividend system, where all proceeds of the tax are paid out in equal payments to everybody in the country, to avoid poorer people being prefentially hurt when they can't afford to switch to other options. Essentially a wealth transfer between those who pollute a lot, and those who don't. 

This would add: 

- $2 / gallon of gasoline (in effect a lifetime subsidy to electric cars charged by renewables of at least $10,000)

- $180 / MWh of coal electricity (wholesale electricity is around $40 / MWh, so this would quintuple the cost of coal)

- $80 / MWh of natural gas electricity (triples its cost)

- $40 / 1000 miles for economy Air fares. (Nearly double a lot of low cost short haul air fares)

- $1000 per year to costs of heating a house using natural gas. (Doubles the cost)

- $4 / kg of lamb or beef (about a 50% increase).

- $2.5 per board-foot for clearcut timber without replanting (about $40,000 for timber for a typical house)


This would all provide real strong incentives to switch things over. 

To give time for switches to happen, without demolishing the economy in one go, these should probably ramp up over a period of 10 years or so. So put a tax of $20 / ton in now, increasing by $20 per year until it gets to $200 / ton by 2030. Everybody will know its coming and have to make the switches.

Edit: Regarding traded ""credits"", there shouldn't be credits for ""we went low emissions and therefore emitted X less"". However, I'd be completely fine with equal amount tax credits for actual negative emissions. For instance, a mature forest will trap about 125 tons of carbon long term if left undisturbed.

You may be overestimating the space required.

An area like the US southwest gets insolation of [2,000kWh/m^2 per year](https://energyinformative.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/global-irradiance.jpg); with a 25%-efficient solar panel (up from 2019's [22% average](https://about.bnef.com/blog/solars-hot-new-thing-nears-production-qa/)), that's 500kWh/m2/yr of delivered electricity. The world's total energy consumption is around [600 quads/yr](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=87&t=1), which is 180T kWh/yr. Most of that is burned in heat engines at low efficiency (e.g., oil in cars, coal for electricity), so let's round that down to 100T kWh/yr / 500 kWh/m2/yr = 200B m2 = 200,000 km2.

Which seems like a large number, but even a densely-populated nation like India has regions like the [Thar desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_Desert) with 170,000km2 of land (in India) and a population density [similar to Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Scotland).

For the US's 100 quads of energy consumption, the area required would be around 33,000 sq km, or [around 2/3 of Coconino County, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_counties_in_the_United_States_by_area) - 0.3% of the US.

With very few exceptions, land use is not a meaningful constraint on solar or wind power.

> The other issue is that the Sun is only visible from half of the Earth's surface at any given time

[Most utility-scale solar projects being installed in the US now include storage](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/wind-solar-make-up-70-of-new-generation-in-2021-while-batteries-gain-mome/593278/).

They typically include 4h of storage, which is the duration [this study](http://www.2035report.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2035-Report.pdf) used to show the US grid can be 90% decarbonized with 600GWh of storage (p.16), or about $100B at today's battery prices (~$150/kWh * 600GWh), which is roughly [2 years of power sector investment for the US](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2019/power-sector).

> The best use case for solar is probably a distributed model of energy production for supplementing the daytime energy consumption of individual households.

[Household solar PV is about 5x as expensive as utility-scale solar PV per kWh](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020/).

> The problem with fission is mainly the human factor of operation and planning

And *time* - neither the US nor EU has managed to build a new reactor without massive cost and schedule overruns in *decades*, meaning it's *highly* unlikely new nuclear will be able to make a meaningful contribution to their power grids before the 2030s. By contrast, renewables have their supply chains operating at massive scale right now (in fact, [wind+solar+storage are now the large majority of new power generation added world-wide](https://www.carbonbrief.org/exceptional-new-normal-iea-raises-growth-forecast-for-wind-and-solar-by-another-25)).

100TWh of nuclear is simpler for grid operators to deal with than 100TWh of wind+solar+storage, but due to the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions (as well as deaths from air pollution), a good solution for clean power now is better than a great solution in 20 years.

That being said, in my opinion it's a good idea for the US and EU to rebuild their nuclear supply chains, and for nations which already have them (China, Russia, India, Japan, S Korea) to build more to diversify our power options.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit3

h7e194c,t1_h7dnurk,2021-08-02 03:29:15,science,">**You may be overestimating the space required.**

Well, the solar constant can't really be changed. What it means is an absolute upper limit of power per surface area, and in reality things like panel efficiency (if we're generating electricity), time of day, length of day, and whether the panels articulate to track the sun will drop that significantly.

Even somewhere at the equator where the Sun reliable goes almost perfectly overhead and you can just lay the panel flat on the ground, the power curve over daytime starts from zero as night turns into morning, then goes up in a sort of sine wave / bell curve shape, and back down to zero as evening turns to night.

So while the solar constant is about 1.3 kW/m^2 (that's the amount of radiation the square metre receives when it's facing flat towards the Sun), if we want to figure the *average power over day* we need to consider the variable amount of light over the day. For 12 hours, it's entirely dark. Then during daytime, let's assume the amount of light hits 1.3 kW/m^2.

Since work is the integral of power over time, we can look at the *surface area* covered by the light cycle, and from a very simple visual estimate I would say the average power over day is somewhere between a quarter and a third of solar constant.

So this is about equivalent of being 70% in the darkness and 30% in light with full solar constant. That comes up to about 9.36 kWh/day.

Over a year, that would come to about 3,416 MWh/year without counting losses from weather variation etc.

This figure is in the same magnitude as the quoted figure here:

>**An area like the US southwest gets insolation of 2,000kWh/m^2 per year;**

...so after that sanity check, let's accept that as a reasonable annual amount of energy per area.

So what does that mean?

> **with a 25%-efficient solar panel (up from 2019's 22% average), that's 500kWh/m2/yr of delivered electricity.**

I would prefer to look at power figures rather than absolute amount of energy, because that gives a clearer picture of how much area you need to cover in solar panels to get a certain average power output.

So, 2000 kWh per year comes down to about 228 watts per square metre. That is the average power of sunlight that a square metre at US Southwest receives.

Let's further assume a 25% efficiency solar panel.

What this means is now you get about 57 W/m^2 of electricity, measured at the source (each individual panel). Add in a rough estimate of 5% of energy being lost in electric power transfer, so that's about 54 watts per square metre.

>**The world's total energy consumption is around 600 quads/yr, which is 180T kWh/yr.**


World's electric consumption is indeed around 600 quads/year, or 180,000 TWh/year. That comes to around 20×10^12 watts.

> **Most of that is burned in heat engines at low efficiency (e.g., oil in cars, coal for electricity), so let's round that down to 100T kWh/yr / 500 kWh/m2/yr = 200B m2 = 200,000 km2.**

Whoa there, the electricity consumption measures the consumption of *electricity*, not the fuels to generate said electricity.

If we need 180,000 TWh of electricity per year, we won't need any less electricity just because we switch to making all of that with solar panels. We just stop using the fossil fuel power plants for making electricity - we'll still need the same amount of it.

So if we take that need for continuous average of 20×10^12 watts of electric power, now we can divide that by 54 watts per square metre, and the result is the amount of square metres required to cover the Earth's entire electricity production: The grand total comes up to about 381×10^9 m^2 or 380,517 km^2 by my count.

>**Which seems like a large number, but even a densely-populated nation like India has regions like the Thar desert with 170,000km2 of land (in India) and a population density similar to Scotland.**


It is indeed a large number and the problem isn't even so much the absolute amount of area that needs to be covered, but rather the *amount of solar panels required*.

From a brief google search, the most powerful solar panels currently in production (or soon to be released) seem to be 2.4 metres tall and 1.3 metres wide, giving each unit a surface area of around 3.12 square metres.

Again dividing the total required panel surface area by the area of individual panel, that means you'd need to manufacture *and maintain* 122,115,384,615 units of these solar panels to cover the entire world's electricity demands.

To put that number in perspective, in order to build that amount in one hundred years' time would mean that each year, you would need to build approximately 1,221,153,846 solar panels.

That is, 1.22 billion units per year and you'd be finished in a hundred years' time.

***Assuming that none of the units need to be replaced in that time.***


The big concern with this is that, at some point, you'd reach a point where your production capacity was overwhelmed by *just the need to swap out broken panels for new ones*.


Oh, and you can't pack solar panels completely side to side, you have to leave a bit of a maintenance gap so that it's possible to repair or swap them in a reasonable manner. So let's say a massive panel installation would have them in rows, with access paths 1.2 metres wide at each side. That would mean each panel would require a (minimum Amazon grade) surface area of 1.2 m x  1.3 m = 1.56 m^2 for maintenance access. This increases the area taken by each panel by about 50%, so the actual area requirements balloon up to about 570,776 km^2 which is pretty close to the surface area of Kenya.

Of course we're not going to cover Kenya in solar panels, that would be daft. We're definitely going to be using solar panels among every other carbon neutral energy production method, but we most likely won't be able to fulfill the world's entire electricity consumption needs with solar only. And building huge solar farms just seems impractical to say the least.

Storage helps to balance the load locally, which means solar panels will likely be used to supplement household power needs more than anything else. Putting solar panels on the roofs is the most sensible place for them anyway - that area is already denied for normal biospheres, so might as well use that area effectively, right?

I'm not trying to bash solar power unjustly. It is, and will continue to be, an important and worthwhile tool to supersede fossil fuels in our energy production. But it is not going to be doing it alone, and talking about exactly how much solar power we would ""need"" to power the world is ultimately futile because that's not going to happen. Or, in other words, I'm *not* trying to say we shouldn't build solar power because building enough of it to power the world is impossible - that's not the point.

If anything, I'm saying that *trying to rely on any single energy production method* to power the entire world would be silly, and we would stand much better chance of replacing fossil fuels sooner if we just built up *every non-fossil power source at the same time*.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit3

No, that's the total **primary energy** consumption, per the EIA page linked to from the 600 quads/yr figure.  Most of that is burned in heat engines at 20-50% efficiency (coal plants, car engines, etc.), so the amount of electricity needed to replace that primary energy would be *much* less.

So you agree that the power density and area required for solar is not a major problem?  Good, that was my point.

However...

> but rather the amount of solar panels required.

Why is that a problem?

Yes, 70B is a large number, but *anything* to do with the entire world's energy supply is going to be a large number, so it's a non-argument to just say ""gosh, that's a big number!""

[The world builds 100M cars per year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262747/worldwide-automobile-production-since-2000/) (pre-covid), each of which is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger and more complicated than a solar panel.  At that rate, the world will build 3B cars between now and 2050; given that, 70B solar panels does not seem outlandish.

To sanity-check, note that the average price of a new car in the US is [$40k](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-now-the-average-price-of-a-new-car-11613683827), vs. a capital cost of about [$900/kW-peak](https://www.lazard.com/media/451419/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-140.pdf) for utility-scale solar PV (p.16); at a 25% capacity factor, that's 250w/$900, or $3.6/watt.

3B cars * $30k (75% of the US price) = $90T of cars manufactured in 30 years *assuming manufacturing stops growing*.

$90T of solar panels @ $3.6/watt-constant = 25T watts = 25x10^12 watts = 2.5x the amount calculated above.

In other words, the challenge of manufacturing and installing enough solar panels to replace *all* world energy usage by 2050 is just under half as large as the challenge of manufacturing the number of cars the world typically manufactures in a year.

Right, I misread your post. Apologies. 

So, yes, if we *only* intend to replace the world's electricity consumption with solar panels rather than primary energy consumption, then it becomes a lot more feasible task (by a factor of about seven, if the world's electricity consumption is about 25 PWh/year and primary energy consumption is 180 PWh/year).

[But if the goal is to replace fossil fuels, that would only make a fairly small dent in them.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Energy_Flow_US_2016.png)

That means, as we wean the world of fossil fuels, the final electricity consumption will increase correspondingly. The good thing is that electricity is a lot more efficient in most cases, so the efficiency losses will occur mostly in the electric production end (i.e. the efficiency of a solar panel is around 25% for current high end units). So yes, you are correct, assuming all of the ""Energy services"" in the above diagram were covered by electricity, we wouldn't need as much primary energy output as we currently do with less efficient fossil fuel-based turbines and generators.

However, some of the fossil fuels used by transportation and industrial applications could be replaced with electricity (EV's, induction furnaces instead of blast furnaces, etc.) but in some cases it's not going to be practical. In these cases, moving from fossil fuels to synthetic carbon neutral fuels will be necessary. And that process has a lot worse efficiency than just generating electricity, so that will probably offset the calculations towards the other end.

>So you agree that the power density and area required for solar is not a major problem? Good, that was my point.

In a fashion. It isn't *as much* of a problem as the production and maintenance volume required.

Wind power kind of suffers from similar issues, by the way, but it's a lot more forgiving in terms of surface area because wind power extracts energy from air currents, which are essentially convection from solar energy absorbed on a much larger area than the wind turbines themselves. Because of this, a single wind turbine can have average power of 1.67 MW; with solar power, that would require covering a square of about 175 x 175 metres with solar panels somewhere in the tropic. In terms of ""how many panels"", that comes up to 9,912 panels - let's say 10,000 panels (size 3.2 x 2.4 metres) for one wind turbine.

>Yes, 70B is a large number, but anything to do with the entire world's energy supply is going to be a large number, so it's a non-argument to just say ""gosh, that's a big number!""

The number itself is a problem because it represents a high unit number, and with high unit numbers come many issues.

10,000 panels is many panels to build, monitor, and maintain. One wind turbine is just one wind turbine.

Likewise, 1,000 wind turbines is many turbines to build, monitor, and maintain. One nuclear power plant is just one nuclear power plant.

It's not that I'm saying it's a problem just because it's a big number, but rather to illustrate problems of the scale of production required.

>Why is that a problem?

For example let's say there's a thousand factories (production lines, really, but let's call them factories) that produce these solar panels. They make one panel every 10 minutes, so in 10 minutes you get 1,000 new panels. In one hour you get 6,000 panels. In one day you get 144,000 panels, and in one year you get 52,560,000 panels. That's a lot of panels, isn't it?

So with this pace, to get to 70 billion units, it would take these 1000 factories running for 1,331 years to get up to the required amount.

For 10,000 factories, it would take 133 years to hit the target.

For 100,000 factories producing solar panels day and night, one unit per 10 minutes, we're getting to human-relevant time scale of 13 years and 4 months, but 100,000 factories doesn't honestly sound reasonable considering the amount of rare earth metals required for these solar panels. So let's assume the slightly less ludicrous 10,000 factories which *might* be doable.

But is it feasible to expect these factories to produce this many solar panels?

To answer that question we need to figure out how often a solar panel needs to be replaced.

First of all, current solar panels are built to work for 25-30 years. Let's give future tech a benefit of doubt and assume they can last for 50 years.

Secondly, failure rates among solar panels are currently around 5 failures per 10,000 units in a year.

Third, there's damage from external sources (sand storms, hailstorms, floods, exposure to extreme heat or cold, damage caused by animals, and of course vandalism).


The second factor is low enough that even with the full 70 billion units, you would ""only"" have to replace 35 million units every year (around 100,000 every day). If you somehow got to this point, you could keep up with this demand with only around 700 factories.

But the real problem is that once you have been producing these solar panels for 50 years, the first ones will need to start being replaced.

In 50 years, you can only produce up to 26.28 billion solar panels. But since you have to basically start replacing the first units at that point, it turns out you'll never be able to build more than that with only 10,000 factories.


So the amount of factories you need to pull this off depends on the ""expiration time"" of these solar panels, and of course the actual production rate that each factory can maintain. If they can make significantly more of these things than one every 10 minute, then you'd be fine. If you can make the solar panels last significantly longer, then it might be doable with ""only"" 10,000 factories.

But if the solar panel's life time is ""only"" 50 years per unit, then that means you need to be able to build the whole amount of 70 billion solar panels within that 50 years, after which you will need to keep those factories working forever to replace the units that are expiring.

For panels that are good for 50 years, and each factory producing one every 10 minutes, you'd need about 27 thousand factories.


By the way, wind power also suffers from similar issues because of the relatively high unit number compared to more centralized power plants - but not nearly to the same extent as solar does. Because of this, I think wind power has more potential than solar. Also producing the wind turbines doesn't produce as much harmful toxic waste.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit3

I agree. It's more of a way to split the numbers into more manageable pieces and to figure out exactly how much production capability you *would* need to fulfill the quota in a reasonable timeframe.

I don't think it's quite that simplistic. That's manufacturing capability measured in dollars, which doesn't really mean anything - it's just an economical estimate.

Besides the point, building solar panel manufacturing into an industry that covers 8.7% of global manufacturing capacity *within 30 years* is unlikely to be practicable.

Don't get me wrong, I'd be happy if I'm wrong if the production capabilities are much faster than I thought. In fact, that seems to be the case: In the year 2019, solar module production was 140 gigawatts of capacity (nominal capacity, as in ""this is the maximum power the panels can deliver in full daylight""). If we divide 140 GW by 54 watts per square meter (which was calculated as the effective average power of a solar panel in the tropic), we get the surface area of solar panels - and when we divide that surface area by the dimensions of ""standard solar panel"" I've been using, we get a figure of about 338 million units per year.

If you remember from my figures above with the completely arbitrary numbers, I estimated that 10,000 factories would produce about 526 million units. So in terms of production, I'm happy to learn that we are already now at the level of about 6,426 ""factories"", which was the arbitrary production unit that produces one reference solar panel in 10 minutes.

What this means is that with current production capability, the time to cover world's (current) electricity needs would be measured in hundreds of years. If we multiply the production capacity by ten, then the time would shrink by one order of magnitude, to tens of years.

To be exact, with current production capacity the 70 billion unit mark would be met in about 207 years.

So yeah, it's more feasible than I thought. Still a hell of a large amount of units that will need to be cleaned, serviced, maintained, replaced etc.

Would rather see roof top panels than covering vast amounts of land with them, though.

There are also other sides to this, such as the fact that we don't need to replace all current electricity production with solar because a bunch of it is already carbon-neutral.

And the fact that replacing fossil fuels with *everything non-fossil* would take a much shorter time than replacing them with *solar only*.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit3

[Citation Needed]

You might be right, you might be wrong, but ""I think that number is too big"" is not a compelling argument.  Without tying it to real-world data, ""I think"" is quantitatively meaningless.

To get a sense of what is possible in the real world, we can go back to car manufacturing, which increased from ~60M/yr in the early 2000s to ~100M/yr in the late 2010s.  That increase *alone* represents the total amount of manufacturing we're talking about needing for solar panels, and was built out in *15 years* just as part of business-as-usual.

Again, taking the abstract numbers and comparing them to real life contextualizes them and allows us to see their size relative to real-life capabilities.  In this case, building out that much manufacturing capacity for a single industry actually happened over the course of the last *15 years*, so it's clearly something that could feasibly happen again over the next *30 years*.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,1,0,reddit3
h7m7yw6,t1_h7luxbq,2021-08-03 23:57:41,science,"Solar panels are not as complex as cars, you're right about that. But just like cars, their production volume is directly affected by things like availability of the components and raw materials required to manufacture them.

Even if the demand for a product skyrockets, the supply has to keep up in order for actual production volume to increase in the same ratio. If demand increases more than supply, then the economic value of the production goes up, even if the actual production doesn't.

For example, the semiconductor shortage (caused by manufacturing issurs with increased demand) has caused a general shortage of computer components, and that has affected the production of not only things like computer CPUs and GPUs, but also seemingly unrelated products like cars, household appliances, and everything else that relies on semiconductor electronics becaise they are so dependent on computers.

Just like you have called my doubts into question, I would caution against simply assumimg that it's physically possible to increase production volume by some arbitrary amount. Economically, growth happens when demand increases. I could certainly see the demand of photovoltaic panels increasing ten, hundred, or even thousandfold in a short time as the climate catastrophe progresses. But increase of actual production depends on whether the production of raw materials and base components can keep up with the increased demand, and whether new production facilities can be built quickly enough.

The increase in car production you mentioned was about 67%. But solar panel industry would have to grow much faster: If I remember correctly, the kind of volume required for solar panels would be equivalent to 8.3% of the global manufacturing capacity (in terms of monetary value). How much is it now? I don't think it's currently anything close to 5.5% of global capacity, which is the same ratio as with car production increase you mentioned.

I don't think it's currently even half of a percent (though I vould be wrong). But almost certainly the relative growth required would far surpass the growth of auto industry.

With the kind of production increase you're talking about, I think it's more than likely that one or more of the base components in the supply chain would become a ""bottleneck"" that limits the entire industry's production capacity.",HerraTohtori,t2_dr1r0,1,0,reddit3

hxdk9or,t3_suw19d,2022-02-17 23:30:48,science,"I think this article is missing some useful nuance. As someone who works in this industry (and has worked on some clean energy initiatives within my company), I can tell you that we are in fact investing in cleaner initiatives. As this article states, however, the investments aren’t geared towards transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards renewables: they’re geared towards emergent technologies that could (hopefully!) reduce or potentially even eliminate atmospheric releases of ghg emissions from certain industrial sectors someday. For instance, one of the big initiatives right now is carbon capture/sequestration (in simple terms, creating a closed, cradle-to-grave system whereby fossil fuel emissions are stored underground in geologically suitable areas after combustion).

Of course, a ton of questions remain about how viable carbon capture actually is. My intention isn’t to defend this technology because I don't know if it (or something else) will or will not become more viable in the future than it is today. My intention is simply to point out that this article rather narrowly defines “clean energy initiatives” as “transitioning to renewables,” which overlooks actions a lot of companies are taking, whether one agrees with those actions or not.

I am not trying to suggest that greenwashing or other disingenuous messaging doesn’t also take place. It does. That said, I think articles such as this one that gloss over what companies are actually doing (and the discussions we all could/should be having about those things) aren’t much better.

As someone who's been deeply cold without shelter (more than once) - and thought a bit about it...
Insulate and warm people, over spaces: 
Using Germany as example: warming homes takes about 68% share of home energy use (average of about 7,000 kilowatthours per year) = 4760kWh / 365 days = 13kWh per day for heat. (1)This winter I've been using x2 (sometimes x3) USB 5v body-warmers: at almost no cost to run recharging x6 10,000mah power banks, x2 for each warmer (one charges while the other in use).

Electric body warmers and quick self-charging power banks are a real game changer:
The initial costs are only 15 Euros (for a basic warmer to 40 Euros for the good ones - similar costs for the power banks. Using them instead - my heating has only been on a few hours a week to dry washing and take the bite of the worst mornings: these warmers have me toasty the rest of the time, indoors (on low setting) and out (on medium or high): have been sat comfortably in subzero temp outside for hours no problem. Also don't need to put on and take off layers all the time - just press the button to change setting.

Now use less money on food too - as never hungry from cold (plus no illness at all last winter).We only need to warm the torso-body well - as our intelligent circulation system spreads heat around as needed: body-warmers are enough. They also allow arms and hands to be used as normal freely without bulky sleeves getting in the way - so fine for indoors and working ,with no sweaty pits (and it's a body drying heat too).

Best of all: at 0.1813 Euros per kilowatt-hour to recharge: (even with 80% efficiency) my x6 powerbanks (0.6 kwh) cost only 0.13 Euros per day - replacing my heating costs before of 2.35 Euros a day (or about x18 less) - saving 2.22 Euros I spent less than 200 Euros investment which returned in savings after only 90 days first few months use.

Swiched my supplier to renewable sourced and happy to suck up the extra costs - still paying way less over all, never cold and can sleep a little better at night not buying anywhere near as much fossel fuels.

i5km3sg,t3_suw19d,2022-04-21 03:21:21,science,"Up here, even our mainstream print news-media formally support Canada’s fossil fuel industry. Conglomerate Postmedia — which, except for The Toronto Star, owns Canada’s major print publications — is on record allying itself with not only the planet’s second most polluting forms of carbon-based “energy”, but also THE MOST polluting/dirtiest of crudes — bitumen. \[“Mair on Media’s ‘Unholiest of Alliances’ With Energy Industry”, Nov.14 2017, TheTyee.ca\]  
During a presentation, it was stated: *“Postmedia and CAPP \[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers\] will bring energy to the forefront of our national conversation. Together, we will engage executives, the business community and the Canadian public to underscore the ways in which the energy sector powers Canada.”*   
  
Also, a then-publisher of Postmedia’s National Post said: *“From its inception, the National Post has been one of the country’s leading voices on the importance of energy to Canada’s business competitiveness internationally and our economic well-being in general. We will work with \[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers\] to amplify our energy mandate and to be a part of the solution to keep Canada competitive in the global marketplace. The National Post will undertake to leverage all means editorially, technically and creatively to further this critical conversation.”*  
  
A few years ago, Postmedia also had acquired a lobbying firm with close ties to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney in order to participate in his government’s $30 million PR “war room” in promoting the interests of the fossil fuel industry in Canada. Furthermore, in late May, Postmedia refused to run paid ads by Leadnow, a social and environmental justice organization, that expose the Royal Bank of Canada as the largest financer of fossil fuel extraction in Canada.   
  
Really, should the promotion of massive fossil fuel extraction, even Canada’s own, be a partisan position for any newspaper giant to take, especially considering fossil fuel's immense role in manmade global warming thus climate change? And, at least in this case, whatever happened to the honorable journalistic role of ‘afflicting the comfortable’ (which went along with ‘comforting the afflicted’), especially one of such environmental monstrosity?  
  
How can this not be considered ethically-challenged journalism? Unless, of course, it has become so systematic thus normalized — i.e. the ethical (and sometimes even the moral) standard has been further lowered — that those who are aware of it, notably politicians and political writers, don’t bother publicly discussing it.",Professional_Mud_316,t2_90z50xcu,1,0,reddit4

natural gas and nuclear are the clear winners for clean energy. but when they say they want clean energy they really mean just electricity.

natural gas and nuclear power are way better than any alternative. but how do you Power everything else? electric cars are a long way for everyone, not enough range and super risky catching fire.

we could go back to steam power, you know burning wood or coal. even natural gas or propane.

so really what do you do about the energy? you can't just stop making oil and has hoping people would switch to something better. if that were possible that would already be done right? frickin Biden and the Left think that it can be done, maybe but not immediately!!

the best solution is hydrogen to replace gasoline. not hydrogen fuel cells, although it's okay. but hydrogen internal combustion engines. it's the perfect clean energy we can switch to, and it will never run out.

hxf30nc,t1_hxd4ypj,2022-02-18 07:07:14,science,"If anything, there should be more focus on creating more highly durable plastics to use for infrastructure and work towards eliminating the need for steel and steel mills, which is where a lot of pollution also comes from. You also don't need a lot of energy to create plastics, so arguing about plastics when it's discussing fossil fuels is a moot point.

You seem quite naive when it comes to material sciences. You'll never get rid of plastic or the use of oil. Polyol which is used in polyurethane is derived from oil. Polyurethane foam in your seat cushions, beds, insulation, pillows, etc. is all a thermoset plastic. Polyurethane is used for coatings on almost everything, like wood finishes and clear coats, also adhesives. Thermosets don't melt for reuse, it's meant to last a long time and can be repurposed in some cases. Polyurethane provides such great thermal resistant properties, protective properties, and durability that there's hardly anything in the world today that would be able to replace it. However, there's plenty of research going on utilizing plant-based polyol, but so far the product from plant-based polyol does not withstand the same structural integrity. I'm hoping it improves, but that's still far in the future. 

Then, on the other hand, you have polypropylene and polystyrene which are thermoplastics that can be melted and repurposed for new use. These are supposed to be taken to a recycling facility, sorted, and sent to be melted and reused. But instead, they are finding their way into our oceans and wildlife.",,,2,0,reddit4

We've run the numbers on these things a couple times in University and the conclusion is fairly simple: It's not realistic, no matter what, because it physically can not become efficient enough. 

The issue is that it needs energy. So, unless we have already transitioned away from fossil fuels as energy source, it can not capture enough carbon to justify it's existence, ever. Impossible, according to the known laws of physics.

Additionally, the energy efficiency of any Carbon Capture method we currently know, is below 1%. Which means, it's already vastly outclassed by the most realistic alternative, ignoring EVs: Hydrogen. While Hydrogen isn't ready for large scale, it's much further ahead than Carbon Capture and also physically possible, which is a great advantage.

On top of that, it means we need to produce more energy. But we need to reduce energy consumption, to reduce GHG output. So that's another Oxymoron.

There's an expectation that you can keep these systems running for 2x the engineered life of the equipment (40-60 years).  That's really hard when nearly every solution these days is obsolete in 5 years for one reason or another. It's worse when you have to deal with the insane legal and lobbying costs to get local governments on board (who exactly wants a chemical plant or a solar farm down the street?).

The biggest problems off the top of my head for alternative energy:

1) How are you going to get a consistent supply of it? Is whatever it is located near any sort of transit pipeline, or is it located somewhere to the left of the middle of nowhere? 

2) Is it sufficiently cheap to purchase raw materials on the market?

3) How well will whatever it is play with the existing energy supply systems? Can they even work together at all?

4) Where can I build it without everyone getting NIMBY about it?

5) Has anyone successfully done this at anywhere close to a profit before subsidies?

6) what's gonna happen when that specialty company we ordered all our parts from goes under because the solutions we are their only customer?

7) will the government funding go away when the other team starts with the political football in the next half?

8) Has anyone clearly and specifically defined success conditions that I can go to RFP with?

Just curious as the infra overhaul requires billions in infra, training, and public education PLUS a few decades. Net result being we make very little progress from an output perspective (most plans want to 1.5x the grid while replacing it with renewables). 

Additionally infra overhaul doesn’t actually get rid of the carbon in the sky already. That’s still a problem. 

Contrast with aggressive nuclear and carbon capture you don’t need to do much in the way of infra overhaul as everything plugs into existing infra, everyone trained to do what they do now can keep doing it, grid is greener and 10-100x output, and we deal with the carbon in the sky. 

Cost wise the aggressive nuclear is probably 10x more expensive, but the gains are 100x what you get with a simple green infra swap.

To date, less than 10% of plastics produced has been recycled. This ad campaign was backed by companies like Exxon and Chevron. It was much easier and cheaper to make plastic from raw materials vs recycling. They all knew this, they knew that recycling was not viable, but the ads told people to recycle yo save the environment.

Crucially, the energy to weight ratio of oil is incredibly high: oil has an energy density of ~11,700 watt hours per kilogram….. our best batteries top out at around 300wh/kg afaik. This energy density makes oil incredibly useful (essential, really) in applications like aviation and long-distance shipping where less dense energy resources offset most/all of the advantages of that transport medium in the first place. To do an intercontinental voyage with our best current battery technology, for example, would require a battery so large it takes up ~40% the cargo space on said ship.

I’m not trying to be an oil apologist here, but I do believe people who think the lack of transition to renewables is purely a matter of unwillingness have to overlook a lot of practical considerations to arrive at that conclusion.

Why does a nuclear build out (I assume more plants being built?) not require an infrastructure upgrade, while solar would when they are both just supplying electricity to an existing grid?

Also, if nuclear is 10x the cost, and the proposition is to build out nuclear as well as carbon capture, why couldn't you just increase the ammount of green energy capacity you install (so that capacity is greater than the 1.5x proposed) and install carbon capture as well?

It just seems like a poor argument to not do both I guess? Why not just install some nuclear and some green energy and some carbon capture?

Public charging stations are not advertised the same as gas stations with a very tall sign with prices that can be seen from a quarter mile away.  There is a heavy reliance on using the car's navigation or a smartphone to find stations.  If you wanted to find stations near you check (https://www.plugshare.com/). 

The big issue with EV adoption in the US is being able to charge using 240V at home.  I live in a single family home and was able to get my garage wired with 240V to allow for overnight recharging.  I only charge at a public station on road trips because I can start my day with full charge.  Charging at 120V in some cases can take much longer and can leave you waiting for a charge if your driving needs don't align well.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m fully onboard with changing our ways *yesterday*, but saying to the average American “hop on mass transit” is being ignorant of the fact that even a city of 160k people (like mine) has only limited bus service (they don’t even come out to where we live and they don’t run past 8pm) and no trains. 

We are mostly so spread out that it’s not practical for local governments to fund public transit improvements. Our city has had it on the ballot a few times and it always gets voted down. So our bus system had to cut routes and reduce hours. It’s literally impossible to take public transit where I live if you work anything other than a 9-5 job and live close-in. 

I’ve looked at electric cars because we do have a great amount of charging stations (west coast) but the cost isn’t in our range yet. We would need to sell both our cars to afford one ev. And again, without reliable public transit, that poses a problem for our family. I echo the comment “not everyone can afford a Tesla”. 

Now there are alternatives. We could sell our home and move to a city that has good public transit, but then we can’t afford housing. We’ve looked into adding solar panels, but where we live doesn’t get a ton of sun and the start up costs outweigh the benefits for us in our lifetimes. Panels here don’t produce a ton of energy because it’s cloudy most of the year.

So it’s this vicious circle we’re stuck in and many people want to do better but aren’t financially or geographically able.

Our first conundrum lies in the fact that developing nations NEED this resource to grow their economies fast, there’s no time to think about climate when they’re still solving hunger in Africa and India for example. So should these developing countries have to forgo their own development to appease a western mindset? After all, these western counties abused fossil fuels to get where they are now in the first place. 

Probably the 2nd one is the whole addiction to “renewable” energy as if that is our saving grace. The term itself is so muddy and so overused by politicians to appease to the climate change crowd. One small example, is that they consider biomass as renewable energy, but to get this biomass energy they burn tons and tons of wood. So yes, TECHNICALLY, wood is renewable since you can regrow it, but idk, if the goal is climate change why are you burning wood/trees of all things for your energy and call it renewable? They also use huge spaces to grow a certain type of tree that grows very fast and produces a lot of wood, so that they can burn it. Yes burn all that wood and the fumes go into the air, so that they can say “our country runs of 100% renewables” as a flex..

Third one is honestly the space, and wastage of these renewable sources. A single wind turbine, is extremely expensive environment wise, from the transportation of those huge metal pieces, assembly, manufacturing, maintenance, disassembly, all of that uses fossil fuel.

That is a disingenuous argument to make. Nuclear power plants are very energy-intensive in both construction and decommissioning. Not to mention that nuclear waste storage is also expensive to create and requires transporting to. And nuclear fuel generation is also not without it's own environmental impact.

As for cost, nuclear power plants are not usually profitable because of necessary regulations imposed upon them.

I'm not saying that nuclear power is inherently bad, but it's not a silver bullet for the energy generation and storage problem we are having and going to continue to have.

Edit: Also, PV panels seem to have a life expectancy of about 20-25 years, and after 3 years they trend to be carbon neutral.

We could have operated on that level 50 years ago. Maybe even 30 years ago. But even if we stopped ALL GHG emissions today, we'd at least look at a 1.5°C increase. At 2.0°C, the damage is irreversible and we know that we can only achieve 2°C is we pump the breaks today. But we just haven't.

But those are the people, most directly impacted by climate change.

hxeaaeu,t1_hxcr3mt,2022-02-18 02:43:40,science,"Well, you're never going to get there by spending any appreciable amount of time/focus on animal agriculture. 

As we can see, Agriculture (which includes animal husbandry and plant agriculture) make up about 10% of GHG. [https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) 

And I know, I know, the argument is going to be ""But the animals use plant ag, so really, all of GHG agricultural emissions are caused by animals!"" So, let's suppose that's true. We can eradicate ALL farmed animals. Completely wipe them off the face of the planet. Goodbye, farms that engage in permaculture and use animals to help put carbon back in the ground. Goodbye, cow sanctuaries that give cows a nice green pasture where they can chill all day. Goodbye, all house cats and most dogs, because the animal byproduct used to feed them is gone. Goodbye, leather, and goodbye, natural fabrics that are made from something that's NOT putting microplastics in the water.... 

It's not going to be enough. We will STILL need to reduce the actual contributors to GHG. 

The great thing about history, is that it's harder to lie. Do you know why the earth was in a cooling period, until the industrial era? Do you know why since the industrial era, our GHG emissions have gone up exponentially? 

It's not because there are more animals, because there is far fewer animal biomass than there was even 70 years ago. Even if we accept there are more GHG contributing animals, the number of animals is not increasing at an exponential level. And the cows have obviously not conspired together over multiple generations, to hold in their farts until the industrial era. 

So, what will reduce GHG? Our reliance on fossil fuels. 

The response to COVID led to an average of 11% reduction in GHG emissions [https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks)  

 ""The primary driver for the decrease was an 11 percent decrease in CO2  
 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. This decrease was primarily due   
to a 14 percent decrease in transportation emissions driven by decreased  
 demand due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."" 

This isn't even 0. SO many industries were kept open. But despite that, the pandemic caused a 11% decrease in CO2 emissions. That's fact. That's proof. If animals were the main contributer of GHG - we would barely see a blip in that data. But we don't.",shutupdavid0010,t2_3y475n3j,0,0,reddit4

The bigger difference imo is the switch off of FF -> 100% electric. So so so much infra right now is to support FFs. Why get rid of it? Octane is an *amazing* store or energy. It’s extremely dense, it’s very stable, and the energy it stores is super easy to access (compared to nuclear, very dense, can get unstable, *very* hard to get energy out). 

The only issue with Octane is it makes CO2, and drilling destroys the environment. That’s it. So we solve that by capturing the carbon, and using nuclear energy to turn it into fuel.

hxhxvea,t1_hxfc49w,2022-02-18 21:23:55,science,">The biggest area to improve is cut plastic use in disposable packaging and wrappers.

There is a lot more room for improvement. While packaging materials are ubiquitous, they are also thin and give us a lot room lower transport costs, due to weight.

A pretty good example for that are plastic bags. Reusable plastic bags are the equivalent of +200 throwaway bags, in emissions. It's even worse for cotton bags, those are like +3000 throwaway bags, in emissions. Logically, most people would be better off using throwaway bags, unless we force them to reuse those bags for years. So that calculation isn't easy or intuitive, whatsoever. And the dilemma is very similar in B2B, especially given the long transport routes, where weight and ease of use is much more vital.

I think, the most obvious steps are right to repair, a carbon tax and forcing companies to use more sustainable, long lasting plastics or plastic alternatives, with financial incentives and longer, mandated support-windows, like we see in B2B. Let them figure out the cost-benefit calculation, capitalism works pretty well in that regard, compared to regulatory government. Copying a more efficient regulatory system, like the EU, might also make sense in some scenarios. And then start putting that stuff in trade-agreements, forcing the rest of the world to adopt these standards, if they want access to the more profitable Western markets.

Beyond that, we need massive amounts of investments from us, us rich people, the global top \~30%. Poorer countries just *can't* switch to better, more expensive alternatives, bc they can not shoulder the up-front investments.",Original-Aerie8,t2_aj983wd1,1,0,reddit4

Of course there is a lot to work out here, and nobody is claiming this can stop all atmospheric emissions releases from power and industrial facilities, but in industry-dense areas, there are enough emissions that this could potentially work, depending on nearby geology.

What we are trying to find out is how viable this actually is, and what would need to change to make it more viable.

The other problem is one of timescales and basic economics.  What if you are a crane company and a new battery powered crane comes on the market?  Will you immediately replace your tens of millions of dollars of heavy equipment with the new stuff?  Probably not, you can't afford that.  You would also need to upgrade your yard with a battery charging facility, probably needing a significant utility service upgrade which might require additional infrastructure on your local grid.  It will be a piecemeal investment timed when working equipment becomes obsolete or regulations require it.  With enough incentives and everyone working together it will happen but its not like we will do it tomorrow.

I work in the electric utility industry and power generation is definitely not a solved problem.  We don't have the ability to build enough batteries and renewable power and the grid to support it fast enough.  This decade will be a lot of grid investment and research into new ways to get dispatchable power.  Hydrogen through electrolysis with otherwise curtailed nuclear or renewables is looking to be a likely option, we can store it and burn it in existing gas turbines.  Maybe small modular nuclear will really take off.  Maybe we will develop a new battery tech that we can widely deploy cheaply.  Any of these are still at least a decade away from noticeable implementation.

Also not to mention keeping your power on in the meantime, that isn't trivial and it's not like we have unlimited time and money to develop this stuff.

My local glacially-fed river system (the Saskatchewan River System), which supplies water to over half of the Canadian Prairies, is highly susceptible to reduced snowpack. It may be well within my lifetime if current trends continue, and already some years I can't go canoeing on it half as often as I did as a child. If a drastic reduction in global warming doesn't happen, Edmonton may see water use restrictions in order to ensure enough water makes it to Saskatchewan.

As to public opinion, follow the money. If those that own the propaganda machines change their tune, which is something I cannot control and therefore cannot waste precious thought on, then the political will to make drastic changes will flip.

Meanwhile, geologists and paleoclimate researchers tried to understand when Earth slipped into and out of ice ages, and why. An enduring popular myth suggests that in the 1970s the climate science community was predicting “global cooling” and an “imminent” ice age, an observation frequently used by those who would undermine what climate scientists say today about the prospect of global warming. A review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth's climate on human time scales.

Methane can be further turned into heavier fuels trough other proven processes that aren't generally in use because going the other way is cheaper. It is easier to modify engines to run on methane than it is to replace the current transport fleet before it's expiration date.

Synfuels made in this way are in fact carbon neutral. If you don't want synfuels, you can also just pull CO2 out of the atmosphere for storage. just convert it into something that isn't a gas first, so that it stays locked down passively.

 Long term we do want to switch over completely to efficient electric vehicles and electrified trains, but that takes time. a lot of time, infrastructure might be maintained regularly, but outright technology shifts costs more than base maintenance.

Don't know about where you live, but these billion dollar plus infrastructure projects to replace entire sections of infrastructure are hard to get approval and funding for.

There are no barriers to enhancing output from biofuels with this method. Biofuel from agri waste and garbage is a no brainer from the start, and this is being worked on.

I agree that using pumped hydro should be the first choice for load following/grid balancing, but we live in a world where this is not always a feasible option unfortunately. not to mention nuclear works much better combined with it than solar and wind will ever do.  

Even so, synfuels are for vehicles, not load following, and it is in fact a perfect use of excess energy from nuclear plants. The cost of load following vs just running flat out are practically the same. nuclear uses so little fuel that it makes no difference for the plant operational costs.

I do disagree with you on using less energy. That is not going to happen, because nobody is going to accept living in energy poverty, so we either try to work around it by making plentiful cheap energy trough nuclear, or we fail decarbonizing.

Half-hour car rides there can be done in 10 minutes using public transportation, more comfortably (subways are smooth rides compared to cars which can run into bumps) and better temperature controlled than using a car (you cannot control the temperature of your car before you get in).

You don't need to pre-research the route there either because the system is more intuitive and better mapped out. It's specifically designed so that even small children are able to navigate public transport with no help. 

I like cars but they start to have less use in highly populated areas that fund a fancy public transportation system (European and North American cities do not have a high enough population density to make extensive public transport worth it).

Cars are necessary in cities that contain houses in their suburban areas since there wouldn't make sense to have subways or buses running beside everyone's home. Some cities like Toronto attempt it but it costs a lot of money per capita to even build a poor quality, understaffed one that hobos can get into because there just aren't enough people on the bus routes. When there are only thousands of people using it, either they'd have to each pay $1000 to use the bus or else the system is going to be a money pit.

That's incorrect. Coal would be to common feedstock, meaning that you'd dig up coal and pull the carbon into a gas for burning, instead of burning the coal directly. That's objectively worse for the environment than what we currently do.

>It is easier to modify engines to run on methane than it is to replace the current transport fleet before it's expiration date.

You keep cherry picking. You'd first have to build up an entire economic sector for the production of these gases, which would be obsolete in 30 years, tops. That's nothing but a waste of money.

>Synfuels made in this way are in fact carbon neutral.

It's just not. The reaction is balanced and that's it. You are still digging up the materials and blowing CO2 into the atmosphere.

>you can also just pull CO2 out of the atmosphere for storage

Again, you make claims that aren't based in reality. How much energy does that cost? Right, it's extremely inefficient and adds to our pollution, because of that. Planting trees would be smarter and still way too inefficient to put a dent in our current CO2 output.

>infrastructure might be maintained regularly, but outright technology shifts costs more than base maintenance.

But you are not suggesting base maintenance. You are talking about a technology shift, but one that is inefficient and wasteful, compared to just directly investing it into EVs.

>Don't know about where you live, but these billion dollar plus infrastructure projects to replace entire sections of infrastructure are hard to get approval and funding for.

So, instead, do something that is objectively worse? Really? How did we build a energy grid, roads and so on, in the first place? You are effectively just feeding a political trope, used by conservatives.

>but we live in a world where this is not always a feasible option unfortunately

? You can't dig holes, but you want to produce fuels at low efficiency rates?

You claim you don't have enough water for pumping it up a hill, but you want to run a nuclear reactor, which generates electricity with steam turbines?

>not to mention nuclear works much better combined with it than solar and wind will ever do.

\[citation needed\]

>Even so, synfuels are for vehicles, not load following, and it is in fact a perfect use of excess energy from nuclear plants.

You claiming that, doesn't make it correct.

>nuclear uses so little fuel that it makes no difference for the plant operational costs.

Stop cherry picking. When the construction of the plant itself is a massive producer of pollution and cost and can only operate for a limited amount of time, you can not disregard that with ""but the fuel is cheap"". It's not a infinite energy hack, just because you only focus on one factor of the equations.

>I do disagree with you on using less energy.

Well, that's the overwhelming consensus of experts. It's a crackpot theory to suggest otherwise.

>That is not going to happen,

Great. Then we can't slow down climate change. Discussion over, we are fucked. Thanks for the conversation.

>nobody is going to accept living in energy poverty

80% of the globe already does. You are the king, complaining about not getting enough cake, while the general population won't get enough to eat.

>Or do you prefer people freezing to death because there aren't enough power to keep the heat on during a cold snap?

Heating is not a significant factor for pollution. Producing and recycling heat is easy and cheap. Producing electricity and fuel is expensive and hard, which is why it should be rationed. That's why your suggestions are so bad, because you ignore efficiency on the basis of ""nuclear is cheap"", when it just isn't.

>Riots in the streets as people go hungry because food is rotting away on the regular when refrigerated stores of food spoil due to brownouts ?

What are you even talking about? The energy used for refrigeration is barely enough to produce 1/50th of our meat. If you want to talk about food, talk about relevant aspects of it.

Also, are you suggesting that we should rather heat up the planet to a point, where we loose most of our agricultural land?

>I live far north, and solar in the winter has a capacity factor of 0.

Damn, you ignorance is soo painful. Why do you try to lecture people, when you don't even know the absolute basics of the tech?

>The wind stops blowing when the cold sets in too. It's how weather works after all.

Sweden, a country that is significantly colder than any US state, is set to produce 30% of it's energy with wind alone, in 2 years.

>I don't want to deforest my own to stay warm in the winter.

hxq4f6n,t1_hxoqrt8,2022-02-20 17:25:53,science,"I think you might be misinterpreting me. I know that money is essentially a collection of binary code spread across various mainframes, that it doesn’t have any value in itself, that it’s just paper, that it is easily manipulated to the point of absurdity, and that it only works because we as a society have faith in its ability to store value and have agreed upon it as a medium of exchange. 

All of that can be true and money can still be real, albeit abstracted from the value (and yes, oftentimes the lack of value or worse) that it represents. I don’t mean real in the sense that it would continue to have value in some way if there was some global catastrophe - I mean that it is real because it ostensibly represents value, and that we all accept it as an effective medium of exchange. There are a lot of things that are real in the sense that their “realness” or value exists only because we have collectively agreed upon it. That’s how a lot of modern society works. 

With money, the consequences are dire when things happen that destroy its efficacy as a representation of value, but I currently don’t see a better solution in today’s world. We need to have a way to easily transmit the representation of our labor, our property, our knowledge, etc, and fiat currency backed by (mostly) stable, powerful economies/governments is the best way to do that, currently, as far as I can tell. Any other system you can come up with, aside from a straight up barter economy, would still have to rely upon some sort of fiat currency, both because non-fiat currencies are impractical and outmoded, and because even currencies backed by things that are ostensibly inherently valuable (like gold) wouldn’t be immune to the same issues that can occur with fiat currency. You could theoretically limit the circulation of a backed currency such that the supply never exceeds the value of whatever is backing it, but that would probably lead to a stagnant economy, and would probably be impossible to actually pull off; more currency would end up in circulation than whatever is backing it, leading to either a devaluation of the [gold] or shenanigans with the currency. This is leaving aside the fact that, should something happen that was bad enough to make, say, the US dollar worthless, people probably wouldn’t be much interested in gold as a medium of exchange either.",timn1717,t2_11ickx,1,0,reddit4

In short, assume some service or utility X previously could be attained by investing Y units of some resource (time, money, fuel, electricity etc). Then a technological breakthrough happens, and that same utility X is now attainable with Z units of the same resource, where Z<Y. So should we expect the aggregate consumption of that resource to decrease? Jevons paradox says that is not necessarily the case. Individual consumers may now elect to consume more utility since it is cheaper. The classical example is fuel efficient combustion engines. These led to that people drove more, so aggregate fuel consumption was little affected, maybe even increased.

Ok, this takes us to the subject of the article. Uber and Lyft have made transportation within San Francisco easier and more economic efficient than before. As a consequence more people buys more transport utility. Hence, the more efficient way to provide transport utility to the urban dwellers leads to more consumption, and traffic increases.

As an empirical study this is interesting and useful to know. What policy corrective, if any, that should follow isn't obvious. The increased consumption of transport utility must be adding something to somebody. What are the benefits? In the absence of this more efficient transportation service, what other things would be worse off? Maybe young people would be less able to live farther away from work?

I think that the companies would be wise to require that the driver go to the next free 'no parking' area or parking spot. Yes, you would have to walk 100-300ft, but it would reduce traffic for ALL, and Sharon has to walk a tiny bit.

If the companies do not do this, people will complain, and then it will be enforced by the law & why they are already at this stage, why not add on some regulatory costs on top of that?

I'm not convinced this is a benefit of having Uber. Sure, not having a car is great, but you're not really doing any environmental justice by not having a car if your personal trips are just replaced by Uber trips.

If I want to get to work, without ride share, I will drive, walk, bike, transit, whatever. All of those options are as good as or better than ride share on the average trip (riding alone). If it's a trip I do not need to take, I might actually just opt to not go if I decide that the travel effort isn't worth it.

With ride share, I still get to work by car. It's no better than my previous alternatives. I may choose to take trips I might have skipped because the effort was too high - it's just too convenient to hail a ride. On top of that, the driver is *at best* picking 3 other people up with me and taking us to the same location. That cuts the carbon footprint of that trip by 75%. Had I gotten there any other way, except for driving alone, the other options would likely be even better than that.

\- There is literally zero personal enrichment, growth, sense of accomplishment or other job satisfaction in being an Uber/Lyft driver. It is a thankless, robotic task with no opportunity for advancement, pay raise etc.

\- All rideshare companies have made it clear that autonomous cars are the not-so-distant future of ridesharing. If you're a driver, you're living on borrowed time. It is a job with no future.

Thats because people are selfie as a whole. Especially if its super convenient for them to call a uber/lyft from the inside of the bar/restaurant/home and just wait for it to pull up before exiting. The mentality of ""well if i dont use is, someone else will, and there still wont be a different"" 

And in my opinion the main cause for heavier traffic from ride shares is, the manner and/or time of drop-off/pickups

DOUBLE PARKING TO PICK UP OR DROP-OFF: there has been multiple studies done how traffic keeps a ""memory"" and just one car on a busy free flowing highway can cause a noticeable delay just from stopping for a few seconds. Let alone having uber/lyft drivers wait double parked out front for you to walk out. Which can take alot longer then a few seconds

INEXPERIENCED DRIVERS, OR UNAWARE DRIVERS: the way ride shares use to guide drivers to locations promotes bad driving itself. On a empty street its not a big deal. But on a busy street, staying in the left lane untill the last moment before a turn-off to cross 3 lanes, causes ripple effect of slow traffic behind it. There's a difference in travel time from someone who knows the route to someone who has never taken it before (even on the same exact route). But this is also a effect of just gps in general. I am in no way against gps guidance, im just saying it promotes bad driving.

A more comprehensive study needs to be done with transportation scientists that observe the whole model of how people are moving and what effects ride share does to the entire system (including parking, public transit, etc).

The reality is that more humans are getting to where they want to go, quicker on net average.

People in cars are getting there slower, but for some of us who use public transit, we *know* that ridesharing can often take 1/3rd or less time compared. As anecdote, my commute to work via train and bus takes 45 minutes door-to-door on a good day and 95 minutes when there's been any kind of disruption (which happens *at least* once a week, but recently has been happening up to three times a week - hurray Caltrain construction). Ridesharing the same route usually takes 25 minutes.

But at the end of it, it comes down to investment; if cities see this as a problem, they need to come up with realistic solutions. E.g. Norway has point-to-point buses rather than fixed bus routes - that kind of system would work wonders in a city like San Francisco where you frequently have to make tightly timed connections in order to get to where you're going.",hackingdreams,t2_3xprh,34,0,reddit1

It isn't until about you 27th year (of a 30 year mortgage) that 90% of your monthly payment is still technically hers.  For the first 17 years less than half of your monthly payment goes towards the principal with the rest going towards interest.  Around year 27 it hits the 90% mark.

&#x200B;

And that is just the mortgage part of the payment.  Her monthly probably payment also includes real estate tax and insurance bringing what part of that $500 she ""keeps"" down a whole bunch.  Add in the fees she'll pay when she sells the place.  It takes about 5 to 10 years of home ownership (in a single home) before you would break even.  Every time you sell and buy a new home you (mostly) start over too since the selling fees are per home.

1. Call a taxi for to pick you up. Good luck, they’ll say someone is in the way but if someone flags them down on the way they just won’t come to you or call and cancel. So you just sit there waiting.

2. You pay Uber directly and drivers are supposed to follow the gps route provided. So this cuts out two of them major taxi scams 1. Taking the long way 2. Not starting the meter then trying to over charge. In my town these scam happen more often then not.

3. Busy time like New Year’s Eve taxis were impossible. Because of the leak time pricing you can actually get an Uber during these times now. Will cost more but at least you aren’t stranded

4. You rate the driver. I think less than three stars on average and they are fired. So they are nicer, cars are cleaner, and they drive safer.

emwbe6t,t1_emw6bm0,2019-05-09 06:04:29,science,"That is only marginally better as a measure. You still have the problem that the boundaries of a city, like those of a county, are not set in a uniform way based on the structure of the urban aggregate. They are political boundaries, and you can have two comparable urban areas A and B, where the “city of A” includes only the dense urban core, while the “city of B” covers a vast territory including some semi-rural areas.

Secondly, it is hard to summarize the structure of a city in a single number which averages the density across the entire area. You can (and do) have cities with a large mid-density area, but almost no high-density, while others have a significant high-density core surrounded by rings of decreasing density. These distributions produce very different circumstances in practice, even if the average comes out similar.

But I think the most important point is that we need to distinguish between population density and building density. Take a block of one-bedroom apartments, each inhabited by one person. Now imagine each tenant gets a roommate who sleeps in the living room. You have _doubled_ the population density, but the building density has not changed at all!

And that’s exactly what you see in San Francisco. You have adults with good jobs living with three roommates in a two-bedroom apartment. New Yorkers complain about rents and small apartments, but SF is worse. And you can’t measure that with population density; you’d need a different measure, perhaps the average apartment size divided by the number of occupants.

tl;dr: most of San Francisco is actually built at a rather low density, but those buildings are crammed full of people.",Shin-LaC,t2_52xad,1,0,reddit1

Also, Germany has non-privatized subways, and they manage to be quite cheap (probably cheaper than Japanese ones in fact).  In Munich, a 3-day pass costs about $15.

I'm black and I have been working in Law Enforcement for more than 20 years and I have noticed a general difference in policing strategy between white and non-white officers. But like everything else, it's not as simple as race.

While not in the least bit scientific, I've known really aggressive black officers, and more lenient white officers, and in general, where they were raised was important. Black officers I've known who were raised in white areas tended to police like white officers, and white guys I know who grew up in more mixed areas tended to be more like 'us' (ie, ""don't sweat the small stuff/ whatever it's just weed"" etc).

So maybe white/majoritarian 'culture' in this country is simply more authority-centric than minority cultures are. People take their upbringing into everything they do, and police work is no different.

The very nature of intoxicants is that they create their own demand. When opioids hit the legal market in the US and became accessible to anyone with a clinic in their town we saw a massive spike in use, leading to considerable rises in addiction and violent crime that lasted almost a decade. There is also conclusive evidence showing states that legalized recreational marijuana all saw increases in the number of first time marijuana users. These states have also each seen a rise in the regularity of marijuana use.

For example, doing any amount of time for drug possession is a black mark that hinders employment. Doesn't matter the circumstances surrounding it. That just further perpetuates a cycle of crime and drug abuse because there's few options. Of course there's more that's going to be necessary for success to come from it lime better rehab programs and proper set up. We have other issues that need solved in America especially with the rampant corruption. But the idea itself is sound, the logic is sound, and it does work on a small scale.

At the end of the day, at the end of the day, I am given the impression that graduate students are forced to ""overcompete"" with each other which leads losers to be overqualified because they are forced to find jobs related to their dream positions but don't necessarily require all that expertise.  Attach the stigma that those who take those jobs will quickly leave as soon as a better opportunity opens up, and you have a recipe for a lost-lost cause for many outgoing graduates nowadays.

But I remember my boss saying to me that P.I.s need to start taking birth control.  That they're training and overtraining students for jobs that just aren't there.  I get the idea that science should be choosing the best and the brightest, but that doesn't fix the main problem: 1 dozen best and bright candidates, 1 position.

What do you think about this birth control idea?  Given that many tenureship applications and other university obligations force the academic pipeline to remain flowing, would you think that this could be a reasonable fix if universities were to shift paradigms and essentially implement more rigid quotas on incoming graduates?  I think this might shock many labs who rely on student research, but if it will essentially improve employment prospects for newly-qualified researchers, would this be a reasonable solution?",feedmahfish,t2_6g43u,25,0,reddit3

dg36cpm,t1_dg2hpam,2017-04-10 20:00:59,science,"Yes, there is some truth to this, but there is also some evidence that this is a conditional relationship. Past research has shown that when employees perceive themselves as overqualified, they are more likely to search for a new job. Those who are objectively overeducated for their jobs also are likely to change jobs more quickly. Finally, there is a positive correlation between perceived overqualification and turnover intentions. This could be because they are bored but also because they have the qualifications to actually leave.

My own research as well as that of others also has shown that there are conditions under which feelings of overqualification do not translate into higher turnover. For example, in a study conducted in a retail setting, we found that empowerment plays the role of a buffer. When employees have autonomy, and when they feel that they have the ability to influence their work environment (rather than being expected to take a passive, cog-in-a-machine approach to work), their turnover rate is no different from others. So ultimately it may come down to how companies treat their workers rather than their qualifications when they decide whether to stay or leave. ",Berrin_Erdogan,t2_16xyib,28,0,reddit3

This is an interesting question – I am not sure if there is an objective reality of being overqualified. There are more objective looking metrics to be sure. For example, those in labor economics and education literatures often look at the difference between one’s education level and education level required by the job. These metrics assume that everyone at the same education level is equally qualified (disregarding differences in content and quality of education) and also assume that everyone holding the same job title ends up performing the exact same duties. 

Self ratings and other ratings of overqualification have moderate overlap. For example, in an ongoing project, my research team found a correlation of .35 between self ratings and coworker ratings of overqualification. Personality traits play a role (including narcissism), but also the individual may be in a good position to see their own skills and job demands as well. I would say that each metric has its place in the study of overqualification, with self ratings being more important to predicting job attitudes and turnover, and other ratings predicting selection decisions, performance ratings, and other people’s reactions toward the focal person.

What we know is that receiving emotional and social support from friends and family matters. Negative effects on job attitudes often can be buffered via job autonomy and having a high-quality work relationship with your manager.

dg2radn,t1_dg2ny1a,2017-04-10 15:35:11,science,"Unfinished PhD here, also worked many years as a lecturer. When my Masters initially went belly up I worked for a while full time in cafes. Then part time during some of the PhD. Then, when  my health took a turn for the worse and my sick leave ran out, worked in cafes again until even that proved difficult health wise. Now chronically ill, on disability pension, no formal employment. Not as qualified as you, but I'm very familiar with the existential terrain.

At first, it was extremely demoralising not being able to pursue my interests and do the work I was allegedly trained to do. It helps if you have a supportive, stable family situation even if your finances are in trouble. I didn't. Seriously, I think a lot of people should consider psychological counselling at this point, or take solace in religion, or whatever it takes not to have a full-blown crack up. Pro-tip: avoid excessive use alcohol or drugs at this precarious stage.

The second challenge was that the hospitality work required a lot of physical effort, and the unfamiliar routines were at first mentally taxing too. It doesn't help that you feel stupid for not being able to remember the price of a sandwich or latte or whatever, and your colleagues may even go out of their way to treat you like an idiot. Some may resent your previous education or work background, that's just a fact of life in these cases. You will probably feel your brain atrophy in the first few months, thanks to the repetitive tasks and lack of stimulation of the kind you are used to. 

I want to say: keep reading books and articles in your field, keep talking to your former colleagues, keep thinking about your interests every opportunity you can get. (Weekends etc.) But in the beginning, depending on how taxing your hospitality job happens to be, you may not have enough energy left over.

Fortunately, if you manage to look after your physical and mental health during this time, that doesn't last forever. Eventually your new job will become more routine and automatic, and as a result less mentally taxing. It might be physically tiring still, but even that  will improve as you become more physically fit from all the standing. Working as a barista in a busy cafe, my arms got a lot stronger too; so your body adjusts within limits. Some of the customers you meet actually enjoy being served by someone with a bit of cultural or educational capital, they find it flattering to their sense of their own education. Use this to your advantage in your new career. If your bosses are smart, they'll know that it's a drawcard that you have which other employees might not. You might even get promoted, or have your pay increased, for this reason.

Nevertheless: as soon as you can, energy levels permitting, turn your former career into a hobby. You'll still feel wistful about not being able to take it further (in the immediate term), but it's best not to indulge that feeling. Banish any thoughts of status anxiety, nevertheless. It doesn't help.

My own predicament is obviously a lot ""worse"" than many, in that I may never return to academia on account of my health. (I was in a field with no commercial applications, so academia was my only real option.) However, I've really managed to turn things around existentially. Within the limits afforded by my health, I now do research from home that is related to the field in which I used to operate. It's more as a hobbyist, and not quite as intensive or demanding as writing my dissertation, but I'm having a great time with it. It's even liberating being able to dabble, and switch focus from time to time, working on smaller projects without worrying about deadlines. I even started a blog, where I put up my work. Truth be known, I have actually improved my *knowledge of the field* in some key areas, now that I'm not so myopically focused on my narrow PhD topic. Some the *skills* related to my field have also improved, as I look over the work I did years ago and spot mistakes that wouldn't have occurred to me previously. 

Now that I've been forced out of the Ivory Tower, I'm even taking an interest in the knowledge gap between experts in my field, and interested lay people. I get on social media and meet laypeople, get heckled by their questions, and embrace the challenge of closing the knowledge gap. (That's really how the blog began.) I'm still in contact with some of my former colleagues, including one of my thesis supervisors. There's plenty to talk about in this regard.

Finally, you have to admit, there are a lot of downsides to academic life. The career track isn't always that wonderful. The deadlines, publish or perish, the politics, the compromises, the hours. It's pretty sweet being liberated from such things. ",grass_skirt,t2_8amdu,5,0,reddit3

The main risk when hiring a clearly overqualified person is that they will simply see this job as a stepping stone and will leave quickly. At the same time, they often have skills that are beneficial to the company. So the question is, whether the person has a good reason for wanting this job, whether the job can be expanded to absorb some of the skills of the person, how costly turnover is, and whether the person can make contributions to the company even if they are more mobile.

We call this “relative deprivation.” Even though the job is objectively not bad, it is beneath the skill levels and qualifications of the employee. Giving the example of education, going to college creates expectations regarding what type of a job the person will have upon graduation with respect to status, salary, work environment etc. If the person ends up at a lower level position, they are thinking that they are deprived of something they should have had. It has negative consequences for well being, and health. 

For the hiring organization, you get more skills, but someone who is more of a flight risk. Whether this is a problem depends on a number of things. My own research showed the degree to which the person is given autonomy, the degree to which the person fits the company culture, the degree to which the person will work with other overqualified employees (rather than being the token overqualified person) all matter.

At the same time, the overqualification that results from skills inflation is not as detrimental to the well being of the person because the employee ends up working with similarly credentialed individuals (even when it is still overqualification, the feeling that you are not the only person in that situation seems to act as a buffer).

Labor economists argue that overqualification (mostly in the form of overeducation) can be a stepping stone for a better job, or it could be a trap that is hard to get out of. I am familiar with more research supporting the second perspective. Even when overqualified people change jobs, their next position may not be a better match. If there are advancement opportunities within the same company where you can demonstrate your skills and contributions, that would likely be ideal. If you are sure this position would be temporary, you would also need a way of keeping your skills fresh. Pursuing additional certification or volunteer opportunities where you still have the ability to develop and keep your skills current could be useful in your next job hunt.

Nonetheless I'm bored all day and its sometimes very hard to motivate myself.  

I always wait until the deadline is putting me under pressure and then i complete everything in a few days. Its not easy. The customer wants it cheap and my boss does want to earn money.

These genes have been conserved over billions of years because they are extremely important for life. Homologues in cyanobacteria show that these clock genes have been conserved for more than 2 billion years.

For early life, the intimate link between the circadian clock and the cell cycle was very important--the ability of microorganisms to replicate their DNA during the night, in the absence of damaging ultraviolet light, offered a considerable advantage.

As we have retained this system over billions of years in a highly conserved manner, it is not surprising that extreme disruption in the circadian clock caused by long term irregular sleeping/night shifts leads to an increase in the risk of cancer and mental health disorders.",,,2,0,reddit4

Those would be 2 VERY different implications. For example. If we see that a user will go from working 50 hours a week at their job, to working 40 hours and then committing 10 hours into developing a skill or starting a side business. 

THEN i think you can say that your headline has at least a little merit. But if they just sit on ass after not committing more to work then it could be just a general impact on motivation which has other issues and shouldn't just be tied to your job.

The abstract mentions that: ""After adjusting for sociodemographics and other substance use, a significant negative association is found between employees’ lifetime psilocybin use and the amount of overtime they reported working. Specifically, the findings suggest that lifetime psilocybin use in the U.S. full-time working population is associated with an estimated 44,348,400 fewer overtime hours worked per year and may help explain recent findings linking employees’ lifetime psilocybin use to a reduction in sick leave taken.""

So the theoretical basis for the study was further exploration of previous findings that psilocybin use is linked to reduction in sick leave.

Read the article carefully, paying attention to the selective quotes of the researcher and all the anecdotal fluff inserted by the article's author.

The study itself appears to be normative when evaluated by the abstract; it is the article that is a problem.

k2bzsz5,t3_16skse0,2023-09-26 20:13:28,science,">Quiet quitting refers to a phenomenon where employees, particularly in the United States, increasingly prioritize work-life balance over excessive workplace engagement. Instead of going above and beyond their job duties, these employees simply fulfill their basic responsibilities and are often reluctant to work overtime.

I'm sorry did they just expand the meaning to quiet quitting? I kind of thought that was just people who just decided they were going to bounce at lunch/break or never come to work one day?

Many of us before/after mushrooms, I assume just want a real work/life balance in our lives. I think more importantly most of us are realizing, working 40+ hours each week and hoping on retirement to kick back and relax are the days of old. Not to mention who really wants to work until they are 68 to retire when they won't be able to really enjoy it? 

During the wind down phase from a trip, it would not be illogical to think the person who was working 60 hours a week to stop and think about their entire future and scale back on working so many extra hours, so they can enjoy living in the now time.",deadsoulinside,t2_7xjzv,1,0,reddit1

k2coz0o,t3_16skse0,2023-09-26 22:45:29,science,"This bit jumped out at me...

> On average, psilocybin users clocked about 3.60 minutes less of overtime per week. While this may not seem like much on an individual level, when you multiply it by the estimated 15 million full-time workers in the U.S. who have used psychedelic mushrooms, it adds up to 44 million fewer overtime hours worked per year.

3.6 minutes times 15 million workers is 900,000 hours a week, or 46.8 million hours a year, so the math is off already.  That said, most full time workers *don't* actually work overtime.

https://time.com/6168310/overtime-pay-history/

> According to a 2019 Gallup Poll, 52 percent of full-time workers report working more than 40 hours a week; 39 percent work at least 50 hours a week, and 18 percent work at least 60. Yet few of these workers are paid a penny of overtime for all the extra hours they put it in on the job. Overtime pay is no longer the norm.

> According to Gallup, full-time workers report working an average of 47 hours a week.

So 48% don't work overtime.  Of the rest, that includes those who aren't paid for overtime at all.

Setting that aside, the average is an extra 7 hours of overtime a week - 420 minutes.  That translates to a decrease of less than one percent - 0.86% - overtime hours worked.  Given how hard they're having to bend to make it sound awful, this article just reeks of anti-psychedelic propaganda.

I can tell you from being on both ends of this, when management gives you new responsibilities, it's because management wants to make the same amount of money they currently do for doing less, by passing the work to you. It's not a career opportunity. They are not going to like you more, and if they need to let you go they are still going to do it.

Do what you were hired to do. If they want more they can put it in the job description and negotiate wages based on that.",,,1,0,reddit1

People love Work At Home now, but the truth is once the capitalist dinosaurs get in gear, they're gonna optimize all of that 'value' out of the arrangement for themselves. 

1. less managers, relying on software to manage the employees
2. Nationwide, or even international competition for positions, you no longer need to search solely locally.
3. a move to an ""on-call"" model because your workers are always moments away from their workstation.

And that's just the obvious stuff. Capitalists aren't satisfied with their workers getting an equitable share of the value their labor produces, they're only satisfied if they're getting absolutely every single penny for themselves. Their ideal balance sheet would involve slavery with $0's in every labor category for maximum profits.

You’re getting a positive result from your use but that can turn on you very quickly. No judgement on my part, just experienced recommendation - use psych’s therapeutically if you find it’s helpful, and give yourself long periods between doses to maximize its effectiveness and prevent adverse reactions. 

Anything can become addicting - people say shrooms aren’t addictive but they definitely can be if the effect is powerful enough. The problem is psychedelics lose their effectiveness very quickly with repeated use and any substance that alters your reality can have ill effects on your long term health. 

I love psylocibin and will always advocate for it, but i treat it like a medicine used in a very particular way. 

No judgement here! just a very experienced psych dabbler giving you my advice.  The good thing is mushrooms are extremely safe from a toxicity level,  that being said a bad trip can change your life.  

In addition to substances, make sure you’re doing conservative measures for your mental health: good nutrition, physical activity and strong social supports are your best friend.

All that sounds pretty ideal when in university with a demanding schedule.

It did. This is the percentage of people, aged 19 - 30, who used a hallucinogen other than LSD, in the last year. It doesn't quantify how many times or how often because it's irrelevant to the data set. They aren't asking who's using how much, they're asking how many people are using. That number is climbing, quickly.

>pretty much everyone 16 and older has taken a sip of alcohol but we wouldn't call everyone 16 and older a ""drinker"" now would we?

No, but no one was calling these folks ""regular users"" either. If, however, the number of 16 year olds answering the question ""Have you drank in the past year?"" suddenly doubled, that would be concerning regardless of if they are drinking daily or just a sip here or there. Its the change in users that's the point, not the amount or frequency of consumption.

More over, its fairly obvious that you haven't used or even really understand these drugs since even a single use can result in long term mental health changes, which completely upends any significant data being extrapolated from a how much, how often, question.",i_didnt_look,t2_n3unp,2,0,reddit1

k5s3svz,t3_17csppv,2023-10-21 02:53:21,science,"Abstract (snippet):     
>Commuting to work is an important part of many people's daily life, with travel times increasing constantly and becoming a growing problem. The aim of the present study is to assess the associations between commuting and poor mental health in workers. This is a cross-sectional study extracting information from the ‘Commuting, Daily Habits and Urban Health Survey’ in Mairena del Aljarafe (Spain), including a representative sample of 294 workers. 

Conclusion:       
>This study shows that people who use their private motor vehicle feel under pressure, less happy and their sleep quality is affected. Car use also leads to longer and more expensive commuting times. Finally, people who use their private car to commute to work and those who have longer commutes are more associated with poorer mental health. At the same time, those who used public or active transport spent less time and money on their trips. Therefore, the use of public and/or active commuting should be encouraged, along with better management to improve traffic congestion and thus reduce commuting times.",QuintonFlynn,t2_4xi8c,219,0,reddit2
k5st0br,t3_17csppv,2023-10-21 07:15:14,science,"I think this is a valid and useful study, but it has some limitations, being survey data in which public and active are lumped together, and only 66 participants were in that group. Also, commuting time is emphasized over commuting distance. If a commute takes someone 5 minutes by motorcycle, but 30 minutes by walking, this approach would not take that into account.

In my anecdotal experience, there can be a big difference in stress between various public/private/active commuting modes. For example, urban rush hour driving is terrible, but a 10 minute drive in a small rural town is fine.  Riding the bus with adequate seating for 20 minutes with no transfers is great, but shoulder-to-shoulder in the Seoul subway with multiple transfers when they have the heat up too high in winter and you are wearing a heavy coat sucks. Bicycling on a cool fall day is lovely. On an icy & snowy January morning, it's dangerous. 

The thing that really stuck out to me though, is that the mean commute time was ocer 50 minutes.  That seems like a lot of time to spend commuting, regardless of the mode.",ledfrisby,t2_j84pc,33,0,reddit2

* **Could you talk a little bit about what is involved in development of a biosimilar, related to the original product?** Meaning (at the risk of oversimplifying), developing Copaxone requires the idea of how the drug works to treat MS--understanding the disease state on a molecular level and conception of how to design a molecule to treat that disease. Then develop the molecule, test, adjust, test again, etc. But with a biosim, you already have the end product in mind, right? So how does the development and design begin? I realize that the process is more complex than simply reverse-engineering the original molecule, but could you explain a bit about how the design is approached? 


* **Also, is the goal of biosim development to optimize disease treatment, or to mimic the original drug as closely as possible?** If, during the development of Glatopa, it was discovered that a slightly different structure of the molecule resulted in better treatment outcomes, would the team pursue the better outcomes, or the product most closely resembling Copaxone?

We recently went through all of this in the UK with infliximab over the last couple of years, and it's been pointed out to me many times that Remicaide (the original infliximab brand) have altered their product over 30 times since it was licensed. Therefore (the argument goes) it's effectively a biosimilar of itself and so we probably needn't be worried when switching patients to 'official' biosimilars since we didn't particularly care (or even know) when Remicaide changed it's product.

Looking at Momenta's pipeline, I see that your furthest advanced biosimilar product is an Adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar. I was hoping you could help me understand a few things about the biosimilar business model:

1. It seems that a number of companies have already made and received approval for Adalimumab biosimilars (including Amgen). How do you gain market share in a market like this, where multiple companies are already marketing the same product?

2. Humira is approved for multiple indications. Would any Adalimumab biosimilar need to complete trials for each of these indications in order to be marketed to patients with each indication. If yes, can doctors just get around this by prescribing the biosimilar anyway?

3. There is some talk that the TNFα inhibitors are likely to be out-classed by anti-IL6R agents (i.e. Actemra, Sarilumab, Tocilizumab). Where do you see this market going in the coming years? Will TNF-blockers always be first line for arthritis patients?",SirT6,t2_g2kb5,21,0,reddit3

At least with the $100,000 Hep C treatment, the goal is being cured, which generally happens in three months...while I believe the goal for all the current biologics are just disease management/maintenance drugs that you stay on for life or until it stops working.

I am a phd student in pharmaceutical sciences. Can I ask a couple of questions:

1. What is the difference in cost in developing biosimilars vs. a completely new biologics? How much price drop can be expected for protein therapeutics after its biosimilar become available on market?
I ask the question because the FDA requirement for the approval of biosimilars is much stricter than that of small molecule generic drugs. For example you still have to do Phase III clinical trials which are very expensive, also a lot of manufacturing problems have to be solved. So it seems to me that it takes a lot more resources to develop biosimilars compared to small molecule generics. Are we going to see a steep price drop once biosimilar is introduced into the market, just like what we saw with the small molecule drugs? 

2. The strategy statement of your company states that you want to develop biosimilars that are indistinguishable from the branded drug to achieve interchangeability status. How far are you there? And what is still holding you from achieving this goal? Are there analytical methods currently available capable of calling the biosimilar to be identical to the innovator drug? 

3. Do you do LC-MS/MS work on protein therapeutics? What is the attitude of pharma industry towards LC-MS quantification of therapeutic proteins?

dck0w2n,t1_dcjfb0h,2017-01-17 21:04:12,science,"Let me try taking a crack at this. **But before I get going**: it's important to realize that topics such as the FDA regulation of pharmaceuticals, off-label marketing, primary mode of action, and cross-labeling are about as complex as they are boring to lay observers.

The answer to your question is: ""Probably not."" followed by an enormous asterix.

First of all, the FDA does not regulate medicine, so a doctor can generally prescribe anything for anything (another big asterix: malpractice lawsuits, criminal laws, etc. notwithstanding). Instead, the FDA regulates whether drugs can be marketed to doctors and patients. So if a drug company wants to promote and sell a new drug, they'll (usually) need to go through several clinical trials showing both efficacy for the intended purpose *and* safety.

Now let's say you realize through testing that your safe heart medicine causes impotent men to achieve erections. Can you market the safe drug for that purpose? Under the old rules... no. You need to go through another time-consuming and expensive process to change the labels (even though in reality, you *really really* want/probably subtly encourage sales reps to tell doctors ""I heard it also works for erections...just sayin' "" even though that's off label marketing and illegal.)

The new rules are intended to streamline the process of promoting already safe drugs for other uses...so in theory, safety shouldn't be a problem. 

Now for that huge asterix: what happens when sales reps jump in front of the FDA and encourage drugs that were safe for say...healthy adults...and promote 4x that dosage for children?

Truth is, no one really knows. Theoretically, the FDA can still smack them down for it but, in practice, med device and pharma companies often stretch their restrictions as far as they can in order to increase sales. Time will tell on this one but, at least on the surface, the deregulation seems soft enough that the FDA can always backtrack if need be. Of course, that was with the old administration. 

Who knows how the new administration will handle FDA regulation? (**spoiler alert:** Section 3038 is only the beginning). ",bpastore,t2_jlxu8,2,0,reddit3
dck5pzx,t1_dcjfb0h,2017-01-17 22:36:10,science,"Why is it that deregulation of drugs is immediately associated with less ""safety""? 

What about the dangerous risk that the FDA's regulations will stall the development of new, beneficial drugs? Or, even worst, that the regulatory burdens lead to them failing to approve drugs that could've gone on to save lives? What about increased costs to the companies and consumers? And what about the inherent incentive for FDA officials to deny approval since their reputations are far more likely to suffer if they accidentally approve a bad drug than if they falsely reject a good one?

Type 2 errors are a thing you know. And the most catastrophic Type 2 failure of the FDA (beta-blockers in the 60s) led to far more preventable deaths than their worst Type 1 error (the Thalidomide crisis)

There are far more similar cases that, when stacked together, suggest the overall impact of increased FDA involvement in medicine has done more harm than good.

http://www.fdareview.org/04_safety.php

http://www.fdareview.org/05_harm.php

> Deaths owing to drug lag have been numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Wardell (1978a) estimated that practolol, a drug in the beta-blocking family, could save ten thousand lives a year if allowed in the United States. Although the FDA allowed a first beta-blocker, propranolol, in 1968, three years after that drug had been available in Europe, it waited until 1978 to allow the use of propranolol for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, its most important indications. Despite clinical evidence as early as 1974, only in 1981 did the FDA allow a second beta-blocker, timolol, for prevention of a second heart attack. The agency’s withholding of beta-blockers was alone responsible for probably tens of thousands of deaths (on this general issue see Gieringer 1985; Kazman 1990).

I'm sorry if I sound like I'm preaching to the choir. It just frustrates me that most people view the FDA as if it were a sacred entity, with the default assumption that MORE power to them increases safety for everyone.

&gt;“Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with [our] extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously,” CEO Richard Gonzalez said last week. “We believe the litigation process and our intellectual property estate will protect Humira from biosimilar entry until 2022.”

**Q.I.11.	Can an applicant extrapolate clinical data intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity in one condition of use to support licensure of the proposed biosimilar product in one or more additional conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed?**

> A.I.11. (Proposed Answer): Yes. If the proposed product meets the statutory requirements for licensure as a biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act based on, among other things, data derived from a clinical study sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in an appropriate condition of use, the potential exists for the biosimilar product to be licensed for one or more additional conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. However, the applicant would need to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolating clinical data to support a determination of biosimilarity for each condition of use for which licensure is sought.... 

And it continued, but that should answer most of it.  

In regards to the second portion of your question, physicians can prescribe off-label, but if it's not indicated they most likely won't.  If it's prescribed inpatient then they would have to get the drug approved by P&T and if it's prescribed outpatient the patient's insurance might not cover it.  They would likely want data on a biosimilar for a specific indication if it wasn't indicated.

dcnfong,t1_dcke1ei,2017-01-19 23:57:49,science,"Some people are trying to compare genertics to biosimilars -- and while there may be some analogy there, the two should not be confused.  With biosimilars, companies aren't reproducing an exact, proven drug molecule. They're producing something brand new, just pretty similar to the name-brand. The process for developing, manufacturing, and earning regulatory approval for biosimilars is significantly more complex and expensive than for a small molecule generic. The industry of course expects cost savings, as a biosimilar company gets to piggy-back of much of the original R&D and regulatory work, but biosimilars are not likely to save patients that much.

It's possible that companies had big challenges in the first round of biosimilar development/approval process, and that may go away with time. However because biosimilars are just similar and not ""generics"", companies may try to market them as a new best-in-class treatment rather than just a cheap alternative to the original. I think we've yet to really see how the marketing game will play out for these drugs, but we'll never see the type of discounts seen in generics.

>Nonetheless, as introduced, the 21st Century Cures Act instructs the FDA to consider nontraditional study designs and methods of data analysis to further speed approvals. Adaptive trial designs and the use of Bayesian methods hold promise in some kinds of evaluations, particularly in oncology. However, more problematic proposals include encouraging the use of “shorter or smaller clinical trials” for devices and the request that the FDA develop criteria for relying on “evidence from clinical experience,” including “observational studies, registries, and therapeutic use” instead of randomized, controlled trials for approving new uses for existing drugs. Although such data can provide important information about drug utilization and safety once a medication is in use, there is considerable evidence that these approaches are not as rigorous or valid as randomized trials in assessing efficacy.

You asked about moving from chemical action to therapeutic effect (when it's actually going to be both). 

But this part is about shorter trials for devices (a concern that you did not mention before) and FDA being *asked to think* about using historical data for drug re-purposing (that's a new indication, not off-label use as you stated in your original question).

You seem to have a preconceived and alarmist conclusion in mind (""deregulates your whole industry"") and do not appear to make some important distinctions (like off-label use vs. new indication). 

Thus, you will find your concerns - even if very different from ones originally stated. 

On an off chance that you wanted to see some logical discussion, the only real concern there is encouraging shorter or smaller clinical trials for devices. The rest are either misunderstanding (like misreading re: chemical action), or potential danger that usually does not come to pass: FDA develops very conservative criteria if given a chance, so admissible ""evidence from clinical experience"" will not be merely a collection of anecdotal reports.

If FDA is able to consider evidence from experience in the field instead of being limited to clinical trials for approval, that could pave the way for those off-label treatments getting approval, which is good because FDA could then provide more clear guidelines than it does now. To me this part seems like a step in the right direction, but this bill is huge so I'm sure there are things I've missed.

A Doctorate degree will have you pushing the edge yourself, training you to design experiments, write papers and to generate entirely new knowledge.

You generally want the person who's leading a team of research scientists at a pharmaseutical company to be from one of the latter categories, preferably the third.

I feel that this trope is too easy and too beaten to death. I'm sure there are plenty of people at the top that are motivated by profit, but i firmly believe there are a lot more out there that sincerely believe in what they do. you dont *generally* get to the top of a mulitnational, multi billion dollar company, through just being greedy, most people that hold CEO titles are True Believers in their industry. I work at a pharma company and have met a couple pharma CEO's, i have no doubt in my mind that these people care *sincerely* about finding effective therapies, and if possible the holy grail of the disease they fight- a cure. 

There is now a cure for Hepatitis C. A *cure*. is it expensive? hell yes it is, but its an actual honest to goodness cure for a disease, and that is a rare thing to find these days. Why is it so expensive? multi billion dollar R&D costs + production costs (which includes the opportunity cost of diverting a factory from whatever it *could* be producing instead) amortized over a relatively small population of infected people= stupidly expensive drugs. 

I agree that expensive drugs are a problem, i dont have a solution, but i dont think that the problem is a result of some nefarious maleficent mustache twirling villains sitting in smoke filled libraries clad in brazillian redwood and ivory swilling rare scotch and laughing maniacally. 

Most are people that have surpassed the ""money"" phase of their hedonic treadmill. they *have* money, they make millions of dollars a year and their concerns are not super wrapped up in getting *more*. Sure, more would be nice, but more importantly for them is *legacy*. If you have 60-100 million sitting around in assets, you can buy literally *anything* you want, and your wealth gives you unfettered access to just about anything the world can offer. when you *have* everything, it becomes more important that you *do* something meaningful. These guys (and women) want a legacy that includes buildings and parks and scolarships named after them, textbooks in schools with sentences like ""in 2017 John Moneybags, the philanthropist that led Dr. Researchers team to cure cancer...""

Are they selfish? sure. are they driven to an extreme? yup. are they also trying to please shareholders who cant see past the next quarterly earnings report? you bet. But they also are human beings and see firsthand how they can personally be a very real catalyst for change in the world.

dck0u98,t1_dcjrf48,2017-01-17 21:03:13,science,"Keeping in mind that AMGN is such a large company because of its portfolio of branded drugs, sold at a brand price premium. The company has a large revenue base and huge gross margins, over 80%, in fact. AMGN is not a large corporation because it has economies of scale in a capital intensive industry. It is not necessary to be a large company to manufacture drugs cheaply. 

If the FDA were to grace a ""biosimilar"" with an AB-rating (equivalence rating, allowing substitutability at pharmacy) - any small company with a generic could effectively compete with AMGN. You would go to 3 or 4 large payers and 3 or 4 large pharmacies, ask them at what price they would contract with you to substitute your generic drug for AMGN's, and then sign a contract. BAM! It costs next to nothing to manufacture a drug - obviously FDA compliance and things like that add cost but that's not where pharma makes its money. 

Now the FDA is not ready to grant substitutably equivalent ratings to bio-similars yet, and so they are likely to require substantial marketing efforts in order to get Drs. to write Rx's that actually say ""Momenta's biosimilar"" instead of ""Amgen's biologic,"" THAT requires scale. That requires a ton of sales people. Contracting with the payers will help, because the insurance companies will say to the drs... your Rx for Amgen biologic? not approved. Momenta's is cheaper. And then the dr. will do 1 of 2 things: Go back and argue with insurance until it goes through or 2, just write the other prescription... but as you can see this is still an uphill battle that requires some marketing muscle. 

This is really the business question for biosimilars, and I don't think OP works on that side of the business really. Substitutability is key for generics to take market share. If they have it, then there's no barriers to entry. If they don't, then scale and marketing/etc. become important.

This will get you past the computer screen to where a human might actually look at your application. 2) go to any relevant IN PERSON events near you: Job fairs, society meetings, conferences. Review of applications is extremely biased toward people who the job recruiter or manager has actually met. This is why people talk about networking being so important. I got my job because I went to a conference and was outspoken, got to talk with my now manager and showed him I am not a psychopath. At the same time I also got a hit for an application I had made through the online process, but even I ended up choosing the position where I had already met the people irl.",agissilver,t2_4b39b,5,0,reddit3

dcr4004,t1_dcqfxdi,2017-01-22 14:02:44,science,"Alright, thank you for the further explanation. I think I have a better understanding now. 

2DLC is suitable for the pharma industry in two ways. 

1) For tricky separations: When you are dealing with a mixture (of lets say small molecules) and your molecule of interest can not be separated by any one separation mechanism, such as reversed phase, then another separation dimension can often do the job. The most published approach in pharma literature is the combination of reversed phase coupled with a chiral separation. Then the molecule of interest can be separated from the bulk of the sample with the RP, and then from its enantiomers, all online with one instrument. I would point you to the literature of D. Stoll and K. Chang.

2) For complex separations: Analyzing large complex molecules is difficult. Analyzing the difference between two large complex molecules can be even more difficult. In 2DLC for complex analysis in pharma, the biosimilar are making a splash. You digest, and analyze all the peptides with the separation power of two columns. Then you can really see the difference. Here, I would point you to the literature from K. and P. Sandra's lab in Belgium.

Development is, by nature, uncontrolled to a certain extent.  Attempting to develop in a validation environment is like dancing in a body cast.  Validation comes afterwards and shows that the results of development can be repeated, and that  the variability is accounted for and within acceptable limits.

So, my point is that there's a degree of ""hope"" in development because you're not sure that it's actually going to work.  Hope should only be a superstition in validation (and, shortly thereafter, manufacturing) because you should already be sure that it works going into that step.  In fact, in many manufacturing operations the validation batches are marketable because they are monitored in the greatest detail to serve as the standard for the remainder of the product's lifecycle.",gaunt79,t2_b4ozi,1,0,reddit3

Most people fail the purity test, and Johnny’s hands weren’t squeaky clean, so it can never be Amber in the wrong, at most it can be “well both sides.” 

This fear in the education space translates to a common trope: the female student that pressures a male teacher into a relationship by threatening to falsely accuse him as blackmail.

If you think competition is the difference, then I'm sorry to say that is just a sexist belief at the core. I don't mean to be too harsh, but this was something I used to think was the case too.

The reward of a stable and decent paying (or better) job is motivation for just about any adult who aims to take care of themselves to go for regardless of gender. Not that many people choose their careers because they love it. Believe me, I'm one of those who did in my field and a majority of people I've worked with (young and old) don't really love it to their core -- nor do they have to to be successful. When participation variance is substantially skewed, there's reasons for it. Even an individual who might say ""I chose not to pursue ____ because I didn't like ______"" may be a misreport because classes and other participation were not too enjoyable because the experience was in an already skewed environment.

I know two black men who acquired nursing degrees. One glance at the field, plus some understanding of how the job is percieved by it's ""customers"" and it should be obvious why you have your work cut out for you if you want to be a successful black male nurse in America.

A picture of math and computer programming teams pre-80s, definitely pre-70s would be all female. Today, all male and now it pays well. Women's brains didn't biologically change. There were economic and cultural factors. Even today as this is my field, it's plainly obvious in a big tech company that a lot of the women there were not born in the U.S. -- lots of American born and raised males, not a lot of American born females.

It has less to do with which direction you married, although it is easier to marry if you make a lot of money (there's objective research demonstrating this quite clearly, in a casual direction... including in the reverse: a reduction in income predicts divorce as well).

j1a16kp,t1_j19yh7o,2022-12-22 19:41:24,science,"As another person actually in stem, you are absolutely wrong.  There's plenty of accuracy to what they say.

I currently work in a more biological area.  90% of my department are women and ethnic minorities, I am the only het white male in my office.  Student numbers lean towards majority female as well by a small margin, but has been trending that way for many years now, even since my undergrad and probably before.

Normally, this wouldn't be a problem.  I don't care enough about other people to mind whether they are male or female, or whatever.  It doesn't affect my daily relationship with my colleagues.  However, the problem is that this DOES extend to funding opportunities.  Our school-wide mailing list and other departmental or building-specific mailing lists regularly receive updates and offers about specific funding opportunities for scientists to put in proposals, whether it's pump-priming or other small funding opportunities.  This is to get money to do actual science, not just random rewards like 'here you go buy yourself a coffee'.

We get women-in-stem emails.  We get Asian-only emails (usually China-specific).  We get BAME-only emails.  We get LGBT or other 'disadvantaged' minority emails.  We get at least 10+ emails for funding opportunities or reward schemes that cater specifically to these 'minority' groups that go out of their way to exclude straight white guys.  We have had a single opportunity in the last year where we weren't excluded by racial or sexual bias.  One.  And that opportunity is open for everyone, not just us.

Like, you can try to spin it any way you like, you can pretend that it's somehow addressing some kind of previous wrong or that these people face discrimination, you can pretend that we somehow deserve it because of discrimination that other guys have done in the past, but outwardly discriminating against us at the funding level isn't going to sit well at all.  And it's past the point where people are going to continue being sympathetic.

j1a73sa,t1_j19wzqm,2022-12-22 20:20:24,science,"First of all, I will point out that I agree that $38k AND $68k are inadequate IMHO. I have no teaching experience, but I used to work at an after-school camp. Anything with kids requires a great deal of patience and attitude control, but the biggest thing is worrying about the huge liability being responsible for children, and the high scrutiny from adults that comes with it. All of that comes before I can even begin to comprehend the task of teaching, grading, buying supplies, etc.

My only point was to point out teachers, on average, get paid more than a lot of people think. Some casual review of statistics suggests that $38k is not so far off the number I saw that I would make a fuss over it, but I think it was about $42k.

Maybe my perspective is warped since I am a nurse - another career I think is underpaid. It seems they make, on average, $67k per year. Of course, nurses also have a huge responsibility, and markedly worse job conditions (bloody needles, COVID patients) and worse hours (nights, weekends, holidays).

$67k sounds like a lot more than $42k, but when you consider teachers don’t work full years, if seems more even. Most schools operate for 36 weeks per year - if we assume teachers have another 4 weeks of duties in the off season (an arbitrary number I estimated), then their pay is comparable to $60k per year. These younger teachers have the chance to work a seasonal summer job - my friend was a kayak tour guide. 

Also, you need to account for the fact that teachers have significantly greater room to grow in salary with experience vs nurses. The starting teacher salary is only 64% compared to average teacher salary, vs 89% for nurses. 

Also, consider a teacher with a child vs a nurse. A teacher can bring their child to school and effectively have no commute to work after (for at least some years). Tons of nurses work 12 hour shifts (7-7) - they are reliant on someone else to drop off and pick up kids. 

FWIW - I don’t think the poor pay for both is related to misogyny like others say. I am no expert though. The reason is that overall worker productivity soared since the 70s,but teachers and nurses didn’t experience the same effect. A teacher have more kids in their class today than before, or a nurse with more patients, but it isn’t comparable to the 60% increase in productivity the average worker had since the 70s. These industries were not affected by automation, since we (rightly) do not trust machines to make good students or healthy patients the same way we expect them to make a good car.

Anyway, pay is definitely an issue, but it isn’t QUITE as bad as some make it out to be (when compared to nursing).",pvtshoebox,t2_366gv,2,0,reddit4

I think that the pay is not adequate to persuade many men (and women) who could otherwise work in better conditions with better pay for a comparable amount of responsibility. 

I suspect that parents, administrators, and other teachers stigmatize and ostracize their male colleagues, and I also suspect that this stigma spills into dating. I imagine it can be difficult for men to be trusted as a teacher and also convey the sexually forward persona necessary for male heterosexual dating.

Show me evidence that:

1. Affirmative action and related programs are pushing men out of STEM in general (the comment I replied to plus some of yours)

2. Affirmative action and related programs are pushing men out of veterinary medicine (the comment above theirs)

3. Women (or minorities if you want) are not discriminated against in physics, math, engineering, and computer science (your comments) and these underrepresented groups are just choosing not to enter these fields

Because I've shown you evidence for all three of these things being untrue or having no basis.

I'm sick of people getting away with this on these threads. They talk a big game and then show nothing but echo dangerous sentiment. If you were that interested you would have responded to all the links or evidence. You really want to be on the side of ""Young girls took away opportunities for my son to go into engineering"" or ""White men are discriminated against more than any other demographic in society""

1. Look up any admissions charts for a veterinary school. White men and women are always on the same chart. Minorities are often not because they have a different trend due to affirmative actions. True for medical schools as well. They aren't going to tell you exact admissions policies. But that tells you a lot.


2. I have not found a single source about sexism or admissions stopping men from going to veterinary school but some other insight:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340187/

3. Women in stem experience sexism more than other fields. This includes fields that women are more equally represented so the numbers are probably worse if you just look at physics, engineering, etc:

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/

4. Women do not feel a sense of belonging in the engineering workplace, likely due to sexism and hostility in the workplace. The sense of belonging is much more common in college thanks to the women in STEM clubs etc but this is gone once they are in the workforce:

4. Women are credited less on their work in STEM:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04966-w


5. Women are seen as less competent in STEM (unfortunately by men AND women):

https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1211286109


6. In unrelenting fields like STEM, women are more likely to leave if they chose to have a family over men. This means loss of publications for academics and ultimately less women in STEM:

Put another way - the pay of being a nurse, which I think is comparable to a teacher, is one of the reasons I pursued the career. However, I think I should earn more. My salary isn’t the issue, it is the responsibility. I have worked as an EMT and in the military (combat medic) and those are truly underpaid careers.

e1u7qtx,t3_8w9hsn,2018-07-05 16:23:21,science,"I think a big issue with the open space setup is that it is very dependant on the type of work that the employees are doing. Although anecdotal, I work at an engineering services company where we often create smaller teams to finish a particular project. It is drastically more efficient for me, as an electrical engineer, to be able to quickly communicate with the mechanical design team and the software team being in the same room. Especially when we are in the integration phase of the design and trying to get all the pieces to fit together. This helps so much while working out bugs and issues with the design on many different levels. It makes sense seeing as how the tech start-up industry operates extremely similar and is the main reason (AFAIK) the open space setup is being pushed onto the corporate world. However, I can easily see how detrimental the setup can be to other disciplines outside my own where tight collaboration isn't as integral to getting your work done. I couldn't imagine working in other fields like HR or Accounting and having to be forced to interact and listen to co-workers that don't help me finish my work tasks. 

To me the bigger issue is that companies don't spend time to figure out what would benefit the productivity of their employees and instead just follow the start-up industry mindset because it's a successful office model while also being extremely cheap to implement.

I'm a 20something, introverted software engineer with a little over 2 years experience. I've only worked at small(<100 employees), and in an open office layout until recently where the team I was on was moved into cubicles.


I really like working in an open office. It was really convenient to just lay back and ""shout"" at a coworker with questions. There was a friendlier atmosphere and a better feeling of ""team""ness. And, if you needed to, you could throw on headphones to focus harder on a tough problem, but it wasn't needed. And email/IM was still used when either party was busy or looked like they didn't want to be distributed.

Compare that to working in a cubicle and it just isn't the same. Cubicle work feels more claustrophobic, for lack of better terms. It has much less soul, more monotonous. It's almost depressing. Almost all of my contact with ""the outside world"" is via electronic means. I don't really get those water cooler conversations anymore, and it's even harder to get a lunch group going.

The office is light, airy, with a lot of open space. Rather than feeling like you “have no space to work” it feels more like the corporate culture is inviting you to communicate with one another and work more as a team.

However, a key difference may be that along with these open spaces for general work, we are also afforded the option of smaller, private rooms to use temporarily. If you need quiet, or to meet with someone face-to-face without the intrusions of others, you can just hop into one of these rooms if they are empty. There is no need to reserve them and they operate on an honors system — certainly some people, especially those higher up tend to “claim” the rooms as their personal offices, but the idea is to NOT have a personal office. You are supposed to use the room to do what you need to do, and then leave it so someone else can hop in.

This layout makes everyone more approachable and empowers even those employees of the lowest pay grade (such as myself) to make valuable connections with other people who may benefit your career in the long-run. I have seen this office space compared to some of the organization’s other non-open office spaces, and prefer the former. I suppose my question to those who dislike the open-concept is: what’s the alternative? Do you LIKE cubicle layouts? This is the only other layout I have seen, in my experience. I am genuinely curious.

Certainly some open concept spaces are more authoritarian and designed to “keep an eye” on everyone at once. More so, some spaces are just gimmicks that photograph well in company office pictures. However, I believe that when done correctly and backed by genuine policies that promote an atmosphere of teamwork, growth, and knowledge, that this layout is incredible.",Dirigent,t2_l7ysc,-1,0,reddit1

Perhaps it's because I hate working for large corporates and always aim for jobs in small-to-mid sized companies, where individual enterprise is noted. It's better for some jobs than others, but I've never outright hated it, and at best it really helps build quick relationships (enjoying the company of your colleagues being IMO 80% of job satisfaction). Immediate answers to questions and sanity checks on decisions are very useful in every job I've been in.

Being confined to an office is restrictive, to me. Maybe I'm lucky that I can usually tune out conversations or put headphones in when I need to concentrate, but I'd actively fight against being put in a solo office in my current role, and my last few too.

I can see how it can go very wrong, but with the right company culture and a hiring policy that puts like-minded people together, I barely have a bad word to say about open-plan offices. I'm not hugely extroverted, either - I'll happily tune people out for a whole day, and love time to myself, but I can't imagine being happy spending forty hours a week in a box without other people to interact with.

e1u29u0,t1_e1ttved,2018-07-05 15:03:24,science,"Open offices are fantastic when done right, they are rarely done right.

There was once a time when open plan offices were common place, this tended to be pre-19th century. In the 19th century closed offices took over, a great example are a lot of old British barristers' chambers buildings, you'll find similar stuff in older American court offices. Very high ceilings with massive walls and doors lining hallways. 

The open plan was brought back by architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, who disliked how restrictive all the doors and walls were. I've worked in early 20th century office building before and can guarantee it's annoying as hell at times to have to go through three doors every time you want to talk to someone.

However, there was an important difference. His open plan offices were *nothing* like 21st century ones. They had gigantic tables, massive spaces between each one, and everyone got their own personal table to work at. This allowed ease of use, while giving everyone their own personal space.

Cubicles appeared in the 60s under the same premise, efficient open plan floor designs with temporary cubicle walls for individual privacy. These cubicles were also designed by architects and made massive. Plenty of desk space and room. Slowly, cubicles got smaller and smaller as companies wanted more efficient use for floor space and the horrible cubicle farms were formed. 

As the cubicles got smaller and more claustrophobic, they just got rid of them. Now we have the rows of narrowly places computers of today. Where the lack of walls allowed even more compact placement. 

There's no real answer to what's best, traditional offices have their benefits while open plan and cubicles can be done great too. It's up to personal preference really. Issue is, companies have ruined it through corporate meddling and disregard for workers. ",,,69,0,reddit1

You find an office space that meets your basic needs, then part of your lease includes a dollar value used toward the initial build-out of the space.  That means building out interior walls (offices, break room, storage, IT room, etc), carpet, paint, etc.  This is usually specified as 'real' (as in real estate) items only; i.e. part of the building and not furniture.


Basically you pick a space and the property owners build it out to your specs, then you move in.  Most lease renewals will also include a budget toward this as well so you can refresh paint, carpet, and do minor improvements every few years.",Draskuul,t2_cdivh,3,0,reddit1

Having walls and a discrete area gives provides a scheme for context-switching between the two.  When someone shows up, you switch to interacting with them; when they leave you can switch back.
