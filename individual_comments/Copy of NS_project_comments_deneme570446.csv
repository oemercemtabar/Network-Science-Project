""The purse strings have insulated themselves from the workers with a layer of middle management""

When I sat down with my middle manager I grilled him on what the co. was doing. Conclusion? I'm a Network Admin in an IT dept. thats treated like a cost center. 

No CoL raises, no retention bonuses, no hazard pay, no WFH, coverage needed most Saturdays each week with a plant that runs 3 shifts--24/7 just about. No merit raises, but thats what they call their raises and they have people here 15+ years they've been stiffing and need to finally grease some palms. So, what did I learn to survive this new year? I changed my schedule to work 9 hour days and leave at 40 on Friday. This is so I can get my ""raise"" by milking OT. 

For the record, I hate less than 40hrs/week with praises from local plant still being seen by the top-downs as a ""cost reduction opportunity"" rather than a positive mark for efficient use of time.

I hate that the unofficial word is to milk OT. I don't want to spend 60 hours here every week just because you've managed to beat down the dudes 20+ years older than me that still work here.

ehzjc1v,t3_aybkbu,2019-03-07 11:23:17,science,"Abstract:

> In 1924, The Morton Salt Company began nationwide distribution of iodine-fortified salt. Ac-cess to iodine, a key determinant of cognitive ability, rose sharply. We compare outcomes for cohorts exposed in utero with those of slightly older, unexposed cohorts, across states with high versus low baseline iodine deficiency. Income increased by 11% labor force participation rose 0.68 percentage points; and full-time work went up 0.9 percentage points due to increased iodine availability. These impacts were largely driven by changes in the economic outcomes of young women. In later adulthood, both men and women had higher family incomes due to iodization.

>\[W\]e add evidence on the long-run effects of micronutrient fortification campaigns and in particular mass salt iodization as a means of eradicating iodine deficiency. **Nearly 2 billion people worldwide–a third of the world’s population–do not have adequate access to iodine** (De Benoist et al., 2004). Recent estimates from the economics literature suggest that the incidence of iodine deficiency, and thus **the returns to reducing IDD, may be very large** (Feyrer et al., 2017; Field et al., 2009; Politi, 2010). Policymakers in IDD-endemic countries, as well as the WHO, UNICEF, and other international organizations, have made increasing access to iodine a high priority. Mass salt iodization to prevent IDD is, far and away, the preferred policy: iodizing salt is much cheaper than continuous supplementation in populations with iodine-deficient diets, and, taken with other 5 micronutrients such as iron, is highly cost-effective in terms of fetal and infant deaths averted (Horton et al., 2008).

The milk will kill you before the vitamin D in it will. You can chug a gallon and your vitamin D level won't be high enough to be concerned. It's harmless. I am not a doctor though so if you are at all concerned get your blood tested and ask a doctor. For a reference though in a quart of milk there are about 10 IU of vitamin D and doctors recommend between 400-4000 IU a day. Its a wide gap because it was recommended at 400-800 IU but a lot of doctors are recommending more these days. between 1000-4000 IU.

____

>**Abstract**

>The oil and gas (O&G) sector represents a large source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. However, estimates of O&G emissions rely upon bottom-up approaches, and are rarely evaluated through atmospheric measurements. Here, we use aircraft measurements over the Canadian oil sands (OS) to derive the first top-down, measurement-based determination of the their annual CO2 emissions and intensities. The results indicate that CO2 emission intensities for OS facilities are 13–123% larger than those estimated using publically available data. This leads to 64% higher annual GHG emissions from surface mining operations, and 30% higher overall OS GHG emissions (17 Mt) compared to that reported by industry, despite emissions reporting which uses the most up to date and recommended bottom-up approaches. Given the similarity in bottom-up reporting methods across the entire O&G sector, these results suggest that O&G CO2 emissions inventory data may be more uncertain than previously considered.",avogadros_number,t2_bmfil,40,0,reddit1

They don't have a way of measuring CO2 coming from their equipment, plants, or from mining.  Instead they got together with Environment Canada and came up with an average carbon amount produced per truckload of bitumen.

They did this in.... 1995.  This was part of our original CO2 emissions and tracking standards for the country that were devised to help us meet our Kyoto goals (which didn't happen).

This doesn't just mean that Suncor is reporting wrong, it likely means that EVERYONE is reporting wrong and that Canada's CO2 emissions have in fact not been under control.

As someone who worked in the Canadian oilfields, I'm having  hard time agreeing with that statement.

From top to bottom, there's this mindset of ""What's best for the industry"".

- over a dozen people die in the oil fields every year but the media doesn't report on it because that's best for the industry. 

- company not meeting safety standards? You're getting a pass anyway because that's what's best for the industry.

However, due to your own lack of reading comprehension, you have gone a childish tirade, revealing your own ignorance in the process.

Here I have supplied sources of fossil fuel companies spreading misinformation and lies in order to confuse the public and muddy the waters about the truth of climate change:

>Documents uncovered by journalists and activists over the past decade lay out a clear strategy: **First,** **target media** **outlets to get them to report more on the “uncertainties” in climate science, and position industry-backed contrarian scientists as expert  sources for media. Second,** **target conservatives** **with the message that climate change is a liberal hoax, and paint anyone who takes the issue seriously as** **“out of touch with reality.”** In  the 1990s, oil companies, fossil fuel industry trade groups and their  respective PR firms began positioning contrarian scientists such as Willie Soon, William Happer and David Legates  as experts whose opinions on climate change should be considered equal and opposite to that of climate scientists. The Heartland Institute, which hosts an annual International Conference on Climate Change known as the leading climate skeptics conference, for example, routinely calls out media outlets  (including The Washington Post) for showing “bias” in covering climate change when they either decline to quote a skeptic or question a skeptic’s credibility.

>Investigative journalism by Inside Climate News  (ICN) into Exxon’s internal documents revealed that the company was at  the forefront of climate research, warning of the dangers posed by  human-caused global warming from the late-1970s to the late-1980s. As  Harvard climate historian Naomi Oreskes noted,  
>  
>*""But Exxon was sending a different message, even though its own  evidence contradicted its public claim that the science was highly  uncertain and no one really knew whether the climate was changing or, if  it was changing, what was causing it …* ***Journalists and scientists have  identified more than 30 different organizations funded by the company  that have worked to undermine the scientific message and prevent policy  action to control greenhouse gas emissions.****""*

You spun that so hard. The dude never says it has to be fossil fuel energy, even though he is blatantly against solar and other energy sources. His own sources are just other blogs, not actual studies. I looked him up, he appears to write some pretty good science fiction novels.

Meanwhile, with increased CO2 emissions, potentially millions will be displaced along the coasts of the planet, some of the most heaviest settled regions. There will be water shortages, increased mosquitoes populations, droughts which will reduce crops, more intense storms leading to more deaths/flooding/destruction, etc.

Presently, fossil fuel companies already contribute to smog:

>While major stationary sources are often identified with air  pollution, the greatest source of emissions are actually mobile sources, principally the automobile.  
>  
>There are many available air pollution control technologies and  urban planning strategies available to reduce air pollution; however, worldwide costs of addressing the issue are high.  
>  
>The most immediate method of improving air quality would be the use of bioethanol fuel, biodiesel, solar energy, and hybrid vehicle technologies.  
>  
>**The World Health Organization estimates that 4.6 million people die  each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution.**

[Source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/air_pollution.htm)

Cars run on fossil fuels. The driver of that industry is the fossil fuel industry. It would unprofitable for them if cars became electric or used another kind of energy. This is why they started using misinformation to begin with.

Coal is also a massive contributor to the problem:

>Coal is the dominant CO2 emissions source related to electricity generation  
>  
>In 2017, the electric power sector accounted for about 38% of U.S.  primary energy consumption and produced 34% of total U.S. energy-related  CO2 emissions. Coal accounted for 69% and natural gas for 29% of  electric power sector CO2 emissions.

[Source](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=environment_where_ghg_come_from)

The coal industry is incredibly destructive to our ecosystems, too. It's believe that the coal industry alone kills more than 14 billion birds a year. We need healthy ecosystems for the animals we eat or for pollinators since many of our crops would be devastated by the loss of pollinators from pollution.

>The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are  responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour  (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible  for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data  used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000  birds in the United States in 2009 but nuclear plants killed about  330,000 and **fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million.**

If you fell extremely ill at work and got taken away in an ambulance and died en route to the hospital, that doesn't count as dying at work.

If you died in a car accident while going to work, that doesn't count as dying at work either.

If you're old and sickly, chances are you don't have a job, so no dying at work for you.

Such work deserves the same recognition and safety concerns as the respective civilian laborers.

that's part of what I'm talking about.  ""Military Service"" is a term so broad as to be meaningless in itself.  It actually includes literally EVERY other profession which was already covered in the survey (maybe not Fisherman).

So they broke out fatalities by profession, then lumped military into one profession, then ignored the by far largest contributor to military fatalities.  If they're going to ignore combat, then the ""military"" catch all makes little sense...a navy firefighter is a firefighter.

If you look up accident statistics for 2012, Army alone has over 120 fatalities...so they clearly excluded even more than just combat fatalities.  At this point, I can't even guess what they DID consider a valid fatality to count.

Some of the research will be useful to the company and some will not.  Only the useful research will be submitted to a journal for publication so will obviously be more favorable.  Peer-review just checks the methodology used to conduct the study: reviewers don't go into their labs (in any scientific field) and reproduce the study.

Also they might be more likely to fund studies that they think will have a positive outcome, even if they're not influencing the result. And the govt is motivated by different considerations, so the food industry might be more likely to fund studies of a different character and which therefore have different expected outcomes.

Sacks G, Riesenberg D, Mialon M, Dean S, Cameron AJ (2020) The characteristics and extent of food industry involvement in peer-reviewed research articles from 10 leading nutrition-related journals in 2018. PLoS ONE 15(12): e0243144. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243144


**Abstract**

*Introduction*

There is emerging evidence that food industry involvement in nutrition research may bias research findings and/or research agendas. However, the extent of food industry involvement in nutrition research has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to identify the extent of food industry involvement in peer-reviewed articles from a sample of leading nutrition-related journals, and to examine the extent to which findings from research involving the food industry support industry interests.

*Methods*

All original research articles published in 2018 in the top 10 most-cited nutrition- and dietetics-related journals were analysed. We evaluated the proportion of articles that disclosed involvement from the food industry, including through author affiliations, funding sources, declarations of interest or other acknowledgments. Principal research findings from articles with food industry involvement, and a random sample of articles without food industry involvement, were categorised according to the extent to which they supported relevant food industry interests.

*Results*

196/1,461 (13.4%) articles reported food industry involvement. The extent of food industry involvement varied by journal, with The Journal of Nutrition (28.3%) having the highest and Paediatric Obesity (3.8%) having the lowest proportion of industry involvement. Processed food manufacturers were involved in the most articles (77/196, 39.3%). Of articles with food industry involvement, 55.6% reported findings favourable to relevant food industry interests, compared to 9.7% of articles without food industry involvement.

*Conclusion*

Food industry involvement in peer-reviewed research in leading nutrition-related journals is commonplace. In line with previous literature, this study has shown that a greater proportion of peer-reviewed studies involving the food industry have results that favour relevant food industry interests than peer-reviewed studies without food industry involvement. Given the potential competing interests of the food industry, it is important to explore mechanisms that can safeguard the integrity and public relevance of nutrition research.",stubby_hoof,t2_11ahit,1,0,reddit3

Along the way we broke down scholarly journals and research papers out in the wild (didn't have to be linguistics based each time for this class) and we talked about nutrition and the food companies that employ ""scientists"" to carry out these studies. 

We often found that they skewed data, used a statical analysis incorrectly, left out peritinent information, or just didn't have some info at all for you to back track and test their theories. 

In conclusion, be VERY cautious of any ""research"" that was enacted by the main party, and not through an unbiased 3rd party. And even then, they can still trick you because food companies just play so dirty and have been known to bribe their ""scientists"".

What is the difference between the American Cattleman's Association paying for a study to show how beef is a healthy part of the diet and then PETA paying for a study to show how unhealthy beef is in the diet???  

The issue is that MOST money in many areas of science is from groups that have a specific stake in the results, pro or con. They ALL pay for a set of results. Whether it is food industry looking for a scientist that has a slant toward them in a positive light or a activist group looking for a scientist with a slant toward a negative light, they all cherry pick who they pay to do the studies. 

Do you think Greenpeace is looking for a scientist to do a fair study on the effects of cattle processing on greenhouse gases? Or do they pay the guy that comes to them to sponsor his study to PROVE that cattle are bad for greenhouse gases?????

Very little, if any, of this type of science is done as PURE science with no expected outcome. And for everyone who says have the government pay for all science, NO, just no, stahp. Government is even worse for sponsoring science. They only sponsor things based on politics and expediency. They only pay for science that A. meets their pre-established bias AND B. meets their political agenda. 

No food industry company is going to pay for a study that says their product is bad, dangerous, or unhealthy. And no activist group is going to pay for a study that shows the product they want off the market to be safe and nutritious.",not_whiney,t2_et3zm,6,0,reddit3

Virtually everything people today blame of sugar is false, but true of saturated fat.

Saturated fats increase total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL (1) (LDL is a causal factor in atherosclerosis (2)), impair HDLs anti-inflammatory properties and endothelial function (3), increase inflammation (4), are more metabolically harmful than sugar during overfeeding (5), are less satiating than carbs, protein or unsaturated fat (6), increase insulin resistance (7), increase endotoxemia (8) and impair cognitive function (9). The only diets with which heart disease, the number one cause of death, has been reversed are diets low in saturated fat (10). The meta analyses that found no association between heart disease and saturated fat adjusted for serum cholesterol levels, one of the main drivers of atherosclerosis (11). Similarly, if you adjusted for bullets you would conclude guns have never killed anyone. Meta analyses that didn’t make this elementary mistake found saturated fat does cause heart disease in a dose response manner (12)

Oooo, time for me to chime in as a pharmaceutical chemist and go on a short rant!

People always talk about how chocolate/wine/açaí is good for you because it has polyphenols in it. “Studies show that the compounds in wine reduce inflammation/pain/cancer...” but there’s more to it than that. Polyphenols are composed of multiple phenol units, which themselves are basic chemical units made up of oxygen and carbon rings. Phenols are notorious in the drug development industry because they bind to just about every protein out there; tons of receptors in your body are more than happy to form a brief bond with a phenol. However, polyphenols are big and bulky, so they don’t really fit well into a protein receptor. It’s like trying to fit a cone through a hole whose diameter is smaller than the base of the cone: some of the cone (the polyphenol) goes in, but it doesn’t fit all the way and it sure doesn’t fit comfortably like a properly sized disc would.

With that in mind, when we look at a lot of these studies claiming that polyphenols do this thing or treat that thing, it’s because technically speaking you do have some slight activity on *every* receptor. But it’s not specific enough to actually bind long-term and create a meaningful physiological difference, never mind the fact that the concentration and localization of these polyphenols after drinking “a single glass of wine”  is far too low in the first place.",VibraphoneFuckup,t2_svk1i,76,0,reddit3

1) the symptom of diabetes is a disruption of sugar metabolism 
2) companies biased towards painting sugar in a neutral or positive light have done biased studies

Is that fair? Please correct me if I'm wrong

Well the thing is, there aren't just studies out there that show some vague correlation between saturated fat and diabetes. There is a proven, well established mechanism. And that mechanism is this: 

- tiny droplets of fat, called intramyocellular lipid, can build up in our muscles from the bloodstream
- this creates toxic fatty breakdown products and free radicals that **block the insulin signaling process**
- thus, the elevation of fat levels in the blood causes insulin resistance by inhibition of glucose transport into the muscles

This was found out after MRI techniques were developed to **actually observe this happening**. It's not just a theory. It's been shown to happen. The original study in which they did this is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC507380/). 

Now this doesn't mean that processed sugars are healthy and don't cause or exacerbate any issues in the body. But they are not the cause of type 2 diabetes. The inability to handle glucose properly is the *symptom*. 

If you have any studies that show the contrary, I would be interested to read them, and please clarify anything you believe I have misunderstood.

Uh no, absolutely not. The paper they published was correct. Sugar is not causing disease, excess saturated fat is. Sugar isn’t a health food but it also doesn’t cause direct harm unless you consume more than the top 5% of Americans sugar consumers or enough to gain weight and sugar is not responsible for our obesity epidemic. Virtually everything people today blame of sugar is false, but true of saturated fat. 

Saturated fats increase total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL (1) (LDL is a causal factor in atherosclerosis (2)), impair HDLs anti-inflammatory properties and endothelial function (3), increase inflammation (4), are more metabolically harmful than sugar during overfeeding (5), are less satiating than carbs, protein or unsaturated fat (6), increase insulin resistance (7), increase endotoxemia (8) and impair cognitive function (9). The only diets with which heart disease, the number one cause of death, has been reversed are diets low in saturated fat (10). The meta analyses that found no association between heart disease and saturated fat adjusted for serum cholesterol levels, one of the main drivers of atherosclerosis (11). Similarly, if you adjusted for bullets you would conclude guns have never killed anyone. Meta analyses that didn’t make this elementary mistake found saturated fat does cause heart disease in a dose response manner (12)

Mechanistically, though, when you consider that [zonulin may increase intestinal permability](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/09/459061317/a-protein-in-the-gut-may-explain-why-some-cant-stomach-gluten); and that higher intestinal permeability may lead to greater amounts of lipopolysaccharides entering the bloodstream; and that the [immune system really hates LPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide#Health_effects), that it might at least be worth considering that there is something to the argument.

That's not really a problem of bias affecting the study - blueberries really are healthy -  it's a problem of selective research.

Pharm companies shouldn't be in charge of their research either. That is something that should just be nationalized IMO. The basic research is already 99% nationalized and funded by governments/universities. They just end up giving their results to private companies basically out of the goodness of their hearts to get the research out/lack of funding to do their own further research and distribution of the eventual drugs.

At the time the arguments were a bit disingenuous.

The Stanford prison experiment (SPE) was a social psychology experiment that attempted to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison officers. It was conducted at Stanford University on the days of August 14–20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. In the study, volunteers were assigned to be either ""guards"" or ""prisoners"" by the flip of a coin, in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the superintendent. Several ""prisoners"" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days.

Publication bias is a type of bias that occurs in published academic research. It occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings, and inserts bias in favor of positive results. The study of publication bias is an important topic in metascience.

https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/insulin-resistance-syndrome


It is described by the CDC as:

""A lot of blood sugar enters the bloodstream.

The pancreas pumps out more insulin to get blood sugar into cells.

Over time, cells stop responding to all that insulin—they’ve become insulin resistant.

The pancreas keeps making more insulin to try to make cells respond.

Eventually, the pancreas can’t keep up, and blood sugar keeps rising. ""

Yes. The cells stop responding because of the mechanism I described in my comment. These two sources do not contradict my statements, they just don't discuss a cause.

Sucrose is a compound composed of one molecule of glucose, and one molecule of fructose bound together. They are not at all the same, either in form or in effect on the human body.

The metabolic pathway they take is radically different. Fructose is more or less treated as a toxin, and converted directly into fat inside the liver in a highly inflammatory process that also promotes hepatic insulin resistance. Glucose goes down a completely different metabolic pathway, and is not nearly as strong of a motivator of metabolic dysfunction as fructose. 

Fructose also has an order of magnitude greater promotion of glycation (ie the Maillard reaction inside your body) than glucose, due to the much higher percentage of fructose molecules which are in the straight-chain form rather than the ring form (cyclic).

**Edit**: for clarity, the percentage of fructose molecules in straight-chain form at any given moment (they change back and forth in a process called mutarotation) is still objectively low, but it is many times greater than the percentage of straight-chained glucose, as the cyclic form of glucose is much more stable.

In fact, glucose has the most stable cyclic form of all six-carbon monosaccharides (hexoses), and in the evolutionary corner of the biology world the common theory is that the reason it is the dominant hexose used among living organisms, is that it has the lowest propensity to bind to (and damage) a critical group of proteins called amines, which is the process called glycation I mentioned above.",Cleistheknees,t2_4lgrp83i,83,0,reddit3

I have no reason to believe meat consumption is linked to heart disease. The mechanism of heart disease is atherosclerotic inflammation due to excessive insulin levels in the long term. People have wrongly correlated cholesterol as a driving factor in the past because it was easily testable, but is in fact a response to the inflamed arteries and not the cause. Total cholesterol is not an informative measure in health as there is good and bad cholesterol. Total LDL is not an informative measure in health as there is good and bad LDL that is rarely tested for. An NMR-lipoprotein test is required to see how much of each kind of LDL is present. Triglycerides are the only measurable cholesterol molecule that can be found on a basic test, and triglycerides consist of 3 fatty acid molecules bonded with one glycerol(sugar) molecule.

If the glucose is eliminated from the diet, the glycerols cannot be bound into triglycerides, and the existing triglyceride bonds get broken as the body consumes its excess glucose, releasing the lipids to circulate as free fatty acids which are then burned for energy.

And regarding metastudies, the individual studies themselves often offer different conclusions than the author of a metastudy may claim or infer. Also if the study itself is flawed, any metastudy using its data is inherently flawed. Often the conclusion of a study does not correlate with the data.

**SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF ROBERT LUSTIG’S FAT CHANCE**
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4161/7165cfc5cff26a18812495b64307a46a72b7.pdf

**Metabolic Effects of a Prolonged, Very-High-Dose Dietary Fructose Challenge in Healthy Subjects**
“ Methods: Ten healthy subjects (age: 28 ± 19 y; BMI: 22.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2) underwent comprehensive metabolic phenotyping prior to and 8 wk following a high-fructose diet (**150 g daily**). Eleven patients with NAFLD (age: 39.4 ± 3.95 y; BMI: 28.4 ± 1.25) were characterized as ""positive controls."" Insulin sensitivity was analyzed by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and postprandial interorgan crosstalk of lipid and glucose metabolism was evaluated, by determining postprandial hepatic and intra-myocellular lipid and glycogen accumulation, employing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7 T. Myocardial lipid content and myocardial function were assessed by 1H MRS imaging and MRI at 3 T.

Results: High fructose intake resulted in lower intake of other dietary sugars and did not increase total daily energy intake. Ectopic lipid deposition and postprandial glycogen storage in the liver and skeletal muscle were not altered. Postprandial changes in hepatic lipids were measured [Δhepatocellular lipid (HCL)_healthy_baseline: -15.9 ± 10.7 compared with ± ΔHCL_healthy_follow-up: -6.9 ± 4.6; P = 0.17] and hepatic glycogen (Δglycogen_baseline: 64.4 ± 14.1 compared with Δglycogen_follow-up: 51.1 ± 9.8; P = 0.42). Myocardial function and myocardial mass remained stable. As expected, impaired hepatic glycogen storage and increased ectopic lipid storage in the liver and skeletal muscle were observed in insulin-resistant patients with NAFLD.

Conclusions: **Ingestion of a high dose of fructose for 8 wk was not associated with relevant metabolic consequences in the presence of a stable energy intake, slightly lower body weight, and potentially incomplete absorption of the orally administered fructose load**. This indicated that young, metabolically healthy subjects can at least temporarily compensate for increased fructose intake.”

**Fructose Ingestion: Dose-Dependent Responses in Health Research**

“Estimates of fructose intake made from a national representative USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals indicated that >95% of persons aged >19 y consume <100 g/d from all sources (10). Similar intakes have been observed in studies of health professionals in men (11), women (12), young women (13) [see also Taylor and Curhan (14)], and female adolescents (10)...

Several intervention studies in diabetics and nondiabetics show fructose to markedly lower HbA1c (22–27)...

No evidence was uncovered via PubMed that <100 g/d fructose in exchange for other carbohydrate would impair insulin sensitivity in humans. Indeed, consistent with a lowering of HbA1c (Fig. 1A), insulin sensitivity was improved (24) (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, an excessive intake (250 g/d) is reported to cause insulin resistance (28) (Fig. 2), and intermediate but still very high or excessive doses (>100 g/d) can be without important effect (29,30). This provides weak evidence of possible dose dependency (Fig. 2) and strong reason to caution against extrapolating from excessive to moderate or high fructose intakes seen in the general population...

Meta-analysis of >40 human intervention studies show <100 g/d fructose is either without effect or may lower FPTG (Fig. 1 C) (10). FPTG was elevated significantly only by excessive fructose intake, dose-dependently (10)...Fructose is reported not to induce oxidative or inflammatory stress even at excessive dosage, 75 g in drinks (225g g equivalents/d) (42)...

Short- and intermediate-duration studies (∼<3 mo) show moderate and high fructose intakes in normal and diabetic subjects to have no practical or statistically significant effect on body weight (23,24,27,37,38,44–49). There is, however, some weak evidence (a few studies of short duration) that >200 g/d fructose might elevate body weight (44,50,51)...

Baseline information from 3 cohort studies indicates no association between the dose of fructose ingested and BMI (Fig. 4)...

Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and overweight or obesity (among others) generally characterize this syndrome. The evidence for each of these does not support a role for <100 g/d fructose in causation among the adult, and female adolescent, populations. Approximately 20% of adolescent males consume very high or excessive amounts of fructose (>100 g/d) from total sugars (10) and may, therefore, be subject to the balance of risk between marginally higher FPTG and potential lower HbA1c (Fig. 1)...

Although epidemiological evidence cannot indicate causality, the associations are consistent with fructose having a low glycemic index (19), lowering protein glycation (strongly evident), and improving insulin sensitivity (weakly evident) at doses <100 g/d (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, low-glycemic-index/GL carbohydrates lower HbA1c and fructosamine (glycated albumin) in similar intervention studies (strongly evident) (18,60). Further, prospective studies combined show a lower incidence of T2DM when GL is reduced...

Moderate doses of fructose have neutral or diametrically opposite effects to those expected for very high or excessive fructose intakes and show evidence of improved glycemic control. There is reason to believe that moderate fructose ingestion could be beneficial for public health, whereas excess intake would be a risk to health. Practical applications will depend on further research on a wider range of health risk factors than those mentioned here...

Animal studies often use doses of fructose in excess of what humans would normally consume and so have a high potential to mislead about the public health aspects of fructose.” https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/139/6/1246S/4670464",Only8livesleft,t2_q2l0ya3,1,0,reddit3

In the case of driving tests the research is arguably less complex and way more reproducible than testing of chemical compounds.   
Third parties can invest in the right measuring devices and given a good calibration their results are relatively easy to repeat and check, at least two tests can be performed in a normal workday.

Metabolism is just all the changes that occur to stuff you ingest, so in a certain sense everything affects it. Yes, fiber can slow the absorption of some nutrients at the brush border, and contributes to the mucosal lining of the gut, which prevents things you don’t want from absorbing (ie leaky gut syndrome). 

However, the speed at which fructose enters the bloodstream isn’t a critical piece of its problematic nature, as is the case with glucose. Fructose is still unable to be metabolized with insulin secretion, it still cannot be taken into cells via the normal GLUT4 transporter, and it’s still almost entirely metabolized in the liver and kidneys. In this case, the fructose load is the problem. None of those problems are dependent on the speed of fructose transport from the gut.

With regards to the *glucose* in fruit, yes the more fiber, the slower the glucose transport into the bloodstream, the better. A mellow-sloped insulin and glucose curve over an hour is much less taxing than a massive spike in 10 minutes, because you don’t run into the harmful effects of insulin until the levels get high and stay high (ie hyperinsulinemia).",Cleistheknees,t2_4lgrp83i,20,0,reddit3

Yes and no. The two kinds of HFCS you’ll find in foods are HFCS 42 and HFCS 55, and they are 42% fructose and 55% fructose respectively. The isotope trace studies I’ve seen haven’t shown any measurable metabolic difference between HFCS 55 and granulated sugar.

Fructolysis refers to the metabolism of fructose from dietary sources. Though the metabolism of glucose through glycolysis uses many of the same enzymes and intermediate structures as those in fructolysis, the two sugars have very different metabolic fates in human metabolism. Unlike glucose, which is directly metabolized widely in the body, fructose is almost entirely metabolized in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis. Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.

iugysvx,t1_iugiiir,2022-10-31 06:55:44,science,"There is significantly more nuance in the actual study than what you are presenting. Some key areas are as follows: 

1. And, as predicted, a significant interaction between participant gender and participant age in predicting perceived warmth (β = -0.027, p =.034 – see Fig. 3) emerged, supporting H2. Contrary to H2, however, the simple slope effect for women was not significant (β = -0.010, p =.342), but it was for men (β = 0.016, p =.030), and in a positive direction, indicating that middle-aged men were perceived as warmer than young-adult men but that there was no difference in warmth perceptions for younger compared to middle-aged women. Fig. 3 shows the relationship and, interestingly, though perceptions of women’s warmth across the age span visibly declines, the relationship is not significant. Thus, H2 is only partially supported; men and women are viewed as differing in warmth as they age, but it is men, and not women who are perceived as changing more, and in a positive direction.8

2. Given the downward trend for women from younger-adult to middle-age shown in Figure 3, H2 might have been confirmed in a larger sample and particularly-one with more female targets, who made up only 36% of participants in this sample. It is also worth noting that targets selected their own evaluators and as such, may have received more favorable warmth evaluations. Thus, our results may be more conservative (e.g., less stark for women) than if cross-evaluators were not chosen by targets. These results still offer some support for our theory in that they show that age-based prescriptions operate distinctly for women and men, and an expectation that people will generally increase in warmth as they age, with women being seen as failing to conform to this expectation.

There are also the results from study 3 worth noting:

Random effects analysis. Table 7 displays the base equation (model 1) and the within-person longitudinal test of H3A and H3B (model 2). Among the control variables, teaching in the MBA for Professionals (β = -0.183, p <.05) and citation counts are positively related to teaching evaluations (β = 0.000, p <.01). Relevant to our hypothesis tests, women receive more negative teaching evaluations (β = -0.662, p <.001), and lower evaluations when they are middle-aged compared to when they were younger and when they are older, as indicated by the significant coefficient for squared age (β = -0.002, p =.036). Moreover, the interaction between squared age and gender is significant (β = 0.005, p <.001). The form of this interaction in Fig. 4 reveals a significant decline in women’s teaching evaluations from young adulthood to middle age (and a rebound from middle age to older adulthood) supporting H3B, that women, even when compared to their own earlier and later performance on a learned skill, are rated the lowest when they are middle-aged. This contrasts with the pattern for men professors, as demonstrated in Table 7 and Fig. 4, whose teaching evaluations increase from young adulthood to middle age, supporting H3A. Cross-sectional and fixed effects analyses revealed the same pattern of results, which we report in S3.E and S3.B and Table S3.B1, respectively. It is worth noting that our predicted results emerge even including child-leaves in the models. Specifically, the number of child leaves taken did not significantly predict teaching evaluations (β = -0.052, p =.570).",PennName47,t2_3f3kiw40,197,0,reddit4

Maybe that’s just anecdotal or just my own bias, but I do believe there’s a layer of sexism to be discussed here.

As in we can agree that capitalism is the problem, or a problem (we don’t fully but we’re probably not far from each other on that topic), but we can still recognize that there’s an instance of capitalism that’s exactly like the current iteration, except without that specific layer of sexism, and that it would be net positive to women in aggregate if not to society as a whole.

Also, I do believe those questions are important even *outside* of the capitalist framework. Unless you can envision an absolutely measurable and objective notion of merit, or a system that does not rely on some notion of merit to begin with, then the question of how merit is assessed and rewarded (be it through promotion, money or something else entirely) and whether arbitrary notions like gender ethnicity etc plays a part will remain.

All of that to say that I don’t fully disagree with you, but I do believe capitalism and sexism are pretty orthogonal (i.e. when you speak about sexism in the context of capitalism, you’re speaking about sexism in general, or, sure, solving sexism will not fix capitalism, but you won’t throw away sexism by throwing away capitalism either)",GeorgeS6969,t2_glnpc9c,1,0,reddit4

However, I still love my job at its core so I needed to figure out how to have a more self preserving stance at work that would allow me to still do the job I love without feeling taken advantage of. I simply started saying ""no thanks"" to optional extra tasks that were asked of me when I really didn't want to do them. A recent convo went like this. "" Hey would you be okay with doing xyz?"" Me: ""Oh no thanks but thank you for asking."" ...This resulted in me getting pulled into the office the next day to ask me if I was OKAY. lollll...This happened literally only because I said no. Once. The expectation is there to go above and beyond with a smile on your face at all times.

The study is not about how happy employees are drained out of their energy, it's about changes in happiness levels during the day drain employees.

For those who don't want to read the entire article:

To have the employees feel the least depleted of energy at the end of the day, their mood should:

\- follow a linear path > not going from unhappy to happy several times a day but slowly progress from one level to the other

\- follow a slow progression > not going from super happy the morning to borderline suicidal at the end of the day (or vice versa)

\- decline during the day > happiest point in the beginning and progressing toward less happiness at the end of the day

\- last but not least, happiness should be overall high. As they state in the study: \[Quote\] ""we do not deny that end-states which achieve hedonic goals are advantageous- this general consensus formed extends to our work on resource depletion as well. However, our work also suggests that the is more to the story"" \[/Quote\]

Not only did the managers get paid more to deal with difficult customers they were in a much better position to solve the problem if at all possible. Made my job really easy because I only dealt with regular/happy customers who appreciated my “service with a smile” which made my day feel better. 

Now that I’m in somewhat of a management position, I take all the blame and deflect all the credit. It’s relatively easy for me to make my teams life easier (making sure we have adequate budget, negotiating for realistic deadlines, being lax with schedules when we’re slow, getting buy in from the team before I commit on deliverables), this means the team can do their best work which makes my life easier. If everyone on my team does what their supposed, we’re all good. Don’t need them to go above and beyond.

As a manager this is how I look at: If someone stops going ""above and beyond"" their actual duties, maybe we should look at whether this behavior was rewarded financially (or via promotion etc) or not by their employer/manager? You'd have to be a fool to keep going above and beyond if it nets you no benefit and actually is a drain on you personally.

Companies and managers cause ""quiet quitting"" not the employees themselves.

Part of my job is to help those willing to go above and beyond grown into new roles, responsibilities etc. But those who just want to get their job done well/professionally and call it a day are a valuable part of the team as well.

I didn’t go any higher because the glass ceiling was very low for women at that company but with my hourly rate plus regular OT of about 10 hrs a week I was making more than the salaried supervisors who also had to work a mandatory 50hr week. My current job I expressed wanting to set my career goal with the company at a senior CDM position around my 6-month point. I just had my 1 year anniversary and I was told last month I was getting promoted. So in these two instances hard work paid off and my current career goal won’t have my supervisor feeling threatened that I will compete with her for advancement.

I have no interest in management positions. I’m more of the type who prefers to master the job and teach others to do the same. So I think this mindset might explain why I have no trouble getting promotions since I’m putting myself in a position to complement my supervisor/manager to help make the team stronger.

A lot of people grew up poor or had poor family back in the day (think Boomers generation). So getting a job so you don't have to labour in the field or go hungry was a blessing. It meant a huge step up in terms of the quality of life you could lead.

Their kids (Gen X) were at the tail end of this fortune and parroted what they were told because dad and grandpa could afford a home, a car, 4 kids and a vacation on one salary. Things were changing even before the millennials came along but the philosophy of hard work and loyalty stuck with the older generation. They influenced the youth and didn't adequately prepare them.

And how could they? They haven't had to experience growing up again, student debt, low paying entry level jobs they require experience and a master's degree...they are looking forward to retirement after 40 years at the same company.

Teachers also want their students to succeed by working hard. But at school you work hard for you. At work it's for the company. At school you got an A and maybe dad bought you a toy. At work you get more work. You needed to be born in the right family with the right connections to not have to worry about money or success.

A better analogy would be if every A you got, the teacher would get a raise. You would just get more work to maintain that A grade, and maybe some praise.

So we all have different ideas of what ""quiet quitting"" actually means, based on our own personal perception of what our respective jobs entail.

gt00ped,t3_mhhrw3,2021-04-01 05:33:56,science,"Gaming is an industry where this is most obvious and blatant. Most people working entry level in gaming are on contracts, meaning they earn hourly, get no overtime, and should the work environment become unfavorable (it always does) they can't get out from under their terrible boss(es). Oftentimes, ""crunch"" (or overtime) isn't technically required by employers, however it is absolutely expected. If you're a contracted worker, then at best they let your contract run its course and don't hire you back as a full time employee. If you're a good little boy and you work your life away (literally), they might hire you on full time, so that this time when they threaten and extort you into slaving away for other people's happiness, you might at least be paid for it. 

Not to mention, many employers will look for fresh faced passionate artists and programmers with no experience specifically in order to take advantage of their passion, so now the employer doesn't need to extort or threaten the employee, because he knows the employee will ruin his life by himself because his passion will drive him into voluntarily working overtime and crunching 24/7. What's worse, is people actually defend ""crunch culture"", and defend the mistreatment of these workers. One argument that I've personally heard more than I'd like to have heard is ""they aren't required to crunch in their contracts, it's not like they have a gun to their head"". Except you absolutely do. Your reputation, your job, your passion, your projects, your income, and especially your sanity, are all on the chopping block if you don't crunch. If you don't crunch, your employer (as mentioned before) won't hire you back when your contract runs out.

It starts with the executive leader. If they’re someone with narcissistic tendencies, they’ll immediately fire anyone who doesn’t soothe their profound insecurities. Aka “professionally kiss their ass”. Competencies will not matter- just their ability to be a sycophant.

These sycophants are then vested with hiring and management authority. Being narcissistic themselves, the cycle repeats one layer lower. And continues all the way down until the lowest supervisory level.  One or two conscientious people might by accident be in managerial roles, but they’ll be pushed out or leave of their own accord because the entire organization will be toxic .

Often, people might decide to “change the system from within”. They don’t realize until the end that changing the system from within requires firing 90% of the decision makers. Naturally this would break the organization- meaning once narcissistic people have entrenched into multiple management layers, it’s more expedient to just close the organization and start over. 

Ethics and truth take a backseat to making the next layer up look good. Appearances and fraud take precedence. Lies , more lies, and damn lies become daily operating procedure. In these organizations upward mobility goes to those who lie the best. Meanwhile, job turnovers at 60% while the management competes to show who gives the fewest fucks about their direct reports.

He made the conscious decision to use the chaos method because it would keep the department heads at odds with each other and speed of the leader = speed of the crew. Departments did not mingle or fraternize and that was his goal.

See, there was nothing stopping anyone from striking out and opening up their own company to compete with him so he made sure everyone hated everyone else to keep people from getting chatty with other bosses of other departments say, at lunch and over time, you amass a group of people that, together had the ability to open their own company and run it.

I know it sounds asinine but it worked. He steered his company to #1 in it's sector in sales and was able to go public on NASDAQ, get acquired by a NYSE listed company a few years later and then gobbled up by one of the largest hospitality and resort ownership outfits out there with literally dozens of brands from hotels to car rentals to real estate.

When he sold out, he cashed a check for 200 million in 1995 freedom bucks.

I ran into the boss of the outfit years later and asked him if it was true his chaos system was deliberate. He just laughed and nodded his head. Turns out his biggest fear (other than a disgruntled customer driving a truck through his front doors) was having 4 or 5 supervisory level kids from the departments that mattered put it all together , quit and go start their own outfit to compete with him.",way2funni,t2_3ku6r,679,0,reddit3

Once corner-cutting is baked into a corporate culture, it can exist only as long as nobody questions it. Such an organization is going to be precluded from doing business with legitimate companies who have reputations to protect and screen both vendors and customers for red flags. Getting outside investment becomes much more difficult when you have to open your books to an auditor. Any business transaction they might get with a government agency suddenly elevates what might have been explained away as sloppiness into knowing that on any day, someone might question a number, and the lie that will be given starts the wheels of a criminal case.

Ken Lay (Enron) is a fascinating example of this; he had a history of clearly ignoring rules and falsifying financial information - from expense reports up - and while he created a culture that could thrive on bravado and a herd mentality - the outcome was inevitable.

So, I was engaged to a guy who was absolutely a sociopath as became apparent when he thought he had that relationship on a lock - he met every single category in the DSM IV and I would assume he met the criteria for anti-social personality disorder under the DSM-V as well.  The unique thing about personality disorders is, with the exception of borderline personality disorder, the illness serves the person well.  They’re disorders that hurt those around the individual.  

A pattern of rule breaking, risk taking, deception, etc. along with glib superficial charm - the traits of anti-social personality disorder - are beneficial in cut-throat businesses.  The same could be said of narcissism.  Is it ultimately good for the company or employees?

gt0cs67,t3_mhhrw3,2021-04-01 08:36:59,science,"Hell yes. At least, if not the company CEOs then for sure some highest level execs choose lick fraudsters. To validate the Smith research with examples:

I'm worked for several companies like that. In one the VP pf marketing hired (on purpose) a sales manager who was a sociopathic liar. Both conned the company for one year and then the company failed drastically. Both went on the next companies to lie to. The sales guy became so notorious in Silicon Valley that he had to escape back to India where he runs real estate scams.

At another high tech company, one whole department had nothing but dishonest VPs and engineers. I was hired in there, found all the fraud, and blew the whistle to senior management. One day the corrupt lying VP came to my desk and physically threatened me (he was a Sikh who carries a knife as part of the religion) then fired me and walked me to the door. After a year, the department failed, the company sold off the entire division and took a huge loss. And that is why Microsoft should never trust Micron again after they fucked up your large cloud hardware project.

My main point on this, it is not uncommon in high tech for there to be unethical bosses, and this school's research is spot on.

gt0j8vm,t3_mhhrw3,2021-04-01 10:00:05,science,"I'm in my fifties and this is what we generally used to call a ""good ol boys"" business. It's a systemic environment of corruption that everyone goes along with, because ""that's just the way it is"". 

They're still around of course, but much less common the bigger the business. It tends to still run rampant in small stores or companies - especially the more rural they are.

...ok, this really triggered some strong memories for me, so I apologize for the tangent I'm about to go on.

I'm from a military family, and also served from the early 80's till the 00's. The VA used to operate with a good ol boys mentality too, but thankfully, after a *lot* of bloodletting over many years, most VA's are run the way most modern businesses are. In terms of workplace environment - not technology or procedures so much.

I always hated working jobs at places with that kind of environment. Because while the workers got away with as much as their bosses would let them, *those* bosses also got away with as much as *their* bosses let them. And so on till you got to the owners. The net result is that if you were at the bottom, you got screwed.

Everything was shady, everyone was suspicious, or paranoid (usually both), and everyone gossiped about everyone else. The only way to get ahead was by knowing someone, or sleeping with someone. When I finally went in the military, I thought I'd gone to heaven. Don't get me wrong, the military had their own version of it, but to such a lesser degree. 

These days, now that most company's employees operate at a much higher level of integrity and ethics, the military has become a comparative utopia in terms of integration, equality, honesty and merit based advancement.

Of course those other negative things still exist everywhere humans are, but overall things are so much better now than they were. If you want to know what life was like just 50 or 60 years ago, watch season two of The Man in the High Castle. Especially episode 7. For me, it felt like re-living my life in Texas in the 70's and 80's as I went from pre-adolescence to my teens. My older siblings remember that time as being America's golden age. My younger sister and I knew better. We saw under the veneer.

Starting about five years ago, it looked like all those old ways were about to come crashing back into American life. My sister and I and nearly all my nieces and nephews (two generations worth totaling close to 23) became more and more worried that we were about to slip back into that environment. 

Fortunately, it turned out most folks in the country *don't* want to go back to that way of living. 

**caveat:** yes, I'm very well aware there's still a lot of corporate corruption and shady business practices - mostly practiced by larger companies. And I know it's a very big problem. As a matter of fact I'd argue it might be the biggest threat to democracies globally. I was talking about the specific atmosphere of shadiness that permeated most businesses not too long ago. That's what triggered these memories I just shared.",pdgenoa,t2_ru8by,1,0,reddit3

Sadly I was one of the employees for a long time. All I wanted to ever do was update the Facebook page and be with the kids, but she forced me to meet with investors, architects, special educators, all who thought she had a wonderful vision (I made it sound like that) and would blatantly cheat them of their money and time or portray something that was completely false about the school (such as we have 3 special educators on hand when we had none..)

Our district was the best in the country, won multiple awards, etc etc. All without being asked to conduct morally reprehensible business. The higher ups wanted more after his promotion and found a guy who was more than willing to commit acts of fraud or use questionable tactics to achieve whatever numbers the top brass wanted. One store complied and by the time I got fired they were using fake social security numbers to sign up dead people, who they found in the obituaries, for AT&T services, fraudulently signing up new customers as businesses, and adding new lines of services without consent. All of these was at the behest of the new district manager. Those of us who weren’t compliant were fired and replaced with people from the evil store or by new people willing to follow the directions of the new district manager. 

They were all busted in the end, but not fired or even reprimanded. AT&T/Prime Communications swept it all under the rug and promoted a few people out of state or transferred them to new stores to avoid the customers they defrauded.

As one pays attention, it usually turns out that the person received the position by making someone else appear falsely incompetent. Now, he/she fears actual competent people and look for ways to hide, undermine, or outright get rid of the person.

Consider: Pretty much the whole of America participated in the slow extermination, ""resettlement,"" and conquest of native Americans and their territory. Jews have been targeted by tons of different religious and ethnic groups over time. Slavery was bought into by many people. Eugenics was incredibly popular at one point. The majority of men were perfectly happy with the insane amount of control they had over their wives at many points in history. 

The traits that enable this kind of bad behavior do not require psychopathy, they require viewing an Us versus a Them, belief in the superiority of Us and the dehumanization of Them. Which is unfortunately very normal. In capitalist systems, the Us is the ""entrepreneur"" and the ""Them"" is labor and customers. 

As long as you see ""Them"" as inferior and not fully human, you can do awful things to them. Especially if they're abstract: you never personally have to tell someone you're refusing to make good on the insurance they bought. You don't have to listen to them yell or cry or die. You hire plebs to do that work. And the plebs also ""benefit"" from the anonymity of acting behind the corporate veil. It's called psychological distance. ""It's not MY fault. It's the company's.

gt0xghg,t1_gszsc4m,2021-04-01 12:46:52,science,"I don't think it's psychopathy or even low-to-no empathy personalities. Lots of these people probably have empathy in some situations, but not others. Technically, this is true of psychopaths, but it's also true of everyone to some degree. Do you feel empathy for a child molester being raped and beaten prison? What percent of people in authoritarian societies feel empathy for slaves, or the otherwise oppressed? Some, but not all. Shutting off empathy is a feature of normal humanity. 

In entrepreneurship it's often not even true empathy, because the harm is often deluded. Employees are still getting paid, and lots of businesses go under... part of life. The other victims tend to be financial institutions, large corporations, and wealthy investors. Many risky investments fizzle out. It's their fault for not being wise with their investments. Who cares about a rich asshole losing money, or the plight of a soulless corporation?

Psychopathy is a disorder (controversial and no longer a real diagnosis AFAIK, but even using your soft definition of ""low empathy"", that would be a disorder in my view). I think relatively normal people can do these kinds of things quite easily. We have a culture of hucksters in the USA. Some people think it's all in the game. In a way it probably is. Average people can be jerks too.

The reason I push back at this diagnosis, is that it confuses the issue. The average normal person is capable of doing these kinds of things under the right circumstances. When accountability is diffused, the harm to victims goes unseen, or the victim is dehumanized or vilified. People will do awful things under these circumstances.

Which system, I don't know. Less hierarchies and bureaucracy help, because then you have to deal with humans not numbers. This rules out corporate structures as well as state socialism (what they call communism in the US).

Survival of the fittest means “the ability to do whatever it takes to survive”? You assume ruthlessness is always the most beneficial trait. Could there be a world in which survival depends on one’s ability to collaborate and share, because any individual’s survival depends on well-being of the collective? Yes it certainly could. In fact this is already our present condition, especially if considered from a planet-wide perspective. But this reality is obscured by the ideology of capitalism — especially the deeply-held belief that capitalism is “natural”, and that exploitative capitalist practices mirror “the law of the jungle”.

I very briefly skimmed the paper, but the authors motivate their paper using a prior research that finds an association between ""dark pattern"" personality traits and earnings management (which is a huge area of focus in accounting research).

The authors extend this research to ask, in situations where pushing ethical boundaries (earnings management) has benefits to the company, is management more likely to hire someone who is likely to do that?

This is specifically looking at an accounting topic, earnings management, but it's still relevant outside of the area. There appears to be a lot of research on the behavior of people with these ""dark pattern"" traits. So you could use some of that research and say, ""we have evidence about the effects of candidate personality traits on hiring decisions in an accounting context, we expect to see similar effects in other contests.""

I see your point, but think the effect of leadership or political influence is a disproportionate factor when considering the system as a whole - that is to say, if one was to apportion a ratio of cause and effect, it is the ""active manipulators"" that are more causual in creating the systems - normally by using people's emotional insecurity as leverage to insert ""solutions"" that benefit them and aggregate power / control, as opposed to the idea stemming from a group's desires.

""Less hierarchies and bureaucracy"" probably means less globalization and trade and an emphasis on smaller-scale communities of 200 people at absolute maximum. I think global trade has beneficial elements and world peace created through economic interdependence is unambiguously good, so I have an idea of politics organized as groups of 20-30 people who choose representatives to groups of 20-30 people, and so on until you have a council of 20-30 people who between them directly or indirectly represent everyone in the entire world.

But there's a fine line between that and psychopathy, and I suspect a lot of the intellectual underpinning of our modern world was laid by people like that who thought everyone thought like them, unaware that they were ultimately providing the justification for narcissistic psychopaths to subjugate everyone else.)",MorganWick,t2_k6tyz,7,0,reddit3

gt1lkke,t1_gt1js7c,2021-04-01 16:06:26,science,"Maybe it's just my bias, but from what I gather I think video games are different in the sense that there's a lot of people who get into this field who crunch voluntarily. I don't necessarily mean crunch that's enforced by employers, but crunch stemming from believing in a project, self-financing it, etc. That's why I mentioned the 90s, because there seems to have been a lot of developers in that era who pushed their ideas on their own. With time, that self-imposed crunch started being abused by employers, and it ended up becoming some sort of a norm that was expected of most people.

>alternatively for people who crunch voluntarily, have a limited amount of time that the employee is allowed to crunch so that they don't get carried away by their passion for the art and force them to take a break from crunching

In these discussions I rarely see people mention this, but I think if you solve this issue the other kind of crunch will be alleviated as well, or even disappear. I'm not sure how you do this, though. I've personally seen that even when employers don't engage in crunch directly, it ends up happening automatically. Part of it stems from some sort of social pressure to put in the hours.

Say you see one guy staying after 8 hours to finish up something, if enough people do that it can snowball and there's a sort of unseen, unsaid expectation of not leaving early. This in particular is also abused by employers, esp. when there's talk of ""teamwork"". One thing I've seen is that employees would be forced to leave their work place after say 8 hours, but they could then continue working on at home; that way you don't have that aura of pressure around. But it's not perfect, in most of tech industry you're connected to most of the work everyone does; esp. now with covid.

Part of this issue is also related to age and work experience; most of the video game devs I know who do self-imposed crunch are in their early to mid 20s; have no family or other similar obligations to take of, and are solely focused on their careers. It's no different than say a doctor or a lawyer putting in 80hour+/weeks.",,,3,0,reddit3

gt0yyr4,t1_gt03tn5,2021-04-01 13:02:05,science,"This is more of a thesis on how the writers viewed the arche-types on The Office than an attempt at actually understanding the real business world. There are obviously truths the writers of The Office put into the show, but it’s of course exaggerated for comedic effect.

There’s really nothing illuminating here unless you are a fan of The Office or you like to read about the theories behind these characters, like a sort of TVTropes.

Sociopaths are not fast-tracked to the top, you’d be hard pressed to find an executive without many years of experience in the field.

We know short-term thinking is pervasive in companies, and it is incentivized. It’s actually crazy that it’s not as pervasive as it could be.

Sometimes people try to have others take the fall, but it doesn’t always work, and we have no idea how often that happens, much less something all “competent” executives do. To have this be the sole reason incompetent people are promoted to middle-management is not a credible thesis. 

Even in this thesis only those that over-perform get promoted. So are they promoted because they are easily molded by upper management like some House of Cards-type conniving or because they are over-performing?

I see no reason why The Peter Principle isn’t one the main contributing factors to this phenomenon. The only critique of it from that article was that “executives are smart,” but they are not. Most of the time they are as clueless as middle-management *because* of The Peter Principle. Shareholders are usually more clueless than the executives. 

Many people think that the profit-motive is enough of an incentive to create a meritocracy where the best people rise to the top, when we know this isn’t the case. 

Even where the incentive works as intended, it’s a slow-as-molasses process that gets even slower the bigger and more liquid a company / the economy gets. Horribly run large companies take forever to degrade to the point of bankruptcy because they can keep borrowing to cover their mistakes. It usually takes a recession to take them down unless the government props them up as we saw last year.

The reason why The Peter Principle hits the nail on the head: Economists are starting to realize that a lot of classical economics doesn’t work in the real world due to sociological behaviors; one of these behaviors is manifested in the phenomenon known as “sticky wages”. Even if there is reason to decrease wages due to changing economic factors, companies hesitate to do so (this also seems to go against the idea that most companies are sociopathic and pragmatic), instead, waiting until conditions get so bad they have to let go a sizable amount of workers in a reorg. 

As it is for wages, the exact same is true for promotions. **Management is unlikely to demote someone after they’ve proven incapable of doing the job they’ve been promoted to because it will look bad on them. It’s not their problem anymore. There’s no real incentive to do so.**

As for the minimum work Losers, it’s just that some people are driven and/or want a more material life in exchange for putting in grueling hours and sacrificing their personal life and some people aren’t that way.

Lastly, not all executives are as clued into the capitalist system, or they wouldn’t be executives, they’d just be capitalists and take in that passive income; it’s just that they have more money than they know what to do with and invest more in the stock market.

They don’t luck into getting paid that much, there are only so many people with the necessary skills, personality (including sociopathy in some cases, but also drive and a need for more power/wealth), and experience to do the job. It’s the same reason why entertainers and athletes get over-paid for the work they do. 

They may be getting over-paid, but at least they are still doing what needs to be done in the economy rather than capitalists who do little to nothing for the world.

As well, science is cold and logical and factual. It takes all emotion out of things. This is arguably a good thing, but makes pesky things like good/evil, right/wrong, moral/immoral, etc. impossible to quantify. And you're right, evil has no place in science. But that doesn't make evil nonexistent. 

I agree that there is a lot of stigma associated with the word evil, and that it is an ever changing concept. But you seem to be under the impression that evil is a permanent thing when it is not. Probably the church's fault. ""If you commit a sin, you are a sinner. You must repent or you will go to hell and get skewered with a thousand needles! But worry not! Just be a member of my flock and you'll go to heaven!"" - some pastor or whatever. But nobody is always good, never evil. It's an impossible standard to live up to.

>Evil is a thing you attribute to intentional acts which cause pain and suffering

I didnt take the powerlessness to be putting the police in any sort of victim role, I took it as while the situation can definitely be improved if cops always did everything right, the underlying issue would still exist. and ultimately they just deal with the symptoms rather than the root issue(not trying to minimize police brutality just framing the pov  of the bigger picture)

gt15ik3,t1_gt082jr,2021-04-01 14:01:51,science,"What you have is a blessing, the Stoics thought it was basically on the path to enlightenment. What makes someone good or bad is clearly not about what emotions they feel. Many horrible people do things out of passion or even because they think it’s right. What makes people good or bad is really just higher-order thinking and reasoning skills. There’s always a good reason behind every morally right action. Take enlightened self-interest to heart. You don’t have to do selfish things simply because you can. If you were smart you would do good things because you know it will likely benefit you in the end.

For instance, helping someone pick up groceries that fell seems like a pretty selfless act, but it’s really not. By doing so you are literally fostering a community that will bend at your will. If you are ever incapable of helping yourself, this debt will be repaid if you’re successful in your efforts. Every action like this has a cumulative ripple effect throughout society. Karma is true in a way, reasonable actions often beget reasonable actions and unreasonable actions often beget unreasonable actions. If you’re smart you’d think deeply about why society considers something good or bad and whether or not it would be reasonable for you to “emulate” these actions in the long run.

If you see something you know society will find wrong, find a way to make money by fixing it and doing good things. Most people are good and want to reward good, if you are clever enough to figure out how. If you have to resort to what society considers immoral, then you’re just dumb and not very smart.

\>We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data from adults (n = 10,248) in the 2015–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

They looked at THREE YEARS of survey data from the CDC's NHANES report, which asks the question ""What did you eat over the last 24 hours"".  This survey is conducted with a random sample of US population at random times over the year. [https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DR1IFF\_J.htm](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DR1IFF_J.htm)

\>The in-person interview was conducted in a private room in the NHANES MEC. A set of measuring guides (various glasses, bowls, mugs, bottles, household spoons, measuring cups and spoons, a ruler, thickness sticks, bean bags, and circles) was available in the MEC dietary interview room for the participant to use for reporting amounts of foods (NHANES Measuring Guides for the Dietary Recall Interview). Upon completion of the in-person interview, participants were given measuring cups, spoons, a ruler, and a food model booklet, which contained two-dimensional drawings of the various measuring guides available in the MEC, to use for reporting food amounts during the telephone interview. Telephone dietary interviews were collected 3 to 10 days following the MEC dietary interview and were generally scheduled on a different day of the week as the MEC interview. Only a small number of participants (n=99) were interviewed on the same day of the week for both day 1 and day 2 interviews due to their scheduling availability. Any participant who did not have a telephone was given a toll-free number to call so that the recall could be conducted.  


My 24 hour period in the study is not the same day as your 24 hour period, so we are not introducing any bias towards specific days of the week or year that might not be representative (Eg, Christmas or Super Bowl Sunday).  That is controlled for in this study and results.

Yes, some people may eat beef only one day a week, and if you didn't catch them on that day then their response does not represent that person's typical consumption.  But in a normally distributed population like we have here (per the survey methodology) this averages out with all the people we happened to catch on the one day a week they happen to eat a LOT of meat.",diabloman8890,t2_g6x7v,1211,0,reddit1

I question this a bit, since most world environmental organizations place this number around 20-25% (which is not the same as 33%).

“… beef industry produces 8-10 times more emissions than chicken, and over 50 times more than beans”

Great, so what does that mean quantitatively? It’s a relative comparison that provides no numerical specificity for the beef industry itself.

“A mere 12% of ***Americans*** eat half the nations beef”

… so the initial statistic of the GLOBAL food industry is irrelevant if we’re only talking about Americans.

Everything about this headline is useless.

A more effective way to describe this would’ve been:

 “The American beef industry produces X% of human produced greenhouse emissions, with Y% of Americans contributing.” Or something similar.

Did you know that greenhouse gas emissions due to cattle farming can be reduced by 99% by just feeding them some seaweed or not feeding them only on corn? But yeah, let's just confuse the issue and continue misleading people into thinking that personal choices have an affect on the environment.

It's almost always industry choices that cause the impacts. You taking shorter showers to conserve water is comically eclipsed by agriculture water use. Recycling plastic does nothing because the vast majority of it can't actually be recycled; plastic pollution is due to companies insisting on making everything plastic even it's product packaging that will be thrown away as soon as it's purchased. Your car's exhaust is eclipsed by industrial vehicle emissions like tractor trailer trucks and planes.

After all, if you're just growing cow musculature, you're not growing a digestive tract that blasts methane into the atmosphere, and you could probably power the meat lab with mostly green energy. And of course, you'd be investing less water, time and nutrients than is required to grow an ENTIRE cow to slaughtering age. What's more, since the meat would be grown in the labs, it'd technically be veal starting out, but without the atrocities involved in actual veal production. Hell, if it costs more to age the beef, that'd mean that lab-grown veal would probably be cheaper than mature beef.

However, the enemy is trying to fight back against the emerging field of cultured meat. Meaning that we have to strike back with sevenfold force and fury, to cripple the lobbyists that would dare threaten OUR superior future.",DrSmirnoffe,t2_dzgr4,-8,0,reddit1

If you do not survey the same person over time to create a time series, then all you can say is that on a given day, some 12% were disproportionate consumers. On another day, some *possibly different* 12% were disproportionate consumers.

They compare across demographic groups to show that these have differences. This is valid. e.g.

> In bivariate logistic regression models, disproportionate beef consumption was significantly associated with gender; males were 1.55 times (95% CI 1.24, 1.93) more likely to be disproportionate beef consumers than females. Disproportionate beef consumption ranged across race/ethnicity categories, from 8.2% for non-Hispanic Asians to 14.1% for those who were other/multiracial.

So men are 50% more likely to be disproportionate consumers than women. Similarly, Mexicans are 11% more likely to disproportionately consume than Non-Hispanic Whites. Your point about sampling is that you can sample different groups like this over time and compare their averages, which is fine.

But there is no group identified that's 12% of the population and eats 50% of the beef. Across different demographic groups, about 8-15% disproportionately consume each day. The actual statement involving 12 and 50 is that each day, about 12% of the population eats 50% of the beef. There is no evidence that it is the same 12% each day, or that there is some 12% subgroup consuming 50% over time.",Drisku11,t2_bg6v5,144,0,reddit1

But in a normally distributed population like we have here (per the survey methodology) this averages out with all the people we happened to catch on the one day a week they happen to eat a LOT of meat.

is just wrong.

We have two samples from each participant.  If we assume everybody eats the same amount of beef and on average eat it once every ten days, the following code will simulate sampling this:

    #!/usr/bin/python3

    import random
    import collections

    chance_of_eating_beef_on_a_day = 0.1
    number_of_samples_per_person = 2
    number_of_people_to_sample = 10_000

    num_beef_eating = [sum(int(random.random() < chance_of_eating_beef_on_a_day) for _ in 
    range(number_of_samples_per_person)) for unused in range(number_of_people_to_sample)]

    def make_distribution(s):
      d = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 0)
      for x in s:
        d[x] += 1
      return dict(d)

    dist = dict(sorted(make_distribution(num_beef_eating).items()))
 
    print(f'Beef eater distribution: {dist}')

Running this code gives the following output:

    Beef eater distribution: {0: 8096, 1: 1811, 2: 93}

Ie, even if everybody eats the same amount of beef every ten days, this sampling algorithm will claim that under 20% of people eat all the beef.

So your conclusions are wrong.  And **the subject that is being posted here is not the same conclusion as in the article**.

The first sentence of the article is ""A new study has found that 12% of Americans are responsible for eating half of all beef consumed **on a given day**"" [emphasis mine], which is entirely different from ""all beef consumed overall"" (which this reddit post claims.)",eek04,t2_5v61f,38,0,reddit1

On the other hand, most special days for eating or not eating meat are religious and/or occur on weekends or holidays, some of which are also federal/national holidays, when people are less likely to be participating in or running a survey. e.g., you won't capture Catholics skipping meat on Fridays during Lent unless you survey on Saturdays during Lent, you won't capture your average American eating way too much Turkey on Thanksgiving unless you manage to catch them on Black Friday, and you won't capture Jews eating less beef for the Rosh Hashanah eve seder unless they participate in a survey during the first day of Rosh Hashanah. Or July 4th barbecues when the 4th is just before a weekend, or because so many people just take that week off anyway.

I doubt that would move the needle much here, but there are absolutely reasons the survey could systematically under count days of abstention or over consumption, simply because those days are not normally distributed and in fact are disproportionately concentrated in periods where people simply are not going to be available for in-person surveys.",stult,t2_43rkt,1,0,reddit1

Upon completion of the in-person interview, participants were given measuring cups, spoons, a ruler, and a food model booklet, which contained two-dimensional drawings of the various measuring guides available in the MEC, to use for reporting food amounts during the telephone interview. Telephone dietary interviews were collected 3 to 10 days following the MEC dietary interview and were generally scheduled on a different day of the week as the MEC interview. Only a small number of participants (n=99) were interviewed on the same day of the week for both day 1 and day 2 interviews due to their scheduling availability.

To put some hard numbers on this:  

 * Average US beef consumption is [55 pounds](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/How-much-beef-is-consumed-per-person-in-the-US) per person per year.  
 * 55lb x 454g/lb / 365d/yr = **68g** per person per day on average.  
 * A typical amount to serve at dinner is [1/4 to 3/4lb](https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-right-amount-of-meat-to-serve-per-person-112577) (uncooked weight), depending on the dish.  
 * 1/4lb = 114g, 1/2lb = 227g, 3/4lb = 341g  

If the only beef meals were averages (0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4lb) with the beef-containing ones being of equal probability, we'd see:  

 * P x 114g + P x 227g + P x 341g + (1-3xP) x 0g = 68g of beef per day  
 * Solving for P, we get 682P = 68, so P = 10%  

Thus, using just averages, we would expect to see among 100 dinners:  
 * 10 x 114g beef  
 * 10 x 227g beef  
 * 10 x 341g beef  
 * 70 x 0g beef  
In other words, 10% of people consumed 50% of the beef, *exactly as we see in the paper's results*.

There are some additional complexities (e.g., people eating beef for lunch instead of dinner), but to a first approximation **the paper's results are basically what we should expect to see from infrequent but largely uniform beef consumption**.",grundar,t2_cqlcs,73,0,reddit1

Now if you have someone else who eats half a frequently as you do, 1/14th of them will be classified as having eaten beef. They eat half as much as you do, so on average they contribute half as much to the final tally.  

In the end everything averages out, provided you have a large enough sample. Some people who eat infrequently have eaten on that day, and some people who eat frequently have not eaten on that day.

The question is, what’s the purpose of this article. What are we supposed to do with it. Stop eating meat?

I hate when poor science is used against the masses in this way. We need red meat. Red meat, provides us the nutrients we can’t get from other protein sources. Utilization of science, as a means to discourage consumption of an otherwise perfectly fine food source, is abhorrently wrong.

There's also the factor that for a large amount of the world, having an entire country or even half of one go Vegan isn't feasible. They may not have the tools for large scale agriculture, they may not have the climate for it, it may end up costing far more than a mixed diet, etc. Sure, in the US and Europe it's easy to go ""I'll just get the vegan patty instead of the regular one"" but that's not as easy in, say, Nigeria, which has an almost as large population as the US.

So maybe if you got half of the wealthiest quarter of the world population to quit meat entirely, or alternatively got all of them to cut their meat consumption in half, you'd be left with about 2% global emissions cut. But that's not accounting for the additional emissions from the increased agricultural production, which would add back a little over 1%, assuming a vegan's diet produces a little more than half as much CO2 as a regular diet, which according to a quick Google search it does.

So you'd be left with a reduction of maybe 0.8% annually if you're lucky, if you manage to go through with the monumental task of getting every other person in the west to never eat meat again. And, I mean, good luck with that. Realistically half of that group would laugh in your face, and the rest would either refuse or play along but ""forget"" about it after a few months. Any international vegan campaign short of establishing a global dictatorship to ban meat would realistically only be able to cut anywhere from 0.2% to 0.05% of world emissions, and that's a HIGH estimate. 

For comparison, the annual net change in CO2 from cropland is currently 1.4%. Deforestation makes up around 2.2% a year. Crop burning, the act of setting cropland ablaze to clear out old plants after a harvest (quicker than collecting leftovers manually), makes up 3.5%.

There are MUCH better places to start reducing emissions than to force people over to a plant based diet. Commercial energy use makes up 6.6% of CO2 and is a lot easier to reduce than meat use globally, both on a local and on an international scale, through one time investments. If you want to chip away at percentages, start there. If you'd rather go for the actual problems, go protest against the EU refusing to allow sales of climate quotas. $100m to reduce emissions in Bangladesh is gonna go a lot further than $100m to reduce emissions in Switzerland.

There will always be land that is in private hands that doesn’t make sense to restore as wildlife habitats due to other human usage. Much of it is not suitable for grain production or other agriculture. Putting cows on it in a way that the majority of their feed is from grazing instead of grain would absolutely be less impactful.

Now I’ve had to move to a specific grocery store chain that sources from within 200 miles of me. I like that less than the old solution (the beef is lower quality) but it appears to be a temporary thing. Our angus producer bought another farm to expand because she’s sold out for two years. I’ll happily start buying from her beyond our quarter share that keeps getting delayed when she can manage it. 

Since I was a kid the Illinois river was devastated by asian carp. You cannot get river fish anymore. You can’t get domestic farmed catfish anymore. You can still get regionally caught walleye (Lake Michigan) but it’s getting expensive. There’s no more local chicken other than a couple former layers my friends give me when they cull and the single chance to buy a few from the Amish early summer. There’s plenty of local pork, but none of it is direct sold. It gets processed and commingled and shipped back to us via the larger processors. We have to deal with the confinement smells and runoff without being able to buy the product directly.

Obviously, in this population, everyone eats an identical proportion of beef on average over time, so we know that, in general, 50% of the beef is consumed by 50% of the population.

Now let's take a statistically relevant sample of this population and view their eating habits on one day. Because we constructed this population, we know that there is a 50% chance that an individual person in our sample will consume only beef on that day, and a 50% chance that they will consume no beef. To be even more clear: if we sample 100 people from the population that I specified in the first paragraph and observe them for one day, we would expect to see 50 people eat only beef and to see 50 people eat no beef. If we made the same mistake as the study, we would conclude that 50% of people eat 100% of the beef consumed by the population in general, which we already know is not correct.

In the case of this example, just as in the actual study, the problem is that the proportion of beef consumed by a member of the population in a single day is not necessarily the same as the proportion they consume over time. The study certainly should have been able to estimate the true value of the per day statistic--for the reasons you have already mentioned--but knowing the proportion of consumption on a single day is not actually that interesting.

For example, the Nutrient Rich Food Index uses nutrients per calorie as the primary measure of nutrient density, but also adjusts for the weight and serving size of the food. 

If you are looking for a high protein food that provides essential minerals and vitamins, red meat may be a better choice than plants in terms of nutrients per calorie. However, if you are looking for a low fat food that provides dietary fiber and antioxidants, plants may be a better choice than red meat in terms of nutrients per calorie. 

That being said red meat is a rich source of protein, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamin B12, which are essential for the body’s growth, maintenance, and function. 

Plants on the other hand are a rich source of fiber, antioxidants, vitamin C, folate, and vitamin K, which are beneficial for the digestive system, immune system, and blood clotting. However, plants also contain less protein, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamin B12 than red meat, which can lead to deficiencies if not supplemented.

The methane breaks down back into co2, then is absorbed into the grass, then eaten by the cow. So it WAS a contributor in increasing GHG emissions to the levels we have now, but now that it has reached equilibrium, the methane is no longer accumulating.

If the cows were eliminated then there would be a reduction in GHG in the atmosphere and associated benefits, but they aren’t causing the additional accumulation that is being quoted. It’s there now, and is being used at a similar rate as it’s being created.

Actually I've known 2 personally, my ex who really only bought a gun to go shooting with me (she could rent one, but she wanted to get one she could have painted pink). The other was a guy who bought one because basically someone he knew talked him into it, so he bought a Garand and I think he said he never even shot it.

I own 3 rifles, and I'd kind of say as a gun owner I don't own a lot of guns. Or maybe I'd say that I guess 3 is probably the low end of average. But if you do something like hunt, you're probably going to own a few guns. Like you'll probably have a 22 to practice shoot with since it's cheaper ammo, and maybe shoot pests with. You'll probably have a larger caliber (many states have minimum caliber for deer hunting, and deer hunting with a 22 would be pretty unethical) rifle for hunting. Might have a shot gun for bird hunting and other uses. Maybe a hand gun for self defense or defense against bears if you're in bear territory. That's 4 guns without any real duplication or specialization.

I think someone who shoots fairly often could easily have 10 guns and it wouldn't really be surprising.

As an aside, sometimes when people are arrested news articles will say something like ""they found 500 rounds of ammunition in their house"". And to someone who doesn't shoot that sounds like a lot. But a day at the range you can easily go through several hundred rounds. In things like 22, 500 rounds is a single large box of ammo.

Let's assume normal distribution. 
My first question is normal distribution over what exactly. 

I expect a normal like distribution over the probability of eating meat on a given day is what you mean. However this doesn't need to be a distribution - the area under the curve doesn't need to be 1 because I can have just a delta function distribution (everyone eats beef 100% of the time). Or do you mean amount of beef consumed?

Even if you make hand wavy claims to central limit theorem, for CLT to hold, we require 
- N draws tends to infinity
- individual variables are i.i.d.

In particular, your conclusion states 'people vary by probability'. So they cannot be i.i.d. distributed by definition. There is likely some sort of distribution, but I'll eat my socks if it looks anything like a Gaussian.

Further to the point in the post above. I don't care there is a distribution. Even if there was a distribution which makes the probability of eating beef different per person, the study's timescale limits the extrapolation of the conclusion. Let's say 12% of people really do eat all the beef in that period. It's only 48 hours - what happens if a different 12% of people eat half the beef in another period? And so on?

TL;DR, they mostly feed on natural growing grass and leaves, and the food we do give them is mostly residue and byproducts of agriculture that are not edible by humans.

Having cattle pasturing in a deep carbon cycle method is by its nature a renewable farm. I’m trying to remember the name of the book but it was like *The Hydrogen Economy* for farming and had veldt in the title. You actually can have some measure of biodiversity and habitat for native species while raising cattle and having deep carbon cycles. That’s especially true for large parts of America that were burn managed prairies before manifest destiny. Cattle serve a similar place in the ecology to bison but are more practical for a few reasons. Lots of native plants and insects thrive in land that is intensively grazed like that.

It’s by no means the only path, but it is a viable one that works within our existing system. The other half of that conversation is talking about agriculture for industrial feedstock crops like modern corn and soy. It takes a tremendous amount of carbon to make some of that land viable via nitrogen addition. We poorly manage it because it’s designed for maximum extraction and tends to decrease the quality of the land over time. Forestry has similar issues as is evidenced by half of North America being on fire right now. The large companies plant monocultures and aggressively stop small fires so undergrowth builds up till you have massive ones. 

There’s also something to be said for how well the American excise tax on firearms and ammunition funds our land trust system for a dwindling number of hunters but that gets a bit outside of this conversation. Those land trusts also can play a large role in positive future outcomes.",MerryChoppins,t2_adh7a,2,0,reddit1

Reducing livestock reduces the amount of agricultural land being used to grow food for livestock. This not only allows for more land to be left wild, but it could allow for more land being used to grow fuel crops, because while certain aspects of transportation can be reduced, or replaced with electric solutions, things like shipping and aviation are resistant to that, and biofuels are a path to reducing the emissions of these activities.

Frankly, I don't think there's much we can do about wildfires. Not only is human behaviour hard to change, but fewer fires means more fuel in forests not being burned means future fires burn worse.

Similarly, transportation is largely a technology and city design inertia problem that we can't do much to dial up or down, at least not in the short term.

Similarly, I think it's a hard problem to get people to change their eating habits, but we're talking about what you can do. I can't solve the transportation issue. I can eat less meat.

It is absolutely true that emissions reductions need to be prioritized to the largest components, including transportation, heating, electricity and manufacturing. But reaching net zero will also absolutely require a reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture and the vast inefficiencies of large ruminant meat production do not increase food security in developed countries like the US. Rather, such production creates a luxury product that [requires more land, fresh water, energy, and GHG emissions to produce](https://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/04_20_2016_Bobby_Magill_CC_GHG_Emissions_1050_991_s_c1_c_c.png) at a far higher price.

> it makes sense to work towards fixing transportation, electricity, and heat, as those sectors are far more easy to fix in terms of GHG emissions

That is completely backwards. Each of those industries requires massive infrastructure and capital changes in order to transition. Thousands of new power plants, efficient insulation, increased mass transit and elimination of literally billions of ICE engines will require decades of sustained, incredibly expensive and resource intensive effort. Necessary, for certain, but incredibly costly. Transitioning away from expensive, resource intensive meats, however, will almost immediately begin to save money and resources and all the technology and infrastructure necessary for the transition already exists and is already applied at scale throughout most of the world.

In fact, the calorie/protein conversion ratios of meat are so incredibly low that most of the food supplied from cattle could be replaced [simply by diverting the grains currently fed to them directly to human consumption](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/10/105002).

You can because if you actually navigate to the study, it states 

“The main reason for this differential impact is that ruminant animals emit far more methane than monogastric animals, that is, those with just one stomach. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has over 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide [7]. Because of their potency, a recent United Nations report indicated that reducing methane emissions is one of the most cost-effective strategies to rapidly reduce the rate of global warming [8].”

If the methane is balanced in and out of the system, then they are not the contributor they are accused of being because the methane is being destroyed at the same rate as it is being created.

This is a huge study, we don't really gain anything from extra precision here unless there are very good reasons to assume there is some sort of systematic biasing of results brought about, and there just isn't.

From this land alone, all of the protein and calories cattle provide could be more than replaced, simply due to the [vast inefficiency of consuming a higher trophic energy level in the form of a large ruminant](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-protein-poore) that makes protein from cattle 20x less efficient than nuts and 40x less efficient than grains.",RedditFostersHate,t2_jiex2ydb,10,0,reddit1

> On one hand, if it’s only 12% accounting for half the beef consumption, you could make some big gains if you get those 12% on board,” Rose said. “On the other hand, those 12% may be most resistant to change.” 

Because we don't know whether that trend is consistent for, say, a week, or a month, or a year. Maybe that 12% of daily beefeaters only eat beef occasionally, and therefore it's really ~36% of the population that's responsible for that half of beef consumption.

&#x200B;

Many many things in the world follow a normal distribution in population samples and we can make certain assumptions using these types of distributions that you're correctly pointing out that we can't make in other distributions.

The point is how many winners there are in the total population, over a time period, compared to a given day.

If you've only looked at one day at a time, you cannot know the [has ever won] population, and the authors implying in the news article that it's the same proportion as the amount for a given day is irresponsible.

e.g. In a fair single-draw lottery, there would only be one winner per day, who had 100% of the winnings, but we would expect that distribution to change over repeated instances.

If it were always rigged for the same person, then we would expect it to remain the exact same. But we could also imagine infinite other resulting distributions.

jylkg1e,t1_jyku8fl,2023-09-01 00:33:32,science,"(a.) Yes, of course I know what normal distributions are.

(b.) Beef consumption definitionally can't be normally distributed. It bottoms out at 0, and normal distributions necessarily include values to negative infinity (with low values, but they're still needed to maintain many of the gaussian distribution's properties).

(c.) The results aren't even close to normally distributed. Almost 45% of the population has the exact same minimum value. The closest you could be is a [Truncated distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution), which has different properties. But as far as I can tell, nothing in the paper indicates that it's even that. Where are you getting the claim that it's normal from?

(d.) Even if it were normal, a behavior being normally distributed on a given day still doesn't enable you to project data from single day occurrences to implied longer behaviors for sub-populations in the way you describe.

e.g. How many calories an American eats on a given day could approximate a normal distribution, but you can't assume that the 5th percentile of calories eaten in a day (let's say 100 calories) can be projected to the 5th percentile for a full year at 36,500 calories annually. The set of people who eat 100 calories on the day you sampled them will eat more calories the next couple days—they're not independent events, those people are going to be super hungry. And even if they were independent events (which we don't know), reversion to the mean means that they'll still *usually* eat more calories than that the rest of the year. You'd need to simulate the effects of the 365 independent events, which neither the study nor you have done.

You can use that daily data by itself to project the other way (i.e. you can say with x% confidence that all days will have ~5% of people eating 100 calories or less), but not to say that 5% of people's total year consumption will meet some total level of calories or even some percentage of the total calories. You can't know the relationship between the events without more data.

>For this study, they're not saying ""on any given day"", they're saying ""averaged out, across the whole sample population, over a 3 year period of random days of data.""

Wanna bet? They say ""on any given day"" multiple times in the paper. When they say that, I agree they don't mean ""on [x] particular day we sampled"", but they mean, ""the average value, *for a single day*"". As in, not claiming that it's the same value as if they'd inquired after the dietary habits of the past 3 years.",N_Cat,t2_wqxs2,1,0,reddit1

You’ll see these adhd’ers play a video game for hours straight without so much as looking up. (Often people assume the game is one task and the person can clearly focus on that task - when in reality the person is being presented with numerous new tasks/challenges in the game that keeps that dopamine loop running in their brain constantly). They’re the ones where they’ll start a project and get immersed and hyper focused on it, or pick up new hobbies and dedicate massive effort in. Often with a struggle to maintain that effort or interest long-term in any single task/hobby. 

This can be leveraged for benefit, if they know what triggers that hyper focus. For example, if the idea of writing notecards is something they can hyper focus on, that might be a study tool they can utilize rather than trying to read textbooks/watch lectures, each card being a new task to focus on. Or perhaps highlighting books gets ‘em roped in, and they can devour textbooks all day that way, but ask them to rustle up the motivation to read a flash card and it’s a struggle bus. 

Plenty of neurotypical people can exhibit elements of hyperfocus, as well as numerous varieties of neurodivergent individuals. Autism spectrum is often very associated with hyperfocus, as is ADHD. 

Neurodivergents tend to be the ones who hyperfocus so hard on something, they won’t go to bed while doing that thing. Especially if you remove some inhibitions, such as with alcohol - they’ll stay up until daylight scrolling TikTok or in a game, fighting that tiredness to keep going a bit longer. 

This is why I recommend to patients to work with timers. When they’re doing a task they don’t necessarily want to do and will get distracted from, 5 minute repeating timer on their phone that gets them reminded back to their task. With things that they’ll get sucked into black holes on, screen limit timers in iOS work wonders - like capping themselves to an hour or two of social media a day. Setting up routines and schedules for them, tends to be helpful as well - such as keys/wallets/purses all get placed in the same spot in their home, bedtime/wake-up reminders and times, etc. A non-punitive routine really helps keep things pieced together. 

If you’re concerned about ADHD, talk with your doctor about it. Things that are helpful are friends and family questionnaires, childhood memories/school difficulties, etc. 

And keep in mind, medication can help, but it isn’t a complete solution. Reading and understanding behaviors of neurodivergency help in a lot of subtle, but impactful ways.",DaltonZeta,t2_8vdqh,63,0,reddit3

> This paper quantifies employer market power in US manufacturing and how it has changed over time. Using administrative data, we estimate plant-level markdowns—the ratio between a plant's marginal revenue product of labor and its wage. We find most manufacturing plants operate in a monopsonistic environment, with an average markdown of 1.53, implying a worker earning only 65 cents on the marginal dollar generated. To investigate long-term trends for the entire sector, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded measure for the aggregate markdown. We find that it decreased between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, but has been sharply increasing since.

The essence of capitalism is, a capitalist buys the facility/resources needed to make some product, pays workers to manufacture that product, and sells the product for more than the cost of the facilities/resources and the cost of the labor to produce it.  The claim here is that in a competitive labor market, cost of the labor would be equal to the revenue generated from the manufactured product. Nevermind the cost of the facility/resources/intellectural property, etc. Nevermind too that the organizer/capitalist who put up his capital for the facility/resources should be able to make a profit on the use of his capital assets and the input labor cost. The assertion here is that in a competitive labor market, labor must be compensated for 100% of the revenue generated. The input assertion is flawed, reflecting a view that only labor matters, everyone else simply owes labor their resources",shiningPate,t2_6cqg2,11,0,reddit4

The logic here is that if a company is making $1.00 from an hour of an employee's labor and paying them $0.50, another company will come along and offer them $0.51 so their company profits $0.49 for each hour of labor.

ie7xgur,t3_vnk9wu,2022-06-29 18:50:00,science,"Most of the comments are saying similar things of how 1:1 pay to production leaves the companies with 0 profit. This 'competitive labor market' is a theoretical construct of what things would look like if we assumed away most of the things that make the realities of life and running a business complicated. This is necessary to get a solution at all and is the reference point for economists not because they honestly believe it is possible, but because it is what they have to do to get an equilibrium that has a solution. While it may never actually be attainable, I would argue it is fairly reasonable to assume that firms are legitimately trying to get as close as they can to this theoretical optimum of profits being maximized so thinking about economies this way is still reasonable. It has also proven vary valuable. 

So, yeas in a perfectly competitive labor market in this sense it would be 1:1, but we will never actually be there.

Obviously something like accounting is overhead and not labor. But what about say a salesman? What if salesman is a design engineer that makes custom design with every quote? Is a project manager labour or overhead? Does that change if part of your contract to manufacture a custom thing is to manage the installation of said thing? What about say Quality Control? Does that change if part of contract is providing certain certificates of testing? Or production foremen? Does that change if it's a small outfit that has production foreman doing half the actual work? Are engineers and draftsman labor or overhead? Does that change if half of your contract is the design as well as the manufacture of said piece of equipment? What about the guy that maintains the robot that builds the product?

I think it's worth noting too that the industries that have the highest markdown rate per this study are the ones that have the most quality control / red-tape due to high safety requirements or incredibly tight precision; food, Chemical/oil & gas (literally have giant plants filled with what are more or less bombs), medical equipment,  computer parts...

Government should be working hard on both problems.   Travel can be made easier by being made quicker and cheaper.  New freeways.  New busses and trains.  Anything that allows a worker from one plant to go work for another.

Ease of moving house is arguably an easier problem.   Today a house move can be a massive burden.  There are costs to move, many months of solicitors if you buy a house, long locked-in leases if you rent.  You might also need to move your family, disrupting their life, etc.

All those things could be made easier.   For example, lease lock-in's could be banned.   Schemes could be put in place to reduce the paperwork involved in a house purchase - for example, requiring a mortgage can be transferred to another property fee-free and delay-free.

The typical concept of profit people have is that you sell something for more than it cost you to make, and pocket the difference because of the buyer's inability or lack of desire to go make it themselves. Here, the companies are making stuff that's worth more than it costs, and using strength in the labor market to keep those costs below what they ""should"" be in a competitive labor market.

ihjncyp,t1_ie9d4y5,2022-07-25 06:04:10,science,"I think neither actually.

If you really want to go to extremes, you can set the maximum labour price as the maximum wage compatible with sustainably running a company while budgeting for depreciation of assets and insurance; ie. a company that survives sustainably, even if it is unable to invest, and at the minimum side, the wage required to just meet the bills for a sustainable and dignified living standard (so that both conditions squeeze together and meet in a company that pays an equal minimum to all workers, and makes just enough money to just about stay in business).

You can exceed the limit in either direction temporarily, with workers getting malnourished and unable to survive or companies slowly collapsing as they unable to replace equipment or deal with disasters, and more often than not, for small businesses, this will occur until the initial capital investment has been paid off, with people causing themselves minor health problems, damaging their relationships etc. in order to get their business afloat, or not properly accounting for risks and using borrowed equipment they didn't pay for, or both.

But neither of these sustainability conditions (realised in practice by the rare case of a desperate business owner trying to retain workers to keep their business afloat, and the far more common case of a desperate worker trying to keep a roof over his head) are what this marginal rate is talking about.

Instead it's supposed to be some middle ground, where there are so many workers and so many employers that any job that is in some abstract sense worth paying someone to do gets done, there is zero unemployment, work is shared out, and we just assume/hope everyone gets enough to make their life sustainable, because this market has ideally arranged everyone's behaviour so that the optimal utilisation of human effort has occurred.

In this kind of standard approach to economics, my understanding is that there are technically no markets any more within the framework of the problem, (having been constructed out of the problem by the assumptions) just the optimisation of an overall production function, that *looks* like supply and demand, but is actually the result of a global optimisation process based on the comparison of marginal advantages of different options and following the gradient upwards to maximum utility.

You assume that the market conditions are such that such a global function optimiser is achieved, and then try and guess what it would say by looking at local gradients of money gained by adding workers, or working more hours, so that if someone working an hour more makes your company $10 or $40 extra, you offer them those extra $10 of $40, and if they don't want it they choose not to take it, and if it makes them better off than the value of the time they loose, they take it, and there are always enough jobs and people available that every position that could reasonably be filled gets filled by someone for whom that extra money is worth more than the value to them of their leisure time.

Conditions of survival and choices made on that basis are irrelevant in this model, but it seems like the calculated wages from this end up higher than survival wages and also higher than the wages people are paid in practice, so that kind of weirdness is dodged.",eliminating_coasts,t2_4a2fkfot,1,0,reddit4

What product did he make? It was that capitalists hoarding of capital that prevented others from having access to the same opportunity. Given adequate capital, a co-op can create an enterprise. Without labor, a capitalist cannot.

That's incorrect.

Some were grumpy and introverted (I have never met anyone really, really good that wasn't conscientious) but not at any rate greater than the general population.  Heck, one of the best I've ever met was a bubbly blonde, who ran the social club and did competitive ballroom dancing in her spare time.   None of these people have ever committed anything to GitHub, and very few would have twitter accounts (the first, of course, negating any correlation to the second, for this study).

TBH, I don't quite see how the number of commits you make relates in any way to the quality of your code.  A huge number of commits usually says someone who fucks it up a lot, to me.",razor_eddie,t2_1547ot,1,0,reddit1

It would not at all surprise me to see that your personality type invokes a preference for specific activities. In fact, to me it's a logical conclusion. While I may not agree with the generalized statement there is some truth to it.  


So, being an athlete is an actively co-operattive career path depending on the sports that you like to play. If you have low agreeableness (like me) your going to have a hard time with team activities if you're not the team captain.  


When you look at something like software development, it's something that requires you to spend large chucks of time isolated from other people and a lot of programmers also tend to be ""dog f'ers"" at work; ex: watching youtube/netflix and playing f'ing video games on company time using company computers....

They do not account for the fact that twitter users are automatically going to be only a fraction of the population and probably have its own characteristics for people outside of the population itself, so really, this data is only useful for people who tweet and want a feedback loop of data.

Also, it assumes that the personalities of people in those current positions are of quality for that position: maybe introverts really hate computers but they do it because that’s what society tells them they should do. 

How about we don’t use a limited expression unit to judge people as a whole? Twitter is not an accurate representation of a personality. Also, if someone consistently quotes other people on twitter, wouldn’t their personality profile get mixed up?

Being 49% E is the same as 51% E but the mbti cutoff if 50%. People should read the stats more than the letters. The issue is then that mbti categorises while it really is just measuring traits just like the big 5. There's also correlation with big 5.

Moreover mbti when going deeper doesn't even address the letters but the Cognitive functions.

Many issues with mbti are completely resolved with cognitive functions. The issue there is that you can't essentially prove them.

The issue people have with mbti is the simple test that they take. Yes it sucks. We can do better. But what about the reasoning behind? Nobody cared about that. Meanwhile there's no theory behind the big five unless I'm mistaken, because it's just a statistic observation. How can you be offensive with that?",Mylaur,t2_gtwu7,5,0,reddit1
fhk42ag,t1_fhk2wcr,2020-02-14 07:38:11,science,"While MBTI based on the four letters and self taken personality tests are unreliable in test re-test situations, like most personality tests. It's actually quite funny that this individual has not looked into the underlying psychological theory behind Myers Brigs Type Indicator, which is Carl Jung's cognitive functions. The lack of mentioning them means he clearly did not study it in depth. INTJs have the function stack Ni-Te-Fi-Se. While his retest funnily enough was an ESFP, which has the function stack Se-Fi-Te-Ni. What does this mean, well it is actually quite common for an INTJ to perceive themselves as an ESFP as they share the same cognitive functions just in the reverse order. All types with growth strengthen their 3rd and 4th functions (for the INTJ, Fi-Se). So a mature INTJ can actually function like an ESFP. Though that state is still more energy consuming than it would be for an actual ESFP.

Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions

A more digestible read of the functions: https://personalityjunkie.com/functions-ni-ti-fi-si-ne-te-fe-se/

Mind you all people have all 8 functions, growth is often seen from strengthening your 3rd and 4th functions. Wisdom comes from an understanding of the shadow or unconcious functions (the four not in your stack).

That's the theory anyway. Russian socionics has utilized it to greater effect than American MBTI in terms of manipulation of people and overall use.",martymcflyer,t2_61ceb,4,0,reddit1

It's true that people issuing takedowns of personality typologies rarely know the systems well at all which means the takedowns are typically really disappointing reading, but that doesn't mean the takedowns themselves aren't warranted. The theories are rigid and usually unamenable to correction by evidence except by addition of more and more kludge complications when the base systems fails to live up to reality but has to be adhered to to keep ""doing the system"", and basically every operationalization of function typology I've ever seen is either a pile of asspulls, complete garbage, or both.

There's a certain draw to how typology tends to discuss how it feels to live as a certain kind of person, but the Big Five can and do accommodate that kind of thing once you go beyond simple behavior lists into what they mean.

English is the langauge of business because we have 11 official languages (the most popular being English, Afrikaans, Zulu and isiXhosa). It just makes more sense to have a common lmaguage that can also be understood abroad. 

In general highschool/the work space attitudes mirror Western norms. In a highschool setting this means high schoolers were forced to straighten their hair, codeswitch to an acceptable accent, among other changes. Psychologically you're telling young people that how they are naturally is not suitable for the work place. It is possible to have curly hair that is neat. Having an accent should not (but I'm aware does) affect a perceived intelligence. There should be a middle ground that akcnowledges differences in physical being without making possibly vulnerable people feel inadequate for existing.

To make it anywhere you have to play the game and it's exhausting day in and day out having to put in extra work to appear professional.

Just for a bit of racial history. 

— black women had to have hair covered at all times per law at one time

— once freed they had to blend to find work and some even took to using whitening creams or powered face and hands to pass

- those who could naturally pass typically did not speak of the black side of the family. Lots of children coming out from the 30s - 60s and even 70s who thought they were Lilly white but turns out their parent or grand parent was black.

One women I read about - her mom made her promise to not tell anyone she was “black” until she was dead. 

So until recently it was an unspoken rule to fit in was to be “like white”

So they were surprised that code switching benefits every race?

“After reading the emails, Black participants rated the non-codeswitching co-worker as more professional than did White participants. The researchers say this is likely because Black people are more likely to see value in displays of their racial identity and are less likely to “penalize” Black co-workers for not codeswitching. Still, both Black and White participants rated the codeswitching co-worker as more professional than the non-codeswitching co-worker.”

Does it not stand to reason that the founding members of the modern business environment would set the tone for norms and expectations? Speaking for the U.S. that would be white men. CEOs, presidents, and leadership in business circles tend to be quite WASPy. We could trace a line back to college education and (lack of) diversity in the universities and programs feeding these leadership positions, not to mention the nepotism that happens.

Change and diversity at the top is slowly changing, and I’d like to think we’ll see the norms of professionalism change eventually as well.

At the end of the day, it is a race issue, whether some here want to admit it or not. I am a white gal with a neutral enough Midwestern accent, boring hair, and a traditional English name. Right off the bat I have advantages over any counterparts with strong accents, hair perceived as less professional, or names that are difficult to pronounce, ethnic, or heavily regional. 

Not one of those factors has a damn thing to do with intelligence or the ability to do a job well.

Conduct the same study in China and you will likely find the same result for people who take up Chinese looks, style, speech patterns, etc..

In a sense this article or study, is what's racist. Like, they are calling certain dress or hair style as being ""white"" now, I get for women, straight hair, ok, that's white hair.

We’re talking about people telling you that your natural hair style, or what would even be considered a nice hair style, isn’t looked at that way in most business settings. If I took the time to have my hair braided as an Afro Puerto Rican man, even if my hair is kept well, people will still see it as unprofessional. I went to a predominately white (90% of guests were white) and was told not to have my hair braided and was asked to “choose a different hairstyle that’s more appropriate” by friends of mine. It was very weird and unsettling. I’ve had bosses of mine tell me my Afro was “too much” after a certain length even though it’s well kept. Not that my hair was even exceptionally long to begin with. It doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll always have someone at some point tell you that your hair is unnatural in its natural state. It would take me tons of hair products to style my hair. Products that dry out my scalp and cause dandruff. And so I stopped all caring all together.

But the study doesn't seem definitive to me because first, it seems the data was from surveys with a small sample size, only about 1K, and second:

> Specifically, we measure intragroup (e.g., Black people) and intergroup (e.g., White people) evaluations of codeswitching and perceptions of professionalism for Black people who do (not) codeswitch in the workplace.

So it's not even studying or measuring codeswitching or mirroring in the workplace, *the study is specifically focusing on only black codeswitching or mirroring.** And we aren't given the criteria for finding and screening participants, only the agency which found them, so the sample could present a significant bias or entirely skewed group from the norms. That is, whatever and wherever the researchers consider normative.

From the second study:
> We presume that intragroup preferences for Black people to express prototypically Black cultural traits and features explains Black participants’ positive evaluations of the non-codeswitching coworker (Axt et al., 2018). The reverse was true for the White observers in our study.

Which seems to be a pretty big assumption in a racial bias study.

I'm not a sociologist and I only took a cursory look at the study, so take this with a grain of salt. While the study does seem to merit further questioning into these issues, it also seems to make some questionable assumptions and fails to consider factors such whether the work culture in the survey is persistent across international business or not and why that is, account for regional differences, who the target audience of the business is, what type of business, regional location, etcetera.",Foxsayy,t2_z7sal,1,0,reddit3

So - if I move to Vietnam for work - how much should I expect the Vietnamese culture to bend to mine? 

Should they have burgers at every corner, should they learn how to pronounce my American name, or maybe learn my Mexican name pronunciation - how much should they cater to me? 

As white Americans created this country, fighting off the brits, and wiping out the natives, taking from the Spanish and Mexicans, establishing Anglo Saxon style courts and government, establishing English as the language, establishing work ethics - so on and so forth - (I’m not saying it was good or bad, just saying they did) - so then - any new subculture that comes in - should it align with the white culture or no? 

Should we change to the metric system like our European Americans? Or maybe we should have a more vegetarian diet as our Indian Americans? Should we have more Spanish as our Mexican Americans? Should we quit our Christmas songs for a more Kwanza oriented holiday?

Even a white guy is going to be removing slang he normally uses and will avoid speaking about certain topics, I behaved more of myself when my mom used to drag me to church than at the office.

I remember someone being surprised to learn I drank at such a job and they had no idea that I smoked a ridiculous amount of weed and that I am definitely counter culture and my friends in high school were mostly skaters or into punk rock. Another guy that I worked with always wore long sleeve shirts because he was tatted out as he used to be in a gang but you wouldn't know unless he told you in private. The generic office personality you are expected to have is to be as non offensive and pleasant as possible.

hne7f3c,t1_hndz7j6,2021-12-06 00:09:02,science,"Part of the problem is when some people say racism they have a different definition than when others say racism. The dictionary definition of racism is:

> the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or superior to one another.

This doesn’t require hatred or consciousness. For example the concept that Asian’s are good at math doesn’t have an ounce of hatred in it, but it’s absolutely racist because it assumes some quality exists inherently in a race. 

That any quality preferentially exists in a people by virtue of their race is about the dumbest concept ever but it’s believed by most people. The fact is race is an amorphous social designation and quite honestly, you’d struggle to find agreement on even how many races exist let alone who falls into the categories. So how can anyone suggest that qualities exist by virtue of race, when we don’t even have clear delineations. It’s an astronomically dumb concept but it still exists socially and is something many people have to deal with routinely.",eusebius13,t2_1ldarimg,-22,0,reddit3

Try telling a southerner that ""y'all"" isn't a word. Try telling anyone that a word they, and everyone around them has used longer than they can remember is ""wrong"" and that they shouldn't use it anymore.

The fact of the matter is every single word you know is made up, and pronounced very differently than it was originally. The language you use is almost indistinguishable from the English of 500+ years ago. Silent consonants in words like gnat, and sword were not silent as recently as 400 years ago. Also, have you considered whether or not you're pronouncing Wednesday or February correctly as originally intended, or if perhaps you're saying in a way that slips off the tongue easier for you?

One of the first things I did after high school was study business people, how they act, talk, etc. I copied them. It really helped in my business ventures. I don’t think it’s white stuff at all. I think it’s just boring, politically correct, safe culture. Nothing wrong with it. There is an argument that business culture ultimately came from white culture, since old white dudes defined it though. And it works as a sort of filter. It’s prolly along the lines of structural racism, but more like structural classism. You don’t really need much money to dress “business”.",bnelson,t2_7u7k,1,0,reddit3

hnf7eeo,t1_hneylvy,2021-12-06 04:41:17,science,"Honestly probably the latter, just expressed badly, based on my limited knowledge about the zeitgeist in this area of sociology.

The problem with all of this is that people are incapable of separating their personal culture of professionalism from the fundamentals of professionalism.

Wearing a suit, having short cropped hair, talking with an accent that is perceived as being ""white"" and other such things are not *fundamentally* professional. They are cultural mores defined by society that has a long history of the dominance of a specific white ethnicity. 

The problem with the the statement ""I am acting like an intelligent successful business person."" Is that it is a meaningless statement divorced from the culture that spawned it. ""An intelligent successful business person"" has no specific norms, and the clothing, accent and attitude they project will vary heavily between cultures.

So the image that Americans have of ""an intelligent successful business person"" is one that was created to match the cultural values of the dominant white upper class. When a person acts that way it is not a conflation to associate that behavior with the culture that established it, they are literally one and the same.

As an example: If you watch any Korean TV you will invariably end up eventually seeing their images of a ""successful business person."" Their media, which is an enhanced and idealistic version of reality as their perceive it, seems strongly value hierarchical submission and self sacrifice in their business people. Though they wear similar clothing to American business people, they carry themselves entirely differently, have different mannerisms and operate under different values and goals. The media image of an American business person, which is also a function of an enhanced and idealistic version of how we perceive reality, is much more of a free thinking maverick that paints outside the lines and rapidly overthrows power structures while asserting dominance in their interactions by virtue of their extreme merit.

Reality never lives up to those expectations of course, it just demonstrates that the ideal form of cultural norms can be very different. So when a black person speaks in AAVE, it does not mean they are less intelligent or less capable of expressing themselves, and when they have curly big hair it does not mean they are less professional at all. It is the difference between their cultural expression and the white dominated cultural expression that causes those impressions, and so it is not wrong to say they are conforming to the expectations of white upper class culture.",Caelinus,t2_emecd,8,0,reddit4

Furthermore, that’s Webster’s definition of racism not mine. 

> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism

I’m using the English language. The authority on the definition of words in the English language is the dictionary. I’m sorry you don’t like how the dictionary defines racism, but feel free to make up your own definition and use that. But when you make up your own words, understand that you’re going to compromise your ability to understand the actual concepts behind those words.

Edit to say — why do you think racism is an insult? It’s not an insult, it’s a condition. But clearly you think it’s an insult, which is why you react to it in such an emotional way. It’s like you’re denying the existence of assholes because that’s the best argument you have against being called an asshole. 

Racism is what it is, discrimination on the basis of race.

The first reason is you don’t even have distinct racial categories. Without distinct racial categories, how do you establish trends. You can’t even establish which individual belongs to which category. 

Tell me this, how many races are there? Socially a child with a white parent and a black parent is black. Are they? If they are then you’ve established race isn’t genetic because the black son of a white mother/father has half of their DNA but they’re different races. 

A father/son are more genetically similar than any other people on the planet with the exception of an identical twin or the grandparents. So what’s the cause of the trends you suggest exist, it’s clearly not DNA.  

Any data that suggests for example, black people have X tendency is corrupted by whatever definition of black is used for that dataset. 

In fact the only racial trends that you can establish for certain is how a person will be treated by others in society based on the perception of that person’s race.",eusebius13,t2_1ldarimg,1,0,reddit4
hnih4p2,t1_hnie3fq,2021-12-06 21:50:05,science,"It’s racist to assume something inferior or superior is caused by a person’s race. Consequently there is a ton of racism against white people. 

If you were to attempt to quantify the negative effects of racism against a racial group, it would be difficult to make the argument that racism against whites is more harmful that racism against blacks on a group level. I’m sure on an individual level there are whites that have experienced terrible racial discrimination. Further, early US treatment of Italians, may not have been racial discrimination, but it was just as harmful as similar discrimination, it just wasn’t on the basis of race (unless you consider that some thought at that time Italians were non-white).

All that said, observing the social consequences of race is not racist. For example noting that blacks were 8 times more likely to be arrested for personal amounts of marijuana than whites in NYC despite no disparity in marijuana usage isn’t racist. It’s pointing out a racial disparity that can only be explained by racism.",eusebius13,t2_1ldarimg,1,0,reddit4

(For instance, Midwestern, California, and Southern American are mutually intelligible in almost all cases; barring a particularly thick accent, there is no good reason to evaluate people who use them more negatively.)

That said, if the logic you outline is correct, it also highlights how the structure of professional speech is systemically exclusive. Rather than doing the work to overturn the present standard and rework it into a standard that shares the load more equitably, many business leaders stick with White.

What I would say, though, is that I have had to code switch a lot less than (a) people who are particularly working class and didn't already have extensive exposure to standard mid-Atlantic English, (b) people whose dialects are held as particularly non-prestigious in professional settings, like Black Englishes, varieties of Louisiana Creole, or non-British international dialects of English, and (c) ELL students who learned a non-American variety of English, like British English, and are still adapting to American norms. Many workers just have to switch register; members of these groups often have to completely change how they speak in order to be taken seriously.

In other words, code switching is a spectrum. Everyone may do it to some extent, but some people and groups have to do it more in order to fit in.",TaliesinMerlin,t2_xf5n3,1,0,reddit4

Also I’m not assuming black people aren’t professional looking “when they’re acting naturally”, this is what the participants’ responses indicate. A man with stereotypically black attributes was seen as less professional than the same man code switching. Try picturing the scene: the participants listened to a man they were told was named Jamal who wore cornrows talking about how to succeed in the company. Then they listened to another man they were told was named Jacob who had a buzz cut and talked about the same thing. On average the participants thought Jacob with the buzz cut was more professional than Jamal with the cornrows.

Some of the swamp people's accents are quite understandable, but some garble the pronunciation so much that most other dialects would need to spend a good chunk of time learning the regional dialect to figure out 80% of the words they're saying. It's incomprehensible. 

Admittedly its a comparatively rare case, and within their own group its fine because that's the regional dialect.

hni8gif,t1_hni4lks,2021-12-06 20:54:04,science,"Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in a gene. That mutation was beneficial in areas where malaria was a significant risk as sickle cell is protective against malaria.  It can occur in any race, but is prevalent amongst races that lived in those areas. 

>”Sickle cell disease can affect people of any ethnic background. It is more common, however, in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian ancestry.”

>https://sicklecellanemianews.com/causes-sickle-cell-disease/

Now this distinction is important because if you want to suggest the presence of certain genes are the thing that makes racial distinctions, than race isn’t “race,” as it’s commonly used. At that point you would have to create genetic clusters and define people by those clusters. Those clusters are not associated with skin tone and consequently, do not match the racial categories in common usage. 

The bottom line is, the best case for a racial distinction, as it’s commonly used is simply the presence of a range of alleles associated with skin color. The presence of those ranges of alleles is not predictive of much else genetically.

This isn’t a suggestion that there are outliers, it’s a suggestion that an American black male is going to be more genetically similar to other Americans, black and white, than an Ethiopian black male, even if they share the alleles for skin color. This is because the gene pools that created they’re genetic material are different. That’s just the way genetics works.

Darwin’s finches became different species due to genetic isolation and random mutations that occurred within their respective gene pools. Those mutations were absent from the gene pools of the finches on the other islands. If you truly wanted to create races through genetic clusters, those clusters wouldn’t be associated only with alleles for skin color.

The most accurate subcategory would be gene pools or a full cluster analysis, especially given the human genome has more than 3 Million nucleotides. Those gene pools do not correlate with the few dozen alleles associated with skin color and you’d be just as accurate attempting to use height or blood type as a genetic proxy, since those too are cause by variation in alleles.",eusebius13,t2_1ldarimg,1,0,reddit4

>I mean as in understandable. 

That's fair, and that's an issue of intelligibility, which is different from being ""bad."" I have coached international students in how to reduce their inflected accents, for instance. 

What I'm talking about are issues of dialect that either (a) don't affect intelligibility or (b) would be pretty easy to learn. To the former, slight accents shouldn't be a big deal, but nonetheless some accents are ostracized even when only slightly present. To the latter, people in business settings are obviously able to learn and use some nonstandard forms, but they don't learn others. For instance, ""you all"" and ""y'all"" is widespread where I'm at, I had one supervisor from the upper Midwest saying ""might could"" and ""thanks much,"" and I've heard our equivalent of a CFO from Appalachia say ""fixin' to."" It's nonstandard, but we learn it. But a form like [habitual be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_be), even though it's efficacious for communicating a specific idea (repetitive action) and doesn't pose especial difficulties for people who don't know it, is something people react strongly to and is generally avoided in professional settings.",TaliesinMerlin,t2_xf5n3,2,0,reddit4

hngh2ck,t1_hngf77e,2021-12-06 13:42:14,science,"I agree with most of that. I'm not sure where I fall on my opinion of standardizing professional communication for clarity and specificity, but I think it there could be arguements either way.

For instance, ""ya'll"" and ""you all"" are just slight regional changes for a word, similar to pop vs soda. Along with ""might could"" and ""thanks much,"" they're all a slightly nonstandard but nevertheless regional modification to common words or turns of phrase. 

On the other hand, the habitual be actually comes with grammatical changes that aren't intuitive. From the Wikipedia article:

> It is a common misconception that AAVE speakers simply replace is with be across all tenses, with no added meaning. In fact, AAVE speakers use be to mark a habitual grammatical aspect not explicitly distinguished in Standard English. For example, to be singing means to sing habitually, not to presently be singing

I can empathize with both the people who want to speak most comfortably in their dialect, but also see how standardized communication reduces misunderstandings that could be costly.

I know I'm reiterating what you said about it, I'm making the point that I'm not sure what range of dialects we should reasonably expect people to be familiar with in business settings, seeing as how its a pretty international affair and specificity is of greater importance.",Foxsayy,t2_z7sal,8,0,reddit4

hnieh4v,t1_hni9jk4,2021-12-06 21:32:57,science,"Well the data show there’s more genetic variation within a racial category, the between racial categories. For example there’s potentially more genetic difference between two black people, than the average black person and the average white person.

In fact, this study agrees with you, for the most part, and suggests that considering race in healthcare is retarding progress because race is a social category. 

> We know that there is an association between socially constructed race and the likelihood that one lives near a toxic waste site (Bullard and others 2007). Thus it is true that in the United States, person who is a non-European American is highly likely to be exposed to environmental toxins that contribute to their increased likelihood to develop a complex disease in later life.

> http://hedrick.ucsd.edu/BICD136/PDF-links/Race_and_Biomedical_Research_2009-libre.pdf

But the cause is not genetic even though that’s the assumption. That race is a social construct has been accepted by the science community for decades now:

>''Race is a social concept, not a scientific one,'' said Dr. J. Craig Venter, head of the Celera Genomics Corporation in Rockville, Md. ''We all evolved in the last 100,000 years from the same small number of tribes that migrated out of Africa and colonized the world.''

>Dr. Venter and scientists at the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they had put together a draft of the entire sequence of the human genome, and the researchers had unanimously declared, there is only one race -- the human race.

>Dr. Venter and other researchers say that those traits most commonly used to distinguish one race from another, like skin and eye color, or the width of the nose, are traits controlled by a relatively few number of genes, and thus have been able to change rapidly in response to extreme environmental pressures during the short course of Homo sapiens history.

> https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/22/science/do-races-differ-not-really-genes-show.html?referringSource=articleShare

Finally I’m not suggesting that you’re promoting discrimination on any level. The bottom line is the scientific community is largely unified on the fact that race does not have a genetic basis or result in genetic tendencies. The trends that you speak of are not going to apply to race broadly, except for the social consequences of race. If they were genetic, first, you’d have clear genetic categories, second you’d have a clear set of isolated genes. Neither exist. 

The definition of racist has value, because there are still people who believe race is a causative factor in traits and tendencies. Outside of the social consequences of race, there’s no data to support that. And the record is clear, there is no genetic basis for differences outside of the way the alleles for skin color, etc express themselves.",eusebius13,t2_1ldarimg,1,0,reddit4

ghizcr1,t3_kn3msp,2020-12-30 19:19:53,science,"[Earlier version of this paper by the same author.](https://www.upf.edu/documents/2963149/3253728/The_Labor_Market_Impact_of_Undocumented_Immigrants_Christoph_Albert_April2017.pdf)

&#x200B;

tl;dr    


1. Undocumented immigrants have a lower reservation wage than documented, and are willing to accept lower wages as a result.   
2.  Firms see this wage difference, and select lower cost workers.
3. This lower cost for the firm results in higher demand for documented labor downstream because firms face lower marginal costs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Because firms job creation is a function of the labor costs, the more the wage difference between documented and undocumented, the more jobs they create for documented.     This means that if the government reduces undocumented labor, *documented labor income falls* as firms cut back on hiring to save costs. 

&#x200B;

The author notes:

>  
 ""Hence, undocumented immigration is unambiguously beneficial for documented workers as it raises their job finding rates and wages. ""  
>  
>  
>  
> I use the framework to simulate a policy of stricter immigration enforcement by increasing the removal risk. One effect of this is an increase in the break-up probability for matches with undocumented workers, which lowers job creation and depresses job finding rates and wages of all workers. A second effect arises, if the risk increases more strongly for employed than for unemployed undocumented workers. A higher removal rate for the employed implies that firms have to pay a risk compensation in order to induce an undocumented worker to accept a job. This compensation raises expected wage costs, decreases the expected profits from opening a vacancy and as a consequence depresses job creation and job finding rates of all workers further. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does the author test this?     

 

First, it basically only applies those who are substitutes for low skill labor --- US native high school dropouts. 

&#x200B;

> Given the large size of the immigrant workforce relative to natives among high school dropouts, I choose to restrict my empirical analysis to this education level only (for simplicity henceforth referred to as ""low-skilled"").  

&#x200B;

Additionally, the author notes that choosing such a limited and homogenously skilled group is a makes documented vs undocumented measure more precise, and reduces unobserved effect on skills that could affect wages. 

&#x200B;

The author then proceeds to show their model which is derived from previous economic work 

> This section presents a labor market model extending the canonical search and matching framework (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994) with non-random hiring, whose implementation is based on the hiring mechanism in Barnichon and Zylberberg (2014). They depart from the assumption that matching is strictly random and instead allow firms to gather and rank several applications and hire the worker they receive the highest surplus from. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A couple of things the author changes from the previous models:

1.  undocumented are not eligible for gov benefits
2. undocumented have lower bargaining power 
3. undocumented can be removed from the labor pool

&#x200B;

The author then models the probability of a worker applying and being selected, and the amount of surplus they can extract from the firm. 

&#x200B;

Then the author models the reservation wage.    In the equations, if you set the documented and undocumented to be equal, terms will cancel such that their reservation wage is equal. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then we're onto the firms.    Table 6 summarizes the choice the firms will make based on profit. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How does this begin to  look at equilibrium?  First, an important point: 

>  
>  
> As in the standard search framework, the ratio of job seekers to vacancies for each worker type is independent of the size of the total unemployment pool uD + uU . What determines the equilibrium is the ratio of documented to undocumented workers among the unemployed uU /uD = qU /qD. With the given distribution of profits, it can easily be verified that the higher 32 is this ratio, the higher is the probability of having at least one undocumented applicant and therefore the higher are expected firm profits. Hence, while an increase in the unemployment pool that leaves uU /uD unchanged does not affect the equilibrium as vacancies will increase proportionally, a relative increase in uU compared to uD will lead to an increase in vacancies that is overproportional to the increase of the total unemployment pool and vice versa. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The author then accounts for inflows and outflows in the market, and calibrates the model to the data. 

&#x200B;

Equations 22,23,24 summarize the job creation and wage effects.    Practice your partial derivatives because what this shows is that the more the reservation differs, the more vacancies are posted. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, the author tests the model -- which effect is most pronounced?   

&#x200B;

We find that in [Figure 12.](https://imgur.com/a/YLK1CE6)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As the share of undocumented rises, job finding *for both groups* rise, and wages *for documented workers* rise. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The author notes:

&#x200B;

> **In sum, undocumented immigration is unambiguously beneficial for documented workers**

This is simply a case of supply and demand.  Increasing the supply of labor tends to depress wages, benefiting employers and harming workers.  This doesn't harm undocumented workers themselves because any job they can get in USA will pay better than in their home country.

This is why big corporations and both political parties almost always support globalization/immigration.  Globalization means (1) they can make their goods cheaply in third world countries and sell them in America, or (2) in cases where outsourcing is impracticable, they can import cheaper workers to replace more expensive American workers.  

Whether immigration benefits America as a whole is a more complication calculation.  Where the immigrant worker is highly educated (foreign educated tech workers, doctors, etc), I can easily see a net benefit since the USA is receiving the benefits of his/her education without actually investing in it.

The dominant effect depends on the fall in wage costs, which is larger for undocumented immigration than it is for legal immigration. The model predicts a dominating job creation effect for the former, reducing natives' unemployment rate, but not for the latter.

An [ungated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tn-RdjPrletJeuZdF_Z8nPpya7FXgf7z/view) version of the paper. Here is the conclusion of the paper:

> This paper analyzes the distinct labor market effects of documented and undocumented immi-
gration in a framework that generates predictions consistent with a number of key data patterns, in particular large differences in job finding rates between natives and immigrants. As differ-
entials in job finding rates are at odds with a standard random matching mechanism, I propose
a job search model with non-random hiring and worker heterogeneity in bargaining power, un-
employment benefits and deportation risk. As immigrants accept the lower wages, firms always
prefer to hire them when having the choice. Immigration has two opposing effects on natives.
The creation of additional vacancies due to lower average wage costs decreases their unem-
ployment rate, whereas the higher competition for jobs through cheaper workers increases it.
Simulating the model shows that the job creation effect dominates the competition effect of
undocumented immigration, implying employment gains and a strong rise in wages for natives.
The opposite is the case for documented immigration, which drives down average wage costs
only marginally and thus has a weak job creation effect. I test these predictions by estimating
the impact of immigrant population shares on vacancies and wages among low-skilled workers
and find qualitative support for the results.

> A rise in the deportation rate for undocumented immigrants dampens job creation due to
a lower expected firm surplus, which in turn lowers the job finding rates of all workers. In
case the deportation rate rises more for employed undocumented workers, for example through
worksite raids, job finding rates and wages of legal workers fall more strongly, wheres wages
of undocumented workers rise due to a risk premium for accepting a job.

> The findings of this paper have important policy implications. Shielding the economy from
low-skilled undocumented immigration or providing legal status to present undocumented im-
migrants has a negative impact on the employment opportunities and wages of low-skilled
natives, at least in the short run. Therefore, such policies would achieve the exact opposite of
what they are intended for. The same holds for stricter immigration enforcement through in-
creased deportations, which is predicted to be detrimental for all workers. The negative impact on natives is especially large, if deportation policies mainly target undocumented immigrants
at their workplace.

> The presented model certainly neglects other relevant dimensions of heterogeneity between
documented and undocumented immigrants that might come into effect rather in the long run.
The higher prospect of a long-term stay in the US for example could incentivize immigrants
with legal status to invest in their education and host-country-specific skills, move to more
productive jobs or become entrepreneurs, all of which is likely to increase their productivity and
to have positive spillovers on natives. Moreover, the effects on high-skilled workers working in
jobs complementary to low-skilled workers’ jobs are not considered in this paper. This leaves
many avenues for future research on undocumented immigration, which could be facilitated by
improved data resources or new policy experiments.

Note that since the paper doesn't consider the long-term effects of immigration, which tend to have positive spillovers on natives (see last paragraph of the conclusion), the paper provides a conservative assessment of the beneficial effects of undocumented and documented immigration.",smurfyjenkins,t2_6yoba,-35,0,reddit3

It’s totally justified too. There’s a quote from the study that others have posted that says that undocumented laborers have higher job finding rates than American workers because they can work for lower wages. 

There IS a debate to be had regarding whether this is a net good for society anyways. Undocumented labor is providing consumers with cheap prices and it is possible that the lower prices would account for the lower wages, leading to no change in real wages. But then again, nominal wages falling would mean that the relative price of foreign goods would go up. But it’s also possible that the lower nominal wages would attract more jobs and companies to America.

Long story short, there’re a lot of economic questions surrounding undocumented labor, but this title is misleading. One thing we do know is  that yes, undocumented labor leads to lower nominal wages and increased competition for jobs.",,,0,0,reddit3

You can't trust economic research. As others have mentioned here, a lot of assumptions were made in this paper. That's par for the course with economics. Any economic model and generally any economic paper you read will essentially make the assumption that the choices made by agents or whoever is being observed are optimal (with respect to utility, which is literally just a backed out value to give numerical order to choices people make) given their information and constraints. This is a dumb assumption to make for macroeconomic analysis because it means any intervention taken on a market causes a decrease in welfare/output/whatever. It means the free market and what you observe is the best outcome. This influenced Regan in lowering high income tax rates and trickle down economics. This made Greenspan enthusiastic in deregulation of financial markets. This means unions are bad and reducing protections for native citizens from immigrant laborers is good. This means lowering labor costs ie. wages and sending jobs overseas is good. This means, as you may have heard according to Larry Summers, transferring cash from higher to lower income members of society such as through the $2,000 stimulus checks is bad and causes the most productive members of society to work less. It's all horseshit and economists need to be called out on the poison they've tainted society with. I sure hope scientists don't fall for the crap called economic research.",,,1,0,reddit3

Essentially what we know about immigration is that: 

1. the net benefit is always positive in the long run
2. the short run effect on wages is ambiguous and inconclusive, some studies find that wages are lower in the short run others find that they're not, and others again find that generally if wages are adversely effected it's usually to the detriment of first/second gen immigrants who the new immigrants are a closer substitute for than the native population
3. the most important point is that due to point 1 we could in theory compensate workers for any loss in income they incur due to the effects of immigration and this would still be more beneficial than simply restricting immigration",Gore-Galore,t2_yxpd6,3,0,reddit3

At least the abstract makes no mention of stricter immigration policies, nor does it mention if they are harmful to all workers - native or immigrant alike. 

> This paper studies the labor market effects of both documented and undocumented immigration in a search model featuring nonrandom hiring. As immigrants accept lower wages, they are preferably chosen by firms and therefore have higher job finding rates than natives, consistent with evidence found in US data. Immigration leads to the creation of additional jobs but also raises competition for natives. The dominant effect depends on the fall in wage costs, which is larger for undocumented immigration than it is for legal immigration.

American burger flipper becomes assistant manager since immigrant push up his job to a better one. No immigrant then his job would go back to burger flipping.

You say supply and demand but you're completely ignoring demand. Immigrants also need to eat. With immigration simultaneously raising labor supply AND demand, the net effect becomes an empirical question. And the data says.. its mostly a wash on native wages and employment rate.

Immigration leads to the creation of additional jobs but also raises competition for natives.

You're absolutely right that this is really counterintuitive!

Best explanation we've got is that jobs are ""needs."" Bringing in more people increases competition for jobs, but also and more importantly increases the amount of food and clothing and shelter needed in an area, which absolutely increases demand for jobs.

The idea that there's a fixed number of jobs and any new entrants depress wages is called the [lump of labor fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy). It's easy to see that's not how jobs work, because the USA does not have the same number of jobs today as it had in the 90s, or 50s, or back in 1776 when there were only a few million people. And if we dwindled to a society of 100 and everyone died off Children of Men style, there would not still be 200 million jobs for those 10 to fill. IBM wouldn't be hiring anybody to answer the phones in that world!

That's not too say it's unambiguously the case that the net impact of immigration is always positive for the lowest paid. Generally, empirical work on this has tended to find that that it's a bit net negative for the lowest paid but very positive for everyone else - such that a society can choose to use fiscal redistribution to ensure that *all* segments are net richer as a result of immigration than they would be without it.

**Key Points**

* While some policymakers have blamed immigration for slowing U.S. wage growth since the 1970s, most academic research finds little long run effect on Americans’ wages.

* The available evidence suggests that immigration leads to more innovation, a better educated workforce, greater occupational specialization, better matching of skills with jobs, and higher overall economic productivity.

* Immigration also has a net positive effect on combined federal, state, and local budgets. But not all taxpayers benefit equally. In regions with large populations of less educated, low-income immigrants, native-born residents bear significant net costs due to immigrants’ use of public services, especially education.

I have experience this first hand over the last 20 years running my own business.  Example, reception job got no real applicants at a low wage so we had to raise the pay rate to get applicants and a worker.  We offered more in the ad and got several applicants and hired one.  This has happened with other positions as well and it varied based on how the economy is doing.

As I said, I'd rather they got livable wages. Because, from experience, I'm aware that poverty sucks for everyone all around. (Wow, poor people can't afford to buy things? Shocker.)

But as I also said, agriculture is not a profitable industry. How to pay workers more if you're going into debt just trying to sell your life-essential products at prices customers can afford?

Leading back to... as I said, again: Good luck with that moral dilemma. I'm fully aware it's a complex situation with no clear answer. So, given the choice between options ""stupid,"" ""wrong,"" and ""stupidly wrong,"" I'm willing to deal with the choice that gives employment to the people who actually need it, lets farmowners actually run a business with less dependency on government handouts, and makes food more affordable to more people (even if it is only slightly so on an individual level, a few cents for everyone across a state adds up).

*Could* you make a moral objection to one thing or another about this state of affairs? Sure, whatever, but you're missing the point. If your objection is that *immigrants* are taking jobs ""Americans"" might be able to, then you're forgetting the fact that the only difference between an American and an immigrant is legal registration. If you're trying to argue that *illegal* immigrants don't pay taxes, your solutions are to spend hideous amounts of money trying to keep willing laborers out, or to actually register those laborers (by force, if need be), so you can actually tax the people who are, more frequently than not, entirely willing to pay taxes if given the opportunity. If your objection is that these people aren't being paid enough for their labor, then tracking them down, registering them as citizens, and forcing businesses to pay them just and fair wages is the logical priority. If your objection is that farmowners should be hiring legal Americans over illegal residents, then your priority will have to be figuring out why Americans aren't willing to do those jobs even when farmowners actually try hiring Americans by offering competitive wages.

Or. You could leave things as they are now. Say what you will about the current state of affairs, but it's at least a functional system that benefits all its participants to at least a minor extent. Morally speaking, that isn't the *wrong* choice. Lazy choice, sure. But not the wrong one.",,,1,0,reddit3

>The findings of this paper have important policy implications. Shielding the economy from low-skilled undocumented immigration or providing legal status to present undocumented immigrants has a negative impact on the employment opportunities and wages of competing low-skilled natives. Therefore, such policies would achieve the exact opposite of what they are intended for. The same holds for stricter immigration enforcement through increased deportations, which is predicted to be detrimental for all workers. The negative impact on natives is especially large, if deportation policies mainly target undocumented immigrants at their workplace

2. reductions in costs in one area increase demand in another.  

Intuitively, the less you spend on a,b,c, the more you can spend on x,y,z.   As a,b,c get cheaper, the more demand x,y,z and the more the economy will shift resources to x,y,z.

The company I worked for was great and took a lot of pride in what they did, but I could easily see some less scrupulous companies slipping a couple extra ""temp"" workers onto a team.

A bit of a side note, the summer I worked there was some sort of tightening of immigration restrictions which lead to a labor shortage.  I heard my boss mention it a couple times.  It's part of the reason I was able to get a job there, but it also meant a lot of new hires that weren't ideal, or that left not long after being hired.

> The crux of the problem is that the plusses and minuses are not distributed equally. The academy found, for example, that the willingness of less-skilled immigrants to work at low pay reduced consumption costs — the costs to consumers of goods and services like health care, child care, food preparation, house cleaning, repair and construction — for millions of Americans. This resulted in “positive net benefits to the U.S. economy during the last two decades of the 20th century.” These low-wage workers simultaneously generated “a redistribution of wealth from low- to high-skilled native-born workers.”

> In summary, the immigration surplus stems from the increase in the return to capital that results from the increased supply of labor and the subsequent fall in wages. Natives who own more capital will receive more income from the immigration surplus than natives who own less capital, who can consequently be adversely affected.

> lowers the wages of competing workers, while raising the return to capital and the wages of complementary workers. In other words, the immigration surplus does not accrue equally to everyone. It goes primarily to the owners of capital, which includes business and landowners and investors.

> Competing workers’ wages fall, at least in the initial transition period as the economy adjusts to the new labor inflow. Research suggests that previous immigrants suffer more of the adverse wage effects than do natives. Research also suggests any negative wage effects are concentrated among low-skilled — not high-skilled — workers.",Hugogs10,t2_mns8z,0,0,reddit3

gksco6u,t1_gkrvyaa,2021-01-26 03:43:02,science,"Demographics change is absolutely a concern for me because it plays into every other factor like quality of life and politics.  Sure places like Switzerland take in immigrants and still maintain a relatively high quality of life, but it's still overwhelmingly majority white.  

Compare the state of California today to any New England state, like New Hampshire/Maine.  Both have had their local governments completely controlled by Democrats.  Yet people have been fleeing in record numbers out of California even before COVID and it has some of the lowest quality of life in the US, and is about 37% white.  And New Hampshire has some of the highest quality of life in the US, and it's over 90% white.  It's not as cut and dry as white=good but nonwhites overwhelmingly support one party while whites vote across both party lines every few years.  So the issues that are causing people to leave California like high taxes, high regulation, wealth inequality, and ineffective homeless treatment will likely never be regulated away because the party in power with the ability to do so will likely always remain in power.

ghlqe48,t1_ghkblhu,2020-12-31 13:20:51,science,">How does the “job creation channel” of immigration work in the model?

&#x200B;

Firms post vacancies based on expected [surplus](https://imgur.com/a/wbK97wj).     

The more surplus they expect, the more vacancies they post.

[Firms decision model](https://imgur.com/a/7hOqHRT) about whether to hire an undocumented worker vs documented.   

The only 'search friction' is the distribution of applicants to firms -- some firms will receive, others will receive zero.     This comes from just previous literature.  Productivity of each worker is normalized to 1, mirroring the broad homogeneous nature of this workforce.   

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Job creation occurs because firms will post more vacancies because they expect ever increasing surplus from the gains in productivity.

You're goal is to buy a functional car (a lime) and to avoid buying a car that has problems with it and needs more money in order to function (a lemon). Let's say you would be willing to pay $1,000 for the lime. Most people would agree that a lemon is worth $0 (for the sake of argument). When you go to view the car you want to buy, there is no way for you to know 100% if the car is a lime or a lemon.

Now, imagine that you are trying to sell a car in the same situation. You KNOW that the car you are selling is a lime and NOT a lemon so you list it for $1000. However, there is a large chance that it never sells despite being a perfectly good vehicle at a good price.

This is because the buyer and the seller have different amount of information and information is what dictates market price (or demand). The vast majority buyers are not willing to pay $1000 since a percentage of ""limes"" sold turn out to be lemons. As a result, market prices adjusts and trends towards the average of the two. In this situation, likely a little over $500.

If you move to the US from a poorer country, even a mediocre job where you live in a cramped conditions is still better for your family than if you'd stayed home. You're making progress. Immigrating was a good call for you.

Meanwhile for people who grew up here, we absorb from our parents the idea that a college degree and some elbow grease ought to earn you enough money to buy a house and raise a family, and yeah, that's kinda possible if you live in a tiny house and you tighten your belt relative to the standard of living you had in your parents' place. And yeah, ideas of what is an 'average' standard of living are certainly skewed by aspirational shows on TV, or even stuff like house hunting shows on HGTV. But it's pretty clear that relative to what our parents made us expect, a lot of us aren't actually prospering.

Me? I'm great. I grew up on a single parent's income in a 2000 square foot house with a huge yard right by a nice park, and now I live with my girlfriend in a 670 square foot apartment where the nearest greenspace is a mile away, and despite being 39 years old and having a degree from a much more prestigious college than my mom had, I'm earning (adjusted for inflation) just 2/3 what my mom earned at the same point in her career. 

But hey, I learned from her lesson and didn't fall into credit card debt. So I'm pretty stable.

But I've got friends ten years younger than me, who had to drop out of college during the Great Recession because their families couldn't support them, and who despite managing to get community college degrees while working through their twenties are working in a StitchFix warehouse or at Starbucks or doing gig work. And they have a sort of absurdist view of the American economy. They're pretty convinced that until a bunch of old people die off, there's no reason trying to pursue the American dream, because the folks with power and influence are actively working against them, since if the working class succeeds, that means lower profits for big corporations.

gjnkfpm,t1_ghjdscz,2021-01-17 22:04:02,science,"This is on the right track, but mischaracterizes the nature of the problem: the seller with a ""lime"" doesn't offer it for sale only to see it sit on the lot, rather, that seller withholds the car from the market.   The fundamental problem isn't that the good cars are too expensive in the presence of asymmetric information, the problem is the market for good cars may fail to form at all.

To see this, we need to make the example a little more elaborate so that there's some incentive for trades to take place.  Suppose sellers value good cars at $1,000 and buyers at $1,200, so that trade at any price between those values makes both parties better off.  Everyone values bad cars at $0.  Everyone knows there are equal numbers of good and bad cars out there, and that everyone is risk neutral.  Finally, sellers know whether their car is good or bad, but buyers have no idea.

Does a market form?  Note first that, if so, good and bad cars must trade at the same price, because buyers can't tell the difference.  So maybe a price of, say, $1,100 would clear the market?  At that price all cars are offered for sale.  Then a buyer is equally likely to wind up with a good or a bad car, so they value the car as equally likely to be worth $0 or $1,200, so they're willing to pay up to $600.  No one is willing buy a car at if the price is $1,100, and no market forms.

Notice this is true for any price above $1,000.  What about prices below $1,000?  Any price greater than zero and less than $1,000 induces all sellers with bad cars to offer them for sale, but no sellers with good cars.  Buyers then know that any car offered must be a lemon, and they value lemons at $0, so they don't buy.  This is the fundamental issue in a nutshell: a buyer thinks, ""aha! the very fact that this person is willing to sell me this car at this price means I shouldn't be willing to pay this price for this car.""

So what happens?  If we assume people trade when they're indifferent to trading, then a market forms, the price in the market is $0, all the cars traded are lemons, and there is no gain from trade.  If we assume people do not trade when indifferent, then there is no market at all.  In either case, it is impossible to trade good cars.",skedastic777,t2_30rxu8zw,1,0,reddit3

I did notice that most or all of these articles refer to it as ""forced labor"" and not ""slave labor.""

It's hard to say.

If I am remembering right, and your argument was ""slavery is any labor which is forced,"" then I guess you're right. Most people are still hesitant to say this qualifies, for some reason. Maybe that is for political reasons, because they fear what China may say.

I put on about 100lbs working there and didn’t start to lose it until I emotionally divorced myself from the position and devised an exit strategy. I’m currently unemployed and burning through my savings and I still feel less stress on a daily basis now that I’m gone even though my future has never been less certain in nearly 40 years.

It's depressing how often the goal becomes ""let's help you put band-aids on all of the stab wounds your job has inflicted upon your sense of self."" Nevermind the fact that you're working 50-60 hours at a salary job that is physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing. None of us are designed to do that and yet many of us are expected to.

Employers: That's just like... your responsibility. If you can't compartmentalize your exhaustion and perform like the rest of us, then maybe there's something wrong with you. 

As social workers, we are encouraged to look at our individual experiences through systems lenses. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors don't just exist in a vacuum- they're all impacted by a multitude of systems we operate within, some of which we aren't fully aware of. Family systems, medical systems, occupational systems, and we are so alienated from them that we really have no control. One thing I consistently find is the bigger the system, the further we are alienated and the easier it is for those in charge to disregard our humanity. 

A good portion of people are realistically trapped in dehumanizing positions that don't recognize or accommodate any kind of divergent minds. You stick to the protocol, no matter how inefficient it is for you, and if you're too slow at doing it our way, you lose your job. Capitalism has made us increasingly dependent on our jobs which is fantastic for employers as they have all the leverage.  Big-business employers lose hardly anything by firing people and in most cases can do it at-will. 

Yet if we lose our job we lose everything else we need to survive- and the ""safety nets"" like disability and unemployment assistance (*cough* right to work *cough*) have been so reworked by corporate interests that it becomes its own trap. The poorer you are, the more time and money it takes to do anything. And under capitalism our value is intrinsically tied to how much money we make. The systems appear designed to suck people down at every step of the way. It takes one thing outside of our control to get caught in a spiral of debt, and decades of near mistake-free effort on our part to get out of it. The more desperate we are for a paycheck, and the less we value ourselves, the easier we are to exploit as workers. Oh, joy!

Edit: I've never been given one reward, let alone 4. I feel  validated knowing that people are noticing similar things and grateful when we can take action to tend to our mental health as much as our physical health.

Ironically, it was actually an EAP through work that helped me realize I was in this kind of position and take action to protect myself. I really thought I would never be able to function as a social worker again and I was doomed to feel like a cog in a wheel- because my workplace was and they wanted me to believe that was the norm. Now that I am in a much smaller organization where my supervisor actually cares about my wellbeing and advocates on my behalf I can be reminded that I am not a broken person because I cannot meet the demands of work. I am a person doing my best to work in a broken system. 

Frankly, I don't think we should be expected to even maintain 40 hours a week at this rate. The data already suggests all sorts of detriment to societies who work more hours. At least, I don't think I can sustain that. My heart has been so heavy watching everything unfold through so many different perspectives of pain. I am honored to sit with clients through that and work toward ways to manage it more effectively.

The past three months have been non stop stress, anxiety, and frenetic efforts at simply staying above water on my duties. My relationship suffered, my mental well-being suffered, and my physical health suffered. I was diagnosed COVID positive the day after i put in my notice and i’ve still had to put in ungodly amounts of work, albeit from home, doing virtual therapy, setting up meetings, and finishing the absolutely ridiculous amount of documentation required for the job. My to do list is still 30 items long, and it’s friday. 

The few weeks before putting in my notice, I cried in bed at night and felt absolutely miserable when I woke up, knowing what was ahead of me that day. My work with clients suffered. My quality of work suffered. 

And at every turn, when i brought the concerns to my supervisor, he would talk out of both sides of his mouth: one day he’d tell the team to take time, set boundaries with our time, and practice self care. the next day, he’d be asking me why i wasn’t scheduling 2.5+ hour sessions with my clients on friday afternoons. 

it’s too much. it’s too much. as a mental health worker, this job nearly sent me off a cliff in three months. i lost interest in the things i used to love. i got irritated so the time. 

so, i’m done. i’m moving to a private practice where the money isn’t guaranteed, but it’s on my time and at my speed. i’m so fortunate to have the chance to do it and my heart breaks for people caught in situations feeling the way i felt for these past three months.

Even for non profit organisations, over working and understaffing often lead to this sort of problem, I’ve also heard of a phenomenon that I forget the name of. But the better an employee is, the more likely they are to be given extra tasks or take on extra work with the result being long term burnout and eventual leaving of the job. (If anyone knows the name of this phenomenon I’d appreciate reminding)

Even within the NHS of England, and ironically psychiatric nursing and crisis care. Burnout and overworking is common due to funding limitations and shortage of staff. Stress from simply not having enough staff to fulfil the roles needed and continuous pressure from above to complete the work safely and quickly without error when there isn’t enough staff to work safely or quickly is extreme.

There is a common joke amongst medical groups where bosses ask employees how they can help improve their mental well-being.

Of course the employees say stuff like, time off work, more staff to amend shortages, shorter hours and better pay.

The punchline is always the bosses responding with something like a YouTube video on yoga and breathing techniques. Which obviously ignores the core problem.",aallen1993,t2_42osx2ip,5,0,reddit1

genkm8i,t3_k6q4or,2020-12-05 00:53:53,science,"This is highly monetizable research for any company that wants to decrease employee turnover, optimize healthcare spending, and increase job satisfaction for all employees. 

Constantly hiring new employees because they keep on burning out or leaving abruptly can result in employees costing the company more than they make them, especially for positions that require ongoing training. 

Increased healthcare spending and providing employees with more PTO will give them more time and resources to address mental & physical health concerns. Employees that get regular, in-depth checkups are more likely to avoid sudden-onset illnesses that would otherwise cost the company months of time off to recover and address chronic illnesses that could threaten the employee's long-term productivity. Of course, this kind of healthcare policy must go hand-in-hand with decreasing employee turnover as long-term employees will exhibit the most significant increases in profitability/consistency.

If employees are not invested in the company's purpose, they will always have low job satisfaction. [Social support is found to be negatively associated with satisfaction and productivity] (https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2001-05924-006) and it's really the only way to improve worker satisfaction besides paying workers salaries that exceed the cost of living standards. Performance reviews, incentives, competitions, lotteries, and other low-effort management tactics rarely have a significant impact on worker productivity because they do not address the inherent flaws of the system as a whole.

Any company that wishes to improve profitability by means of improving the careers and lives of all its employees, not just management/executives, should absolutely be using these kinds of mental health metrics to drive transparent policy changes. Unfortunately, large corporations with high turnover and basically zero employee benefits have no interest in radically changing management strategies and worker culture. Why invest so much money in workers when they can put their money towards political lobbying for deregulation, stock buybacks, bailouts, and tax cuts and return incredible short-term profits without having to do the hard work of using managers and executives effectively? The answer is usually greed and apathy from the top executives, the same motives that got them there in the first place.",poop_toilet,t2_oe2s7,3,0,reddit1

If you start cutting people slack due to severity in work-related depressive symptoms - people will just overreport their stress. If you (like is mostly currently the case) develop a system where seeming not to suffer such symptoms is seen as good for business  - people will underreport them.   


Simply having a new categorization does nothing. It isn't even a first step if all it does is help classify you as one thing we don't have a solution for, or another thing we don't have a solution for. Changing the label you put on a person itself does nothing to help them overcome the issue.

geni15o,t1_gendh50,2020-12-05 00:28:18,science,"That’s an excellent logistical question. The aforementioned company partnered with Gallup for some kind of survey, I think they called it a pulse survey? idr. At any rate we filled it out for several years without incident and then suddenly one year my whole “team” was called into a room to “discuss” the results of the supposedly anonymous survey. The higher ups decided our answers reflected poorly on them in particular but played it as though there must have been some sort of breakdown in communication. Us lowly blue collar types must not have understood some of the questions, you see. It felt like a warning. The next year it happened again only this time they were clearly furious. I think they may have even used the word “ungrateful” at some point (because every day we drift closer and closer to a Dickensian hellscape). I actually sabotaged my entire future at that company just because my hyperlexic autistic ass couldn’t keep my mouth shut when parsing out the issues with the individual questions. I didn’t realize until halfway through the meeting that things had basically devolved into a dialogue between myself and the second in command at my department making it look like I was the trouble maker. This was especially ironic because I had been incredibly placating when filling out the survey for the express purpose of avoiding a repeat of the previous year. Needless to say on his journey back to HQ he stopped at every other store in my massive service area and created work orders with 24 hour response codes. I checked with my teammates and this didn’t happen to anyone else whose area he passed through. He’s also the architect of the changes I mentioned in my first comment so a real piece of work, that guy.

Now there are a few problems with the way Gallup conducted their survey. First of all although the survey was *technically* anonymous, it was recorded in a way the company could use the data “to make targeted improvements”, so it was divided by direct managerial reporting. This meant that although the stores we serviced were given their own subdivisions (a much larger group and therefor harder to target individuals) *we* were divided by teams. This meant that our subdivision was only 11 dudes, making it real easy to make guesses about who said what. So that sort of structuring really screwed my department’s ability to engage effectively with it. My company, like far too many, also had a horrendously retaliatory atmosphere which was never addressed in a meaningful way so tying a supervisor’s bonus to their underlings’ survey results was a real good way to make some poor wrench-turners’ lives hell.

I’m not completely sure how to avoid the same sorts of issues. Obviously giving the company less access to specific data could go a long way to keep things honest. Also, and maybe I’m being ridiculous here, it’s been my experience that companies who offer to throw pizza parties if a survey goes their way are probably already *kind of* decent, as ours would just give a coded “or else” and dangle no carrot of any kind. Another issue is that we had to use company terminals and our employee ID number (sorry, PERSON ID number) to access the survey. It might make more sense to allow individuals to use their social security numbers to access the system and fill out individual surveys for every company they’ve worked for (within the last fiscal year? idk) so that the company is taken out of the loop entirely. And before you jump to a company having a right to have input in the process, well I’m not so sure. If your concern is a bunch of employees basically being trolls to make them look bad, isn’t that an environment they’ve fostered? Shouldn’t they suffer the consequences for somehow turning themselves into a breeding ground for bitter dickheads? Again, I don’t know.

How do they determine a country’s happiness index? Could we upscale that? One thing that I know for sure is it’s not an issue that an unemployed plumber is going to solve in the comments on Reddit. I think it can be done by better minds than mine, but I’ve actually given up hope of seeing any major pro-labor (if even pro-human) moves in the US in my lifetime so I’m not holding my breath either way.",FadeToPuce,t2_69uwpttx,343,0,reddit1

I have accepted the reality that as a millennial, I need to just work for myself. The two biggest things I advocate to my peers to help their career is become code and data literate, and incorporate. The gig economy can actually be quite lucrative if you accept your 1099 through your own LLC. I can accept the ruling of Citizens V United that Corporations are ""People"". The implications of this are that you have more rights as an individual when you incorporate. Working for myself has allowed me to check out of the harmful corporate lies we are forced to ""believe"" to survive in that system. If you operate as an incorporated individual, there is so much opportunity. So many people need help with so much, and if you can code and understand data, you can model and solve problems 1000% more efficiently than those who cannot. My generation is going to be responsible for cleaning up all of this mess, and our ancestors have left all of the tools and cultural institutions to do it.

Just like the Great Generation made huge sacrifices to survive, we must do the same thing, and as a result, have the power to set up the rest of this century for peace and prosperity to flourish, just as they did for last century.",eitauisunity,t2_5jgfb,3,0,reddit1

gennhak,t1_geni15o,2020-12-05 01:21:52,science,"> I’m not completely sure how to avoid the same sorts of issues.

The US military does many surveys like this, for various occasions such as periodic reviews of unit cohesion/morale, evaluation of how well a new Commander or 1SG/CSM is doing, attention and adherence to anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment/assault policies, if the unit strongly employs safety measures and risk identification/mitigation processes, etc.

The way they do them, generally is that, say it's your Battalion being evaluated - this element consists of 2 or more Company sized elements (Usually 60-200 people). Each Company in that Battalion is given a web address for the survey, and an access code - that access code is, to my knowledge, different for every Company in that Battalion - although it may just be an identifier for that particular survey for that Battalion, and every one of the 500-1200+ Soldiers in that Battalion may use the same access code. This web address and access code is blasted out to every Soldier via e-mail, text message, print-out, sending a picture of it, etc.

Most of them, the only identifying information you provide is your rank, sex (Not gender, but we'll get there eventually), race/ethnicity, age range, and time in service. The last three may have a 'Decline to answer' option on some of these surveys.

Then it goes through a shitton of 'Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, Not Applicable' type of questions, and ends with several questions that allow you to type a response in your own words, and the answers are presented to the command team exactly as written. In some of these surveys, the command team can insert custom questions in this area if they choose to, to gain more information about pre-identified problem areas (I.e. maybe there's a clique of junior leaders that are particularly harsh in enforcing standards with or disciplining a unit's two or three openly homosexual Soldiers; or the commander suspects that hazing rituals take place when a new Soldier is assigned to X squad or Y platoon).

Obviously, even that minimal information can still be used to identify some people - we had one of these surveys about a year ago, and one of my friends and coworkers, the only female Sergeant First Class in our unit at the time, would have very easily been identified should someone who wished to do so have access to the answers among specific demographics (I.e. I want to see how all female E-7's in our unit - all one of them - answered). I am unsure if unit leadership has the capability of doing this when the survey period is over, and the results are released to the command team, however.",Droidball,t2_ha9a4,55,0,reddit1

Frankly, we need to start building a parallel government—like a union but much larger—to play ball with the rich, heartless fucks.  Eventually, we need to end tolerance for capitalist fuckery.  We need to become independent, just like a child of a narcissist does.

However I worked for a great team leader, very empathic, tailored his way of leading to each team member. When he got the comments back I walked in on him talking to the manager about it and he could tell by the way the comments were written who had said what in the majority of cases, he was saying.

The manager continued that she wished there were more comments as she was genuinely confused about some of the responses. It seemed to her that 2 questions were practically the same but on one hand the group had said the group was doing well and on the other question they said things needed to change.

She also struggled with how to improve things. She asked if holding a group meeting to ask for ideas from staff was a good thing or if it undid the anonymity folks had in the survey form. She put this to us in a meeting and asked for a blind ballot and said if anyone was uncomfortable she would not ask for ideas in a group meeting but try think of another way.

I am of the strong belief that you can create a perfect system, **but** as soon as you add people it starts showing cracks.

Like incentivising doctors to get their patient stats up in heart rate. blood pressure lack of smoking etc = doctors only taking on healthy patients.

Unfortunately part of the reason I write the way I do is because of my relationship with the autism spectrum. I was reading at a very early age as a result of what is sometimes called “hyperlexia”. Put in popular autism language, reading/writing are my “special interest”.

That said, as strange as it sounds, I actually credit comic books with a lot of my early vocabulary. I can’t speak much for today’s comics, but in the 1990s a lot of complex science fiction concepts were getting into comics and I would read them with a dictionary nearby. It seemed like every other day someone was being put into a genetic recombination device, or being assimilated into a symbiotic organism against their will, and *so much* electromagnetism; you couldn’t walk 10 feet in the Marvel Universe in the 1990s without stepping into an EM field or getting hit by an EM pulse. It was madness! But I also don’t think the value of an art form which uses a combination of words *and* pictures can be understated for a person trying to expand their vocabulary or learn a language.

gep5if7,t1_geooye7,2020-12-05 13:54:41,science,"That's definitely a good point. As an example, I recently started working as a contractor for a pharma company and ostensibly, my work would be less stressful than the people I work with who are full time employees of the company. I am hourly and not supposed to work more than 40 hours a week, whereas they are salary and sometimes will work a fair amount more than that. 

But an employee at the same level I would be would get 3 to 4 weeks of vacation, sick time that isn't tracked (just don't abuse it basically), personal days, good benefits with stock, retirement etc. But as a contractor I don't get any of that, 0 paid time off, no benefits, little job security, although the base pay is good since the company saves a lot not having to pay those ancillary costs.  

And I'm not actually complaining about it for myself. I'm lucky enough with my spouse's salary that we can afford for me to take unpaid time off without much hardship, I can be on her health insurance and so forth, so it's not causing too much stress. 

But for someone not in that position, who may have to pay really high rates for insurance or just not have it, who has to decide if they should work while extremely sick or take zero holidays because they can't afford to not be paid, who can expect to be fired at any time despite having no performance issues, it probably could be extremely stressful. 

I'm definitely happy to not be in that position, but it strikes as somewhat disingenuous that the company I work for stresses that their employees are treated very well, it's a big family and all that corporate lingo. And from what I've seen so far, that is true to some degree for their full time employees.

geo7rpq,t1_genzkwc,2020-12-05 04:55:52,science,"Hey, I apologize in advance if this is not something you’re interested in or if this feels like I’m trying to push something on you as that is not my intention, but I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life and I’m actually off of work on leave right now due to burnout/secondary traumatic stress in order to work on myself. I thought I might put out into the world what I’ve been up to in case it may help anyone else. Please disregard all of this if you are not interested or if you need or want to for any reason. 

I’m not sure what forms of therapy you’re familiar with, but the two I’m working on right now are dialectical behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. I have a workbook for DBT and a CBT for depression workbook. I went into this leave thinking I wanted to focus on DBT in order to build up coping skills to fortify my resilience and ability to cope when I return to work, but when I finally started it I realized I actually had other work to do in the CBT department that sort of needs to be priority. DBT is more skills training based and CBT is more focused on retraining/rewiring your brain to change the thought processes like negative feedback loops and rumination, and reframing them to be something more positive that you’re then able to work with. I’ve had my CBT workbook for years and never really got into it because I just wasn’t ready, but now I actually am and feel like I’m making progress. My therapist helps me out a lot because I have a hard time coming up with the alternate framings but it’ll get better with practice I know. 

There are tons of workbooks out there on DBT and CBT and for all sorts of conditions depending on what you may need, for instance I got a CBT for anxiety workbook for one of my friends a while back and I scanned through it before I gave it to them, and i found it wasn’t really for me because depression is more primary for me than anxiety is. Your therapist may also be able to get some worksheets for you for some of the stuff. 

If you aren’t interested in workbooks, there are tons of videos on YouTube on all sorts of different topics related to mental health conditions and different types of therapy like DBT and CBT. There’s a subreddit for DBT help that I peeked at the other day and it seemed a bit daunting and overwhelming for me, but you might not have that same experience. I’m sure there are tons of other specific subreddits out there for whatever you may be looking for anyway.

One major thing for me underlying all my issues is that I lived with undiagnosed ADHD for the first almost 3 decades of my life and I do not have a handle on it whatsoever. I’m a just barely functioning human on a good day. Just yesterday I came across a podcast called Translating ADHD and it is basically a verbal reading of my autobiography. You may be interested in it even if you don’t have ADHD because I feel like the lessons they talk about would be helpful for anyone, but that could just be because I relate to them so much. But if not that one, there’s tons of different podcasts to choose from that might be helpful. 

I know this is long-winded, I apologize. I’m not very good at simplifying things very well. I probably was going to even write more but I’m falling asleep right now and can’t remember. If you ever want to reach out to talk about anything, about how you’re doing, about these or other resources, or whatever, feel free. Everyone’s journey to wellness is their own and everyone must go at their own pace and there’s nothing wrong with that. I’ve made quite a bit of progress over the years from where I began, slowly and little by little, and I still have a long way to go. I wish you all the best in your journey and I’m rooting for you.

gerabke,t1_geokco8,2020-12-06 00:43:19,science,"I definitely agree about the different things for different people thing. Even different things for the same person at different times. I’ve remembered some of what I forgot to mention last night. A big part of my journey has been research. Accessing and learning as much about my conditions, treatment, and the human condition in general as much as I could, however I could. Books, websites, documentaries/movies, other people (older and wiser), and I even ended up getting my degree because of it. Processing the knowledge and applying it to my own life has been a much slower go of it though, partly because I’d never made myself or my mental health the priority.

Self care is so important. Even just learning a bunch of different things about self care is important. And having a whole list of self care things to reference and utilize that are personal for yourself, because everyone is different. It’s awesome you incorporate mediation into your routine, meditation is great. I’m not great at it, but want to get better. I’ve learned (and still am learning) that self care isn’t always necessarily what you most want to be doing, but what you need. For example, I may want to veg out on the couch and watch Netflix for days, but what I actually need is to get up, shower, and clean up my living space. And sometimes when I don’t have it in me to get up, knowing that it’s okay to sit with my feelings and take some time to just be. Self care can be as small as showering, brushing your teeth, and putting on clean clothes, to exercising, doing hobbies, or socializing with others. Another thing that’s helpful is being able to recognize when you’re not doing okay, and reaching out to your support people and communicating that to them. It’s okay to ask for help. It isn’t weakness, it’s actually a strength. 

More self care is cutting out toxic and negative people from your life. Remembering to be kind to yourself and knowing that on any given day you did your best is important too. And I don’t mean doing your best as in you tried your hardest, I mean that whatever happened that day, was your best that you could do that day. Maybe you wanted to get more done, maybe you’d done better at something before than you did that day, or maybe you have gotten more done in a day before than you did, but understanding that your best that day was different and was what it was and that it’s okay. Forgiving yourself and again, being kind to yourself helps. 

Another thing about research I find to be important is I research anything before I get it or do it. Like the workbooks, to get good quality/helpful ones. Also, I’ve been to quite a few therapists over the years but it wasn’t until I researched to find someone that specialized in my needs that I found one that actually helped. I researched the psychiatrists in the area before choosing and I ended up with a really great psychiatrist that literally saved my life. I’ve been on a ton of different medications and combinations over the years and everyone is different when it comes to meds but having a really competent, intelligent, and perceptive psychiatrist has been priceless. 

I’m not sure if you’ve had a psychological evaluation before, but sometimes they can be helpful to give you and your care providers insight into your specific conditions and psychology and the summary often includes recommendations on what sort of treatment plan might be helpful specifically for you. I think those are all the biggest things that have played roles in my journey and recovery. Hopefully some of these might stand out for others in need and might help guide someone else in their journey. 

Again, if you ever want to or are in need, reach out anytime. Best of luck!",okeyemscarednow,t2_2xayjs10,2,0,reddit1

h4z1r0t,t1_h4y6tff,2021-07-12 22:37:40,science,"This focus around cultural assimilation has always seemed short-sighted and misplaced to me. The cultural differences between immigrants and their first-generation children are huge enough to ensure that the resulting children are culturally “distinct” within one generation, to say nothing of subsequent ones. Those kids are hyper-aware of which inherited cultural traits or behaviors have negative value in their birth country, so those are often the first to go. An easy example are morals around relationships and sexuality. Go to any high school in New Jersey and you can find first-gen kids born of traditional marriages - they’ll have partners of a different ethnicity and have pre-marital sexual experiences behind their parents back.

The key to **integration** has always been maintaining a social contract with those subsequent-gen kids that offers them the possibility of being valued in society at large. Individuals then pick and choose what elements of their parents culture to retain in order to fit in. If instead they encounter a wider society that consistently treats them as “other”, then they’ll self-select themselves by keeping within their immigrant communities.

As an example, it took generations for Italian-Americans to be accepted by white American society, but now that they are, you see the decline of historically exclusive Italian neighborhoods. What purpose does that kind of cultural haven serve for a sixth-gen Italian-American? For that matter, how many Americans today can say they have exclusively Italian-American ancestry? You know assimilation can take place in American society when someone can confidently declare they “are” Polish, Greek, Italian, and Irish all at once.

Meanwhile, African Americans were historically not allowed to have a valued place in America (by excluding them from the dominant “White” society, but also by violently suppressing the parallel Black society). Black community and culture is still strong today because Black people still experience the sort of racism that reveals they are valued differently in “normal” society.

Similarly, many Americans of Asian descent have created and maintain a Pan Asian-American (AAPI) identity to address the unique challenges they face in American society. You see individuals who identify first and foremost as American and absolutely resent the seemingly innocuous questions about their ancestry (“where are you *really* from?”). Despite the fact that many would say that they (as the “model” minority) have been successfully integrated in economic, educational, and cultural aspects of wider American society, they are not immune from being *othered*.",telamascope,t2_3m0k3,57,0,reddit2

h50di66,t1_h4zdr2b,2021-07-13 06:24:32,science,"To be more clear, the problem I have is with the term. Assimilation implies loss of existing identity but also a misplaced sense of the principal agent of change.

The focus on the term assimilation is raised from the perspective of the cultural majority concerned with preserving their unique character when facing new kinds of immigrants for the first time. That can be a completely valid concern that can be expressed and addressed in good faith ways, but it’s commonly seen as a desire to have minorities molded to fit into the existing society where that the majority culture has a duty to be involved in the process to keep out incompatible values. I’m thinking specifically of the attitude behind policies like the French ban on burqas and hijabs.

What experienced immigrant-friendly societies have repeatedly seen is that cultural minorities (especially children) will **integrate** themselves on their own terms if the destination at the end of said process is seen to be achievable. It happens both due to positive and negative experiences these individuals will inevitably have by being in contact with the majority (in this I absolutely agree that groups need to interact). Positive reinforcements may be realizing that playing a certain sport is valued, so an individual may be motivated to participate. Equally as important (though less acknowledged) are negative examples, such as when bilingual children realize that speaking their parents’ language is not valued among their monolingual peers. Other classic examples are accents, foods, and incompatible values inherited from their parents. The key is that these are things that the individuals have some sort of agency over - people will go through a lot of pain and effort to succeed in their environment. And it gets easier with each subsequent generation as the distance between an individual’s cultural poles shrinks (or, ideally, as one can learn to accept or reconcile parts of both identities). However, the key is that the goal of shrinking that conflict needs to be seen as achievable and worth the effort - that is to say that any barriers are not seen as insurmountable.

With that, I come back to the French covering ban. It was entirely misguided because secularism, women’s rights, and sexual liberty are clearly valued in French society - every first-generation kid in secondary school is going to be exposed to those ideas and how normative they are in French society. But instead of having faith that this next generation (one that inevitably would have more social and political impact on France than their immigrant parents) would overall choose to engage with and espouse these same values in order to more easily secure their   composite French identity, we instead saw French leaders choose to enact laws that explicitly targeted their parents’ customs. More importantly, this state overreaction can raise doubts in their minds of whether or not they as individuals can ever be accepted as French or if they would be perceived as inevitably “other” due to their background. Absent those doubts, most individuals would choose to be more secular than their parents generation because it’s simply easier to conform to the majority than to be an extremely devout Muslim *and* still be perceived French.

That recognition that the bulk of the work  in integration (which is separate from assimilation) falls on the part of immigrants and (particularly) their descendants is the key. This is why I reiterate that the term assimilation is both short-sighted and misguided, because it focuses on the wrong perspective. If we assert that our societies are based on shared ideals instead of necessarily a shared ethnicity, and if the goal is to mold newcomers to fit the identity presented by the cultural majority, then the majority is setting themselves up for failure by supposing that they have a prescriptive level of control over the results of the process. Such a perspective can erode egalitarianism if the majority group sees its influence wane and instead turns to ethnicity to justify their continued position in society. This is apparent today in America with the rise of white identity politics in an increasingly non-white but also increasingly multi-cultural society united by shared ideals.

To accept immigration is to accept that a successful result changes both the immigrants and the wider society. When the expressed goal is assimilation, societies are setting themselves up to fail to reach people who want to retain parts of their identity or (worse) come to believe that they can never successfully be accepted due to bigotry. For that reason, it’s better to use a framework of [social integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration) that focuses on how best to empower minorities to self-actualize a place in wider society.",telamascope,t2_3m0k3,13,0,reddit2

However, if you have to force the majority to agree with your view that accepting the customs of the immigrants is necassary than I fear your ignoring a problem being created. If french society allowed vlaues that they disagree with to exist on the condition that they would eventually change, than that is very dependant on not allowing those same immigrants to settle where they wont need to mix with the majority population. As I understand it, again correct me if im wrong. The issue in france is that now you have a nation within a nation and the 2 don't mix nor do they agree with one anothers values.
As for the term assimilation, if some people think I'm refrencing a robot then I think you missed the reason I used that word. I used it specifically to mean that people in general arent very accepting of a moral value thay they do not like. To assimilate to me would mean conforming to that societies moral hardlines. I don't feel people have demonstrated the long term capacity to tolerate these moral  hardlines, again pointing to the abortion debate which only seems to get worse with strict religious doctrine, which I find many people accross the western world constantly fighting over.  
We, I find, respected the moral hardline differences between regions within our own countries before the internet it seems but due to globalization i find more and more people becoming aggressive with what they value being the best or only way to be. This is just with our own  current populations differences between regions. Now bring in even more disagreements and look at what each western nation is going through. We are becoming more and more destabilized in the attempt to force conformity.
Then you compare that to a monocultured industrialized nation and I do not see the same societal breakdown.

There are likely some hiring managers that discriminate extremely heavily in favor of women and others that discriminate extremely heavily against them. I didn't expect it to be this strong, though.


Of course, if biased hiring exists, then a male resume contains different information about a candidate than a female resume with an identical job history, which undermines our ability to be confident the hiring was really biased.

Men are typically held back from female dominated fields by perceptions of RISK. (For example, risk of sexual assault or predatory behavior). Perceptions of male competence in female dominated fields may have improved, but perceptions of risk may have not 

I will add that it is possible also that perceptions of competence and perceptions of risk do not equally improve based on overall more positive performance. A single risk case can have more of a negative impact on perception than a single incompetence case

There are also lots of non-monetary benefits, like most notably a ton of vacation (I can speak first hand of this, as the kid from a couple of teachers)

Same applies to nursing, minus the non-monetary benefits

Interestingly, it also seems the issue is mostly concentrated on young education. High school education tends to be around 60/40. Which is not 50/50, but it's not *that* lopsided either. And while HS pays more than primary school, the difference is not that big.

She's right, if you're using crime as a marker. 

Here's the issue that.  That's not where you're supposed to stop thinking. 

That would be correct also about a poor person, a black or Latino person, or a young person. I'm sure you could pull up a litany of additional groups you could accurately make that claim about.  You can, accurately, say that statement about those groups of people and not be *factually* incorrect.  This is actually where a lot of ""scientific racists"" get off not thinking they're racist but in fact pragmatists. 

The issue with that is, if that's where you stop thinking, you are in fact a standard textbook bigot. That's exactly how bigots rationalize things. You've reduced all members of a group into the worst version of that group, dehumanizing them so you can then disenfranchise them, while promoting an ideology that openly rationalizes the loss of their equality. 

That same person would not be so casual about saying that about someone from poverty, or a black person, or a Latino person, because they have internalized through social pressure that there is complexity there and they should not do that. Edit: And they don't make the logical connection that all of these groups exhibit higher crime rates due to some societal lack.  Because *they* have been failed in some way by *all of us*. 

The issue seems to be, from my perspective, that we have been conditioned, through the same social pressures to *not* see the complexity when it comes to men.  Society at large promotes this idea, much like society at large promoted women's various disenfranchisements, sustained by both gender's through stereotype. It's used as both an excuse to embody it without serious judgement, and an excuse to be bigoted towards men.

Edit: It seems to me this is made more difficult though by the fact that the world still needs the ""bad man"" image for both fear, and in practice to maintain societal control. I see much of conservative America's forgiveness of police brutality being wrapped up in the perspective that violent men are important to society, and that promoting the inevitable, intrinsic dangerousness of some ""bad men"" (and not seeing this as a systemic problem) protects the acceptance of ""good men"" to use violence without consequence.",BigDowntownRobot,t2_df42v,368,0,reddit3

We know from prior research that there is a tremendous double standard applied to men and women when they sexually assault a minor. We also know that children that are assaulted by women still face elevated risks of trauma and future disorder.

It's a significant blindspot for too many people on this topic.

Another blindspot is that teaching used to be 90+% men. But because it was considered one of the few jobs that obviously favored women, early women's liberation activists focused on the field as a good entry point for women to enter the workforce. A foot in the door.

They argued that girls needed role models in schools and that men don't understand them so more teachers need to be women. And that worked. But they didn't stop pushing at 50% representation. And they never reversed course and said, ""Hey, wait, boys need role models too, we need more men to teach now,"" as the ratio passed 60% and 70%. Now we're in a boys' education crisis with them struggling at all levels of education and being 44% of university students and declining.

Instead, what the people that fought so hard to create the imbalance did was claim that it wasn't their decades-long push to favor women in the field that caused the imbalance, but *the sexism of men*. They claimed that the real reason for the huge swing in gender balance was men fleeing the field to avoid ""being associated with women"", or something like that. 

But if you ask them if they're willing to engage in activism to get more men into teaching they not only won't do it, but it's likely they'll show up as protesters anywhere anyone tries to address the issue.

As someone that was on the early education track but had to bail for various reasons(some of which were discrimination I was receiving that I highly disagreed with), I think a lot of men just don't grow up thinking about child care or having to care for their siblings/cousins any more.  You combine that fact with the fact there are far more ""sexy"" career routes for men, and you're gonna see a fairly large dip in the people interested in it.

One avenue that attracted me, other than just having a ton of child care in my background, was the philosophy around ""the most impressionable stage of human development is in those crucial pre-K years and being able to positively influence a child will live on for the next 80+ years of their lives."" I think more men would be cool with early education track if we pushed that positive idea of making a huge influence on kid's lives.  Male ego is a big fan of having a lasting ""legacy"" and this one allows you to literally touch the lives of thousands of kids before you hit retirement age. 

I also think another avenue of attack would just be getting 'fun playful' dudes to sign up for it as well.

As far as why we see more men the higher the education level: I speculate it's due to the better perception (grade school vs highschool seen as more prestigious, and even moreso for higher education), and increase of more ""masculine"" disciplines like science and math. Anecdotally, I had 1 male teacher in elementary school, and none at all after that until highschool science. I also think there is an association between elementary school requiring skills like ""good with children "" and ""nurturing"" (feminine coded) vs when they grow, and the focus is more on ""quality "" of education (in parentheses, because I don't believe that being a man has any bearing on quality of teaching, but perhaps that is an existing association)",Necromelody,t2_jived,13,0,reddit3

It's unfair to say that women can't be good at leadership and math or ""logic"", and also assert that men are inherently bad at communicating and empathy (and whatever other traits often passed off as ""masculine"" and ""feminine""). Because often it comes down more to personality and the individual than it does gender.

I think for women it can be more obviously bad because of how these roles reflect in their jobs and paychecks. But a little more sinister and quiet is how this affects men and their mental health and interpersonal relationships.",Necromelody,t2_jived,0,0,reddit3

Men also are underrepresented in fields involving children, and there's evidence that it's having a detrimental effect on young boys.

For example (using US numbers) the total workforce is roughly 157,232,000 at the start of 2024, and 161,183,000 employed persons. Lawyers and doctors combine are only around 2 million of that figure. Less than half of a percentage of the total job market both available and employed.

Even if we add up every single job people typically mention when they think of “men’s jobs are high paying” (doctors, lawyers, engineers, technology development) we’re only talking about the top 3% of the total workforce. 6% of the total male workforce assuming a gender split of 50/50. Our perceptions are very much colored by our lives experience, and that’s why meta analysis like this are so important. Even how we conceive of each other’s rolls in society is government by gender perception which it itself excludes huge swaths of the gender it’s supposed to represent.

I think the more we move away from idealizing both genders by using the top 5% of both as a means of comparison the more will have a more accurate understand of our lives experiences.

Race is not a good indicator for criminality in the first place. Other factors have a much higher correlation with criminality that would serve as a more unbiased predictor for risk assessment. That doesn't mean discrimination of any kind is okay, but it is to say that one can easily make a compelling argument for one kind without supporting another for race.

Poverty level, age, and sex have a higher correlation across all racial demographics with criminality than race itself. If we were being strictly fair to statistics, you'd have to ask if all poor teenagers and young adults should be refused from a job opportunity. But this is besides the point. Discrimination on these bases is common, and that includes race. There are no micromanaging practices that will erase this fact in a capitalist system where the only risks companies take are which fines they're willing to pay. And when the risks for discrimination against protected classes (that being, white women) is higher than the lawsuits associated with criminal activity in the workplace, you're going to get this sort of disparity. A concentration of all wealth is still in the hands of a very small demographic, mostly compromised of men anyway. Most jobs are held by men, as well. And most of the power to do anything about it, all, resides in the hands of men.

As a woman who studied engineering: do you know what I saw in my classes? Me and maybe 3 other women. All of which were often the ""smart"" ones, who asked questions in class, who worked hard to get good grades. They were the most determined.

When looking at the men, you had a much bigger variety of personalities. You had extremely shy men, men who regularly skipped class, but still managed a C average.

This is not to say that the woman were inherently smarter than the men. It's just that to be successful as a woman in STEM, you need to be VERY confident, VERY committed, VERY stubborn. Otherwise, you quit. Men were not put through quite the same selection process.

What do you think these women look like once they graduate? Do you really think they suddenly had no voice, no way of advocating for themselves, aren't still outperforming to keep up?

I haven't said (or thought) that, nor have I seen it anywhere in this thread. Indeed, I'd agree that women in STEM, or at least in CS, on average, are more driven than the men. I think it is a tougher path.

I don't see that that necessarily translates for wages (where job hopping, and negotiating at hire likely plays a bigger role). Still, my understanding is that women before childbirth tend to out-earn men in many places and roles these days. I think the gap in tech, for same education and years of experience is essentially noise.

Dishonest people, of course, don't correct for things like hours worked, sometimes even lumping together part-time and full-time, or considering all people over 70% to be full-time, even though there are significant gender skews.

For anecdotes, the three women I knew best in my master's program: one moved into HR where she's now an SVP. The other worked for a number of year's, took time off for the two kids, and decided not to go back. The third is still active, but at a smaller company. I know at my company there are more women in management (as a percent) than the graduating classes, likely the result of execs saying that's what they want (they didn't phrase it that way, they just have an explicit diversity goal to hit a higher percent than the national average, and that of the better schools we tend to higher from). In short, if anything, women are being favored for roles at my company.

(I'm just digging up the studies that show women favored in STEM hiring 2:1 and in entry into the AAAS 10:1 or something)

Studies found:

[National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418878112)

We abandoned male youth education in the 70s as punishment for failing women in the past and look where it’s gotten us. Any discussion about it is shut down as people view it as taking away opportunity from women but fail to see the bigger picture (like it’s scary that women are about to outnumber male students at a 2:1 ration in higher education in a few years).

CSA from women to boys is absolutely a problem that is disgustingly downplayed and not taken as serious by society as it should, and does go underreported and happens way more often than people think as your link shows. 

Nevertheless, even accounting for unreported crimes, even your link says nothing to the contrary about men being CSA perpetrators more frequently than women. 

Indeed the two stats your link gave paints a picture,

> We also pooled four years of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and found that 35 percent of male victims who experienced rape or sexual assault reported at least one female perpetrator…

> 96 percent of women who report rape or sexual assault in the NCVS were abused by men. 

Still, female perpetrators happen more than thought, as your link says, still not as common as male perpetrators. Whether it’s a biology thing or a cultural thing causing that, i don’t know, but it doesn’t matter when it comes time for parents to hire a baby sitter to watch their daughter. 

Particularly, the stat from your link shows that only 4% of women rape or SA victims had female perpetrators bs 96% male. So you can see how eliminating males when choosing a baby sitter to watch your daughter can decrease the odds your child is abused.

In most of my companies, I was the only women besides HR, or there were other women but not at the management and higher. This is civil engineering which is very old school still. I think our experiences were at the two extremes.

As far as hours worked: yes, men do tend to work more at their job than women. But how much of that correlates to the expectation of being responsible for childcare? Not to mention domestic housework. So I am not necessarily disagreeing here, but it's often not really a choice.

The tl;dr version is that men overall work an average of 3 hours more per week than women, and childless men are around 20% more engaged in the workforce than childless women. Both factors combined lead to more generous raises. To add, once kids are added to the mix, women with children tend to on average work 2 hours less per week than childless women, whereas men with children tend to work slightly more hours.

kpepqej,t1_kped07o,2024-02-07 23:41:20,science,"I don’t believe this paper says that there isn’t a wage gap. The exact opposite actually. It does say that the gap is smaller in a narrow band of measurement.

“Younger women – those ages 25 to 34 and early in their work lives – have edged closer to wage parity with men in recent years. Starting in 2007, their earnings have consistently stood at about 90 cents to the dollar or more compared with men of the same age. But even as pay parity might appear in reach for women at the start of their careers, the wage gap tends to increase as they age.”

“A good share of the increase in the gender pay gap takes place when women are between the ages of 35 and 44. In 2022, women ages 25 to 34 earned about 92% as much as men of the same ages, but women ages 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 earned 83% as much. The ratio dropped to 79% among those ages 55 to 64. This general pattern has not changed in at least four decades.”

Clearly child-rearing is a large factor, but even controlled for in this paper, a significant gap appears with age. This is POST child-rearing age, when women rejoin the workforce.

“**Employed mothers earn about the same as similarly educated women without children at home; both groups earn less than fathers”**

“Among employed women ages 25 to 34 with at least a bachelor’s degree, both mothers and women without children at home earned 80% as much as fathers in 2022.”

Clearly then motherhood and fatherhood are affecting the genders differently, and women ARE getting paid less even in situations where they should have been the ‘ideal’ pick i.e., they don’t have the burden of children but the male candidate does. Even then we see a wage gap.

**“Higher education, a shift to higher-paying occupations and more labor market experience have helped women narrow the gender pay gap since 1982. But even as women have continued to outpace men in educational attainment, the pay gap has been stuck in a holding pattern since 2002, ranging from 80 to 85 cents to the dollar.”**

It’s unfair to the vast majority of males that would never touch a child and aspire to be a child caretaker, yes, but that is such a small issue compared CSA. Especially true when you’re talking about one’s own daughter.

Amthe majority of the offences are assault, robbery or drug related. This study tells us nothing about the rate of gender or CSA for males who later go on to be sex offenders, child or otherwise.

For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),

So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of ""made to penetrators"" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women. 42% close enough for you?

And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.

Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known

data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.

And non CDC study...

A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.

Another non CDC study...

a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.

And another non CDC study...

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”

when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).",RyukHunter,t2_3wj7v80t,28,0,reddit3

If someone says they'll take in animals on a shelter, but they refuse foxes because foxes are more likely to kill their rabbits, and you say rabbits are likely to give birth and create cramped conditions, those are entirely different issues that need entirely different solutions.

For starters, even if we assume purely cold and calculated justifications for both forms of discrimination, the cost of pregnancy is much lower than the potential cost of sexual assault. The former, you may have to pay for leave, or you can hire someone else to fill the role. It is typically not that big of a cost to the company, at least in comparison to the lawsuits you'd have to pay if you actively refused to hire women. You're also more likely to hire new employees if you provide better medical coverage in general, regardless of who is more likely to use it once every few years. However, the consequences of hiring a sexual predator are much greater. It's why, you know, companies don't spend money covering up pregnant employees. Even if we ignore the lawsuits that are possible from having SA occurring in the workplace, you have a lot more to lose for keeping a sexual predator on board than you do a pregnant person.

Instead of trying to force this comparison to work, why don't you just switch to a different, more common form of bigotry? Felons, rehabilitated or not, are refused many positions in the workplace. Felons are less likely to commit a crime if given opportunities after serving time. Refusing them the position increases the likelihood of recidivism. Not only that, but the assumption of criminal history is one of the reasons minorities with names and addresses associated with their ethnicity face greater hiring discrimination. This would've been a much more compelling argument than... women getting pregnant. Because it's actually the exact same topic. A double standard implies one has greater consideration for one side on a given topic. But if the consideration is one may need a month of sick leave and one may _rape_ someone, that's not a double standard.

f2zfdgj,t3_depwlm,2019-10-08 07:12:49,science,"I wonder if it matters how much the hobby resembles the work or job on a more individual level? Because I had a similar issue when I initially tried going into multimedia as a career. For me the problem was that doing my hobby as a job basically clashed with all the things that I liked about my hobby and that I was confident about, but if how I perceived my hobby had lined up more with how it functions as a job I might not have hated it as much. If that makes sense. Like, I don't feel as confident making stuff that's dictated by someone else and I don't do well when having to create stuff on a schedule with deadlines. So it made something I usually enjoyed and did well at exhausting, and made me constantly compare what I thought would work or what I wanted with what was demanded of me, but if I was the type of person who enjoyed a challenge in that area and did well on a deadline I might have done better. 

If someone did rock climbing as an activity where they focused a lot on safety and just having fun then they might not do well in a job in, say, rescue where it's dangerous and tense and they're out of their element despite performing familiar actions. But maybe they could do fine in a safe lab environment where they can focus on getting results because it's something they're more comfortable with? Alternatively, what if what they like about rock climbing is the thrill, and they're good at going up against a problem and conquering it? Then could they actually do well in a rescue type job that compliments that?",Ppleater,t2_7qn8v,4,0,reddit4

f30qrr6,t3_depwlm,2019-10-08 18:45:55,science,"IIRC the classic maxim for life-work balance is to find three things to which you can apply yourself; one that makes you money, one that gets you exercise, and one as a creative outlet. 

Seems like a lot of people have been tossing out the same half-joke of “what if the scientist is a geologist.”  That doesn’t matter if you’re able to pursue the aspects of the other hobbies that fulfill their respective purpose.  The fact that a geologist is climbing rocks isn’t particular meaningful if the geologist is fully applying him/herself to the rock climbing pursuit.

Many people find burnout with excessive overlap between hobbies and career because they get caught up in the business aspects of their hobby in the course of their work. Then you don’t enjoy the free time hobby of the same kind of pursuit. That’s the whole point of this article and anyone who is laughing it off and distancing themselves from it with pithy irony are doing themselves the greatest disservice.

For anyone who comes across this and is struggling with that balance, for any number of reasons, I can empathize. There are all kinds of reasons that life makes finding this balance difficult. But the best things in life can be found in the active pursuit of them.  Try what interests you as a possible hobby, don’t expect to be great at it when you’re new, and find something that speaks to you in some way.  Rounding out your life to support a hobby and balancing it against responsibilities is what life is all about.

Just like Bill Gates is an exception; I just watched [Inside Bill's Brain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10837476/), and it's incredible to get a glimpse at someone who is so single-mindedly focused on whatever they're doing. Most of us could only dream of being so good at 'that one thing'.

Basically, I'm less willing to use my extra energy or time on work when I have the opportunity to use it on something I find more fulfilling (and I doubt I'll find a career where this will change in relation to climbing).

Perhaps I get anxious less at work when presented with a difficult situation, since I've developed good coping mechanisms for high stress situations over the years (focus on what you're doing and you will more likely be okay).

That being said  I'd happily take a mountain rescue job (the skills transfer over) if it paid well, but it would likely spoil climbing a little in that dragging bodies out of canyons and crevasses is very grim.",,,1,0,reddit4

Example: I saw a young man recently who'd hurt his knee. I examined him, and could tell he had torn his ACL. I ordered an MRI to confirm this, and referred him to a Orthopedist for repair. The next day, I got a message that the MRI had been rejected by his insurance company. To override it, I would have to call a number. I did, and spent 10 minutes working my way through a phone tree until I finally reached a human. After a long time, she was able to tell me the reason: MRIs of the knee are only approved after an X-ray is done first. As any 1st year med student could tell you, X-rays are next to useless when it comes to evaluating an injury to a ligament, and I explained that to her. She said that she might be able to bypass it, but I'd have to talk to their supervising doctor. I sat on hold for 10 more minutes, and eventually reached that doc, who immediately cleared the MRI. The whole thing took 30+ minutes.

I get why these hurdles exist: healthcare costs a ton in the US, and discouraging unneeded tests IS a big part of reeling that in. But the practical effect is that it makes necessary steps exhausting. ",awdixon,t2_390jn,551,0,reddit1

e4dwucy,t3_986alk,2018-08-18 00:50:14,science,"I can speak to this a bit. Heres the closest ELI5 I can come up with to explain some of the matters at play here:

The US healthcare system has, for a very long time, been based on ""fee for service"" - you get an Xray, you pay for the Xray (oversimplifying but you get it). Well thats great and all but as you might imagine it:

1. Doesn't incentivize good OUTCOMES, one in which the patient gets better and not hot-potatoed around to other specialists for more ""services"".
2. Can easily be manipulated to bill for unneccesary procedures etc

During this fee for service period Doctors would get reimbursed for these services and depending on your insurance type, they might get very ""little"" versus what Medicaid and other insurance companies are keeping. Over the past couple years there has been a shift to ""Value Based Care"" and as the name implies, doctors would get incentivized to produce results ie. patients dont keep coming back and they get better.

Great, all is fine and dandy right? Not quite. Documentation of the entire patient encounter has always occurred (thats why you have charts) and that dictated the reimbursement levels a doctor would receive. Now this need to document is accentuated as we shift to the new Value Based initiative. This coupled with the fact that documentation has become electronic, aka on computers (programs are called EMR/EHRs), has put a serious amount of stress on providers to not only provide Care but document appropriately, resulting in doctors either:

1. Documenting in the room while seeing you - resulting in lower pt satisfaction, which is another factor that I wont dive too deep into.
2. Wait to document until after patient visits or at the end of the day, potentially missing information (as well reimbursement bc doctors tend to underchart to avoid legal action) There is a shocking amount of providers staying hours on end just to  finish and wrap up after a 10 hour day, some even charting on the weekends. You have to remember these are CLINICAL professionals not CLERICAL and even the best typists are having trouble keeping up as reimbursements continuously decline

OR

Dont document much the day of the encounter and letting it pile up, losing reimbursement as well important details about the encounter, so its a lose lose for both the patient and provider (as well the practice waiting to get paid)

This is just 1 major aspect affecting their work-life balance but its played a vital role over the last few years as we continuously change healthcare policy (what needs to be charted, for those in the field I know how much you love MACRA/MIPS and MU.)

e4dy7tv,t3_986alk,2018-08-18 01:14:47,science,"Physician here. I found a link to the primary manuscript and found the ‘commentary’ to be well written but without any newly generated data. The nuances of burnout are well defined and supported by studies from different periods. What I hoped for, primary research over a decade with supporting data on physician burnout certainly was not a component of this article. Instead the data seemed to support the authors’ opinions. 

What do I think?  Well, yes the electronic health record (EHR) detracts from the doctor/patient relationship but we needed something that improved documentation and, hopefully, improved value based care. So I suffer through the EHR and keep my fingers crossed that it will make the advances promised years ago. So far, the cost of care has only increased with the EHR adding to these costs.  

Insurance companies are extraordinarily challenging to negotiate and when you consider some with ‘not for profit’ status and executives who earn millions, the hope is that new models will replace at least some of the insurers. The current availability of Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance could be revamped to support better options for each although many hospitals and doctors require some percentage of the higher paying insured patients to survive. This challenge is not new, in medical school I had a family medicine physician tell me that he had not made an income from his practice in years but he enjoyed the work and wanted to keep his staff employed. He also retired that year. 

In my practice and at my hospital I do not see the high burnout that was described in the article. Medicine is hard work, so are law, accounting, retail, and most jobs. At times my frustration will increase, my current pet peeve is an administrator who was hired with no medical experience who is now making decisions that make my work life harder. But she will learn or get fired. And most days I can do the job I was trained to do. 

I do feel lucky to be able to contribute to society by caring for patients with little concern for their insurance as my specialty (surgery) and my state (prefer not to say) allow both. I sometimes wonder if I should change to ‘cash pay’ so I can work less and make more but that model does not work for my beliefs. 

In any case, there needs to be a counter point to the posts here. Medicine is still a terrific career that is both fulfilling and pays well. Compare that to teachers who have a fulfilling career but are vastly underpaid. For now I am going to pour myself and my wife a glass of wine as I am working all weekend.

e4e7dda,t3_986alk,2018-08-18 04:09:35,science,"There is a point at which doctors should stop putting up with insurance. In fact, this is already happening. Some are starting practices that so not take insurance, some find ways to work without having to deal with certain parts of insurance like working for the government, and some simply leave medicine. Systems only exist because enough people tolerate them. Embedded into physician culture is this idea of self-sacrifice. In a sick way, many physicians actually sort of enjoy the difficulty or even the challenge of working with insurance. There is some component of arrogant masochism to this. However, I think that this is slowly bleeding away as a new generation of doctors take over.

The second issue is production. In private practice you keep what you kill, and as an employee your pay is very often largely based on what you produce. You might be surprised that most physicians are not paid for their time, and much of the work they do is technically unpaid under many of these production models. Why don't physicians just work less and make a little less money?  For one it is against the self-sacrificing, hardworking, superman doctor culture. For another, doctors are very commonly in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and pay thousands of dollars a month in loans. So, physicians work quickly and a lot. Physician pay is so high less because the pay is so amazing for the training level, and more because they work so good damn much. It's not uncommon for many doctors to spend a great deal of time after hours dealing with call/emergencies and documentation.

These are just the broad trends. There are plenty of doctors who find ways out of working with insurance and/or work very reasonable hours. It's up to physicians to simply refuse to work in situations they don't want to. Many doctors don't realize that they are propping up a broken system by their voluntary conformity.",WADemosthenes,t2_8gl6x,3,0,reddit1
e4e99gj,t3_986alk,2018-08-18 04:53:37,science,"This study is spot on.  Insurance companies have specific criteria that must be met before certain things will be approved.  For instance, if I want to order a Lumbar Spine MRI for back pain, the patient must have failed 6 weeks of conservative treatment directed by a medical provider, or have severe muscle weakness, cancer, or other emergent symptoms.  If I can’t document this specifically in my note, then I have to spend 15 minutes setting up a peer to peer discussion, after which I have to either wait another 30 min-ish to speak to a physician, or be available when they want to call me back, which I can’t do during clinic, so I either have to stay late after clinic, or skip a lunch break.  The final decision is somewhat based on guidelines above and somewhat based on what mood the peer to peer physician is in at the moment.  Ultimately both the providers and the patients suffer- the provider with time spent trying to argue the case, the patient with having to jump through insurance company’s hoops to get their health care covered.

1.

Patients are incentivized to wait on non-urgent procedures to do everything in one period, which has no net benefit.

2. Allow patients to know prices *before* treatment when possible, at least estimates for ideal conditions, and how much the most likely complications might add.  I know someone who is on one of those healthcare sharing pools, so he called around for quotes on some kind of standard scan, and *most* hospitals wouldn't even give an estimate.  If people could shop around, and think about cost, that could drive down costs.

3. Enforce contracts with insurance companies and require prompt payment.

Only then would we see some improvement with the system we have, the stakeholder/customer needs to be the consumer/doctor, not large employers or easy large clients where individuals and doctors are not as important in their incentives.  

Currently insurance is doing a good job keeping employer insurance low, but because they limit groups and treat consumers/individuals/doctors/suppliers like crap to achieve that. Individuals, small businesses, medium businesses, entrepreneurs, families on the private market are more risky so those people pay more due to the way insurance companies group by company/person.  Groups should be across the entire nation or at least slices of it that are equally balanced. Employer based insurance goals include removing sick people from the groups, lose your job and your employer insurance is gone.  Private market and a public option, the original goal of ACA, would be more competitive on pricing and true access.

Stop getting insurance through your company, it complicates changing jobs, starting businesses, out of luck if you actually get sick, fuels ageism and makes healthcare a corporate service not people/doctor/individual/family focused product.

Take employers out of the picture and focused more on individuals/doctors and the fixed market healthcare market would start to correct, as well as a public option to compete with like Medicare for all. 

We don't get auto, home, other insurance through work, why healthcare which is the most private of all, why let employers select and decide important decisions for you and take the benefits to their needs not yours or doctors?",drawkbox,t2_psll,2,0,reddit1

Lack of enthusiasm for the work (as the top comment suggests) is in large part related to the poor performance of current EHR technology!

In fact, about 10 seconds of reading Health IT related news will make it clear that the electronic health record is near-universally hated!

The good news? There are organizations out there with clinicians who are highly satisfied with their EHR. And not just on Epic or Cerner.

With the rare exception of a few VERY outdated systems, doctors can have a successful EHR experience regardless of the vendor. 

Three areas of focus highly correlated with clinician satisfaction:

Training (a botched initial training on an EHR will taint users experience even 5+ years post go-live)

Personalizations (It's a PITA, but setting your EHR instance up for YOU is a make-or-break for success).

Governance (For clinical/IT leadership: are you LISTENING to end-user feedback? When they ask for changes is it a ""No."" Or a ""How about instead we try..."" Org culture has a huge impact on doctors feeling successful with their EHR.)

The EHR can be a beautiful thing for the ease of our job- we take what practitioners do, and turn it into a viable, reimbursable claim. However, due to the current state of insurance in the United States, medical practitioners have become nothing more than a vendor of service. In order to maintain a successful practice that actually keeps the lights on, you have to see 80+ patients a day. 

Let’s break that down. 

99213- a mid-level established office visit, generally 10 minutes (face to face) in duration. Multiply that by 80. That’s 13.33 hours. A day. 5 days a week. Some physicians shoot for 100 patients a day. 16.67 hours. 

Most doctors offices are only open 9-10 hours a day. They are cramming 100 patients into 9 hours, just to reach billable hours to keep the lights on, and pay their staff. 

If you’ve ever waited in a doctors office for more than 30 minutes past your appointment time- this is why. They’re not trying to be jerks, lording their profession over you. They are trying to give each of their patients 10 minutes of face to face time in a 3 minute window.

While I sympathize with the MD's feelings of loss of autonomy, I can tell you that the ""care"" most US Physicians consists of is hands off. 

They aren't managing their patient's diseases and symptoms, instead herding them in and out like cattle. They aren't educating the patients on how to take care of themselves, their disease(s), and they aren't following up with them to make sure that whatever they complained about at the appointment actually resolved in a few days/week.

Many times treatment is based on whichever drug rep stopped by that month or gave them the nicest incentive to prescribe their flavor of the month drug. Most of the time the patient cannot afford these new medications, even with insurance, and I see it time and time again where the older medications work just as well. 

Many times patients leave the offices with nothing to show for it but a prescription, no game plan for symptom/disease management,  and no follow up. Many of these patients end up in the ER and subsequently admitted for a hospital stay. For things that could have been managed outpatient if the MDs had been more proactive and involved. 

Our healthcare costs are overwhelming in this country, and yes there are many factors involved. But it starts with the Physicians and their management, or mismanagement, of their patients. If there were no governing body, many of these patients would never get yearly labwork done. Preventative medicine saves costs and saves lives.  

So while I know that there are many Physicians that are involved, stay abreast of the latest treatments, findings, and scientific research, I can tell you as a nurse that has been in healthcare for over 25 years,  there are many many more that are on cruise control.

While anecdotal, it gives an important perspective on the differences between how medical care is delivered under the current U.S. system vs. the single-payer system in Canada.

From the article:

>**Dr. Page:** How does it relate to primary care being a family physician or being a patient receiving primary care. How would you summarize the major differences between the two systems?
>
>**Dr. Hendry:** Well, as far as the medical care goes, it’s really hardly different at all. In other words, I might see someone in my office – they’re going to have same colds, they’re going to have the same problems, and I’m going to be bringing my same expertise there, be ordering the same tests for investigation, and I’ll be making my referrals. So in terms of day-to-day seeing patients, it’s not that different. What’s really different is the context in which it’s happening. It might be helpful just to give a little example. I’m right now in my office and saw patients all morning. So what happens is that they come in the door, they say hi, they have their card, their number, whatever. No one has to check for whether or not it’s still valid, or whether they changed from one plan to another, or if they have co-pays that they need, or anything. They just come in for the visit. They go down the hall and I see them. I do whatever is necessary. I don’t have to fill out any extra forms. I go to my EMR, my electronic medical records, I put down what I did, and it gets sent off by the one, part-time bookkeeper, who serves the six-physician practice, and I get money.",M_Smoljo,t2_kd5q2,1,0,reddit1

CVS-Aetna, Bershire/Amazon/JPMorgan, heck even Walmart are paving the way towards getting rid of the emphasis on billing codes and more towards outcomes-based medicine at a reduced cost.  A reduced emphasis on Fee for Service will improve outcomes, because it means that healthcare is more focused on quality than quantity.

Final point, I think the silver lining of the EHR emphasis vis-à-vis ACA is that these systems are now more interoperable than they would have been, which means that we're that much closer to being able to freely share data between disparate systems and EMRs.

The issue lies more in the ownership of the hospital, not the insurance companies.

When doctors own the majority share of a hospital or hospital network, they can hold more control over contracts and negotiations.

And it is ALL about the contracts ..

However, when a corporation (maybe one with ties to insurance companies even..) owns the majority then who do you think decisions will favor?

Patients? Nope.

Physicians? Nope.

Nurses? EVS? Nutrition? No. No. And no.

It will benefit the admin and the corporate entity.

Physicians need to quit dumping money into frivolous investments ... dont invest in a sushi bar or a Ferrari, or oil fields or large stocks - invest in the hospital, or in ""a"" hospital at the least.

Ok, so because of big corporate bullying, every 15 minutes a doctor spends with a patient they have to put out at least 30 minutes filling out nearly meaningless paper work just to meet insurance requirements. Additionally , a large chunk of that 15 mins that you get to spend with a doctor is spent going over more insurance required guidelines and protocals just to make sure that the doctor can bill for an actual visit. 

Now consider that one probably has to see 20 patients a day just to make a reasonable salary, it's easy to see how the average work week for a primary care physician has creeped past 70 hours.

I actually really prefer the EHRs to paper charts. When a patient’s different providers are in the same system and use the same EHR I have access to all their records. In the best cases I can search through all their previous visits or hospital stays, review imaging and pathology, social consults, pastoral care, etc. I can look up that weird sounding medication that made them feel better but they don’t remember. Often I find a note stashed away with contact information or next of kin and this in certain cases this has been invaluable. With paper charts you have to request all that information by having someone call or electronic submit a request for records to be faxed, and more often than not that takes more time than expected. And even if you had all those records in one place the sheer mass of paperwork makes the chart unwieldy and hard to search through. 

IMO, it’s not the EHR itself that people don’t like. It’s the time constraints placed on physicians that forces them to chart extensively while seeing patients. ",elwood2cool,t2_86lgv,9,0,reddit1

On the individual health system level, there is a trend toward making physicians replaceable. I think the lumping of physicians, PAs, and NPs together as ""providers"" is part of this trend.

Before going to the ER, I literally sat waiting bleeding all over the place so that my wife could call insurance to make sure the ER was in network.

We got a $800 bill a month later. Why? Because the ER was in network, but the emergency doctor IN the ER was NOT in network. We literally called first to ensure coverage, and it didn't matter. How can the doctor in the ER not be in network when the ER itself is??? And how does 10 minutes with a doctor cost $800 bucks?

We literally potentially saved or just extended lives with this continual effort. 

Just one more example that popped into my head - I have ran reports of patients who have a certain diagnosis and we make sure they have had a test and if they haven't we create a list to either remind them or request the report if it was somehow missed - redundancy is so important in healthcare. This has literally caught malignant growth patients in our system.  I don't know how physicians can defend paper charts from that standpoint.

e4dweog,t1_e4dtck7,2018-08-18 00:42:44,science,"I don't directly have the answer to your musings, but I can say that Medicare/Medicaid is a **major** stress on doctors. They have **tons** of regulations that must be followed, and since you're doing that stuff for a major chunk of your patients it becomes standardized across them all. All reimbursements have been falling for a long time now, meaning doctors have to see more and more patients to compensate, leading of course to mistakes, stress, and burnout. To exemplify just how much overhead dealing with insurance adds, look at the rise of [direct primary care](https://www.dpcare.org/).

I want to be clear, though: the trouble with our system is not *just* Medicare, but the entire way the insurance companies operate. Insurance got closely coupled with employment back after ww2 when the worst president we've ever had, FDR, signed an executive order that limited wages. The result was of course companies finding ways to compete around this, so they started offering health insurance plans. This worked fine when health care was low cost and employees largely stayed with one company, but that obviously didn't last long and we quickly spiraled to the mess we have now. https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/part-1-the-history-of-u.s.-employer-provided-health-insurance-post-world-war-ii

The worst result of this sudden boom of insurance was that the people spending the money on health services now had no idea nor care about how much the services cost. If someone doesn't know and care how much the service is they're paying for, then of course costs will inflate and people will over buy.

This is exactly why ""Medicare for all!"" does *not* fix the system. Divorcing people even further from the costs while giving everyone ""free"" coverage will inevitably lead to only more price inflation, more over use and thus increasing wait times. ",socialmeritwarrior,t2_r9cn7tj,14,0,reddit1

Seems like a no-brainer, but in the US you can never trust an insurance company to pay what it claims it will pay. Those plans are both offered by the same company. They don't get very good reviews online, people say it's hard getting them to pay, so maybe that's why they can charge so little. And as far as I know there's no official rating agency, and there don't seem to be an business regulations, just policy rules.

Dental Insurances give patients and average max coverage of $1.5-2K a year. That MIGHT cover one root canal and one crown and the patient will pay 20% of that bill still.

~1975 the max coverage for patients was typically $1.5k. That would go farther then to cover more procedures a year. Multiple crowns and fillings. It's not all the dental insurance companies' fault, employers are the ones purchasing these plans for their employees.

In addition, dental school tuition leaves most students with around ~$200k of debt after loans with cost of living. Spaced out for the life of the loan, grads look at ~$400-500k debt. Then grads have to buy a practice at ~$600-800k depending on your location in America. Typically, purchasing a practice occurs within 6-10 years of graduating.

So insurance companies are paying less to the patient and the dentist; while costs for materials, education, and offsite labwork all go up.

My tuition was $240,000 at graduation and was half a million on the life of the loan before refinancing.

These numbers on tuition are actually low for California but I imagine generally accurate, maybe even on the low side all together.

I’ve had patients storm out of the office, literally screaming what a scam it is. But the dentist isn’t the scam artist, it’s the insurance.

I have friends that got so fed up with this that they started allowing patients with periodontal disease sign a waiver saying that they will receive a prophylaxis but accept the risks involved with leaving subgingival plaque and calculus.

It's pretty common, but it is insurance fraud and if they ever get audited they're most likely screwed. Many practices don't take the co-pay in an attempt to increase patient retention (since no one likes paying out of pocket), however that means they would not get the full amount of their actual fee schedule. So in order to compensate, most practices that do not take co-pay will charge the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to pay, and they usually see more patients (higher volume) in order to make the same amount. This kind of practice usually hurts those practices that take the co-pay or provide high quality service with fewer patients in the schedule. Many patients will not go to those practices because they need to pay out of pocket for the difference otherwise the practice that focuses on patient/clinic quality care will not make enough since they see fewer patients, so they need to make it up by charging more (it's also more ethical to charge the co-pay and less stress if they ever get audited).

It is silly to blame the EHR. The EHR is just a tool. The EHR does not create the requirements for obtaining reimbursement, and those requirements are what makes the system so absurd.

My take on it is that EHRs are selected and purchased by executive groups, and those executive groups want more and more data for controlling and reporting and they care primarily about AR days and such.

it takes too much time to go walk back to an office log on, open the chart click through the noise. it takes like 3 min minimum compared to 5 seconds. which is time you dont have.

so instead you have a chief complaint. you go in and ask what they are there for as you stare at the computer and wait for the chart to open while trying to listen at the same time.  and if you left a note about something personal it would be hard to work that in 3 min into the encounter when you are already talking about bp control or something.

""Apply the formula."" Decisions carry risk. Risk is inherent in decisions made, because there's a chance for a wrong decision to be made, and that invites liability and insurance companies are 100% about mitigating that.

Even if the policy got it wrong, 'it was for the greater good,' or 'it was good in 90% of cases.' It's cold, it's impersonal, and it has the weight of a hundred doctors who were wrong, not just one doctor who simply happened to be wrong this one time. Even if the former has a higher error rate, it's harder to sue it.

I am an anesthesiologist.  I work at a level one trauma center.  We have designated operating rooms set up with all of our equipment, medications, machine checked out, fluid warmers on and ready.  This is so that if a bad trauma comes in, we can be as fast as possible getting the patient ready for surgery.  

There are ""risk-management"" people (not MDs or RNs) at the institution I work at that keep trying to dictate how we practice anesthesiology.  They say that we cannot have IV fluid bags spiked on IV poles.  That we cannot have medications drawn up before hand.  Of course, we label and date our syringes, and lock up our medications.  IV bags are dated as well.  We're not sloppy, we're being *reasonable* anesthesiologists.  

But that's not enough to satisfy these people.  They want us to start our set up the moment the patient comes in the room.  Supposedly this is based on their interpretation of rules from several federal accrediting bodies.  Again, not rules designed by physicians, but by administrators.

We've all tried to explain to them that this is not how it works.  There are people that come in so unstable that the surgeons will start operating almost as soon as the patient is on the table (already unconscious from trauma).  We cannot spend the time at that point to draw up medications and spike IV bags.  Nope, that's too late, patient could die or be seriously injured.

What's infuriating about this, isn't how ignorant these adminidroids are about what we do.  It's that we have people who don't understand anesthesiology, telling anesthesiologists how to do their jobs.  If shit hit the fan, and it's inevitable that it would if we ultimately end up following their policies, I'm certain that these administrators will scatter like cockroaches into the dark, no where to be seen.  The only people left to bear responsibility will be anesthesiologists and surgeons.",albinus1927,t2_85j4t,7,0,reddit1

Warning, tangent ahead!

For the military thing, many people argue that the money is just circulated within our domestic economy so the amount spent doesn't matter, and many people argue that it's good to have so many military research/manufacturing jobs. Both are false arguments. In particular, for the military research, that's all research that *is not applicable to any non-militwry products, and often can't even be used for military hardware we sell overseas*. That means every dollar spent on such research is, at best, zero-sum for the economy. But consider what happens when that money and those minds are dedicated to research that isn't classified - it can be used to make products and technologies which can be valuable for consumers and sold worldwide, benefitting the economy. Politicians sometimes claim we need our best and brightest minds working in defense research - they are wrong, because every mind in that field is an American mind (always American due to security clearance requirements) that is diverted from a profitable activity. If all scientists and engineers in the US worked in defense, we'd be at a massive economic disadvantage very soon.

The problems that other docs are warning you about are very real and very serious, but I think if medical students are informed about them and take action, there is still hope for reform.

My advice to anyone thinking of medical school today is this:

1. Pay attention to how much debt you accumulate during training, and do everything you can to minimize it. When you do become an attending, keep living like a resident so you can pay off the debt as soon as possible. Once you are free of the student loans, you have the freedom to walk away from a toxic job if you need to. The days of doctors living large are over - plan on having a comfortable but modest life.
2. Pay attention to the burnout rates in the specialties you are thinking about, and if possible try to look into employment options that give you more control over how you work such as still being able to open your own private practice (many psychiatrists still are self employed in a private practice, but other specialties have so much red tape and administrative burden that it is no longer realistic to hang up your own shingle). The happiest primary care doctors I know of are the ones who have what's called a ""direct primary care"" practice - if you are thinking of doing internal medicine or family medicine, I strongly recommend looking into how feasible it would be for you to do direct primary care.
3. Pay attention to the issue of midlevels (NPs, PAs) trying to gain independent practice rights, and if they are trying to put forward legislation in your state to gain independent practice, talk to your state medical society about what you can do to help fight it.

The world definitely still needs intelligent, ambitious people going to medical school. Don't let the dark talk scare you away from a very rewarding and noble profession - but be aware of the problems and think about what you can do about them.",enragedchipmunk,t2_c7xf0,4,0,reddit1

Two years ago I started throwing up a lot. I stopped being able to eat food and then I couldn't even hold down water.

They did the same thing, saline drip and nausea medicine with the first test being done on a stool sample. By the time I went in to the ER the second time, I had gone three weeks without being able to eat food. I ended up staying in the hospital for two weeks and each doctor that saw me gave me a different diagnoses.

In a different situation, I needed surgery done on my back. It took months for me to get to the point where I could even talk to a surgeon. I had to go through my primary multiple times as she kept trying very basic things like pain killers and telling me to take it easy. Then I had to see a specialist who confirmed I needed something more done, but didn't actually help much. It took 4 months to have the consultation with the surgeon who confirmed surgery would help but he wanted me to try an epidural shot first. I was fine with taking the less invasive procedure a try. I tried it twice, actually. Finally, almost two years from the start of the problem I got the surgery done

I looked it up later, out of curiosity, and found that most people with the same issue are able to get the surgery done within a few months of uncovering the problem.

Drug laws are archaic and irrational because you can't babysit adults. There will always be those who abuse their medications. Your policies hurt more than they help.

D: ""Here's an estimate, what is your insurance?""

M: ""I'm paying cash""

D: ""Here's the actual amount (minus admin fees)""

Ohhhhh yeah.

$160 filling can cost $300-$600 on insurance, whereas I could pay cash and walk out with no extra mess. I'd be paying $80-120 for the deductible/copay/whateverthatis in a few weeks anyways, so I might as well just avoid that hassle, save the postage, maybe save a tree branch.

That's what really gets me, every time I see the bill, I can easily pay it, but when the insurance reports the bill, it's usually 2-3X that amount, plus it saves the dentist from paying someone to do all the extra paperwork, calls, and haggling with the insurance company.

e4e26kq,t1_e4dwnoc,2018-08-18 02:26:11,science,"I had a root canal done on, whatever the tooth behind the canine is. 

Didn't work. Repeat root canal done. Still no bueno. Was scheduled for an implant, but insurance wouldn't cover the cost. 

Got a third opinion, the surgeon actually did a CT and noticed the space between the teeth was too small for a post without hitting the other teeth. I asked to see the scan myself and yup, nothing that looked promising. Surgeon told my that if I had let the other guy do the first surgery, I might of ended up losing 3 teeth instead of one. He also wouldn't have found out until he was in there, so who knows what bone and nerve damage may have occured. So new surgeon would have to do some crazy shit, while doing a CT guided implant surgery. The cost was in the multiplr thousands, and my insurance said fuck that you're on your own. 

By now the tooth didn't even have enough substrate left for a traditional filling or crown, so my dentist literally ""built"" an entire tooth out of whatever composite they use for fillings. No idea how he did it, but he did warn me it would only last a year or so. That was about 4 years ago. I still can't get my insurance to help in any useful way, and can't afford the cost of the insane surgery that would need to be done. 

Upside though...if the tooth finally gives in and gets infected, endocarditis kills pretty quickly. And when you're septic you're usually confused anyway so I would probably be blissfully unaware of my doom. 

Gotta love the insurance industry. ",ln2b8,t2_m7lr3qu,21,0,reddit1

I didn't freak out on the dentist, though, I'm relieved to report. He was sympathetic to my frustration at the gridlock of circumstances in a very resigned way. He referred me to the local dental school where it might be offered it at reduced cost, but the one near me has really strict rules about setting up appointments. 

You can ONLY leave a message on their special voicemail. It's first come, first serve as far as who the schedule from the messages and they state they will not schedule you if you do not leave information in the exact way they say to do so, that you will not receive a call if the info is wrong... so there's no way to tell if you didn't get an appointment because it was full up or you did it wrong. 

They are equally adamant on the voicemail that you cannot call for info from any other number at the school. I have yet to receive an appointment despite several very careful attempts, alas.
