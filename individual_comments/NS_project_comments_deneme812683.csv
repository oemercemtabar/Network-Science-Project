there was once this bit on Carlos Mencias show where a priest gave an open letter called ""fuck you pedophiles"" and talked about how he hated that every time he took his church group out on a trip, they send out an amber alert. I wish I could find it but that's the sentiment here.

Just because we're (finally) opening the doors doesn't mean that women can just drop what they're doing to run through. Birth control hasn't been around that long, and its use is STILL being contested, even in first-world countries. I'm bringing that up to demonstrate how little time women have had in the context of human history to freely pursue non-domestic dreams. The same goes for men and being domestic. 

I've already seen comments in this thread from men saying that they'd love to be a SAHP, but can't for one reason or another. Maybe they're in another stage of life, maybe they just can't afford to. Maybe they make more money than their partner and, now that they have kids, they can't just stop working so their partner can go to school and pursue a STEM degree like she wanted to before they got pregnant. That's not my story, but there are PLENTY of reasons why some women aren't working in STEM and some men aren't at home with kids other than ""they just don't want to."" 

A lot of the women who are eligible to pursue a career in STEM now grew up hearing that it wasn't an option for them, so a lot of them went on to pursue other things. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure that there are still women alive today who were computer scientists back when that field was dominated by women. Personally, I love STEM, and it would be great if simply glancing at a textbook was enough to land me a position, but the reality is that a career is something that needs to be planned for. 

> How do you think that will play out if the same number of women keep coming into the field? 

I think the number of women coming into the field will fluctuate, but that's probably true of most fields. The world changes fast, but it takes awhile for society to catch up. I think looking at the current number of women in STEM and coming to the conclusion that women just aren't interested is ""sexist"" the way that looking at crime rates and coming to the conclusion that black people just commit more crime is racist. Just because everything looks equal on paper doesn't mean it is, you know? It takes time for society to adjust and make actual change.

They're saying that there *shouldn't* be quotas -- instead, women who actually want to be in STEM just need to be treated well. Maybe, if women are worse at asking for raises, there should be different systems for tracking who isn't getting as many raises compared to similar performers.

> The reason that is important isn't because that automatically proves sexism, but because it means that such an analysis doesn't really disprove sexism, either. 

By this logic you can never prove whether or not there was sexism, because everything's complicated, there are always confounders.

Anyway nobody said the 95% number disproved sexism. The idea was, that's our best guess for the part of the wage gap explained by sexism. It could be adjusted if some factor like underpromotion isn't being properly accounted for (although I think it is).

> Such analyses are fine and good, but a lot of people are overstating the case they make.

Again, I think you're understating the case they make, because you're assuming the confounder you mentioned has a bigger impact than it does, because you're not actually looking at the numbers to see the actual effect.

>  I've seen quite a few more conservative people be like, ""Oh, after this analysis the wage gop drops to 5%? Guess all that liberal whining about sexism was a lie"". It's just not that simple.

But the 77% number is still more misleading (or whatever the unadjusted number is).

If one person thinks that women are paid 23% less due to sexism, and another person thinks that they're paid 0% less due to sexism, and the actual number is 5%...the latter person was closer to the mark.

To be clear: are you suggesting to just use the 77% number, and pretend that the entire 23% gap is due to sexism? Or are you advocating some other way of thinking and talking about the wage gap?",MuonManLaserJab,t2_fs9b6,2,0,reddit2

duh81hg,t1_duh47ic,2018-02-19 05:14:50,news,"Because the ultra PC and ""safespace"" culture has gotten to almost 1984 levels of intolerance to critical thought.

I mean harassment is never OK, but what they're defining as harassment is becoming ridiculous. It's literally when a girl is asked out by a guy whom she does not find attractive. 

How dare I say that maybe, just maybe, if a girl feels uncomfortable that a guy who she found unattractive asked her out, she should just fucking get over it. The guy's not psychic—he doesn't know how she feels and the only way to find out is to try. He also felt uncomfortable, getting up the nerves and putting himself on the line to ask her out. This is the dance of nature. If no one can ask eachother out, how's the world going to couple up?

And if this bit of discomfort is enough to make her quit her major, then she didn't really care for that major in the first place. 

Again, I completely agree that if he persists instead of accepting the decline politely, then he's in harassment territory. But I've been in CS undergrad and grad school in two of the nerdiest CS universities—most of the guys don't even have the courage to talk to girls, and if they did, it took a lot of guts and they would immediately retreat bashfully at a rejection. 

I don't believe that the kind of ""non-stop harassment"" guys exist to the level that it's causing masses of tech-loving women to bail. I think it's exagerated by this strange wave of self-victimizing ultra-sensitivity that has swept our society. I think the reality is, as this article said, women just don't really care about STEM that much.

Classist? Never said anything about socio-economic status. 

I don't think that it is particularly unfair to say that undergratuates tend to have less developed political ideologies than older people. You have just left home for the first time and are still very much in the process of figuring out who you are and what you believe in. At this point your understanding of grand belief systems like libertarianism, anarchism, communism, environmentalism, economic rationalism, etc etc are not yet fully developed so nuance and contrary views are harder to incorporate. In addition to this, many undergraduate focused political action groups (here in Australia the main ones were the young Liberals, young Labor, the Evangelical union and the Socialist alternative) tend to enforce a degree of ideological purity that leaves less room for alternative perspectives.

Feminism is no exception to this. Young feminists may be aware of terms like intersectionality on a conceptual level, but universities tend to skew toward the wealthy and well educated, so naturally their perspective at least initially will tend to be more focused on the concerns faced by women in these groups  than in the broader community,

She constantly has to reject guys, which is emotionally exhausting. Some guys can react very badly when they are rejected and she has to guess which ones those are. Afterwards she is stuck in classes and group projects with guys who might still be salty that she rejected them. She can also face rumors spread by salty guys. To deal with one guy who you rejected is aggravating, but doable. But having to do often can be awful.


Also in a class with only guys there are not many people who you can confide in. I am part of a board game club and me and other women had to deal with persistent socially awkward guys and other guys mean well, but they just couldn't grasp what we went through because they empathized with the rejected guy. They also wouldn't discourage the rejected guy from continuing to pursue me and the other girls even though we mentioned to them about their advances being uncomfortable. It made forming friendships with guys difficult sometimes, because often they turned into another pursuer or they encouraged their friend and would give them personal information or tried to be a wingman and push their friend on you, so you multiple guys try to pressure you into dating someone.  

It's can be courageous to ask someone out, but do think that for the receivers it can also be difficult to deal constantly have to give people bad news and deal with the emotions another person has about it. You don't want to ruin someone's day. And trust me, a lot of these guys have often never even talked with the girl but more likely built a fantasy image because she also like programming or games. So they are expecting way too much and take it way harder than when someone casually asks someone out at the bar or online.

There are also definitely harassers some guys would ask every girl out (and I mean every, even those not single) and when rejected he would endlessly nag about it to you and other people, another would stare at you dead in the face from the other side of the room.

And that's the rub of it. The kind of people who often need social support to raise children are not particularly rational or forward thinking.

Literally all for-profit insurance companies that are profitable operate this way. Last time I checked there are plenty of such companies around. The reason why people purchase it is because the company is able to pay out even if the total pay out has exceeded the expected cost or if the amount that you had gotten from investing your premiums instead of paying them, would have yet to cover the pay out from insurance.

When selling insurance, the product being sold is a reduction in risk, people find value in reduction in risk, and therefore are willing to pay more in than they may be likely to ever get out.

That's not what false dichotomy means. False dichotomy is the false claim that there's only two answers to a question, and it must be one of the two. That's what dichotomy means.

""You're either for us or against us"" is a classic example of a false dichotomy - because a person can be neither. ""Lunatic, liar or lord"" is an example of a false trilemma, because there are more options - ""myth, mistaken, misattribution"" for three more, and more beyond that.

The organization pushing something is *critically* important for determining the validity of the thing being pushed. Just like flat-earthers aren't credible when they push flat-earth, or young earth creationists aren't credible when they claim to have evidence that the earth is 6,000 years old.

If you merely ask for 50/50 and the other party contests it, then they have to prove you're unfit.

Most state court presumes shared, shared isn't 50/50. Further you are simply assuming that all of the cases where the father doesn't contest the agreement that it would have maintained the same ratio. That simply isn't in evidence. 

How do you explain the selection effect? Are the men who contest the agreement simply randomly selected? If so, are all of men's lawyers demonstrably unfit? Presumably they should be able to advise their clients to some degree which should result in selection. They are after all, trained professionals, often who specialize in exactly this matter.

If you're not sure what I mean by the selection effect, let me put it this way, when 50% of men take the SATs and 50% of women take the SATs their scores are roughly equal, maybe a few points more in math for men, a few points more in verbal for women, but nothing crazy. When 40% of men take the SAT and 60% of women do, the average women's scores are worse. Why? Because you're generally comparing the top 40% to the top 60%. 

Why is this relevant to law? Well we're only seeing a small portion of men contest the matter and take it to court. What does that suggest for the rest? Either they're utterly indifferent, or they know they won't do better in court. Now your claim is that is simply ignorance. Yet, they have legal representation which has advised them. Now either, all of those lawyers are so incompetent that they cannot select cases whatsoever, or there's something to the fact that there's a difference in who goes to court.

Incidentally, if you think it is just the incompetent random selection item, that has some troubling implications for efforts on equality in STEM, the wage gap, and a host of other matters. ",FuggleyBrew,t2_5mqno,0,0,reddit2

Also even in that scenario you get the same amount of days off within a 2 week period.

I literally said all of this, or nothing I said contradicted it.

>In your bizarro world of insurance, which is informed by left leaning media and potentially a personal distaste for markets and an confident ignorance of economics, insurance companies charge customers without consideration of their expected costs, such that some customers are taken on at risk adjusted rates of return that are different than other customers.

I never said this, nor do I believe it. Insurance companies must charge customers **more** than their expected costs (unless they are unprofitable, or have other forms of income). That isn't the same as saying they do so **independently** of their expected costs, which is what you're arguing against, but I never said that, nor would I ever intend to say that.

>such that some customers are taken on at risk adjusted rates of return that are different than other customers.

Pretty sure insurance companies aren't allowed to change premiums based on certain factors (like race), and therefore the risk adjusted rates of return should vary.

>such that other companies do not offer premium reductions that are still guaranteed to produce profit in your magical system?

My system isn't magic, the reason why other companies don't offer premium reductions that are still guaranteed to produce profit is for the same reason why there is non zero profit in any industry, that the companies themselves want profit and the consumers want lower premiums. These competing pressures tend towards some equilibrium. If the premiums get too high then the consumers will stop buying insurance as it is no longer worth it, and/or a competitor will undercut everyone else. There are exceptions where this model doesn't work well, namely health insurance.

>Why, in your mind, would a customer willingly purchase a policy with a premium that is greater than his expected cost + a rate of return? 

I already explained this in my post, did you just not read it?

Lets say that I just signed up for auto insurance a month or two ago, and then I get into a major accident. Chances are that I have not paid as much in premiums as I am about to get back from my insurance company. I'm thus willing to pay out more than my expected cost in insurance premiums because if I had instead invested those premiums, I would have less than my insurance company just paid out.

Expected cost also does not reflect actual cost to every individual. I could, potentially, end up in a situation with any given type of insurance where they will need to pay out more than expected cost to me. The average person may be fine with just investing the expected cost and using that instead of insurance, but that is different from every person being fine with just investing the expected cost and using that. If someone gets into far more car accidents than would be expected, their insurance may have to pay out more than their expected cost. If I had invested my premium instead, I'd have to come up with additional funds.

These are services offered which have value, and therefore people are willing to pay to access these services.

>Do you know that the individual mandate existed to force people to purchase insurance that was a guaranteed super-loss to them (exceeding expected cost + average profit per policy)? Do you know that the ACA forced insurance companies to use community rating? Do you think the law was written to force insurance companies and customers to act in the way you think insurance works because insurance was already working that way absent the force used to force them to do so? Idiot.

Yes, I knew all that, however the first statement is untrue. You see, the problem with health insurance is that demand for it is always the same. Literally everyone always wants health insurance, and if they think they can afford it they will virtually always buy it. Contributing even more to issues with health insurance are that healthcare is where the two factors that increase insurance premiums above rate of return that I mentioned above are most dramatic (you can become suddenly very sick without warning and you can have some ailment that is many times more expensive than expected cost to cure or treat) and that people are scared of death and dying (and of going broke while doing so). This means it makes more sense for health insurance companies to keep forcing premiums up, as long as the amount of profit coming in from those who can afford it is higher than the amount of money that can be made from those who could afford the lower premiums. It doesn't make sense to undercut your competition because if you're not going to get enough market share to compensate for the fact that you have just reduced the total amount of dollars in the health insurance industry itself then you'll lose money by doing so.

This means that health insurance companies can be most profitable by letting the poor die without insurance, leaving them totally unable to afford care. This works great for them, but people tend to react negatively to letting poor people die (hence why the ER is free). This also creates a situation where only those with higher risk are the only ones willing to buy health insurance, as the young are more willing to take the chance to go without health insurance. This means that all the people on health insurance are those from higher risk groups, which means that premiums have to be higher, which makes buying health insurance make less sense for those with lower risk.

In order to bring down the rate of increase of premiums the ACA with the mandate forced people to buy healthcare, so that there would be more lower risk people buying insurance which would help fight the rise in health insurance premiums. The problem with this is that Americans don't like being forced to buy things, especially things that they perceive (actual or not) to not necessarily be in their best interest to purchase. The ACA forced insurance companies to do a lot of things (like stop selling non-insurance), because we, as moral and ethical human beings, didn't like the outcomes of the free market, so something had to change. Health insurance sucks now, but it sucked a lot worse pre-ACA.

I'm not a big fan of the ACA to be honest. At this point America should just adopt the NHS model and be done with it. They spend like half of what we spend IIRC and get outcomes that are pretty much just as good or better and don't have people going bankrupt just because they got sick. Are wait times longer for non-urgent care? yeah, but that is still a fuck load better than your wait time being ""until I win the lottery"".

The reason why the first statement is untrue is because if you're a very young and fit person, you could still suddenly become very sick without any warning, and thus health insurance would actually not necessarily be a loss for you as you could exceeded either the expected cost, or the amount that you'd paid out in premiums so far (which, with health insurance, could mean the difference between life and death). Thus, it is not a guarantee that you'll lose money on it, but that the population as a whole, will.

You waxed on before about ""In your bizarro world of insurance, which is informed by left leaning media and potentially a personal distaste for markets and an confident ignorance of economics"", the reality is that markets are pretty much just evolutionary algorithms for the distribution of resources. Relatively free markets work pretty well in a lot of situations, although they very rarely arrive at the optimal solution. However, the thing about evolution and evolutionary algorithms, is that all they care about is how fitness is measured. In a free market that is profitability, which means that as long as something is profitable it will be reinforced by the market. This can clash with ethical and moral principals, which is why we might not let insurance companies charge someone more because they're black, or because they're gay, or because they're Muslim, .etc. On what grounds we allow insurance companies to charge differing premiums and to which groups is a question that we have to figure out together because that's how Democracy works.

The problem comes in when people like you come in, who apparently don't give a shit about moral and ethical implications, as long as whatever is being done is being done in the name of a freer market. Fuck the poor, let 'em die, am I right?",mimmimmim,t2_lm3m1on,2,0,reddit2

dui80yx,t1_duhwtxx,2018-02-19 20:01:18,news,"> Lets say that I just signed up for auto insurance a month or two ago, and then I get into a major accident. Chances are that I have not paid as much in premiums as I am about to get back from my insurance company. I'm thus willing to pay out more than my expected cost in insurance premiums because if I had instead invested those premiums, I would have less than my insurance company just paid out.

This is a misunderstanding of 'expected cost'. 

> I could, potentially, end up in a situation with any given type of insurance where they will need to pay out more than expected cost to me.

>Yes, I knew all that, however the first statement is untrue. (*in the context of the mandate*) You see, the problem with health insurance is that demand for it is always the same.

This is just factually false. The reason 'community rating' and the individual mandate, as well as the maximum differential by age were put in place was to force insurance companies to sign some people up *knowing ahead of time* that they would be net losses, and to make up for it by charging other people more *knowing ahead of time* that they would not consume their premiums, excluding ROR. The mandate itself existed to *force* people for whom, on average, would end up better off without insurance even absent ROR. Go read about the death spiral and tell me again that young, healthy people weren't forced to purchase insurance with premiums exceeding their expected cost + average ROR. This is not only acknowledged, but trumpeted to the extent that left leaning journalists, policy makers, and think tankers went public to assert that Trump rescinding the individual mandate would put insurance markets in a death spiral, as no one would willingly purchase insurance that was so overpriced. 

>Literally everyone always wants health insurance, and if they think they can afford it they will virtually always buy it.

Literally everyone wants more of everything, and yet, they must choose between myriad products to spend their limited resources. Tell me, do you sell all of your belongings every time you get the flu, in order to fully invest in your healthcare? No, you don't, and no, no one chooses to spend more on healthcare every time they have the opportunity. This is another fake meme you've picked up in your leftist circles. 

>It doesn't make sense to undercut your competition

Herein you assert that economics don't real because you are pretty sure that incentives don't matter based on your feelings. Your question/assertion -> ""Why would a firm lower their prices in order to make more profit by stealing market share?!"" Competition is a fact. 

>It doesn't make sense to undercut your competition because if you're not going to get enough market share to compensate for the fact that you have just reduced the total amount of dollars in the health insurance industry itself then you'll lose money by doing so.

Let's examine this logical statement: 'It doesn't make sense to do X in order to increase profits because if X doesn't increase your profits'. Truly profound. 

>This means that health insurance companies can be most profitable by letting the poor die without insurance

Health insurance is most profitable by selling insurance at various levels in accordance with actuarial cost. And yes, health insurance is most profitable by selectively denying claims. That is an actual problem which can be addressed legally.


>This also creates a situation where only those with higher risk are the only ones willing to buy health insurance, as the young are more willing to take the chance to go without health insurance.

This is why you allow health insurers to charge according to expected cost. Young, healthy people are willing to purchase insurance that is reflective of their young and healthy status. They are less willing to purchase insurance that does not fully consider their youth and health. That is why Mr. Obama had to make the individual mandate; it's hard to get people to sign up for being ripped off.

>The problem with this is that Americans don't like being forced to buy things, especially things that they perceive (actual or not) to not necessarily be in their best interest to purchase.

It is a matter of fact that being charged greater than your expected cost + ROR is not in the best interest of the policy purchaser. This is evidence both by the fact that insurance premiums for the young and healthy increased drastically with the ACA, and the fact that they had to be coerced in to purchasing them by people who knew better than they did, what they should do (you are solidly in the camp of 'I am smarter than you, do what I say or I will punish you, resist and I will kill you', comrade).

>The reason why the first statement is untrue is because if you're a very young and fit person, you could still suddenly become very sick without any warning, and thus health insurance would actually not necessarily be a loss for you as you could exceeded either the expected cost, or the amount that you'd paid out in premiums so far

Herein you either feign or demonstrate an ignorance of mathematics and statistics sufficient that it should provide you with a moment to reflect and perhaps humility going forward before you decide that you should be allowed to impose your feelings-based policy prescriptions on others, at the barrel of a gun. Let me help you figure out why:

""You could win the lottery, therefore purchasing lottery tickets is actually not necessarily a loss for you"" 

or...

""You could flip 10 heads in a row, therefore the chance to flip 10 heads in a row is less than 2^10 ""

>Thus, it is not a guarantee that you'll lose money on it, but that the population as a whole, will.

Yes, in your system some people are guaranteed to lose money on average, and some people are guaranteed to net money on average, and both groups know from the outset which group they belong to. That isn't insurance, that is a welfare scheme. Calling it insurance is a lie, told by liars who admitted that they lied (Gruber).

> the reality is that markets are pretty much just evolutionary algorithms for the distribution of resources.

Markets are the state of nature. People want to keep their property and so are only willing to part with it in exchange for something that they value more than what they are parting with. It is not an 'evolutionary algorithm' which implies a one way causality with path dependency.

>Relatively free markets work pretty well in a lot of situations, although they very rarely arrive at the optimal solution.

Presumably 'optimal' here in defined as ""in accordance with my enlightened preferences"".


>This can clash with ethical and moral principals, which is why we might not let insurance companies charge someone more because they're black, or because they're gay, or because they're Muslim, .etc.

If those attributes have comorbidity with higher expected costs than you can stroke your 'ethics' all you want but the costs will be either be borne by those with the cost or by other groups without the cost. If group A and group B have divergent expected costs to the tune of $10 extra for group A, then by spreading the expected cost across A and B, you are charging group B $5 more than it's expected cost, which is nothing more than a $5 handout to group A, of course enforced by violence (the gulags become necessary a little bit further down the road of remaking reality to fit your emotional requirements).

>On what grounds we allow insurance companies to charge differing premiums and to which groups is a question that we have to figure out together because that's how Democracy works.

Fine, but at least stop pretending that mandatory, violence enforced wealth transfers have anything to do with insurance. 




>The problem comes in when people like you come in, who apparently don't give a shit about moral and ethical implications

Like the moral implications of stealing from people and killing them if they resist? Your worldview imposed on the rest of us requires totalitarianism. But hey, at least everyone can starve together in the new USSR under your command?


Some people will receive more in payouts than they have paid in premiums and some people will receive less. This is absolutely not the same as 'risk pooling' as in 'community rating', wherein some people pay less or more than their expected cost + ROR.



>Fuck the poor, let 'em die, am I right?

Can you stop and think to yourself about how you here tacitly admit that what you've described is not insurance but is instead a system of laws that mandates wealth redistribution through insurance channels by mandating that some people pay more than their expected cost + ROR in order that some other politician-preferred people pay less?

>Fuck the poor, let 'em die, am I right?

Ah yes, remember, acknowledging the reality of how insurance pricing works; not maintaining the fiction that giving someone with guaranteed $1,000,000 per year medical costs, insurance at $500 per month, is actually 'insurance' rather than wealthy redistribution, is certainly the gateway drug to Soviet Union, Maoist China, or Nazi Germany style genocide.

That's never been my position.  What I'm saying is you don't want to put a government mandate on the purchasing of any benefits.  The sensible type of regulations are wage and hour regulations. 

The most common examples (I will give you California laws but federal is similar):

1.  Minimum wage  
2.  Overtime wage 
3.  Mandated meal breaks
4.  Mandated rest breaks
5.  Salaried exemption status

If government wants to change the terms and conditions of work they can manipulate these regulations.  But to mandate any specific type of benefit (other than simply mandating more cash payments) is nonsense, counter-productive, and paternalistic.  

It assumes someone other than you knows what's better for you as compared to if you were just permitted to make your own decisions.  I don't believe the average adult is a child that needs to be told.

Your first world children will consume the resources of 20 third world children and they don't have easy access to contraceptives. If my nice house doesn't matter then why does it matter if I'm a neck beard in a trailer? Again, thinking your CHOICES make you better when all I've ever done is say that everyone should get the same. You like sleep? Don't have a kid. Want to retire young and not depend on your kids? Well I dunno what your game plan is but I think the 236k I save by not having a kid will go a long way... How is it a stupid argument to say that parents shouldn't get anymore than non parents? That's equality motherfucker. Do you believe in equality or not? You say there is nothing special about my view but then call it a minority view, make up your mind. Is my view common or is it not? And where do you get off asserting that I have no stake in the future? Maybe I intend to do something with my life better than raise another tax paying shit-buying wage slave, because there is nothing special about having kids, it's the most basic fucking shit you can do. Maybe i refuse to bring a child into this world until I can make it better, and if that time comes too late for me then maybe it will help a future generations children, so how dare you say I have no stake in the future. Ihave no desire to be anyone's warm center but apparently you were so desperate for love you could only get it from your kids. I hope you're worth loving I really do because I was raised by a narcissist and I feel bad for others going through the same... Enjoy your bland totally average life. Hope you don't miss the 470k you spend raising your kids when it turns out they can barely support themselves in our over populated world much less their aging parents. Enjoy your retirement home and your reverse mortgage. Hope you sleep well at night knowing that thanks to you the world has two more accountants/telemarketers. Oh and if you ever say anything in the name of equality, think back to me and how you were absolutely convinced your totally average choices entitled you to special rights. I'll be in my nice house driving my nice cars and enjoying the love and companionship of my shelter dogs who needed homes before any future hypothetical humans. You know what... I won't say I'm misanthropic, but I will say that humans as a whole are very incredibly egocentric, thinking that their right to ever expand their footprint far exceeds the rights of any of Earth's other living creatures. I love humans, but I love ALL the animals more than I love Humans. Animals generally aren't shitheads. Humans kinda skew that way. Love 'em, but they're not any better than anyone else sharing our planet, in fact we are cruel and destructive and absolutely fucking refuse to live in harmony with nature, because parenting is apparently a special fucking right

And narcissistic rage is what occurs when that person has their admiration of themselves challenged, like when I wouldn't agree with you. Just read the tone of your text man, it's sad that you lack the self awarness to see it. You say you were raised by a narcissist well it looks like it rubbed off I'm sorry to say.

You admire the fact that you're so much smarter than all the dumb breeders. That's why you have to keep going on about your nice house you claim to own and fancy cars that you claim to drive. You think you're so much better than all us stupid average people (who you know nothing about) living our boring normal lives. 

You claim to love animals and yet you can't empathize with people who love their own children. I've raised my rescue pup from eight weeks old and that's  what originally turned me around on having kids, the selfess love I feel for that big mutt transformed my life. If you can't connect with that and understand why people want to have kids and make those sacrifices willingly you really are lost. 

Lack of empathy is a textbook trait for narcissistic personality disorder.

You constantly insult my choices as being normal and average knowing nothing about me beyond the facts of our conversation. You're right I did call you a neckbeard but that's because you're an arrogant cunt and I honestly don't believe your claims of riches or relationships.

No the truth is you are a special snowflake who wants the privileges that come with parenthood without making the sacrifices that go along with them.

Then why are you loosing your shit? there's no need for that, do you actually read anything you write??? Are you aware that narcissists also suffer from a profound lack of self-awareness?

Because kids take time and energy and it's a normal part of life, why do people take a sick day when they have the flu. This is just basic basic stuff.

Parents get tax credits because parents spend a lot of money and because parents are voters. Again not rocket science.

First of all agent Smith (interesting choice of mouthpiece by the way) says that mammals instinctively find balance with their environment, this is false, animals breed until their numbers exceed the carrying capacity of the ecosystem and then the weak die and the strong survive. This is pretty basic ecology, animals breed according to their biological imperatives (like we do) until they reach the local ecologie's carrying capacity, this is why many wild animals have very large litters, many will not survive to adulthood in the fight for limited resources.

Second of all it's just sad that you empathize with a machine that seeks to destroy and subject humanity rather than the heros of the story.

This isn't a reason not to have kids. The truth of it is as a westerner I could have 6 kids and it still wouldn't be enough.
