It's not ""How much do men earn vs.how much do women earn?"" 
That's so vague it's almost meaningless.
The questions are ""For the exact same work including experience, what do men and women earn? What kind of job pays the most? The least? Why?""
Once you ask those questions, the pay gap all but disappears.

It's a toxic idea. It promotes the current 'men are all violent and potential rapists' and 'Women have always been under the oppression of men' It promotes negative feeling towards men. And makes men feel bad and women feel victimized.

I have known for years the ""pay gap"" reduces once you split part timers from full timers.  And that the median part time woman earns more than the median part time man.  So it's great to hear women now talking about this.  The fact the author also looked at under 40's and found no negligible gap supports the thinking that once women leave the workforce to have children then the ""pay gap"" can't help but appear and is a significant contributing factor.

I have a couple of anecdotes I have observed over the years.  Firstly, I referred a female colleague to a contract finance role for which she was a shoe in.  I recommended a certain rate that she could earn and she negotiated a rate that was 30% lower....!  As they say you can lead a horse to water.......and that was not the only occasion I observed this.  I don't believe it is weak negotiating skills per se, she couldn't see the value the client was prepared to pay versus how much she thought she was worth.  She believed they would increase her rate once they saw the value she was adding....and of course the rate never changed.  Disappointing is one way of putting it.

The second anecdote is within the medical profession.  As women progress up the ranks and earn a better salary, a number of them choose to reduce their hours to retain the same take home pay.  I have observed this on many occasions.  I believe they are happy with the current take home pay and they view a pay rise as a chance to rebalance work vs life.

The latter, Feminist Neo-marxism, is nothing more than the fantasy of mentally ill male-haters.

Marx had nothing to say on race, sex, or sexual orientation. His worries were for the economically disadvantaged and deprived only.

The problem is that it is not a ""PAY"" gap at all.
The study shows an ""EARNINGS"" gap.
They are two very different things.

Women do ""Earn"" less than men in general - but this is due to many different factors, such as hours worked, job type and maternity leave.

Men, in general, work more hours and more men work in industries/occupations that are deemed ""unpleasant"" , ""dangerous"" or ""unsociable"".
These industries are often payed higher than jobs at simler skill levels in other places,due to the risks involved.

The study in question just took an average of all women's pay and all mens pay and compared them without factoring in job types and hours worked.

It's like comparing the earnings two people , one a doctor working 40 hours a week and one a cleaner working 16 hours a week - and then complaining that the 16 hours a week cleaner makes less than the doctor.

The free market works out so that the most productive and efficient outcome is reached. If women, in the history of mankind, simply could be hired for the same work with less pay, then why aren't companies choosing to hire only women? Because women are less productive, even in many non physical jobs.

All I'm suggesting is that we get rid of all equality laws and affirmative action laws. Let employers decide what is best and most productive, because as we all know, business owners care about profits and productivity. If women really deserve to be paid the same and have all the same jobs, then business owners will see that, because they care about profits. Business's that don't care about profits, die very quickly.

Funny, because whenever I suggest this, women repeatedly say I'm trying to ""ban"" women from the workforce, even though I said no such thing, infact I said we should increase individual choice and get rid of laws (not create new laws).

Companies and universities are actively discriminating against men and Asians as demographics. They are clawing and competing against each other to see who can advance the most women in the office. Despite all of this, there is still a universal earnings gap that you can attribute to job choice, hours worked, etc. that has nothing to do with demographics or “institutional sexism”. 

Anecdotally, all of the women I know with high earnings potential also married high earning men. Guess what happens when it comes time for kids? Is it sexism when these high earning women decide on their own (often against what the husband would have picked for them) to not work any more or drastically scale back? What does that do to the aggregate number for the national statistic when lots and lots and lots of women make that choice? 

Sid is a stock broker and Amy is a pharmacist. Both live in Alabama and make $150k/yr. Sid and Amy have their first kid at 31, and Amy decides to quit for three years, and then return at a scaled back capacity when offspring is able to go to preschool.

She’s still a “full time” 34 year old pharmacist in Alabama, but her earnings are not going to come close to someone (male, female, or parent) who didn’t quit for 3 years and picked a position that paid them the most that is less flexible and has more responsibility.

But, I agree that many ppl think it's same place of work, different job, type of thing.

(Not gonna get in medical workforce terms, cause at least in my country, all the medical staff is underpaid compared to the work done)

For example, I believe it's wrong to just set down ""male teachers"" and ""female teachers"" as they teach different things or schooling levels. The field for elementary school tends to be female dominated while uni is more male dominated. They're all teachers, but nonetheless a uni teacher will obviously be paid more than an elementary teacher (again a field that in general is actually underpaid).

While there is some places that have an actual pay gap, I agree that the places that don't still wanna call it for an inexistent one.",,,1,0,reddit3

There are more factors to consider though, like there is some sexism that discourages women from STEM fields.

I don't think it's enough to put women in male dominated filed though, I think we in this community need to get men into female dominated areas. Areas like teaching, child-care, dental assistants and things. ""Men employed in male-dominated occupations are at elevated risk of work-related fatalities, injuries, and suicide.""

The male death rate is partly because men are in such dangerous jobs. If we encourage men to go into female-dominated industries the male death rate might drop. It will show that women are strong and able to do dangerous jobs, and men are valuable and shouldn't be pushed into jobs that might kill them.

Started out thinking that the gender pay gap was a horrible travesty for women. Then saw the same statistics we all did and flipped to ""the pay gap is a myth!""

I've kinda settled on...it's a thing and it's bad but people talk about it the wrong way. 

The top line number doesn't mean what we think it means, for one. The economists that made these studies do pull this out as a problem. But...it's an ECONOMIC problem. They are concerned with increasing capital in the economy on a macro level and identifying a group that has underperformed relative to its peer group is a way to get there. ""How can we grow the economy? Well. Women seem to make less. And they spend more. Getting them higher wages is an objectively positive economic goal."" Morality doesn't come into it. 

Career choice, which OP points out, is another one that I feel like is played up by both sides. Like, yes. Women choose fields that are less monetization and that hurts their wages. And I mostly think that's their fucking fault. They're choosing not to go into higher paying fields. BUT I am somewhat persuaded by the argument that at the lower end of the education spectrum, many higher paying jobs are manual labor positions which women simply cannot do as Sankey or effectively. Should biological shortcomings mean that we put a thumb on the scale? I don't know know. I'm undecided honestly. But we do for people with disabilities. If a man got terribly sick and lost a third of their muscle mass and had problems rebuilding that muscle, they would qualify for government assistance in most western nations and a majority of us states. Also...I do think positions like teacher are underpaid relative to their value to society. Women should be responsible for bargaining, of course, but the way some of these positions are filled makes individual contract bargaining difficult ir even impossible. 

We should also take into account that bias against MEN also increases the wage gap. Studies show men are disproportionately punished for taking paternity leave or sick/personal time for child care. That leaves an economic incentive for the female partner to fulfill childcare duties. And every study shows that babies are by far the largest factor in the decline in female wages over their careers. They work less because they shoulder the majority of child care. And...I don't think that's a bad thing. I would rather a larent take care if a child than a child care worker. But then we're gonna need to pay people some kind of child allowance ge to make that happen or families aren't gonna be able to afford it.

**This doesn’t mean that gender discrimination doesn’t exist. Our analysis just shows that, at the aggregate level, most of the gap is not explained by gender discrimination.**  
  
Regarding the second aspect of the pay gap, societal ideas of gender roles influence the behavior of women and men. Also, biological factors related to parenthood do play a role in the creation of differences in preferences. Namely, women get pregnant and women breastfeed. These differences between sexes could be a plausible explanation of why women tend to spend more time at home versus their couples, especially after marriage and parenthood7.  
  
To conclude and to recap, we can say that, according to our analysis, job market forces and gender preferences in relation to marital status and parenthood could explain almost all of the pay gap. Most of the gap is not the result of gender discrimination.

I am interested in other equity solutions. It's important to know why women aren't being encouraged to go into these dangerous industries but men are. Are we encouraging male disposability, and how can we stop that? It's wrong that one gender is more likely to die at work, you can't have feminism and be okay with that. And if society still has this messed up idea that men are disposable but women are precious, maybe they'd do more to make these industries safer if more women were working in them. Like how female dominated industries might get paid more if more men worked in them.

&#x200B;

If women worked more hours and took on more high stress jobs then men could work less, which could improve mental health and lower suicide rates. Women are also more likely to go to therapy so they might be overall in less danger from high stress jobs. And if we stopped making men feel like their value comes only from their labor, that's good for both men and women.

And frankly we need to revamp a lot of things to address homelessness. Men's homeless shelters would be a good place to start, but providing housing is the best way. [https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness) "" But a recent study showed the savings in emergency healthcare, social services and the justice system totalled as much as €15,000 a year for every homeless person in properly supported housing.""

Feminism is supposed to be about letting women be treated equally to men. If women are being treated better then men in some ways then we haven't achieved the goal of feminism. Sexism against men is still sexism, and the feminism is kind of bullshit if it doesn't care about men's issues. 

Even if you only cared about women, a lot of women's issues are caused by or related to men's issues. No one will ever be really free until men are liberated too.

The feminism you're critiquing seems to be more radical feminism rather then intersectional feminism. Radfems hate men more often and care about men's issues less. Intersectional feminsts care about multiple issues and one of those issues is men's liberation.",AndyesIdumb,t2_d02d86er,0,0,reddit3

Frankly, I wouldn't even bother discussing with a Feminist these topics, not unless there's the potential of onlookers to convince instead.

That sadly doesn't make them a feminist. The pay gap myth is pushed quite a lot in the mainstream with little to no critical thinking about it, presented as gospel. Not everyone is as invested as the activists despite taking activists at their word, especially when they get segments on news channels to spread their bullshit.

>Do try it with them, and see if you can change even 1 feminist stance on pay gap. I can bet that it won't be making any difference.

If you kept reading and not trying to take this as some sort of battle, you'd realise that I already said I don't bother with Feminists unless it's explicitly with an audience, not to sway the Feminist, but to sway the audience.

Seriously, do you think this interaction has gone well? Do you think you've convinced me?

Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. According to the 2019 annual report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 32033 rape cases were registered across the country, or an average of 88 cases daily,slightly lower than 2018 when 91 cases were registered daily.Of these, 30,165 rapes were committed by perpetrators known to the victim (94.2 % of cases), a high number similar to 2018. The share of victims who were minors or below 18 - the legal age of consent - stood at 15.4%, down from 27.8% in 2018. On the other hand, rapes by juveniles remained high in India with 3 minors being arrested for rape, assault and attempted violence on women and girls each day in 2019.India has been characterised as one of the ""countries with the lowest per capita rates of rape"".

He also went to INSEAD, one of the top ranked business schools in the world and was such a good student he received the Henry Ford award for best student of the year /outstanding academic performance. The he went to Harvard for a business management program.
He was a professor in the Portuguese bank training institute and the Catholic University of Portugal while being the VP and head of capital markets.
In Brazil he was CEO of Banco Santander Brazil , also the chairman of the Santander Group. Then was CEO of Santander UK. 
He was recruited to turn Lloyd’s around.  He worked so hard he once stayed up for 5 days without sleeping and he had to take time off for a month for his mental health. Due to this His leadership at Lloyd’s  he made their business profitable again, and helped thousands in Britain needing loans. With increases in vehicle and mortgage loans(Lloyd’s is Britain’s biggest mortgage provider )by appealing more to account owners or customers.. And he helped fully restore the banking group to a private nongovernmental ownership at 900 million euros above the value they were paying back the government for. All while eradicating government regulation violations that were present at the the group. Gradually throughout the time of  all these achievements, his salary was sequentially increased. He didn’t start with that figure, he essentially saved the banking group and was awarded it.
He did so well in banking and leadership he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from: university of Edinburgh, university of Bath, and the university of Warwick. 
He was awarded the Grã-Cruz order of merit by Portugal. I don’t know much about Portuguese awards but from what I’ve read just now, it’s one of the highest civil honors.
It seems like he earned his salary and I don’t know why they feel the need to portray him this way.

Even if female CEOs do get less bonuses on average - you can't make the conclusion that it is due to systematic sexism.

A non-executive director (abbreviated to non-exec, NED or NXD), independent director or external director is a member of the board of directors of a company or organisation, but not a member of the executive management team. They are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way and are differentiated from executive directors, who are members of the board who also serve, or previously served, as executive managers of the company (most often as corporate officers). However they do have the same legal duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities as their executive counterparts.Non-executive directors provide independent oversight and serve on committees concerned with sensitive issues such as the pay of the executive directors and other senior managers; they are usually paid a fee for their services but are not regarded as employees.All directors should be capable of seeing company and business issues in a broad perspective. Nonetheless, non-executive directors are usually chosen because of their independence and initiative, are of an appropriate caliber and have particular personal qualities.

It isn't twisting the article at all, it is seeing through the narrative being portrayed in the article. Board level roles are overwhelmingly pushed towards women in order to make boards more gender diverse. This is so obvious and consistent with all statistics about how board demographics have changed over the past decade or so that is [doesn't need sourcing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_representation_on_corporate_boards_of_directors#Encouraging_gender_diversity_on_corporate_boards)

Is this  ""wage gap"" down to sexism?
This  ""gap"" narrows and reverses when children come along. 
Women predominantly  take the time from work or go back part-time when  children are on the scene.
This happens because women, especially middle class women,  are hypergamous.
 If they didn't go out of their way to marry men who earned as much as possible and more importantly have prospects of Higher earnings in the years to come in the same way that men don't,   then women would be more likely to be the main wage earner and as a result it would make far more sense for the men to be the main caregiver and possibly go part time or pack in while kids are young.
Of course this will never happen until women stop rating a partners potential earnings as highly. 
Ironically men are accused of lacking in romance yet most men, including high earning men, will happily love and marry a woman that earns substantially less than him, even one unemployed.
 Women, especially high earning women,  that do this are like rocking horse shit.
When it comes to selecting a life partner women are far less romantic and are far  more hard nosed about it.
Growing up young men observe this in society all around them. It is why young men are primed to go after money in a way that women aren't
Men  do this  in the choice of career, the hours worked and the general work life balance.
Hypergamy is the unacknowledged engine driving the gender earnings gap.
As long as women cling to this practice like a drowning sailor clinging to a lifebelt nothing will ever change.",tableender,t2_fcbcu6w,3,0,reddit2

Are women happy LARPing as men? For the most part, no. Women are more miserable than ever and the happiest ones live a traditional life where they have and raise children in a family. 

Men used to be able to get married and work while the woman stayed home, and they made enough money to take care of a family with 2-4 children at least. The family participated in 35-60 hours of work, usually the man doing all of it. Now we've got a man and a woman working full time, so it's like 70-100 hours of work while the kids are left in daycare, which has been proven to be traumatic for them.

ek2njx2,t1_ek0qdd3,2019-04-04 02:18:24,MensRights,"> people assume that since there's a gap it must be due to discrimination.

Lay people, anyway. If you're actually studying the field rigorously, you will find that we separate two camps: (1) statistical discrimination (teacher thinks boys are more likely to cause fights than girls, so is less willing to let them argue in class than girls, even though *this* pair of boys may not be prone to violence); (2) taste-based discrimination (I don't like you because you're X).

You also do *not* usually want to control for occupation when doing this type of work. Undergraduates control for occupation when they're running a simple Mincerian model because it soaks up a lot of the weight on the gender term, but it's endogenous as all hell, dubious-at-best to control for, and sacrilege-at-worst. Don't worry, though; if your hypothesis is that there isn't a taste-based discrimination gap in wages, your theory still essentially holds.

There's a decent amount of economics literature that can suggest to you that the majority of the observed gap in productivity, and the majority of the wage gap in general, can largely be attributed to the first birth in the household; women are knocked out of the labor force due to pregnancy. As such, they may ""anticipate"" pregnancy by selecting into fields which are more family friendly (more flexibility in hours, benefits e.g. health insurance for the child, etc.) either before or after first birth. This compensating differential detracts from the overall reported wage. Interestingly, both men and women in the data are found to prefer healthcare benefits at their workplace, even if the foregone wages are more than if they simply found healthcare elsewhere (that could moreso be a commentary on the state of the U.S. private healthcare insurance market and its deep ties to your employer, but you know what I mean).

In terms of there being a ""glass ceiling"" that exists, results are mixed, and it almost always goes back to statistical, rather than taste-based discrimination; employers are worried that a woman has a >0 probability of having a child, and so they don't want to promote them to executive roles which require long surprise hours. It's undeniable that certain high-powered professions have a ""boys club"" at the top that doesn't want to include women, but to the extent that the ""boys club effect"" isn't well-measured, the impact of boys club on promotional pathways isn't well-identified. In law, for example, though there is a well-known boys club effect (reported by men as well), if you handle the model correctly you will find that gender plays absolutely zero role in promotional potential. Then the question becomes: why aren't women making partner at law firms as much as men? Well, we find that they tend to work fewer hours (\~7.5hrs/workday compared to \~8.0hrs/workday for men), and that they tend to bring in fewer new clients (new clients are a huge revenue stream for most first). The next question, kind of the frontier of research at the moment, is whether this lowered productivity is (1) made in anticipation of first birth (no point going for partner if you're going to be a mother in 3 months), (2) lowered expectations / confidence of female lawyers. Results would suggest both play a role.

&#x200B;

The problem comes from both sides here: I have to deal with sociology faculty suggesting that if there's a gap, then it must be discrimination; we try to say if there's a gap, then it's worthy of investigation; then some people who have the nerve to say calling it discrimination is simple-minded, simple-mindedly assume that the differences in outcomes between men and women are because women are lazier. I'm not saying you're saying that, just that this topic pisses a lot of people off and I wish it wasn't so taboo outside of my field to objectively give a shit about it, on either side.",eadala,t2_j6y5t,-1,0,reddit2
ek2r8yl,t1_ek0qdd3,2019-04-04 03:09:40,MensRights,"The intent of the authors is to study factors which are know to explain some of the pay gap, to demonstrate that the “raw” pay gap (not adjusted for any external factors) is used too carelessly, and to conclude that there is insufficient data on the issue. Wages, seniority, education, job field and position,  and ‘interruptions’ in work are some of the complexities that this study lists that make it, as they state in the quote provided, impossible to “determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap...can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women.” This article does not conclude nor intends to conclude that there is no gender discrimination that can explain the pay gap.
In fact, this study is cited in a [Fox Business article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/politics/the-pay-gap-is-alive-and-well-and-hurting-women.amp) titled “The Pay Gap Is Alive and Well — and Hurting Women,” which mostly goes to show that data can be misconstrued in both directions. I personally agree with the original study that the true amount of the gender pay gap attributable to solely gender discrimination and no other factors is near impossible to discover. Efforts to encourage women to enter higher paying fields and to attend college at higher rates are being made which is progress towards the raw wage gap closing. 
However, there is still underlying societal gender roles and expectations which lead women to make certain choices,. The gender pay gap is also exacerbated for women of color - that is to say, minority women make less than minority men of the same race and far less than white men, but again this is a raw assessment and there are a lot of factors at play.
Studies have also shown that “occupations with a greater share of females pay less than those with a lower share, controlling for education and skill” ([source](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/88/2/865/2235342) ). 
There is also a documented “motherhood penalty,” with mothers receiving less pay than women without children while fathers tend to receive more, possibly due to choices about scheduling as well as stereotypes that fathers, but not mothers, are more responsible while mothers, but not fathers, are less dedicated to the job than to their family. This stereotype may also hurt men because men receive little to no parental leave and are expected to take on more work and hours to provide financially for the family at the cost of less time they can spend with their children. Low paid leave in the US means that many new moms leave their job to help with the baby until it is old enough for her to go back to work, and this interruption affects her career and pay negatively. This could be addressed by providing both mothers and fathers more parental leave and more paid leave.

Tl;dr, Wage gap is nuanced, the article and quote actually say there’s not enough data for such a complicated question, and some factors influencing the wage gap are societal/institutional rather than by literally just paying women less money for the same work.",seashell526,t2_248lzu4f,-1,0,reddit2

ek2en10,t1_ek1h12j,2019-04-04 00:20:12,MensRights,"Who said racism / sexism didn't exist, no one was saying that. But it is very hazardous to assume without evidence that since there's a gap, discrimination must make up a statistically significant portion of said gap ""because ummm obviously it must be"". There are many other factors that explain the disparity in pay between men and women, such as the fact that men work more hours, have more experience, tend to choose different professions, tend to negotiate harder when it comes to pay, etc, and in a bunch of studies when these factors are taken into account the gender pay gap narrows significantly or disappears.

Also, there are groups which are on equal or better footing for pay when compared to white men. In the U.S, Asian-American men are actually the highest paid racial group. In 2015, Asian American men were the highest earning racial group at $24/hour. Asian American men earned 117% as much as white American men ($21/hour) and have been out earning their white American counterparts since about 2000. Similarly, in 2015 Asian American women earned 106% as much as white American women.

Based on the logic that you're using, at least some portion of this gap is due to discrimination in favour of Asians and against whites. Otherwise ""Do whites just decide to not make money?"" Or perhaps, just perhaps, there are differences between these racial and gender groups that haven't been taken into account when calculating these ""pay gaps"".",problem_redditor,t2_3cc6xril,4,0,reddit2
ek1pqbm,t1_ek1h7tw,2019-04-03 19:30:10,MensRights,"My best answer for your question is this: things like software development, mastery of computer software, video games etc. takes a lot of solo practice and time spent alone. To me, men seem more drawn toward these types of things than women. There is certainly evidence that women are more social creatures than men and tend to be more engaged in the social aspects of say a desk job and in life as well. Definitely not a negative thing, but I would venture to guess most women dont find staring at a computer screen coding for 8 hours a day appealing. For some men, that could sound like heaven.

(This is observational and anecdotal so please if anyone is more well read than I feel free to correct me). I am a musician and I tend to see this a lot in music as well. The overhwmeling majority of non-classical musicians that I've come into contact with (guitarists/bassists/drummers/etc.) tend to be men. I wonder why this is all the time. I've seen and heard women bassists that completely blow me out of the water so I know that the skill is achievable for both sexes. I know I love to sit down for a few hours and work on mastering a 30 second section of music and I find that individual grind very satisfying. My wife thinks I'm a nutjob for this.

I've heard feminists argue that men should take more of the childcare so that women can go straight back to work and continue unbroken their careers.
My experience is that a great many women don't want that. 
Because of hypergamy, generally it makes no financial sense for men to stop work or take on  most of the childcare.

Probably the most relevant paper on this was actually published in the late 90s: \[Angrist and Evans study changes in women's and men's labor market behavior due to having a third child and find that, while both women's participation and wages drop precipitously, by about 20-30%, men's participation and wages don't move at all\] ([https://www.nber.org/papers/w5778](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5778)).  ""

&#x200B;

Discrimination outside of the workplace?  Yes, housecare, childcare and elder care are some of the reasons that women earn less.  That is what mensrights has been saying for decades.   This isn't discrimination!  If I take 2 years off of work, I will most likely earn less than my co-workers.  I really don't understand this logic.  If she is saying that women shouldn't be the ones doing these things, or that government should pay them for it...well, then that is a different argument.  But that is, in no way, discrimination.

Because men and women tend to (not always, but usually) have different interests. This generally leads them to study and pursue different career paths.

As to why careers that men choose pay differently to the ones that women choose, it gets a bit more complicated. The thing is, that these disparities arise due to a variety of different factors, some of which can be influenced, but many which can not.

There are countless articles and people out there claiming different variances in the ""gender pay gap"" and for different reasons (sometimes forgoing that aspect altogether), but rarely ever do these articles or people go into detail about how to address not just the perceived gap, but the underlying factors aside from simply stating ""just pay women more lol"".

These days however, it makes less and less sense (as also detailed in the video above) to primarily stay at home.

One option talked about, which makes sense to me, is that if a couple have a child, each parent can work in a 3/2 system, meaning 3 days of work per week, and 2 days looking after the child and doing household work. These can be staggered so that there will only be a single day where both parents are out of the house, where the child caring duties can be delegated to a daycare.

She takes care of the kids and housework the rest of the time until the kid is given to day care...then when ever the kid gets a fever/gets sick the mother leaves work to take care of the kid...mean while the father gets a promotion on his job because he is putting in more hours than his female coworkers in similar situations.

I want to give an example of choice factors into pay gap. The last factory I worked at (mid-level manager) had a history of excluding women from tool room and maintenance positions. The union eventually got janitorial jobs classified as maintenance which allowed the company to put women into that department without entering them in the apprentice program. An effective wage gap. The mainteneace workers who completed their apprecticeships could move on to other, better paying factories. The women, who were not given the chance to develop any skills, would be considered unskilled labor by other employers and would have to take a pay cut to change jobs. So they 'chose' to work for less pay than other people who had worked in the same field for the same amount of time. 
When I retired the union was still trying to get a woman into the tool room (lucrative skilled trade). A woman who had applied for the job about 15 yeqrs before I started there and been denied. A new plant manager agrred that she had been treated unfairly. She had become a CMM operator, and her position was also made a skilled position and she got a raise to the same pay level as tool room. She had lost years worth of pay by 'chosing' to be a CCM operator instead of working in tool room. 
Your quote from the Harvard study shows that perception of hard work - i.e. putting in long 'continuous' hours is a factor in pay. I can say from personal experience that this is true - the person who looks like he has his nose to the grindstone gets rewarded. I also know from many different examples that 
1. the grindstone guy can be very incompetent and still get  rewarded based on the perception the boss has, and
2. there is a problem when it is assumed that a woman will be the one looking for flexible work schedule. I realizethat the authors of this report fond that to be more common, but I am not referring to their assumptions. More like the widespread assumption it is the woman's role to sacrifice career for family.

Men tend to chose degrees/professions that pay higher than the degrees/professions that women tend to chose.  That's an objective fact.  Therefore men tend to be the higher earner in relationships meaning they tend to be the stay-at-home parent less often.  That's my opinion.

What I mean by this is it's structured so that anything you try to argue, no matter how factual, reasonable, or true, is easily nullified by their logic. The reason is that in their minds, because men are at the top, any evidence we use must be made up to fit a narrative. If a good counter argument fitted with evidence doesn't fit their agenda, they'll simply say men are in charge and that's why the evidence exist. 

Another way they do this is by bringing up historical oppression. Once I was in a feminist thread and they were making all these terrible generalizations about men and how we will do anything we can to oppress women, and how we're pigs and the usual man hating bullshit. So I responded by asking them if they don't see the sexism they're committing by generalizing men this way. In short, their response was basically ""Men have been doing it through the religions they created, so now it's our turn."" This is when I realized arguing with a radical feminist will always be fruitless.

(When women go on work trips they get asked who's taking care of their children unlike men, in divorces moms get the favor for being automarically being a better parent. Why? because society conditioned she has to be good mother over being an earner, if there has to equality such should be encouraged in men while women are getting told to be the earners)
Making it be alright to be the housespouse and that'd be if women are free of those social obstacles to be full-time earns and getting a pay the male equivalent would.

Funny how you can swallow the wage gap as a valid statistic but then are up in arms about working hours.  Look at any country's labour statistics - men work longer hours with more overtime, the percentage of men working full time is higher (more women work part time), men work shift more often (higher pay), etc.  Men do work longer hours.  It is in the same set of statistics that your precious wage gap comes from.

Where do your claims factor into the wage gap?  They're just claims, there's no supporting statistics or backing for them.  To claim that those factors caused the wage gap is ludicrous - try to understand what a 25% pay gap across the entire workforce entails (billions of dollars), and then explain that this gap comes from a handful of women being passed over for promotion.  

The reason the wage gap exists is because women choose to work shorter hours in less demanding and less dangerous jobs, and they take time off work to travel, raise children or just retire early.  We know this because the statistics support it.  The rest of your claims are baseless.",,,5,0,reddit3

You pick your side depending on your political predilection and personal experience, not based on the science (which admittedly is complex and impossible to boil down to talking points anywhere near as effective as the doom and hoax scenario).

Do you recognize the difficult position that men, specifically those who are low on the hierarchy of capital / power, are in due to the overarching structure of patriarchy? 

The poorest drivers of our society, for both men and women, can be argued as side effects of an imbalance in countervailing opinions being taken seriously by those with power from those with less. 

Any structure that lacks self-reflection and criticism will become anemic and sick, ensuring its downfall. 

Men certainly need rights, because the patriarchy is ensuring they sacrifice needlessly in many ways. 

Don’t cry

Don’t show emotion

Don’t ask for help

Don’t show weakness

Don’t be sensitive

Don’t talk about your inner life

Don’t be too affectionate with your male friends

Don’t seek guidance

Don’t admit you were wrong

Don’t admit you don’t know

Found this in the comments page in about five seconds and it's an utterly predictable response.

What's fascinating is the way though they will always make women out to be the victims, there's always a problem with society and men that needs fixing and if it negatively effects women in their heads no matter how small it must be made into an international issue.

I'm not really sure what you mean by ""work they do/their output on an individual basis"" If you are saying that high-end female models are more talented than their male counterparts, that would not be correct. This wage gap (it IS a gap regardless of whether it has anything to do with social prejudice) in high-end modelling is not down to individual contributions, it can be explained by market forces.

In an open market, the rules of supply and demand apply.


High-end female models make about twice as much as their male counterparts because ... women spend twice as much money on clothes than men. 

Male athletes make more money than their female counterparts. If men are three times more likely to watch basketball than women, then high-end male basketball players will earn three times more than their female counterparts (I'm aware it's a bit more complicated than that with other factors such as women who watch male players, I can't think of a perfect example off the top of my head)

I think it was The Economic Naturalist (2007) where I read about this. This isn't ""news"" as such, it's been a well-known fiscal reality for quite some time.

> This is why we need to stop arguing about the pay gap 

We agree here. OF COURSE there is a pay gap! Bill Gates has 50 billion, Oprah Winfrey has 3 billion. In many sectors, women should consider themselves fortunate to make even half of what their male counterparts bring in each month.

> because there will always be some kind of pay gap at a professional level between all sexes.

I think you'd admit that's an exaggeration. I'm not going to bust your balls on that, but there probably is some kind of occupation out there where men and women bring in a salary based on performance and there is 0.1% parity. True value is impressive. I think it's Freakanomics where they look at a large Italian bank where men make 9% more than women and the hours they put in are greater by 9%. 

If you talk to business people outside of monopolies, oligopolies and the luxury goods industry you'll find that profits are often razor thin.  This is why the feminist concept of a patriarchal corporate world where companies pay men ten or twenty percent more than their real worth based on their ideological goal of perpetuating a world where men make the calls and women make the sandwiches, rather than save themselves millions of dollars each year through the simple step of hiring equally competent but testicularly lacking employeer, is so very ridiculous.

Equal doesn't mean forced equal payment, it means equal oppertunity to earn equal pay in relation to what you provide for the company. The reason the equal pay arguments were brought up were because women of equal skill/more were being paid less than people who were not nearly as qualified.

By making themselves out to be the victims, they can always demand more so that they get paid more, receive superior treatment, etc. Thus, even if women, or any other SJW-endorsed racial, gender, or ethnic group is already treated on an equal or even superior footing to the heterosexual white man, they will still call themselves victims for the pure sake of even being treated *even* better, because once they acknowledge that they are treated in a superior way, some of those privileges will have to be rolled back. 

So, the natural strategy for them is to keep on emphasizing their alleged victimhood for as long as possible, and then once this notion becomes so absurd that defending it is no longer possible, claim that the contrasting group they are competing against has *historically* been an oppressor, and that this justifies it now being subjected to inferior treatment, to balance the scales so to speak. This is precisely the reason why there has been so much talk of “white guilt”, “male guilt”, and “the white man’s burden” in recent years—the notion that certain groups are institutionally oppressed has become so absurd that a new line of support must be found to justify their continued and ever-increasing preferential treatment",shydude92,t2_vi41h,12,0,reddit4

Feminists don't want that work, I don't blame them, I don't want that work either, it's just infuriating to hear them spout off about inequality in the work place and the need for diversity in all sectors, when they really only want to have women in the higher paying, cushier jobs that aren't meant to be for men in their eyes. Pure hyperbole but sometimes I can't help but imagine they want us gone from sight, that we'd be better off working the bins and rigs, away from their view.

This gap isn't a thing to be fixed. It's there for a reason. Why hire men for the exact same price of a female model if they don't make as much impact? It's ridiculous. Your impact and your worth should determine how much you get paid imo. I understand that sucks for the men that do this work, but you've got to be a realist.

Another example.

Mandatory Minimum sentencing is sexist against women because with it women do a higher percentage of their sentence. e.g. A man get 8 years in Prison for a crime , he does 4 years with 3 years being the mandatory minimum, which is 50% of his sentence. His wife commits that same crime and she receives 4 years in prison and does 3 years as she only does the mandatory minimum which is 75% of her sentence. SEXISM against women. They ignore the fact she did 1 year less and received 1/2 of the sentence he got, that is feminist math. (btw, these examples are stuff I have seen on papers regarding mandatory minimum).

Another one.

You voice another criticism that I often hear in MRA circles: MRAs spend more time disparaging feminists than they do talking about men's rights.

Unfortunately the feminist movement in its current form is an affront to men's rights. Many feminists use false or misleading statistics like the wage gap to justify implementing laws and policies that explicitly discriminate against males.

When MRAs criticize feminism and feminists, they criticize the political movement and people that want to discriminate against men on the basis of their gender.

To be honest, I’ve always seen my financial independence as a way to ensure that I’m never beholden to men the way that I’ve witnessed some of my family and friends allow themselves to be. 

My sister had a horrible husband who cheated on her while he was in the military and was a terrible alcoholic for 10 years of their marriage, until they lost their eldest daughter and he drank even more and started mixing it with his mood stabilizers. He started acting weird and “cleaning” his gun all the time, which meant he would take it out to the garage and just stare at it really creepily until my sister walked out to make sure he was okay, then he started yelling at her about how it was his fucking house and his fucking money and he can do whatever he wants without her questioning it or making him feel like he’s making her uncomfortable (all while waiving a gun around).

So she decides for her and her kids’ safety to load up in her van and drive down to my parents’ place, determined that “enough is enough”.

Without prospects and with three young kids, my parents take her in, help her pay for the divorce, and continue to support her for about a year. She’s a 34 year old now still living under my parents’ because she is stuck. Because she allowed someone to take care of her financially.

In order to prevent myself from falling into a toxic and abusive relationship, I have and always will pay equal or more so for a relationship. I have had a boyfriend for 4 1/2 years now. I’ve always paid for my drinks, I’m more comfortable with this and it’s much less pressure for me to feel like there’s an unevenness in our relationship. He makes slightly more than I do, but that’s never been any sort of reasoning for why I now think or care for him to be financially responsible for me. I have plenty of money to buy whatever I need and save for whatever I want. Last big gift he got me was a trip to New Orleans. He paid for the plane tickets and I paid for the hotel. We split food and drinks. 

If I’m ever in a severe financial bind, I know he’d help me out or at least offer. I would also do this for him. But it makes me feel uncomfortable accepting money or favors from men. They (not all of them, granted) seem to end up expecting something in return...or there’s always the possibility of that.

And I’m so much more comfortable and fulfilled with my own income and not having to ask permission for the expensive things I enjoy.

Sorry for the long response. Again, I truly appreciate your perspective. I guess I’ve just inadvertently isolated myself people who still think in the same way about it as you do. Many of my friends and their partners operate similarly to my boyfriend and I.

You can see this taken to its extreme in the incel community. They treat women as though they are completely separate beings than they are, and they hold them in a position of simultaneous worship and contempt. There's an inherent lack of understanding that women are human beings as nuanced and complex as they are that is immediately obvious from the way that they talk about women. That is not the same thing as just being attracted to someone and wanting to have sex with them.

That's just the easiest example that I can come up with off the top of my head, but there are many more subtle examples throughout society. Using female bodies as vehicles for selling merchandise (i.e. modeling) is another pretty clear example.",mdemo23,t2_i53yq,-1,0,reddit4

It’s only a gender gap if women are paid less, just like it’s only racism if the privileged race is white. **You never see the PC leftists complain about the NFL being 70% black, in fact,** they boast about it as a shining example of diversity, and this is pretty much the same mechanism at play.

It's just completely made up or maybe one person said it but it doesn't speak for the general public or ideal on how progressives (who support the PC movement) are. You have extremes on both ends especially on the internet but you have a lot more people in the middle.

Lastly I can not solely judge who is oppressed and who is not. There are so many levels to it, in so many fields that no one can truly judge anyone with full understanding however there are definitely people who get shafted or don't have the same opportunities through no fault of their own.

Women are horrible at controlling motor vehicles, but they compensate for this by being more cautious.  They are more likely to fail the practical part of the driving exam than men are.

This was my original statement. I agree wholeheartedly with you on this. How do you get “more female ancestors than male”? 

In your sample, the generation has 60 different fathers, 80 different mothers? This also means 80 different maternal grandfathers and 60 different paternal grandmothers. If you reduce the influence of one gender, you’re also reducing the genetic impact of previous generations.",Tu_stultus_est,t2_6q286,1,0,reddit4

>If you reduce the influence of one gender, you’re also reducing the genetic impact of previous generations.

Yes, that is the implication. The implication is that genes passed on to a male are only passed on 40% of the time, and for females it's 80%, and so, you have twice as many genes that were passed on to females, since they are twice as likely to procreate. All of the other ""potential genetic impact,"" meaning genes that were passed on to men and women who did not procreate, is ""reduced""- that is where ""the reduction in the genetic impact of previous generations"" (as you put it) ends up.",SunRaSquarePants,t2_k8wp9,1,0,reddit4

The next generation would come out as scummy as the current one if we don't first fix how we elect our leaders.

Electoral reform FIRST. General strike until it happens. No more waiting. No more maybes. No more waiting for a messiah. No compromises!!!!!! 

We are the answer. We have the power. We do everything in this country, not the city/state/federal politicians.

Don't forget that we also have two mainstream conservative parties in the U.S.  One is somewhat level-headed (Democrats) and the other is from another goddamned galaxy (Republicans), so I can see how people can say 'both parties are the same' when there really isn't a better alternative.

Voting does matter, and I too hate it when people say 'what's the point?'  But even for the most skeptical of politics I tell them that local/state elections are usually more important than national ones, because they affect you more than what happens in D.C.

clqf68n,t1_clqcbpl,2014-11-02 01:14:47,politics,"> Why isn't gitmo closed?

Obama has tried several times to close Gitmo.  As early as 2009, he wrote an executive order to close it.  Congress specifically passed a rider onto the budget to prevent any federal money going to close Gitmo, and then passed another law to prevent anyone from Gitmo going to the US, and passed another one so the President would have to inform them well in advance before moving anyone out of Gitmo.  All attached a riders to ""must-pass"" legislation, so he couldn't even veto them.

If you want to close Gitmo, Obama isn't the problem, the problem is conservatives in Congress.  And, by the way, this election, you're not voting for Obama, you're voting to see if conservatives in Congress gain or lose influence.

>Why were no bankers prosecuted?

When did Obama promise to ""prosecute bankers""?  

> Why are student loans higher than ever? 

While the Democrats had control of Congress, they changed the law so that no one will have to pay more then 10% of their income to cover the cost of paying back student loans, and so that any loans left after 20 years will be forgiven.    They also took out third-party intermediaries, which was basically just a give-away to banks (under the old system, the federal govenrment promised the loans, but the banks took the profits, with no risk) saving the govnerment about 6 billion dollars a year.

Since the Republicans took control of Congress, they've pushed to increase the interest rates on student loans.  There was a huge fight about it, with Republicans in the House demanding higher interest rates while Democrats in the Senate fought against the idea. 

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/07/09/tempers-run-high-in-congress-over-student-loan-debate

> Immigration?

Democrats in Congress have been fighting for comprehensive immigration reform for years.  Republicans in Congress have consistently stonewalled them.

>Big oil tax loopholes? Corporate welfare?

This is another area where the Democrats have been fighting to get rid of these loopholes, and the Republicans have been fighting to keep them.  In fact, this was one of main the reasons they were unable to compromise on a budget during 2012.

4. If the owners are OK then allow them to provide feedback & modifications (assuming they didn't write the proposal in the first place).

5. Assign who gets to vote and how, party members in contested areas can vote against in some cases if said bill is bad for them and their chances for re-election.

If at the end of each season, baseball experts just added up the stats and numbers and said, ""Well, the Cardinals have the best team, so let's just call off the playoffs this year and declare the Cardinals the World Series champions,"" well, then the Cardinals wouldn't have actually won anything. Even if you know for certain who's going to win, the games still *have* to be played in order for it to mean anything. And the team who thinks they're going to lose, even knows their going to lose, can't give up and say ""Well, we're not playing this series because what's the point?"" because that's not how baseball works! And that's not how elections work. The act of voting, or of ""playing,"" is essential to the very meaning of elections and their outcomes.
Anyway, I like the analogy and it spoke to me, so just wanted to share it with you. Then again, I read books on elections for fun, so maybe we're not motivated by the same ideas. :) ",overitatoverit,t2_iyuoc,3,0,reddit1

Maybe it *is* hopeless and your vote won't swing this election and the bad guys will still win, but it still makes the final totals that much closer; and the closer the election is, the less hopeless it looks and the more it helps encourage people like you to come out and vote *next* time; and maybe that snowballs to the *next* election -- and then things change at long last.

This process is pretty open, even on mainstream news if you are interested enough to see how the sausage is made the data is available if you just look.

As well as the fact that lobbyists are responsible for a majority of the legislation, not just their influence on **how** to vote. The representatives actually spend some 90% of their time begging for money and don't really have time to engage in their actual job as they are busy making sure they keep their job or even read the bills they are voting on. That's another reason why the votes get delegated before hand.

BUT these votes would not have changed much if you just take 2008-2010 as precedence. The Senate had a super majority and yet only a simple majority is required to set the rules, the Democrats could have easily eliminated the filibuster and passed any legislation that they liked, but they didn't.

The argument you hear about that is that they are worried about what the Republicans might do with such a power, and the fact is that they will steamroll anyway. Just look at the Bush tax cuts that Cheney cast the tie breaking vote for should show the extent that they are willing to go to. (The fact that Obama was the one who made these tax cuts permanent without getting anything in return should also tell you something.)

Not only that but this is a fallacious argument, the options were never ""nuclear option"" or nothing. They could have just as easily restored the filibuster to its historic stance where it required someone to actually stand up and physically filibuster rather than allowing the Republican party to unilaterally shut down the entire legislation process. 

The Democrats aren't stupid, they know all these options and weighed them carefully. By allowing the Republicans to shut down the government and legislation process the Democrats get what they really want: appease the corporate donors who keep them in office and play the victim (thus resulting in OPs post).

Take Obama's stance on shutting down Guantanamo, this is a unilateral action that requires no legislation. He could just sign an order and it's done. If you think it's outside his power to accomplish politically it's just not.

If more people vote, each vote matters less.  This is axiomatic.

I think it's much more likely that if people act toward their incentives and stop voting where voting doesn't matter, it can create a system where each vote counts more and we can enter an environment where each vote does count.  In a democratic state, democrats need not vote - their party will win; similarly, republicans need not vote, their party will lose. If enough people stop voting, the value of a single vote will increase enough that a major issue increasing the proportion of poll goers will be able to swing an election.  In my view, the ideal follows incentives, we can increase something's value by decreasing it's supply.  This is an economic view on the value of voting.

Voting for a 3rd party today (at least in any place I've heard about) is counterproductive - your vote doesn't count and it costs you.  Voting for one of the 2 parties now in a state that isn't a swing state is counterproductive - your vote doesn't count and it costs you.

""We now live in two Americas. One—now the minority—functions in a print-based, literate world that can cope with complexity and can separate illusion from truth. The other—the majority—is retreating from a reality-based world into one of false certainty and magic. To this majority—which crosses social class lines, though the poor are overwhelmingly affected—presidential debate and political rhetoric is pitched at a sixth-grade reading level. In this “other America,” serious film and theater, as well as newspapers and books, are being pushed to the margins of society.

In the tradition of Christopher Lasch’s The Culture of Narcissism and Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death, Pulitzer Prize-winner Chris Hedges navigates this culture—attending WWF contests, the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas, and Ivy League graduation ceremonies—to expose an age of terrifying decline and heightened self-delusion.""

http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9354310

Sorry, the full text of the study used to be offered free.  That is capitalism for you.

Congressmen and Senators know what has the votes to pass and what does not before their votes are cast. So do the lobbyist. The charade requires that the American public be presented with lost cause votes in order to foster a sense of choice. This game is played on both the left and the right.

Please read the Princeton University study that I linked. It is all that you should bother yourself with in evaluating the kabuki theater in Congress.

It is very easy to forward the symbolic ""Yea"" on the ""lost cause' issue especially when it reflects the real needs of the American people and promotes your brand. So long as the actual vote has no chance of passage, the lobbyist and wealthy interests it might harm are unperturbed and remain in your pocket.

A party that votes whole heatedly for the ""impossible to pass"" progressive/populist cause, but is nowhere to be seen when that measure appears to have a chance for passage is WORSE than the regressive side. Treachery and deceit make it worse.

Real reform is undermined especially by these ""down to the wire' votes. The system appears to ""work"" if only a few more votes were collected. But the closer the goal appears to get, the longer away it stretches from us as lobbyists bend ears and twist votes.

Thus, we have the 11th hour commentaries: ""I could not vote for this flawed bill as it is not the perfect solution the American people deserve! But we will get the right legislation passed, mark my words."" Again, read the Princeton study.

We cannot keep choosing the lesser evil and expect to make the changes that are needed and warranted to create a sustainable society with a hopeful future. ",novictim,t2_cxbml,-2,0,reddit2

In this day and age information is the single greatest resource in the world with so much power. Because of its power and utility, it's often used as a tool for many things, mainly though its used to present a point or narrative. It is in such great abundance but very often it is hard to not only mine for, but to make sense and come away with something meaningful from the data you have collected. What the OP has done is mined this data and presented it in such a way that is clearly twisted to fit their agenda. Furthermore, they ignore almost all metadata and provide no way of gaining this data in any way unless on your own volition. What I mean by this and why it's a bigger problem that shouldn't be dismissed as laziness, is that he has provided a mound of data very unintuitively which causes a bit of a cognitive overload. I mean there are around 50 bills here and the links he provided do not even take you to the full bill text regardless of the fact that there is a ""read full bill"" hyperlink at the bottom that doesn't take you to the full bill. Are you really going to take the time to not only find the full text of all these bills, but to then read them, and then to even begin to attempt to understand the reasons why it was voted on in one particular way or the other? To actually research all the pork barrel spending that went into each of these bills, then provide reasons why a democrat or republican is voting one way? An example of this can be found buried at the very bottom of this post.

>After today’s markup, GOP members of the Committee expressed their disappointment with the Committee’s failure to address real problems facing voters both at home and overseas. The Committee’s Ranking Republican Vern Ehlers, R-Mich., noted that voter education and military voting impediments should take priority over Lofgren’s measure to reimburse states for existing programs. “There are areas of election reform where there are demonstrated needs that are not being met, and where money is not being committed,” Ehlers stated. “While I appreciate any effort to support states in carrying out their responsibilities to effectively administer federal elections, H.R. 5803 provides a solution to a non-existent problem. Our nation’s local election officials are already taking care of the problems H.R. 5803 pretends to solve.”

While that was technically the case, the reality was that water boarding was considered legal. The executive action clears up the fact that it is indeed illegal.


>What Obama has done with regard to torture is refuse to prosecute those responsible or turn them over to an international court that will.

Considering how Republicans have been screaming bloody murder over Obamacare, I fear what would happen if their leaders were actually punished. Just look at their reaction over Bundy not paying grazing fees.


>But trying to give the Obama administration an ounce of credit for the shameful and literally criminal way in which they have handled torture is just going way too far


Yeah, giving credit to the Obama administration for doing something they actually did is going too far. Let's just say both parties are the same and sit out the next election, like most people did with this one, and hope for the best. Maybe Jesus Christ will return and run for presidency and then all our problems will be solved all at once and we will have a utopia.

>Rest assured, a future administration is going to resume the torture program, and we will have Obama and his complete mishandling of the Bush crimes to thank.

We will also have to thank proud liberals like yourself who are waiting for Jesus Christ to win the presidency and solve our problems all at once rather than doing so on an incremental basis.

“torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;

(2) “severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—

(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;

(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;

(C) **the threat of imminent death**; or

Uzbek agents who came in threatened the inmates. I'd also argue that waterboarding and putting someone in a coffin for two days gives them a threat of imminent death.

(D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality;

Had you come out guns blazing against ""lib-tards,"" that's one thing, but you put out a very solid point. I read of a British intelligence program whose purpose was to manipulate the results of online polls and it hit me how important information and public perception still is to this day. While we all have the ability to research every tidbit of information, we listen more-often to the narrative being provided or what others think. People don't want to be social outcasts, after all. In Ferguson, there were two beliefs based on the same facts. They may have all been right about one thing or another, but the truth is somewhere in the middle.

Your point about the human need for acceptance is good as well. This basic human need is one of the reasons recruiting for a cult is easier than you would think. Humans get lost or frightened and they look for any sense of purpose, direction, and acceptance. I am fascinated by this kind of psychology.

Since this is a ""wall of text"" (which itself is pure opinion), I must apologize in advance since you seem to have such an aversion to it. First of all, facts are hugely overrated. I am not attempting to write a peer-reviewed journal, I am making positive statements in a discussion on an online forum. I'm leaving it up to the person reading it to test the validity of my statements because in reality, I don't really care if you think what I'm saying can't be backed up with facts. Your opinion hardly effects me in any real way(as does my opinion on your life).

Many people on reddit tend to place so much emphasis on facts and sources when in reality neither are rarely ever important enough, or verifiable in any real way, to actually make your point. Usually in arguments, we cling to what we call objectivity for any of a number of reasons. We have been conditioned to value facts over feelings. While constructing an argument with a certain set of facts may seem conducive to a discussion, more often than not your opponent can come up with a different set of facts that seem to support their argument. Which facts are credible or relevant is always in doubt, which makes objective facts anything but solid. Furthermore, if facts were so important, people would be less inclined to make decisions based on emotions and more on fact. The reality is that they don't; humans are naturally risk takers, it's the reasons why things like advertising, the lottery, and opportunity costs exist. 

Secondly, I do not need facts to back my position. I am defending a stance that is making statements based primarily on data that has already been shared, or the lack of transparency and metadata. The only point I really made that may possibly require on the spot verification, is my claim that titles of bills rarely tell the whole picture. I backed this up in my original post by posting one of your beloved sources. 

I guess, you're right. I tend to mistakenly assume people are aware that absolutes and sweeping generalizations are often short-sighted and stupid and so when I do make that kind of statement, it is based in empirical evidence with some hyperbole mixed in to make a stronger statement. 

You think the democratic party is the only party that suffers from fracturing? Are you living under a rock or have you never heard of things like the tea-party, RHINOS, far-right radicals, anything like that? There are monoliths on both sides(Krugman, Chomsky, Maddow, Obama, THIS FUCKING SUBREDDIT, etc) and because this fact is obscure to you is proof that you have no idea what you're talking about. 

>Are you saying I'm in school?

Yes, because complaining about text density when discussing politics and things of that nature is something I associate with children. Perhaps if you were unwilling or found it difficult to read a ""wall of text"" then you should have fucked off right along and not prompted a discussion which has yielded very little substance or relevance to the topic.

But if the Democrats really cared about turning out liberals, they would fight for liberal issues, which they haven't done. I'm not excusing not voting but most liberals who don't vote do so out of *hopelessness*, not *apathy*. I think its elitist to call every liberal who doesn't vote apathetic.

Nader knowingly split the vote because he sees both parties as the same.  He is wrong about that.

Pretending that Nader played no part at all in Bushs election is a denial of democracy.

That number is for a college educated worker 1 year after graduation. 10 years after graduation, it grows to 12%. If we apply those numbers to a $40,000 salary the new grad is taking a loss of $2,000 a year (~3 months of rent for me), and the more experienced employee is taking a loss of $4,800 a year (~7 months of rent for me).

This increased purchasing power could greatly benefit your small business. An increased minimum wage would also save you money. [This study](http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/research/livingwage/sfo_mar03.pdf) found that increasing the pay (from $6.45 to $10) at San Francisco Airport dropped the turnover rate from 95% to 19%! These reductions in turnover would save businesses large amounts in the costs of recruitment and retraining of new staff. [This study from 2010](http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/workingpapers/157-07.pdf) found that raising minimum wage did not cost jobs. 

On the topic of non-small business: [this report](http://nelp.3cdn.net/e555b2e361f8f734f4_sim6btdzo.pdf) shows that 66% of low wage workers are not employed by small businesses but by corporations with at least 100 employees.

Now if the folks in my neighborhood are making an extra $4k per year, there is also a good chance they're going to buy more widgets, or possibly extra widgets. If I can sell more widgets that extra cost can also be reduced or kept as profit.

cnvsbw1,t1_cnvpkzu,2015-01-21 05:27:36,politics,"In the interest of devil's advocacy, I'll respond with the most popular retorts to that argument:


Ultimately, closing down is your last option, because it's not in anyone's interest.  And lets assume that your profit margin is too small to cut (since the assumption is that you can barely afford to stay open).  So let's examine your other option, laying off some employees.  


Some might say that's good, because now your business is operating more efficiently.  If you are able to deliver your product/service with less overhead (employees), your business was not performing as efficiently as possible before the minimum wage change.  Generally, your goal as a business owner is to generate capital and create profit for yourself, not to provide jobs.  Now, for the few people you've had to lay off, it's certainly a loss and they get hosed.  But now the rest of your employees (combined with the rest of the employees who work for every other business effected by the wage hike) have more purchasing power, which increases economic growth, which will stimulate job creation, which will provide (at least some) additional job availability for those who lost their jobs.


Not to mention that this will decrease the amount of public assistance required to provide additional financial support for your employees (and other employees) who were not earning enough to get by.


But there's another option you missed that's not laying off your employees.  Lets say that your business is already operating as efficiently as possible, and you won't be able to deliver your product/service if you lay off employees.  You would first consider raising your prices, because closing down isn't in anyone's interest.  


The general retort to that is twofold, first that raised prices across the board provide an additional burden on the economy (true, though it's at least somewhat offset by increased purchasing power now obtained by low-wage employees).  And second, that raising your prices will damage your competitiveness in the market, and force you out of business anyway.


But to the second point, all of your competitors ALSO have to operate under the new wage law.  Meaning that they will have to make similar decisions about either laying off employees, cutting profit margins, and raising prices. If they are still able to undercut you, and you're unable to compete, you might go out of business.  But that's capitalism working as intended, a company with more efficiency ""winning"" in a competitive market.  And if your company goes out of business, those jobs don't ""disappear"".  Either the company(ies) that drove you out of business, or a new company, will need to absorb your customer base.  Meaning additional jobs are now available at expanding companies or new companies for the employees that previously worked at your company.  In that scenario, you do lose out as the business owner.  But part of the risk of starting a business is that you might not be able to compete with other companies, and ultimately fail.


Also, take into consideration that a higher minimum wage law possibly **reduces** competitive advantages that other companies have over you.  If you manufacture a product in a state with a higher minimum wage law, and your competitor manufactures a product in a state/locality with a lower minimum wage law (and you sell to the same markets), they have a competitive advantage because their overhead (salary) costs are lower.  Increasing the minimum wage law across the board would reduce (or possibly eliminate) their competitive advantage by forcing the competitor to pay their employees as much as you do.

1) nut up and do the work yourself

2) figure out why you aren't making enough money to compensate those spending their time doing your dirty work. 

The issue we run into a lot of times in American culture is that we have somehow developed the idea that workers are indebted to their employers, who are made out to be the most glorious and charitable members of society (yes, hyperbole). In reality, employers are nothing without those working for them and (by extension) buying things from them. It does take more risk to start a business than to join one, but you will be rewarded accordingly (assuming you are successful) with a freedom that most do not have in their profession. 

Your workers are not your slaves. They are not people who owe you anything by default. They are humans who have taken it upon themselves to assist YOUR business desires, and if you cannot at the very least compensate them a with a wage that they can live off of otherwise, then you need to take a look at what the hell your business is actually accomplishing. 

In most cases, employers can more than afford a higher minimum wage. The problem is that employers have gotten hooked on this poverty wage bullshit, and they know that at the end of the day it'll generally require the guy at the top of the totem pole to take a step back and reassess how valuable their business and them as an employer REALLY are in a first - world society with a real standard of living.",jmastaock,t2_fktyb,2,0,reddit3

I looked up the truth a long time ago and while you are correct that Obama discriminates against women in how they are compensated, the same is not true of the private sector. The 22 cent gap you cite is the difference between *all* men and *all* women without factoring part-time vs full-time, career differences or marital/child rearing choices. These are relevant because depending on the type of career a woman is in and the decisions made with regards to taking time off work to raise children, we will see differentials in pay. Obviously your Google skills are good enough to find sources that appeal to your fragile sense of ""intelligence"" but not good enough to simply search ""arguments against the gender pay gap"". Do not fear, because I am here to show you want my inferior Google searches have brought up over the years, and maybe you will take the time to read them with slightly more critical attention than what you give to your own sources.

[This data is from the Census itself.],(http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/people/2013/p14AR.xls) It is important to note that the pay differential among women varies depending on their marital status, which is important because if it was women who were being discriminated against we should expect to see the same levels of discrimination across all marital types. Before you become self-righteous and point out that there is still a pay gap in my data, it is important to remember that this solely accounts for marital status and does not take into account the differences in career choice among millions of women compared to millions of men, or their child rearing preferences.

[In this source, the writer tries to illuminate the reasons for ""gender discrimination"" and why most of it is easily accounted for](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2014/05/19/90039/explaining-the-gender-wage-gap/)

[While I'm not a huge fan of politifact.com, they even refute the claim and undertake some work to highlight the cause of the gender-pay gap.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/)

I had to take out tons of loans, some of them were in my parent's name because I had no credit rating when I first started. I've since paid back the loans they took out for me, all $18,500 of it, in full before I moved out. Still working on mine.

if your product is a product people need, ie, inelastic, then your price increases wont mater.  if your good is highly elastic, and your competitor is required to increase wages as well (ie, burgerking and mc donalds both have to pay their workers the same wages) then both thier cost go up any ways. people may choose to buy other items though, but then you were only making your money by paying people the bare minimum, and it also becomes a question of morality imo.

  is it moral to pay some one such a low wage that they cant support them selves?  people argue that minimum wage jobs were never ment to support family (false btw, the original minimum wage laws were enacted for that very reason), but then do we just thow out the fact that business end up hiring adults specifically because there are shifts or jobs that cant be filled with highschoolers, and maybe college studends in the first place?  some one has to work that lunch shift. Most retailers are open all day, not just  after school hours, and large retailers like walmart and grocery stores do the majority of their stocking and cleaning late at night, not in the middle of the day. Janitors mostly work at night, etc. These are service we need in society, tend to be the most sucky jobs possible, but due to low requirments, people seem ok to pay an unlivable wage for them with the excuse ""work hard and get a better job"". For starters, that assumes there are an infinite number of ""better jobs"" out there for the taking, and it still ignores we need people doing these jobs.

lets also talk a little futurology. many of these low hanging jobs are being replaced by automation, so it reduces demand to supply ratios further. what are we as a society going to do as automation comes for more and more jobs. its going to happen sooner or later. Automation will eliminate tons of jobs that people don't even currently realize are threatened by automation. how many white collar jobs could be replaced by a script or computer program? as  AI, location recognition and object recognition technology becomes better, how many other jobs can be replaced. Were on the cusp of commercializing self driving cars. Any job you can think of that involves a vehicle could now potentially be fully automated.  Truck drivers, they have to take breaks, a self driving truck could do non stop drives. Garbage collection, a self driving garbage truck that can determine where the grabage can is, and using an automated arm, collect the trash. taxis are pretty obvious, but what about people simply not personal cars any more. ride shares and services like uber, but with out the driver. most Cars currently spend a lot of time doing nothing but sitting parked. If instead they could be picking people up and driving them places through advanced logistics, we reduce the number of cars needing to be purchased.  

point is, what are we going to do with our current model of economics, as we Approach the new age of automation. Were we havnt yet reached the point where human labor is mostly eliminated, but dont have enough jobs to support all the workers. perhaps new jobs will come as a result, but they will be higher tech jobs, and probably fewer in number.

Engineers are paid more than teachers because there are less of them and less people who are qualified to be them. Go to college campus if you are really this ignorant about the difference between the career paths. Engineers have to study more, take harder classes, and pursue substantially higher levels of education. The education major is much, much easier to achieve and is far less rigorous. The same holds true for the respective careers. I'm not saying a teacher's job is easy, but I am saying that the skills required to be a teacher are much more common than those required to be an engineer.

Also, whether cultural or not it does not mean a legislative solution is not appropriate. Segregation, academic, and job discrimination was as much a cultural issue as a legislative one (if not more so). But legislation undeniably shifted the cultural practice through penalties and incentives. 

If we look at other countries that went through the same shift we can find legislative models that are quite effective and strengthen society. For example, several nordic countries observed the same sort of cultural biases in their work force. In Sweden, they legislated parental leave and structured it to be completely gender neutral. A family is allotted a certain number of days leave that can be split between either parent in any amount. If the bias was solely cultural, you'd expect the woman to just take the full parental leave allocation.

Just take a look at the statistics of what majors men and women generally choose to study.  You will then see the entire crux of this issue (or non-issue).  More men study in STEM field, finance, business, etc.  Women tend to lean to education, social work, physical therapy, nursing, etc.  The pay for these fields vary greatly, and skew in the direction of men.  What do you propose we do about this?

You can't force women to study certain things, and conversely, men to study certain things.  This is just how things have panned out over the years, and until more women start to major in these more profitable areas, this ""issue"" will persist.  I, along with many, feel this is a non-issue.  If women want to make more than man, they have every opportunity in this country to do so, NOTHING is holding them back.  

This is anecdotal, but I work with many powerful, high-up women, and they are treated no differently and paid no differently.  They have the same opportunity for advancement as men, and it is strictly merit-based.  

One thing I will say that should be done about this is equal maternity/paternity leave.  This should just be the norm everywhere.

> I'm starting to think it's just made up to rally women.

That's a general statement; note ""women"". I mean, it doesn't make sense in any other context, there's no way you meant that the entire ""75 cents to a dollar"" meme was spawned just to give the women in your particular office something to rally around. So, you were using your anecdotal experience in your office to come to a conclusion about a national conversation. That is a huge jump in logic. It is objectively an invalid argument, and I'm using the word ""invalid"" here as it's used in logic, not as a slur. 

WMDs have no place in this discussion. That was a case of skewing **intelligence**, which is not held to the same standards of evidence as statistical analysis and is by definition not transparent. You and I could not look at the original intelligence data and come to different conclusions, because said data was not available and there was only one source for it. There are multiple sources for data concerning the wage gap and you can easily find as much primary data as you want. 

What you are doing here is piling up (bad) reasons why you can't possibly make an informed opinion on the subject, to tacitly excuse yourself from putting forward objectively invalid arguments, e.g. extrapolating anecdotal evidence. It's a common tactic used to excuse inaction or unsupported conclusions because it paints the situation as so muddled that **nobody** can possibly hold a claim to the truth, so who the fuck cares what you say? Not like anyone else can prove they're more correct than you (and if they try, well, that just makes them nerds/loners/losers/fanatics/tryhards who can't see how pathetic their attempts to clarify the situation really are). 

It's bullshit, plain and simple. It's defeatist, self-serving, arrogant, dismissive, lazy, and above all demonstrably untrue. There *are* ways that you can clarify the debate, they *aren't* all irrevocably biased, humans *are* capable of making rational conclusions based on evidence, and it *doesn't* take nearly as much time and energy as you claim it does. In the span of making your last 5 posts (or reading this one) you could have looked up 3 sources, skimmed the arguments, and at least started forming a cogent picture of where both sides are coming from, even if you couldn't say with certainty which has the greater burden of facts backing them up. 

Cut the crap and see your mental block for what it is. Note that you don't have to agree with me to do this. Hell, you don't even know what my opinion on this topic is; it's irrelevant. I'm telling you to not stand on the sidelines, tossing unsupported arguments into the ring and then defending yourself with ""lol it's not possible to do any better anyway."" **That** is more infuriating than any logical argument you could possibly pose.

This doesn't make practical sense to me. No two candidates are equal, so it doesn't make sense to start everyone at the same scale. All candidates have different experience, education, drive, and so forth, and all of that goes in to how much they're offered. Except in the most absolutely robotic cases, there's no way to say two people are performing equally well, and have improved equally well. It just doesn't make sense to try to standardize it. People are unique, they're not just some piece of machinery you can replace with an identical copy. They all have strengths and weaknesses, and those go in to how much money you offer them to work for you.

>If time and performance are barometrics that determine IF they get a raise, then either sex deserving of a raise would be given it at the same time and the same amount.

But performance is virtually never equal. And it's not just past performance. The amount you agree to pay someone also reflects how well you think they're going to perform in the future. If you have to document every last detail that indicates to you that one employee is going to be more valuable in the future, you're going to be there a long time -- and that's time that's not spent building your product or service.

>Oh and educate us on the wasteful ruinous paperwork you keep to save yourself from lawsuits while you are at it, we don't seem to have to deal with all that much as business owners here out west.

See ""emphatically not questioning"", above. There are proposed actions all over this very thread, and if you were to do a cursory google search you'd find plenty more. Now, you can certainly disagree with those actions, or claim that they'd be counter productive, or any of another host of reasonable, thoughtful things...but you cannot sit there, refuse to look up any of this stuff, and then claim that you have any sort of cogent or logical opinion on the topic.

A few more links on the issue:

The “pay gap” is probably the most widely-cited example of supposed disadvantages faced by women today. It is also totally misleading, as it is only a snapshot of average yearly full-time incomes that does not account for overtime (about 90% male), type of work, or other non-discriminatory, voluntary factors.

The Department of Labor recently funded a study that proved this and found the pay gap is caused by choices, not discrimination.

http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf

Women work (44/56)x100=78% as much time as men.  Kind of explains the gap by itself doesn't it?

The 15 Jobs Where Women Earn More Than Men

http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/03/14/jobs-where-women-earn-more-than-men/

women aged between 22 and 29 earn over £10 per hour on average, compared to men their same age who earn just under this amount.

http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/news/young-women-earn-more-than-men--news-800761492

Young women now earn more than men in UK

http://www.womensviewsonnews.org/2011/10/young-women-now-earn-more-than-men-in-uk/

The only chairwoman in the FTSE 100 index of biggest British companies, when asked about government efforts to force companies to make at least 25% of board member to be female said: ""there's no real evidence to suggest women being on a board makes the companies any better – what we're doing here is forcing an experiment.""

This was further supported in the book “Why Men Earn More"" by Warren Farrell, Ph.D., examined 25 career/life choices men and women make (hours, commute times, etc.) that lead to men earning more and women having more balanced lives, and that showed how men in surveys prioritize money while women prioritize flexibility, shorter hours, shorter commutes, less physical risk and other factors conducive to their choice to be primary parents, an option men still largely don’t have. That is why never-married childless women outearn their male counterparts, and female corporate directors now outearn their male counterparts.

http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0752118220071107?feedTy…

Farrell also lists dozens of careers, including fields of science, where women outearn men. Women simply have more options than men to be primary parents, and many of them exercise that option rather than work long, stressful hours. That is why 57% of female graduates of Stanford and Harvard left the workforce within 15 years of entry into the workforce.

http://edition.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/03/15/optout.revolution/

This is an option few men have (try being a single male and telling women on the first date that you want to stay home).

Blaming men for women’s choices is unfair. In fact research shows most men have no problem with their wives outearning them.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23413243

Research also shows most working dads would quit or take a pay cut to spend more time with kids if their spouses could support the family.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/06/13/dads.work/index.html

Research also shows that parents share workloads more when mothers allow men to be primary parents.

I just don't buy it - any discrepancy in pay between men and women can be explained by cultural issues and common gender behaviors, not discrimination. Men are culturally more career focused and see more of their self-worth in their career, therefore they are more likely to demand raises, or change jobs, and take career risks to get ahead. Women often don't value the career aspect of their lives as much as the family/home aspect; they also tend me to far more loyal to their employer and less likely to take risks/make changes seeking new employment.

At the bare minimum there are three major issues at work here- the jobs in the US that correlate the highest pay with the lowest education are almost exclusively dominated by men. Women don't mine. They're not involved in construction. Even technical fields follow a similar pattern- how many women are programmers or otherwise involved in IT? 

But even ignoring that women also simply don't put forth a ""money positive"" attitude. Studies have repeatedly shown that women simply don't know how to negotiate their own wages and salary, and that when women are put in the position of hiring people? Yeah, when give identical qualifications they'd chose men. 

Some of this isn't surprising- women have been a part of the professional workforce in a major way for barely half a century. Men have been negotiating their pay for many times that.

Maybe they face a tiny bit less opportunity at entry level, which means they have slightly less experience seeking more senior jobs, which means they have slightly fewer opportunities for promotion - and it cascades like an avalanche.

Again, I didn't compile these links or create the list, but since I did post it, i see that the onus is on me to defend it. And I will try.

If we look at these links as a whole, there is a definite trend going on that many other studies I have read (but are not linked and im not going to bother since its been said many times) pointed out. That is, women tend to make CHOICES that lead to the supposed pay gap myth. For this, Im going to assume all things equal: education, job title, company, experience, etc. Only difference is gender.

Firstly, men have been shown to actually NEGOTIATE for their salaries more than their female counterparts. I have seen this many times within my own circle of friends. In my circle almost every male negotiated their salary. I did, my brother did, my old roommate, etc and so forth. ""Oh, you're offering me 45K? Fuck you, I want 60""

Of the ladies I hang out with (wife, sis in law, friend's fiance, her old roomie, wife's gf's)...how many negotiated? One. Guess what? The one that negotiated makes more than she would have (who woulda thought?). The reason the others didn't negotiate? They didn't feel comfortable doing that during a job interview.

Blaming this disparity on men or discrimination doesn't seem fair to me. ""Sally didn't negotiate her salary because men oppress her"" doesn't seem to hold water.

But lets go on.

You mention things like CEO's and that there are only 16 females of the 500. Well, have you ever met a CEO? One that isn't a CEO because daddy was CEO and owned the company? Well, I have and they work their asses off. And i mean they put in the hours. They make the cross country moves for the promotion and extra 20K. They sleep in the office. They work the weekends. Then, one day, after several failed marriages and bleeding ulcers...they get that corner office and 20 year old girlfriend.

VERY FEW women (hell, people for that matter) are willing/able to make that commitment. Women are different than men. Not less than men, not worse than men. They are different than men. Many women wont put in the hours, because they value LIFE over MONEY/WORK.

If you have two employees that are qualified for a promotion, who would you promote? The one who works every weekend, 80 hours a week, drives all night to the conference 3 states over and is willing to move to Siberia for a little extra money? Or the one who is a good worker, but only puts in the 40 hours and has to be home by 4 so she can pick up her kid from daycare? Nothing wrong with priorities, hell you gotta have em, but I know who I'm promoting...im promoting the guy who acts like he's my bitch, so that one day hell have a few minions of his own. That's the way it goes, dude. Make-a da worl' go round.

But, every ONCE IN A WHILE, you find a woman who is willing to put the hours in. The one who hires a British nanny to watch her kid so she can work 75 hours a week. The one who forgoes the ""wifely"" duties as it were. The one who doesn't have girls night out. The one who has no idea the part her kid played in the school recital. The one who is a ""ball-buster"" to use the parlance of our times.

What is she doing now?

She sitting in that corner office. Shes telling her husband Bill Clinton to go fuck himself because she was in the room with Obama when Bin Laden was killed. Shes running Yahoo. She is most certainly out earning her husband, who is out there picking the kid up from daycare. And her hubby will be jerking off tonight, because she wont be home since shes working late...AGAIN.

Not too many women are willing to do that. They want to see their kid dress up like a rock for the school play. They want to be there when lilttle johnny gets home from soccer practice. They want a 10 minunte commute and cant leave this town because ""this is where my nana lives"". They want the every-wednesday-mojito-with-the-girls-night.

I ENVY these people. These people know whats important in life. It inst the corner office or the extra car in the garage. It's about family and friends.

I say ""people"" in that last paragraph because there are some men out there with the same values. They aren't the CEO's either. They aren't the highest paid in the company. They aren't getting that corner office or the company Ferrari. They're earning what Susan in the next cubicle is earning because they value the same things.

What about engineering students being hostile or unaccepting of women in the workplace, or the classroom? That might also present a barrier. 

What about the age-old and still-alive idea that women are inherently worse in STEM fields? Might that not create a culture where women don't feel comfortable entering the field?

You are correct.  Maternity leave is not included in the statistic.  It's people actively working.  So those 0's haven't been included.

For the overall statistic, the big difference is in part-time vs. full time, where many more women choose flexible hours.

The number even differs by about 9% among those actively working >35 hours a week.

As far as I can tell, it's really an indication of choice.  Preference for flexibility, most likely.

I don't know how my employer would figure availability at hire, but there was no reason I would not be available and in the end I worked and billed way more hours than he did.  If he had the exact same experience and job description as I did, I would have probably had room to file a complaint.  I don't think my pay was commensurate with my experience at the time, and I think his was.  I would have to find out what the men who worked as developers were paid.  I had confirmed through my manager (a friend) that both me and the other woman hired were grossly underpaid, which I proved at my next position when my salary was doubled with more vacation time and similar benefits.  

> And if your opening statement is true, why aren't these companies simply hiring only women? Why would they hire men at all if men are no more productive and expect higher pay?

I suspect because the discrimination is not based on the facts of who produces and who does a good job at work and who puts in hours, but the perception of this.  I think that male employers really just don't give credit to women where it is due, and this *bias* is the foundation of the wage gap and the fact that women are underrepresented at the top.  We are given less responsibilities, less challenging projects, and we are seen negatively when we are competitive and try to negotiate.  I think there are also companies out there that actively hire women knowing that women can be cheaper.

For what it's worth, the developers at my office were mostly women, and the designers were mostly male, save 1 female.  If all the developers were paid subpar incomes and the designers were paid average incomes, there would be a wage gap - unless you think web developers should make half as much as web designers.  I also heard from my manager that our team kept the whole company afloat (non-dev-work was financed by dev work) probably through our long billable hours and low compensation.  We were typically the last in the office at night.  

Honestly it took me some time to recover from that job, it is draining to be wrung out and overworked hoping that your next review brings you up to the salary you know you deserve.  It was a very expensive lesson.  

I hope you examine whether you may be holding a bias, because every person like you who is in a position to employ is going to think they have a legitimate reason to discriminate based on gender, and that is why this is still a problem.

Not me.

> you mean like the Beaurau of Labor Statistics? My first and third sources?

You're not really getting what I am saying.  The information behind the feminist claim is that women are the people who make the choices over exactly what product to buy.  They are saying that women have the power to which manufacturers and especially advertisers must defer.  If you really wanted to get a good source on this I would expect that private polling by advertising agencies would be where it was located because they are the ones who really want to know who makes decisions of that nature.

The advertising literature I've seen does go on about women making these decisions, but I've not seen much detail on proportions and it might be that they wouldn't want to exactly give away that data because of its cost to get and its value to competitors.

And as I said above you may well be right to say there's no basis to this feminist claim, although there's usually *something* behind it.  I can easily show that it has been a factoid long repeated by feminists and endlessly repeated by other groups.  A moment's work with Google ought to have shown you that already.  But yes, it may still not be true.  However, your figures from the Labor Bureau don't talk about that same thing.

This link for example: http://www.bls.gov/cex/2011/Standard/cucomp.pdf

I get what you're saying. This is the exact claim I want evidence for, because it seems terribly hard to quantify. I don't think you get what *I'm* saying. This is a *judgement claim*, and judgement claims have no room in a discussion involving empirical data.

>advertising agencies would be where it was located because they are the ones who really want to know who makes decisions of that nature.

Ad agencies do not strike me as a reliable source, especially when *who to advertise to* is the information I'm looking for. I want a non-biased source, so that's what I am deferring to the BLS, the agency *who's job it is to collect that data*. We are all aware of how sexist ad agencies can be, so it doesn't strike me as a good place to draw your conclusions from.

Regarding the link you cited, you are correct; I misread a heading, and it is mostly useless as an indicator for the exact information we're bickering about.

>Then I suggest you re-read what you quoted.

Clearly I'm missing something, so instead of being difficult, why not point it out? Being withholding and smug doesn't aid discussion. The two quotes I cited specifically refer to 'vehicles, houses, and monthly expenditures'. 

>but I've not seen much detail on proportions and it might be that they wouldn't want to exactly give away that data because of its cost to get and its value to competitors.

Then that data is *useless*. I'm sorry. I'm giving you hard numbers that contradict your claims, and you're giving me vague halftruths. Come on, man. There's got to be one hard-data study out there that backs you up, because you seem to think there are. Instead of speaking vaguely about 'advertising literature' and mystery sources. Give them to me, because in my searching I haven't found them.

> I can easily show that it has been a factoid long repeated by feminists and endlessly repeated by other groups.

Then show it, dude. That's what I'm asking for. Because so far all I can find are marketing and advertising articles, and those are decidedly *not* feminist.

Regarding your feminist literature link, it is similarly useless. It cites a techcrunch article as its source for that statistic, and that is a source I have already outed as being useless for not providing a source for ITS statistic.

On top of that, there's a difference between 'feminists say this' and 'a feminist said this'. Find me multiple sources of this oft-repeated 80% quote. Because I got to tell you, I'm not finding any. Maybe I'm just bad at googling, but since you can do it easily, why not help me out?

> the agency who's job it is to collect that data

Why on earth would you think that?  Well if they do collect it then can you find where they have that data?  They collect data about which households buy what but I don't see anywhere them making a call as to whether the husband or wife or some mix makes the decision.  It;s just not what they do.

> Clearly I'm missing something, so instead of being difficult, why not point it out?

The Gallop poll says it excludes the day to day household purchases which is (for the most part) just the sort of thing we're discussing.  It also begs the question as to what counts as a personal choice and what is ""household"".  I know my own wife loves to buy stuff for herself and say it's for both of us :)   There's an awful lot of that ""judgment"" going on there by respondents which makes the poll almost as much about ""how good am I at pretending stuff I do for myself is really for others"" as anything about money.

> I'm giving you hard numbers that contradict your claims

Not yet.  You agreed the Labor Bureau source was no good and the Gallop poll excludes way too much.  Did you say you had another source I missed?

Again, I am not going to argue the statistic is true because the source I have is the feminists.  That's a great source for my purposes because it's ""the enemy"" in the conversations I usually have so it's using their own statement to disprove their own claims.... but as to where they get it from....

> there's a difference between 'feminists say this' and 'a feminist said this'

I'm not clear what it is you're trying to get me to prove at this point?  Do you want feminist ""sources"" or do you not?  They won't tell you where THEY got the figure from.

I'm having a hard time getting more feminists saying it than the one I posted.  As I say Gloria Steinem was the earliest I know of, it was in a book she wrote back in the day.  I have seen it around a lot but sometimes the exact way a slogan gets phrased can change, making it hard to find.

efvn70b,t3_ans75u,2019-02-06 16:41:33,politics,"Hello Mr. Edelen and thanks for taking the time to answer questions today.

I think your commitment to avoid PAC money is quite noble, and in line with a vision of our Republic put forth by founders like James Madison (in the Federalist no.10) and Jurists such as Hugo Black (in particular his excellent dissent from Conn Life Insurance V Johnson from 1939).

In that regard, my question is with regards the larger structural issue of the influence of monied groups within the lawmaking process (and how such influence is facilitated by way of corporate personhood vis-a-vie the 14th amendment).  As Justice Black notes, the Constitutional origin of corporate person-hood (and thus the ability to engage in political speech by way of campaign contributions which would come about after citizen united) was a professed ""secret purpose on the part of the authors of the 14th Amendment"", noted only in a court reporter's introduction (and no where else).

>The records of the time can be searched in vain for evidence that this amendment was adopted for the benefit of corporations. It is true [303 U.S. 77, 87]   that in 1882, twelve years after its adoption, and ten years after the Slaughter House Cases, supra, an argument was made in this Court that a journal of the joint Congressional Committee which framed the amendment, secret and undisclosed up to that date, indicated the committee's desire to protect corporations by the use of the word 'person.' 11 Four years later, in 1886, this Court in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 118 U.S. 394 , 6 S.Ct. 1132, decided for the first time that the word 'person' in the amendment did in some instances include corporations. A secret purpose on the part of the members of the committee, even if such be the fact, however, would not be sufficient to justify any such construction. 

In that regard, if it is the case that the influence of money within our political system can be traced to a usurpation of the 14th amendment by corporate forces (which was, in turn, entrenched by way of stare decisis through cases such as buckley v valeo from 1978 along with citizen united from 2010), what can be done to remedy that problem beyond grassroots fundraising and pledges akin to the one you have taken in your race? 

All of that said,  seeing folks like yourself willing to take on those entrenched forces does give me a glimmer of hope and I wish you all the best in your race (and I also apologize for the slightly longer than anticipated question).

The time has come for medicinal marijuana.    This will allow us to generate new revenue from the state and allow us to combat the opioid crisis.  I am happy that there is a bi-partisan consensus on this issue.  I believe that members of a party should decide the outcomes of their own primary elections.

You can't use medical as a means to generate revenue.  What about recreational?  And ranked choice?And if you believe in closed primaries so you support taking federal tax dollars our of it and letting each party pay for their own primary?

NY law:

>The RHA permits abortions when — according to a medical professional’s “reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient’s case” — “the patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.” In other words, women may choose to have an abortion prior to 24 weeks; pregnancies typically range from 38 to 42 weeks. After 24 weeks, such decisions must be made with a determination that there is an “absence of fetal viability” or that the procedure is “necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.” That determination must be made by a “health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized” under state law, “acting within his or her lawful scope of practice.”

Women are effectively a different class explicitly because they earn less than men, or do not have equal distribution amongst industry (for a variety of alleged reasons).

&#x200B;

McConnell does not want the working class to have solidarity. It is that simple. Wealthy women do not suffer such disparities anyway similar to the working class. The wealthy stick together when it counts, which is why they all pay each other via board membership and such. The money sticks together, despite being a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, and accomplishes their goals.

&#x200B;

Workers do *not* stick together because the wealthy stuck together first and use their influence and power to divide us. You can't have women making the same amount because then the next logical step is to have POC making then same amount as white people. And we can't have non-college educated whites making the same as college educated whites because it breaks the working class strata.

Democrats want to legislate equal pay. Very cool. Unfortunately, it's going to be almost impossible to prove someone gets paid less because of their gender. This is because wages are almost equal until the same ages where people have children, so business can and do say that the gap is due to work experience. Men tend to stay in the workforce and women tend to stay home during their prime earning years, thus permanently hobbling their wages.

We can fix this, but it will take a lot more than just saying people should be paid the same.

We need mandatory parental leave - both maternity and paternity. We need universal Pre-K and public daycare options, or business subsidies for onsite daycares.

There may be a pay gap, but it is not “because patriarchy “. Lots of people understand this very clearly. I think Schumer is just pandering to his base. I love how it is acceptable to make quotas and considerations for perceived victim groups but then when things shift there are no protections the other way. An example is a company bragging about having an all women board, and that being awesome, but an all man board, that’s bad. This isn’t legislating towards equality it’s legislating toward superiority of one group over another. “I’m a woman and I’ve gotten paid less than colleagues!” everyone freaks out.

I don’t find any issue with that, but it has a direct impact on growth in industry.  Taking 9-12 months off to focus on your family is not a bad thing, but if I’m a leader, I miss out on the 12 months of visibility with that woman and I watch someone else bring impact instead.

No, it doesn't. I'm a woman in STEM and have consistently made 10-20% less than male colleagues my entire career. At this point, I'm making less than men just coming into the industry. 

People have this misconception that women getting paid less is because of bosses with cartoonishly evil thoughts like ""oh well she's a woman so I can pay her less!"" And I've seen people like you make the argument of ""well if women are paid less why don't companies hire all women."" Because that's not how any of this works in reality. 

Women are assumed to be less capable than men. That's the bias. And that's throughout an entire corporation - not just bosses. For example - QA will work twice as hard to find bugs in code if they're reviewing something by a female dev. And when they do find bugs, it confirms their bias that women are not as reliable as men. Essentially, when women make a mistake, it's never forgotten. If women do something perfectly, it's not seen as outstanding. Because they're digging out of a hole. When I propose solutions, it's met with skepticism until a male dev backs me up. That's the core of how women get paid less.",,,4,0,reddit2

If women could be paid less and do the same amount of work… why wouldn’t the career field be dominated by women, who do the same work for less money, the same way construction is dominated in many places by Mexicans who do the same (or better) work for less money?

Women also try and get more flexible work hours, which comes with less pay at the end of the year no matter the gender. 

I worked in a warehouse, obviously a job dominated by men. They allowed women in if they could pass the strength test. Whole time I was there only 2 women passed the strength test. One of them injured her back lifting something too heavy and got moved to janitorial, the other quit because she couldn’t keep up with the required pace (that some men struggled with) and i experienced the same in construction, the “average” woman isn’t strong enough to do a lot of construction work. I worked construction with one female who was cut out for it, and she was a great worker, but she was not the average woman, I’d consider her top 1% in regards to toughness and strength. It’s not that women aren’t allowed to work those jobs, it’s that they often can’t pass the strength test most jobs require to qualify, at least in my experience.

You’re absolutely right about teachers and nurses needing to pay more, however. But when we look at it, men who make more than women in nursing also tend to work more hours, as men in general average more hours worked per week than women in nearly every industry. Nurses and teachers across the board need more pay, but the federal law “Equal Pay Act of 1963” we’ve literally had equal pay “for equal work” for 58 years and if someone isn’t getting equal pay, they’ve got a nice fancy lawsuit they deserve to cash in on.

Men judge women on their looks moreso than women judge men.  Is it any coincidence that women put more time and energy into their appearance than men do?  On the flipside, women judge men on their career and ability to provide, much more than men judge women for the same. So it shouldn't be any surprise that men are more motivated by money when they choose a career or that it reflects their work habits(working longer hours).  If one gender has a lot more social motivation to seek out money, then should it be a surprise that gender chooses more lucrative positions and works longer hours seeking a promotion, rather than focusing on family life? 

You're putting the cart before the horse.  Those fields aren't higher paid because they're dominated by men.  They're dominated by men because they're higher paid.  Men go where the money is.  Men only make up 7% of nurses, but they make up more than 50% of anesthesiology nurses.  Because anesthesiologists make more money than other nurses. It requires more training/education and the liabilities are higher. So it's a much higher paid field.  So men seek that field.  Also, in your example above, nurses are not underpaid.  They are paid quite well, and in fact are paid better than most positions that don't require more than 2-4 years of college.  Teachers aren't paid great, but they are paid pretty much on par with most careers that require a similar level of education and training, and they do it while getting far more paid time off than most careers(though they do work long hours when they're working). Teaching is also paid by public funds, and public positions are always paid lower.  

Quite simply, when women and men work the same position and the same # of hours and hold the same level of experience and other credentials, the pay gap disappears.  So no, women and men are not being paid differently. Women are simply making different decisions. If 5 men and 5 women both get into corporate accounting and work 70 hours a week, they will both get paid around the same.  Now, if 2 of the 5 women decides she wants to limit her hours because she wants to be a more attentive mother, then what we'll have is 3 of the 5 women making the same on average as the men, and 2 of the 5 women making less, because they CHOSE to focus more on family than career.  Statistically, men actually INCREASE their hours after having a child, because they have the burden of ""provider"" placed on them, and often do it because they have a partner who has decided to cut her hours(if not quit working completely) so she can focus on motherhood.  This is choice.  If anything, the resulting wage disparity impact is due to a LACK of choice by men, than it is a choice by women, because men do not have that choice.  A man that chooses to reduce his hours or quit his job to focus on fatherhood, is viewed very poorly among society, so a man has no choice but to ""man up"" and put more hours in to support the family.  And this isn't true only among people with kids. I worked in a finance department that had 52 people in it. 24 women and 28 men. We went through a transition period where we acquired several companies, and we were required to work crazy hours for a number of years, as we were transitioning as a company.  By the time things settled down, we had 7 women and 47 men in the same department.  We couldn't retain female employees. They couldn't handle the hours.  Even the young ladies who didn't have children. They all preferred a healthier work/life balance.  And I don't blame them really. They're probably more sane for it. But they don't have the social pressure on them to produce and advance. Most of those men who were there originally ended up with nice bonuses and promotions. The few ladies who remained also had nice bonuses and promotions. But you can't just cry sexism when women are not as willing to put in the work as men are. It is an argument that has no merit.  

Something very very compelling in addition here.  Female entrepreneurs make only 80% of male entrepreneurs.  Weird isn't it?  Entrepreneurs aren't subject to biased or sexist hiring practices. They simply make what they make based on the product/service they're selling, so it's entirely dependent on quality of the business and the drive of the business owner to work to make it.  But the women only make 80% of what men do. It matches the wage gap almost exactly.  What researchers have found is that women tend to go into business around things they want or have an interest in, while men go into business around things that make more money.  They'll sell the most boring and unappealing shit, so long as it has money potential.  Women are much less likely to do this, they want to go into business for an altruistic purpose or for a passion they have. They're also less willing to work the hours that it generally takes to turn a business around into the profit making stage.  

So yes, it's all about choice.  Women have the option to make as much money as men they just have to make different choices.  If every feminist screaming that there aren't enough women in STEM, decided to drop the gender studies degree and actually go into STEM, we'd see the wage gap narrow immediately and the female representation in STEM would go up immediately.  But they never do it.  They want more women in STEM, but they want it to be OTHER women, not them.  

BTW, why do you care about the wage gap?  So long as you know that it's about choice, and that you will on average be compensated the same as a man for your choices, what does it matter that some women make a different choice than you and decide to focus on family instead and thus not make as much $? If you want to make more money, make different choices. I'm actually a man who decided I'd had enough of chasing promotions, and chose to remain where I am and turned my focus into being a more involved father, because that's what I care about more. And now I'm being paid less than some of my colleagues who burn the midnight oil.  But I acknowledge that it was MY CHOICE. It's not an unfair choice. There are always compromises in life if you want to seek happiness. Trust me, those men(and some women) who choose to burn the midnight oil, they are not happy. Well, most of them aren't.

h1vxsp3,t1_h17g7zo,2021-06-15 20:00:15,politics,"But why would a business hire a male if they could hire an equally qualified female for 20% less?

Well....because women don't get paid 20% less for the same work.  Women just on average don't do the same work. Even before child-rearing age, the gap starts to grow simply due to the fact that men work more hours.  

In much the same way that women learn from a young age that they're more valued for their appearance than boys/men are and put more effort into their appearance, boys/men learn from a young age that they're more valued for their status and earning ability than girls/women are. So, even from the start, men are more motivated to work more hours and seek out more special skills within their career in order to separate themselves and increase their value among society.  This doesn't start when ""women start having kids"", it simply becomes more prominent when women start having kids.  

And let's think about that for a second.  Even in countries where men are offered comparable paternity leave, the wage gap still persists at that child rearing age.  This is because women CHOOSE to work fewer hours even after coming back from maternity leave. Because they now have something in life they value more than their career(for some not all women). So they choose to work fewer extra hours and take on fewer extra projects, because they're more motivated to be home seeing their child's first step than they are in working extra projects to put themselves out there for a promotion. It's a choice. They could very easily hire care takers and put in just as much time in the office as their male coworkers. But on the average, they don't. Meanwhile, men when they have kids, tend to work MORE hours and take on MORE extra projects, because they're feeling that societal pressure to provide, and that pressure is often coming from their spouse. Don't you think the men would like to spend more time with their family?  Most men HATE having to work themselves to the bone so they can be an underappreciated father who gets blasted for ""not being around enough"" as his sacrifices go unnoticed.  If anything, this whole situation is due to women having a choice and men not having a choice.  Men who choose to focus on family and not push themselves in the workplace to get ahead so they can become better providers, are not looked upon well in society, especially from women.",Turinturambar44,t2_ce2sz002,1,0,reddit2

How come you never question why those female-dominated industries are so low paid to begin with? Is teaching and nursing not vitally important? I'm a programmer, and I'd never claim I have it easier than a nurse. I'd say my job is less important to society than someone who provides medical care. 

And I'm just tired of people refusing to believe women in male-dominated fields make equal pay. We don't. You have to compare similar jobs. You can't compare a Java programmer to a 3rd grade teacher and then say, ""oh, well, it's because women choose to be teachers."" Once you look at only women in STEM, you still see a disparity. Also - women have to overcome a lot just to get into STEM. Many women leave STEM *because* of the sexist treatment. 

>or they take gaps in employment to have and raise kids and thus lose a few years of salary increases and promotion opportunities.

I don't know any women in STEM who take *years* off to have kids. You get a couple weeks, maybe. But at that level men do too. If her job is so low-paying that it makes more sense to quit rather than hire child-care, then she's probably working somewhere where a gap wouldn't matter. 

>This tends to be the Mom because, again, women tend to go into lower-paying industries by choice (also, antiquated gender roles).

Or because those jobs are low-paid because of sexism to begin with.

This is typically a choice that is made among partners of who is going to be the primary ""breadwinner"" and who is going to handle more of the parenting activities.  Both have their pros and cons.  

As far as female-dominated industries having lower pay that is largely due to supply and demand like all salaries.  You will see articles about how when women join male dominated industries the pay decreases.  The same can be said about men joining female dominated industries.  When the supply of labor increases and demand stays the same companies can pay less.",youandislands,t2_aa08moqt,6,0,reddit2

h1712rx,t1_h16zjei,2021-06-09 20:02:49,politics,"Unfortunately, these articles are shit, and it's a major problem with social science.  Statistics is hard enough to do without an agenda; it's trivially easy to engineer the outcome when you have one.  If you really want, I will do a deep dive on the articles and rip them apart.  (And it's likely that you will also roll your eyes and say--*that's* what they measured?  And *that's* how they spun the outcome?)  I've done it over 100 times--it doesn't matter which side of the political debate the article is on.  99% of them are incredibly flawed.  And when they are written responsibly, often the popular media article gets the conclusion wrong.

I'm a bleeding heart liberal.  But I'm also a scientist.  For 8 years of the Obama administration, his Dept of Labor had the following on its website: ""The pay gap for women with advanced degrees, corporate positions, and high paying, high skill jobs is just as real as the gap for workers overall. In a recent study of newly trained doctors, even after considering the effects of specialty, practice setting, work hours and other factors, the gender pay gap was nearly $17,000 in 2008.""

Even in the quote, we get some devious spin:  They switched from talking about percentages to dollar values because they wanted to make the effect seem bigger, even though now we're talking doctor salaries, so this gap is 90 cents on the dollar.  That's still bad, but better than 77 cents.  They link to this study: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0597.

Here is my summary of that study, which is actually an uplifting one about how women change the shape of the workforce in beneficial ways (for all people), and whose conclusion flatly contradicts the way in which the article is being quoted:

The article witnesses an increase in the pay gap between men and women among new physicians, even conditioned on specialty.  This increase occurred while at the same time the percentage of female doctors was increasing, and the percentage of female doctors choosing non-primary care specialties was increasing.  The article was cited (by the department of labor) as evidence that the gender pay gap persists, even conditioned on career choice and subfield choice within a field.  And the authors' preliminary hypothesis was that the gap was due primarily to gender discrimination.

Their conclusion was that the pay gap existed largely because of women's choices, and that the gap was growing because the influx of women was remaking the face of the medical profession.  In other words, when the field was male-dominated, the choices some women wanted to make (like working 30 hours/week as part of a co-op practice) did not exist.  As more women entered, the market dictated that in order to compete for those doctors, practices should offer a wider variety of options for work/life balance.  Moreover, this led to men having choices that didn't exist before, and they also started choosing such career paths, though still at a rate less than their female colleagues.

It is also a reminder that one should listen carefully to dissenting voices.  In this case, the authors had to listen to the dissenting voice inside their head saying ""We thought it was discrimination, but it looks like choice.  And it's a good thing for everyone.  As scientists, we have to abandon our hypothesis if the evidence doesn't support it.""",,,-4,0,reddit2

What I'm saying is that they work fewer hours on average than men do and are less willing than men to work longer hours. This is not a ""bold assumption"", it's a proven statistical fact. Men work on average 5.5 hours more per week than women do. 

It's sad that you don't understand what statistical averages are. Some women work more hours than men do, some men spend more time at home focusing on family or focus on a better work/life balance than women do. But overall, taking the average of all men and all women, men tend to put in more time working in the office and women tend to put in more time focusing on family or a healthier work/life balance.  This is just simple reality. I'm sorry if it bothers you.  The good thing though is that it means that the ""wage gap"" is irrelevant to the individual, because the individual will on average be compensated for her work just as well as a man who does the same work. 

I don't know why people are so reluctant to understand that the wage gap is a result of choices we make, rather than sexist hiring practices. It should be good news, because it should mean that women can be compensated fairly for what they do. But instead many reject statistics and continue to believe the false idea that women are being paid less for the same work.

h17e4yl,t1_h177gj5,2021-06-09 21:31:35,politics,"The first study you link asserts that women ask for raises as much as men, but are less likely to get them.  Of course, the idea that women simply don't ask has been a pervasive of hypothesis for decades.  This data is from 8 years ago, but maybe things already changed by then.  (More likely, these data sets are so noisy and vulnerable to p-hacking that by phrasing the question correctly, one can argue for any reasonable outcome.)

The paper then does a linear regression analysis over some subset of 20-25 variables.  It is well-known that even selecting which subset of ""demographic and workplace variables"" are relevant can lead to findings that appear statistically significant, simply because each subset of variables represents a different possible model, and the # of such models is not taken into account when considering what p-value is statistically significant.  (This study is no exception to that.)

More simply, in the scientific method, one makes a hypothesis ahead of time, sets up a test that hopes to confirm or disprove the hypothesis, and then performs the test.  What happens in papers like this is that one takes a bunch of survey data and then tries to derive from that data a meaningful hypothesis.  Especially when the authors have an agenda, this is nearly guaranteed to produce \*some\* outcome which can then be editorialized.

Naturally, the researchers try inserting or removing different sets of covariates before they perform a regression analysis.  It is nearly always the case that one will happen upon some subset of covariates that make one particular variable appear to deviate from what would expect if there were no effect.  If that effect counters the goal of the study, it is remarkably easy to rationalize that actually one included some confounding covariate, or didn't include some discriminating covariants, so that the analysis should be done again with a different model.

As an example, consider the following:  Men and women were asked whether pay is negotiated in their workplace.  Despite the workplaces involved having roughly equal numbers of men and women, it was found that women more often say that pay is \*not\* negotiated in their workplace.  And this effect is \*bigger\* than the reported advantage that women have in obtaining a raise if they ask for one.

So we are led to believe that:  Most significantly, women believe less often than men \*at the same company\* that pay can be negotiated.  But men and women ask for raises at a similar rate.  And then women are denied raises at a higher rate.

One could try to construct a narrative around this.  For instance, it suggests that, conditioned on believing that pay is negotiated, women actually ask for raises at a \*higher\* rate than men (because--for whatever reason--women often don't believe pay is negotiated at all at a higher frequency than men at the same company).

And then it makes complete sense that raises would be granted at a lower rate, all other things being equal, right?  If I have two equally meritorious populations, but one population asks for raises at a higher rate, I would expect that population to also be denied at a higher rate.

But this sort of opining would be silly.  In reality, the data is far too noisy and the # of covariates far too large to allow the researchers to run roughshod over the data, pulling out whatever hypotheses are convenient for their goals.",,,-4,0,reddit2

These studies routinely start by overturning the previously held views (e.g., ""women don't ask for raises"") because it's all about shaping noise into a narrative.

There is a wage gap between men and women, and I think it's fundamentally unfair.  But the majority of that gap does not exist between men and women in the same vocation at the same level of experience.  So introducing legislation that makes it easier to sue companies for this type of discrimination is not addressing the problem.  (That was my initial point.)

And I don't think demonization is helpful either.  I know it's tempting to say that the patriarchy has structured society to value the work of men, and I'm sure there's some truth to that.  But I think this is largely an economic problem:  It is much harder to measure the value of traditional ""women's"" work vs. traditional ""men's"" work.  The most obvious example is in child-rearing, whose burden is disproportionately placed on women.  (Again, this is not purely for evil or cultural reasons; especially in the first couple years, women are measurably more skilled at it.)  FYI, my wife is a software engineer, a small defense against the impression that I'm just descending into misogynistic tropes.

A psychologist might argue that the value to society of being raised in a loving, nurturing home is (at least) in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per person.  But it takes a long time for that to materialize, and there's no market for it.  A woman can't demand more money or threaten to stop raising her kid.  She can't demonstrate she's a good parent and leave her kid to raise someone else's (who will pay her more).

That doesn't mean it's OK.  But when economic forces are present, society has relatively quickly moved past the latent patriarchy.  The medical profession is a good example.  We need doctors.  Because of gender discrimination, women were historically discouraged from becoming doctors.  Until the 1940s, there were medical schools in the US that simply wouldn't admit women.  Starting in the 1960s, the labor market opened to women, and they poured into medical school. In many countries (e.g., the UK), women in medical school now outnumber men.",,,0,0,reddit2

This bill overturns something that actuality *does* affect non LGBT.

My daughter is still only a baby, but I'm not cool with the idea that a grown man can claim he's transgender and basically force his way into a place that should be private for a 12 year old girl.

It's one thing to be a dad and bring your three year old daughter into the men's room with you. It's another to feel like I have to go into the women's room with her, or bring her in the men's room with me in order to ensure her safety.

I don't care if the chances are 1 in 1,000,000, our children aren't worth the risk.

There are much more sexual predators than there are transgender people, and I feel like this is creates creates a terrible workaround for very bad people.

I apologize to transgender people, and I'm very pro gay marriage, but I don't see me giving much wiggle room on this issue.

I know that people will say that there aren't many cases - but I would also argue that many would-be predators haven't thought of this yet. Until watching a video that explained this bill, I didn't know that there were states and cities that had laws in place to allow transgender people to enter the opposite bathroom. As predators become more aware, I would bet that more take action to exploit it.

Edit: I've got a lot of down votes. I'm not bothered by them, but I think you'll find that I'm not an unreasonable person if you read why I feel the way I do. You don't have agree with me, but I'd appreciate if you'd read my responses. If not, no biggie.

**Edit again:**
I've answered this a few times since all of this began, but I believe the solution should be to more clearly define gender on a way that will allow them to use the opposite restroom and be protected. 

Simply changing the bathroom laws protects transgender people, but it also protects people that want to legally harass others. 

Changing the gender definition would be a real victory for transgender people, because it defines them as a person, not as some weird outlying group with bathroom exceptions. 

The bathroom law is at best a bandaid for transgender rights, and at worst it protects a creeper and allows them to oogling everyone's mom or teenage son.",Devo317,t2_ctmw4,-23,0,reddit3

Prior to the Charlotte ordinance, there prevailed a self-organized peace wherein the matter of transgender bathroom use was governed by benign disregard. 

Transgender activists found things to dislike in this peace. They demanded ""visibility"" and so they agitated for the Charlotte law and in so-doing, irreparably shattered the peace which had prevailed. 

As much as the state government sought to return things to the way they were, they cannot un-ring the bell the Charlotte city government struck. Once the Charlotte law defined a foolish standard in rigid terms, to undo it, the state government was forced by duty to write a sensible standard over the foolish one. 

It's hard to credit the efforts of many supporting the Charlotte ordinance to obfuscate, misrepresent and invert the chain of cause and effect in this mess.

d1rlybd,t1_d1r587j,2016-04-06 02:19:42,politics,"> Simply changing the bathroom laws protects transgender people, but it also protects people that want to legally harass others. 

Take a deep breath and try and forget all the disinformation videos you've seen for just a second.  Other than what you've been told,  What makes you think that any law, anywhere in the country legalizes sexual harassment?  Some dufus in Seattle thought that last month and he decided to walk into a ladies changing area to try and prove it.   For some stupid reason the officials on duty there failed to call the police but the city agency responsible for helping to write the law issued a statement in concert with the police department saying that what he did was in fact a crime.   He should have been arrested for it even though he didn't even touch anyone, and he probably would have been if someone had been smart enough to call the cops.

It's never legal, and in no circumstances would it ever be legal for any person, male or female to enter a bathroom for any prurience sexual purpose.  People who keep yelling that it's not the case are actually the ones causing the problems.  They're the ones who are most likely to cause pervs to actually believe that they can legally do something bad.

You realize I'm sure that there are female pedos right?  There may be less than men, but they absolutely exist.  ~~In fact there are about 10X as many of them as there are transgender people~~ edit bad math, [4-9% of incidents had female aggressors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_child_molesters).  Well women have every right to walk right into a women's room.  If one was gaping at your child and you caught her, would you think to yourself, ""Gee, I guess she has a right to do it, I mean she's a woman and all, so I can't stop it"".   No one would reasonably believe this.

d1rsp4t,t1_d1rlwks,2016-04-06 05:30:43,politics,"You write well.  But you're wrong.

If they wanted to put it back the way it was they could quite easily have limited themselves to the legal language that says that no city may grant rights over and above that which the state itself grants (not that I approve of that language either).  With that done, the so called rigid standard you are assuming would simply have been negated.

However they didn't do that.  They went on to state that transgender people must use the bathroom that appears on their birth certificate with zero consideration given to the fact that people who live there were born all over the place and birth certificate management is fully federalized.  Some states amend them after surgery, some replace them, and some refuse to change them at all, ever.  If it is possible to alter it at all, it is generally only with surgery, surgery that is completely denied to transgender children and is not sought out by the majority of transgender men.  Even for the people who do want it, it takes years, sometimes many years, to even make it to the top of a waiting list let alone figure out how to pay for it.

The law makes no attempt to clarify any of this mess.  However one thing is quite clear.  They are attempting to prevent transgender people from using a bathroom that makes sense for them to use based on the way they socialize and present in daily life.  They aren't trying to restore what you are so eloquently calling *a self-organized peace wherein the matter of transgender bathroom use was governed by benign disregard.*  Their action is completely contemptuous towards transgender people as well as oblivious to their lived realities.  This isn't the duty of any state legislature.

edit: the law is also not just about bathrooms, not remotely.

edit2: it also may just be my opinion, but sensible laws are enforceable ones.  I've never met someone that carries a birth certificate around with them, so I'd have to say that this is pretty much the opposite of sensible law, and as I already described it's not a sensible standard either.

Someone elsewhere on this thread posted about how and where to distinguish between male and female as far as transgender is concerned. By now, it may have happened more than once. 

Personally, I'd feel happiest if they had to have it on their birth certificate. And yes, I'm aware that it can be revised. We're sort of moving off of the original issue, but it's still relevant, so you've got my opinion. 

Basically, if you're committed enough to change your birth certificate, then I'm cool with you using the opposing restroom - from a legal standpoint. 

However, if someone with a beard tries to walk into the women's room, I'm going to stop them and politely say, ""Hey Man, the men's room is over there."" To which, that person would reply, ""I'm actually a woman."" If they don't come across as a total creeper, I'm probably not going to question it. 

From a realistic standpoint, I think transgender people are going to blend in, and they won't be much of an issue. The person you linked would probably walk into the men's room, and I and everyone else wouldn't bat an eye. That's his/her goal after all, isn't it? 

Again, I don't have a problem with transgender people. They aren't the problem, unless they're also a sexual predator. But from a statistical standpoint, IIRC, transgender people are, in general, pretty non-violent.

My problem is with the non transgender guy that goes into the women's room, not to blend in, but to be a creeper. And I could be wrong, but statistically speaking, there are a lot more sexual offenders than there are transgender people.

Part of my concern is for sexual predators, but I also just see a law allowing creepers to abuse it as a loophole. If a man is legally protected to be in a women's restroom (or even a woman in a men's), then they could openly gawk at people. It's not a crime, but it can cause a disturbance and make people feel very violated.

What's to stop a man from going into a women's room and cat calling?

And you're right - I'm not going to check everyone that goes into the restroom.

But I'm not comfortable with my daughter (or any female) being in the restroom and seeing a man come in, then asking him to leave because they're uncomfortable, and him refusing to leave and being legally protected from doing so.

If he was in there and not committing a crime, no one could realistically ask him to leave. The police wouldn't be able to do remove him, and now you have some asshole making transgender people look bad.

It's a non issue currently. In general, people leave each other alone. Changing the laws opens it up to protect people with less than good will.

Edit: I've answered this a few times since all of this began, but I believe the solution should be to more clearly define gender on a way that will allow them to use the opposite restroom and be protected. 

Simply changing the bathroom laws protects transgender people, but it also protects people that want to legally harass others. 

Changing the gender definition would be a real victory for transgender people, because it defines them as a person, not as some weird outlying group with bathroom exceptions.

The person you linked would probably walk into the men's room, and I and everyone else wouldn't bat an eye. That's his/her goal after all, isn't it? 

The issue in this case is with the law, if your employer knows you're trans because you transitioned while working there they're required to not let them use the appropriate restroom, because they're breaking the law. It's less an issue for random public restrooms and more trying to use them in an environment where someone knows you're trans beforehand and can report you.

>My problem is with the non transgender guy that goes into the women's room, not to blend in, but to be a creeper. And I could be wrong, but statistically speaking, there are a lot more sexual offenders than there are transgender people.

Statistically, there's been very few cases of people pretending to be transgender and then assaulting or molesting someone. I'm not saying it's never happened, but if they've gone through the effort to try to pass I can't think of any examples. If they haven't, then no ones going to take their claims of being trans very seriously, and they can still be removed from the bathroom for being disruptive if they're doing anything other than their business.

Honestly I doubt there's a lot of genuine trans people who haven't started transition or done anything who are using other bathrooms. It's a lot of fuss and is going to upset people, and I'd rather hold it or find a unisex / single occupancy one than deal with that most of the time.

>The manager could of course politely ask that person to leave - but they're not committing a crime, so what's the problem? 

Also about this, I believe in most states the manager can ask you to leave for any reason, basically? If you're disrupting or annoying people it doesn't matter. If it was a girl camping out in the women's room and making a fuss they could also be kicked out.",Pharo212,t2_6aw97,7,0,reddit3

Sorry, but the actual issue is that people aren't aware of how grey sex actually is. Cribbing from wikipedia for convenience: ""The number of intersex people depends on the definition used. The Intersex Society of North America suggested that 1 percent of live births exhibit some degree of sexual ambiguity. Between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births are ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including surgery to assign them to a given sex category (i.e., male or female). According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., on the other hand, 1.7 percent of human births are intersex.""

But that's not even the topic at hand. It's really important to differentiate between sex and gender. Let's use the simple definition ""the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex."" So in the picture linked above, we see a person whose biological sex is female but whose gender is male. His genitals or chromosomes will never affect you, so we might as well take his obvious presentation as male at face value. By the same logic, even if you're unsure or skeptical about someone's gender identity it doesn't cost anything to treat them as the gender they choose to present. (Here's a though experiment: Is the above picture obscene? Is it not showing a topless woman?)

The argument about keeping men out of the ladies' room is a nonstarter. There are, statistically speaking, more transgender people than creepers that would pretend to be transgender to get into a bathroom. It's such a ridiculous situation that it's never going to play out that way. If someone's in the restroom making you uncomfortable, just leave. Even if you couldn't force them to go away, no one's forcing anyone to stay. If you're that concerned about protecting your daughter while she's in there, you can watch the door.

OH NO! DANGLY BITS! INAPPROPRIATE!

I'm about to go off on a bit of a tangent here. It sounds like you have some significant discomfort with genitalia and/or nudity. I mean, your mind immediately went to a ""dirty"" restroom when you imagined this situation, and I'm willing to bet that that's more an indication of how you feel about ""dangly bits"" than how you feel about public restrooms. Lots of things can emotionally scar people, but nudity will only do that when society deems the human body to be generally inappropriate and people internalize that. Do you really think that before people started wearing clothes that children were emotionally scarred by seeing other people naked in non-sexual situations? I highly doubt it; everyone was naked, and they were probably more concerned with where they were going to find their next meal. Some kids are raised among nudists. Do you think they're emotionally scarred by that? Probably not. They probably have a much healthier attitude toward the human body than most people, because they don't find it inherently shameful. I'm not saying that everyone needs to become a nudist; my point is that it's only inappropriate if you treat it as such. End tangent.

This kind of legislation is a wedge issue used to rile up the conservative base. It's not a good wedge issue because it's a matter of very little importance to basically everyone other than transgendered people and the super conservatives who feel like their culture is under attack. Most everyone else wouldn't have even thought to bring up this topic, because it's a non-issue; most people don't care, and we don't really have to put forth any special effort for it. I mean, unisex restrooms are a thing, and they're more common than you might think. If those are socially acceptable, then why would anyone care about someone using the ""wrong"" restroom.

One absurdly ineffective thing that was tried was to give people same sex hormones in hopes that it would reinforce their assigned gender.  It failed miserably.  People ended up even more depressed, anxious, and suicidal.  They were still doing this up to the late 70s.

Likewise there is no other medication that can help.  Talk therapy doesn't help, and straight jackets and shock therapy certainly didn't help.  This isn't a new field of medicine.  They've been trying to treat people for this for almost a century.

Honestly, if you asked a whole bunch of transgender people who hadn't yet transitioned, especially older people who have a ton to lose, whether they'd prefer some magic pill or treatment that would make all the feelings go away so their life would continue on its normally charted path, I suspect many if not most would say ""Hell yeah I'll do it"".

Why do I get the feeling that the number of male predators in the UK are still astronomically higher than 64K? BTW, that's the number of ""sex offenders"" which I assume includes some 19 year old women who fooled around with their 15 year old boyfriends. I'm not really worried about them.

I highly doubt it; everyone was naked, and they were probably more concerned with where they were going to find their next meal. Some kids are raised among nudists. Do you think they're emotionally scarred by that? Probably not. They probably have a much healthier attitude toward the human body than most people, because they don't find it inherently shameful. I'm not saying that everyone needs to become a nudist; my point is that it's only inappropriate if you treat it as such. End tangent.

Ah, there it is.  Remember what I said about appropriate places to make statements?  You are, in effect, suggesting that because my children grow up in a society that has a narrowminded viewpoint, and even though there's the potential for scarring and confusion, that it doesn't matter because it's natural!  Fuck your kids well being, society needs to change *today*.

> This kind of legislation is a wedge issue used to rile up the conservative base. It's not a good wedge issue because it's a matter of very little importance to basically everyone other than transgendered people and the super conservatives who feel like their culture is under attack.

Poor source. You've cited a migrant issue source. Let me spell it out for you. From your own source - 19 IDs, 10 (50%) were asylum seekers. The others were believed to be illegals. The problem is a difference of culture, not mixed bathrooms.  

> A lot of prison rapes occur in bathrooms and shower rooms. In fact, on that note, you want to make prisons co-ed as well??

Prison rapes are not a concern here. They're poorly managed. An ideal society requires less prisons, not more. And actually yes, but with stipulation. If the goal of prison is to reform, then we should suit the prison to match the prisoner. Such considerations should be as gender blind as possible.

Yes, she would be safe. Contrary to popular belief, not many men want to rape women. Contrary to popular belief, men know that rape is illegal and men know that if they are caught, they will face some serious jail time for a moment's pleasure. So yes, a woman would be safe in such a locker room. And if she were not, she's in a public space and presumably SOMEONE on duty would be able to respond much quicker than if she had been taken to someone's home. ",WhiteLycan,t2_7q9l3,1,0,reddit3

It's also not illegal (anywhere in the US) for a lesbian woman to enter a women's locker room and just sit there watching people change. What's the difference? Would you try to find someone to legislate against that as well?

>There are undesirable, but noncriminal, activities that can be conducted in the ""wrong"" gendered space that HB2 can prevent.

There are undesirable, but noncriminal, activities that can be conducted in *any* space. I can see how having strangers check you out in the bathroom would be ""undesirable,"" but it's ultimately harmless--hence the non-criminal part. But telling a woman she can't use the women's bathroom because she's the wrong ""kind"" of woman is harmful--much like telling someone they can't use the same restroom as others because of the color of their skin. There's also no evidence that the scenario you're describing even occurs. So, personally, I value protecting some people against real, clear, discrimination over protecting other people from a (not empirically substantiated) fear of being sized up by strangers while they undress.

The great irony in all of this is that most of the support for HB2 comes from the political right, which is supposed to be pro small government. And yet they find themselves advocating a bill that, as you say, makes it the business of the state government to regulate undesirable, but noncriminal, activities that may or may not take place in public bathrooms.",EugeneVDubs,t2_w91vh,18,0,reddit3

O.K., I'll bite. What part of our biology makes a person identify as a woman or a man?

>An ideal society requires less prisons, not more. And actually yes, but with stipulation. If the goal of prison is to reform, then we should suit the prison to match the prisoner. Such considerations should be as gender blind as possible.

Co-ed prisons. True, it's never really been tried, but that's only because the disaster that would result is self-evident. Even the Obama administration, who is pushing this whole universal bathroom concept, hasn't even proposed something so radical.

>Yes, she would be safe. Contrary to popular belief, not many men want to rape women. Contrary to popular belief, men know that rape is illegal and men know that if they are caught, they will face some serious jail time for a moment's pleasure. So yes, a woman would be safe in such a locker room. 

?? That makes zero sense. Men rape **NOW**, even though rape is illegal and there is the fear of serious jail time. 

Look, I know transsexuals dream of a gender neutral world, where anyone can be as gender fluid as they wish. A world of bland sameness where there is no differentiation between anyone. Not only would that be awful, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because you have not just thousands of years of social norms, but hundreds of thousands of years of evolution of our binary . But good luck anyway. I'll just leave you with this:

*'Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder. The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.'*

Migrants are an increasing number of people from OUTSIDE a country entering it. Most notably Europe, where people from Middle Eastern countries are fleeing tyranical regimes into a culture unlike that which they are familiar with that maintains entirely different values and are thus committing crimes which would not be crimes in their old culture. I fully expect more rapes to occur when a culture that permits what we define as rape has refugees that enters our society.

Reading comprehension needs work. The crux of the argument is that by being in a public area, there is a higher probability of nearby strangers being able to help victims. But let's be real here. If you're not going to do something on the off chance that more rapes happen (like, I dunno, letting refugees into the United States) when most people do not go out of their way to rape, you're arguing from the wrong side. Let's remember that unisex bathrooms are a thing in many places in Europe and the only place that I see rapes spiking out the wazoo is Sweden.

>Oh please. This is not even remotely the same as racial segregation. Racial segregation of restrooms was designed specifically to dehumanize and marginalize black people. There was zero justification for it otherwise.

This bill explicitly states that trans people must use that bathroom that corresponds to their gender at birth. NC is going out of its way to tell trans women (who are women) and trans men (who are men) that the state does not view them as such. Hard to get much more dehumanizing and marginalizing than that. There's also zero justification here as well. You'd have to provide some evidence of men pretending to be trans to spy on women/girls. If that evidence exists, I'd love to see it.

Ah, but the idea of a white woman undressing in front of a random black woman was seen as morally abhorrent, a threat to social order, etc. by segregationists who opposed integrated bathrooms. The good news is that they lost that battle, and now people (even people on the wrong side of history with respect to civil rights) see it as totally mundane.

I can appreciate that this would be an awkward position (for everyone involved). I'd encourage you to think about the end result of the alternative. A young (trans) girl is forced to change in front of a whole locker room full of middle school guys. If we're talking emotional or physical danger, I'd argue it's much greater in the latter scenario. Personally, I'm not familiar with any middle/high school where students are forced to undress in front of one another. Locker rooms tend to have private toilet and shower stalls.  Maybe making sure that's the case everywhere would be a good start. That way, in the scenario you describe, any girls (cis or trans) who are uncomfortable with changing in front of their peers don't have to do so.

>They are doing it only to nullify ordinances that have been passed in pro-big-government cities. I'm not a fan of the way it's all gone down, but don't act like it's totally incoherent.

I'm saying that this law is terrible and doesn't address in anyway the hypothetical problems.

If you want to make a law that make little girls feel more comfortable in bathroom, even if I'm wondering how often it's a problem, you should try a law that actually do that. Which mean that the criteria should have nothing to do  with birth certificates but rather focus on how the person look as little girl in bathrooms rarely check birth certificates.

Which would probably lead to huge problems concerning discrimination laws, not even talking about the problems that can happen when enforcing such a law. If everything that interest you is a piece of paper that nobody can see what concern you has absolutely nothing to do with men, women or children feelings. Same goes with the security aspect, you need to prove that first there is a security threat concerning people posing as transgender to commit crimes which I doubt and that this law will act as a deterrent which is impossible given that the numerous potential crimes that can happen in a bathroom all carry much larger sentences. So with this two things in mind this laws is clearly not written to protect men/women/children feelings or security which let us with it being a law aimed at punish the so called ""trannies"" (frankly this word alone is enough to say it all).

No. I'm saying that a white woman undressing in front of a random black woman is the same as her undressing in front of a random trans woman. The whole ""cis men pretending to be trans to see naked women"" thing is a manufactured right-wing talking point.

>Look, if you want to do away with gendered spaces altogether, at least be honest about it. Ask the Charlotte city council to take up that ordinance, if that's what you really want. Let's see how they react.

Nope, not what I really want (not that I'd necessarily oppose it either). What I really want is an end to legislation that specifically targets, and discriminates against, minorities. In this case, trans people. HB2 says to the trans citizens of NC: the government knows your gender better than you do, and if you don't start shitting and showering with the opposite sex you'll be arrested and charged. This is the stand you want to make?

>Or, you know, in a separate area, if they are really that uncomfortable.

While I agree that private spaces should be available in either scenario (if you thought middle school was rough, imagine transitioning during middle school), I just want to reiterate that we're talking about a young girl forced to share a locker room with all boys (my scenario) vs. young girls forced to share a locker room with another young girl they may view as ""different"" (your scenario). Middle school is awkward under the best of circumstances, and I'm not ready to throw the ""transphobic"" label at a 12-year-old who doesn't know any better so, again, giving everyone the opportunity for privacy is important. But I think if you're being reasonable you have to concede that ""one girl alone with 20 boys"" is more potentially dangerous than ""20 girls and one 'different' girl.""

>It did not apply merely to ""public buildings"" in the sense of government-operated buildings, but to all public accommodations, including privately-owned businesses (dictating to those property owners how they can run their businesses).

""Public buildings"" are buildings that are open to the public, including non-members-only businesses (members-only establishments--e.g., country clubs--were not not affected).

Lila is literally a boy with a wig. At age 17, he decided he was a girl and demanded the ""right"" to use the women's bathrooms and showers (unisex facilities weren't good enough). At least Jazz has taken hormones so he doesn't have a males strength or aggression. But Lila hasn't. Are they equal in your eyes?

Birth certificates shouldn't be changed. The sex you were born with is a medical fact, and that should be on record. But that's another issue. I do take issue with the NC law to that extent - bathrooms should be based on your internal plumbing. They weren't intended to be gender affirming stations. If you've had surgery, use the facility that corresponds to your bodily plumbing. Simple. 

>They even want to see them denied healthcare...for a legitimate medical condition that has been studied by physicians for the better part of a 100 years.

When you are in a locker room, no one cares about your professed gender. They care about your sex, and it is obvious in that environment.

I appreciate that you aren't anti-trans altogether. I really mean that sincerely. But the pre-op/post-op distinction is really arbitrary. Most of the current research shows that trans people are aware of their gender from a very young age--puberty at the absolute latest, but usually much earlier than that. So, saying ""we'll discriminate against pre-op trans people but not post-op trans people"" just marginalizes and discriminates a smaller group, but one that (a) is still quite large, and (b) is extremely vulnerable (to depression, suicide, sexual assault, murder, etc.).

I get that you are legitimately concerned about the opportunistic voyeurs. But if you're going to convince me, or anyone who doesn't already agree with you, that the risk they pose is sufficiently great to warrant discrimination against innocent people, you're going to need some really compelling evidence. So far I've seen none.

>Ah, have we reached the ""choose your definition"" portion of the discussion already? Where I refuse to confuse the conversation by calling a hypothetical biological boy a girl, just because he wants me to? And you can call me a bigot and end the conversation? Very well, here we go.

No. I don't think you're a bigot, and I don't think ad hominem attacks get anywhere. I do think that some of the statements you've made in this conversation are bigoted, or at least ignorant, but I can separate the views from the person.

I also get that this is something you care about a lot (hence the good faith discussion we've been having all afternoon), and that you legitimately believe the Charlotte bill would lead to women and girls being harmed. I'm trying to convince you, and anyone else reading this who agrees with you or is on the fence that (a) there's no evidence whatsoever that such harm would occur (or occurs in places where similar policies are in place), and (b) there's *a lot* of harm involved in HB2, both the overt discrimination piece, and the ""forcing especially vulnerable women to use men's bathrooms/locker rooms"" piece.

Look, if you believe there's no such thing as a trans woman, and someone born with a penis is always just a man, or that an expensive, grueling, and dangerous surgery is the only way one can ""become"" ""truly"" trans, I don't know what to say.

I assure you that every single transgender person on earth understands to a high degree of acuity the challenges that they face in life.  You need not remind them of it.  Doing so is doing nothing more than rubbing salt in a perpetually open wound.

Two, cis people pretend to be trans to ""pass"" in bathrooms, but otherwise live as cis people.

>It's not arbitrary to women who have to undress around you.

It should be. A trans woman is a woman, whether she's had gender reassignment surgery or not. If you aren't comfortable changing with a pre-op trans woman, that's certainly your right (just as you have the right to be uncomfortable changing with black women, or gay women). But the onus is then on you to not change in public spaces that are open to all women. You don't get to impose your own criterion for ""woman-ness"" on others. And it *is* an arbitrary criterion--much more arbitrary than the original birth certificate criterion in HB2. You're essentially saying, for example, that poor trans women who can't afford gender reassignment surgery can't ever truly be women.

>I would also certainly encourage any trans child I have to use the solo-change-area option whenever possible - not because I think she's a freak who should be singled out, but because it is polite to not make large numbers of people uncomfortable if you can help it, and politeness goes a long way in making everyone's lives easier.

So we're shooting for separate but equal facilities here? Daughter dear, your existence makes people uncomfortable, so you should hide yourself as much as you can? 

Look, trans women exist. They always have, of course, but more and more will begin to feel comfortable living in the open, as society gradually drops this taboo (just as we have made progress in dropping taboos about race and sexual orientation). Some trans women are extremely feminine. Some aren't. Some have penises. Some don't. Some are high school students, and yes, even middle school students. I get that this is foreign and unfamiliar and confusing to a lot of people. I don't think that initial discomfort makes you a bigot, or a bad person, or any of the things the undergrad privilege-checker set like to yell about. But when that discomfort drives you to discriminate against, or ostracize, or marginalize others who are just trying to live their lives--you're in wrong. You can't hide an entire group of the population in the solo bathroom at the mall and pretend it doesn't exist. You can't deny who they are, and have your government order them to act like they're something else, just because what they are makes you uncomfortable. You're the one that has to change.

As an analogy, similar studies have found increased somatic morbidity, suicide rate, and overall mortality for patients treated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Only someone who is being deliberately obtuse would suggest that the periods in question were periods of enlightenment regarding social acceptance and treatment of transgender people when they were exactly the opposite.  Therefore the social impact simply can't be ignored or brushed away by any reasonable person.

It really shouldn't take a high degree of either empathy or imagination to envision how a person's life becomes exceptionally complicated, and stressful when confronted with systemic hate and discrimination.  I'm dubious of the intentions of people that can't seem to summon that minor effort.  Any minority group of people, subjected to equal amounts of scorn, social stigmatization and disenfranchisement, economic loss, familial loss, friendship loss, job loss, housing discrimination, job discrimination, and persistent, deliberate negation of their very identities by ideologues who for some mysterious reason feel the need to be threatened by them and lash out against them arbitrarily, would feel equally clinically depressed and suicidal.

As to the star article, the predominate idea being communicated is that understanding them is more important and beneficial to all involved than stigmatizing them more than they already have been.  It makes it more difficult to make any progress in helping them as well as helping them to overcome their inclinations to act on their desires, which has the ancillary benefit of helping the people they would harm.

However I don't see it implied that their goal is to normalize it as a behavior nor do I think that it is remotely reasonable to assume that it is some sort of logical next step.  I'm really not worried about it,  nor am I worried about any significant portion of society ever accepting the notion that it is beneficial for small children to have lovers of any age.

As far as denying who they are...well, I think it's obvious that you have that claim backwards. It's regrettable that they're upset by their sex and will go to such lengths to try to make themselves feel okay. But it's not the rest of us who are confused or in denial; it's trans people.

You might be right, but I doubt it. It may seem like it right now, because they are able to ride the gay-rights wave under the ""LGBT"" umbrella. 

But the electorate will soon start to recognize significant differences between trans rights from gay rights; indeed, it has already begun, as the fates of the Houston & Charlotte ordinances show. And they will realize that there are implications of accepting ""trans men are men"" - which they may accept for now as a feel-good, tolerant aphorism that doesn't make any actual difference in their lives - once they see the extremes to which trans activists will attempt to stretch it. 

Gay rights were different because gay people just wanted to be accepted as people. That's a lot lower hurdle to clear, especially since most of the time they *are* just people - you can't tell whether anyone is gay or straight in most settings. Gay-rights activists weren't trying to convince people that ""gay people *are* straight people"" in the disingenuous way trans activists claim ""trans men *are* men.""

My analogy had nothing to do with ""covering up"" per say, but rather the unnecessary act of making a person's life more unbearable just so that you don't have to be trivially inconvenienced.  

There are no problems at all with my analogy.  It is completely consistent.  Both are medical problems.  Both things might ""bother"" a third part who is exposed to it.  In neither case is it socially, morally or ethically appropriate for a third party who isn't directly affected by the problem to cause the people that are affected by it even more distress than already have to deal with.   And in both cases, the ""bother"" that the third party feels can be mitigated by having a shred of empathy and understanding for the harm that their actions cause, as well as becoming just a bit more educated.

Dr. McHugh was chief of the psychiatry department at John Hopkins for an astounding 25 years. You are right, he hasn't practiced in decades. He's been too busy authoring 7 books on psychiatry, in 2001 he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Presidential Council on Bioethics. In 2002, the Catholic Church hired him to help investigate claims of sexual abuse. He's not just a contender, he won the belt long ago.

Unfortunately it doesn't because the authority I'm appealing to is the prevailing medical opinion.  You on the other hand refuse to accept prevailing medical opinion and just call it political.

I'm afraid that is absolutely not the case.  Logical argumentation literally relies on arguments from authority.  It is only fallacious when it is from a non authority.   When you cross the line as a non medical person and harshly derogate how parents and their doctors medically treat their kids by calling it child abuse then you're off in the weeds.  She doesn't look abused to me, in fact she's remarkably happy.  If I said that men should shouldn't have surgery to save them from prostate cancer unless they first consult with a faith healer to see if they can be saved that way instead, then I'd also be off in the weeds to, because  I am not a doctor.  It would be a preposterous suggestion.

Yours was made more preposterous by assuming that kids aren't given therapy.  She was diagnosed at 4 and would likely have spent the next 8-10 years in therapy before they approved cross hormone therapy prior to puberty, then several more years before surgery would be allowed  That isn't child abuse and it's really unfair to cast such a judgment on parents that are doing their best to save their child.

> Should this ""girl"" be allowed to play with other girls and join them in the locker room? 

No, it would be a straw man argument.   There is no such thing as a 5 year old identity that has ever been documented.  I have zero idea what this person's deal is (I'm not a Dr).  It looks like some sort of infantalism fetish, and I would never suggest being permitted to socialize directly with other people's kids.  It gets much more complicated if you extend the question to include whether the person is unsafe around their own kids.  Again, that would be a matter for a Dr and possibly a court to decide.

This is the problem with people's understanding of these non discrimination laws.   The organizations waging war against them lie through their teeth and act like they mean that anyone gets to do anything without question.  They don't.  They also don't mean that you can't question people or situations that appear dodgy, or appeal a higher level of authority (cops).  In fact the city of Seattle clarified exactly this point recently about their own law.

Cat lady, I believe I've already said that there is no such thing as  [insert stupid thing here] identity.  You asked me about a dog so I'm not sure why you needed to ask me about a cat?   Unless her mother was a cat, then she isn't a damn cat.  There is no mental health care specialist that would say any different, at least none I know of.

The number people usually tout about women making 70-80% of men is just taking the average of all women's salaries vs all men's salaries.   It does not account for education, experience, or even industry.

Hence, if more men go into dangerous jobs that pay well like mining and more women go into part time roles as servers the numbers come out saying that women in America only make half as much as men.  

Claudia Goldin, an economics professor from Harvard has largely debunked the wag gap myth through several studies

>Goldin argued that once you account for a number of factors, including taking time off from work and different careers, then there isn't ""tons of evidence that it's true discrimination.""

>Goldin also suggested that the old claim that men are just better at bargaining doesn't contribute much to the gap.

If wear the same white shirt with the cuffs rolled up and my 25 year old khakis, no one bats an eye.  When I get older and my hair turns grey society will look at me as distinguished. Should men and women be paid the same for the same work? Yes. Should women feel like they have to wear makeup and dress a certain way? Hell no. Do they feel pressured to? I think they do.

*""Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.”*

We've also seen exactly this type of complete and total refusal to negotiate and govern by them across the board its the ""reicht wing way or the high way"".. nothing more. Hell McConnell himself in his bad faith efforts to govern.. or rather in his efforts to bring everything to a halt if its not solely to the benefit of his ""in group"" has filibustered his own damn piece of legislation in the process. 

Also, par the course of the projection bit come falsely accusing ones opposition of something ones own side does first so as to ones own wrongdoings/failings wont seem that bad when brought up. It also works as a means to distract away from the actual things being done. At one level you get the types of false assertions you have just made about lack of compromise, and ""child like"" behavior, on the other far of the loonie ledge you get people accusing antifa of the capitol attacks etc. and somewhere in the middle accusations of ""the left"" being to blame for the actions of the GOP, republican politicians, and far reicht religi loons etc.",,,2,0,reddit4

This is a conservative propaganda talking point. You know why? Because discrimination factors into those elements. If an employer prefers to give promotions and raises to men, Thus having them work longer hours while the women spend less time in more junior roles. The end result is that those men are considered to have more “experience.” 

Even if we pretend discrimination doesn’t cause any of those factors, which it does, the truth is even if you account for all factors, including hours worked, there is still a 7% wage gap exists for absolutely no discernible reason.

>Hence, if more men go into dangerous jobs that pay well like mining and 

“Danger pay” is actually a myth, some of the lowest paying jobs in the US are some of the most dangerous. The average McDonalds cashier makes about the same ($8.41) as the top three most lethal career fields in the country (fishing, forestry, agriculture, and hunting, $9.72):

http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=1530


>more women go into part time roles as servers the numbers come out saying that women in America only make half as much as men.

The famous $.77-80 to the dollar wage gap numbers commonly cited are examining full-time workers only.

But yes, if you wanna include part-time workers, it’s worth noting that the gap is much wider and we are women earning far less, and a number of studies have shown that employers prefer to hire men full-time, prefer to hire women part-time. 

I’m not sure what kind of jobs the people making these arguments have worked, but in every job I’ve had, the employer has the greater influence over who works more hours and whether or not they get promoted. This is not always up to the women.

>	Claudia Goldin, an economics professor from Harvard has largely debunked the wag gap myth through several studies

She talks about being missquoted by conservatives. The articles you have quoted are from specific studies she did on subsets of workers, and not her opinion about the overall wage gap.

she believes the gender wage gap exists and is heavily affected by discrimination. Read more of her studies here. 

https://newrepublic.com/article/117550/gender-pay-gap-and-77-cents-claudia-goldin-says-its-real

“Goldin says, discrimination is clearly part of the story. ""There's no question that there is"" discrimination, she said. “We see incredible evidence of it in court cases that reach the front pages.” One such case made news just last month, when 16 women filed a class action lawsuit against Sterling Jewelers, which owns Jared and Kay. The suit alleges, among other things, that women were routinely paid less than similar or less qualified men and denied promotions that would have increased their pay.”

And if you have any remaining doubts, read about this amazing study they did showing subconscious discrimination: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/

“When given the exact same application, changing only the name and gender from a male to a female, the salaries offered to the applicants dropped from $30,238.10 to $26,507.94, a change of 13%.”",darth_hotdog,t2_dt03u,2,0,reddit4

What's wrong with the modern left(and I happen to be a liberal), isn't that they want equality. It's that they misinterpret a statistic to mean inequality when it doesn't.

If women were actually being paid less for the same work as their male coworkers, then I'd agree with you. But that isn't the case.  Yes the wage gap exists, but not for the same work. When women and men work the same career, work the same number of hours, have the same amount of experience, etc, then the wage gap disappears.  The wage gap is simply a comparison of all working men to all working women, it doesn't consider career choice, hours worked, experience levels, etc. Statistically, women will on average achieve the same wages as their male counterparts when they make the same career choices as their male counterparts. And that is equality. What does it matter to you if some woman makes the choice to work fewer hours because she prefers a better work/life balance or another woman drops out of the work force altogether because she wants to be a full time mother? So long as you get treated the same for your choices, it should not matter if SOME women are making different choices than you and as a result lowering that average wage a little bit.

So the problem some have with the ""modern left"" isn't that they want equality, it's that they misrepresent a problem as inequality when it isn't. Too many still think that the wage gap is women getting paid less for the same work. It simply isn't. We all agree corporations are greedy, don't we?  Then why would we choose to believe that these greedy companies preferentially hire similarly qualified men AND PAY THEM MORE MONEY when they could simply hire women for less to do the same work?

There are really only two ways to get rid of the wage gap.  1) Get men and women to stop making different decisions.  This is unlikely to happen, because men and women are inherently different, and even if different choices were 100% due to social norms rather than biology(they're not), it would still take decades of social programming to achieve the necessary social changes required to result in the wage gap disappearing.  Or 2), we can preferentially hire women over similarly qualified men, or artificially boost the wages of women who work less be higher than the wages of men who work those same jobs or hours. But this would in itself be discrimination. So you would be trying to fix a problem that isn't due to discriminatory hiring practices, by implementing discriminatory hiring practices. Unfortunately I believe the white house got rid of the wage gap by doing just this.  Discriminating hiring/compensation practices that favor women. Which is nothing more than surface level and simply for optics, but isn't applicable nation-wide.",Turinturambar44,t2_ce2sz002,1,0,reddit4

The wage gap is a result of personal choice. Women choose less lucrative careers and work fewer hours, while men have been found to be more motivated by compensation when making career decisions. 

What does it matter do you that some women choose to work fewer hours or quit the workforce altogether so they can have a better work/life balance or focus more on family? So long as you are treated the same for your decisions ON AVERAGE as a man making similar decisions to you, it should not matter. 

Being that the wage gap is what it is, the only way to really get rid of it will be to pay women MORE for the same work as men, and to pay them more for less hours. 

Which makes me curious as to how the white house achieved their 1% pay disparity.  Did they inflate wages of the women already working there?

If we want to make their salaries on par with men we can’t expect companies to take on this burden / the government needs to. Then every business will be able to look at employees as the same and put them on the same level field.

And if you do speak on it and someone realizes how little they're paid - it isn't the company's fault, it isn't the low paid employee's fault for bad negotiations, it is the person that had a consensual talk on wages who says they make more who gets shit. 

If anything, one gender gets more college degrees. You'd think it would sway the supposed gap, but then there's also overtime. One gender has been shown to be more likely to work overtime. With that added effort, in a fair society - wouldn't people want that act to be rewarded? List goes on.

h4hqxg1,t1_h43ecis,2021-07-08 16:59:59,politics,"I imagine this all depends on field of work and the demographics of said field. In a more diverse field, it's likely that bias are more allowed to get through, while in a less diverse field biases tend to go in the other direction. 

One example I have, but I used to work for an IT company and I worked in the recruiting department for a while. IT is not a very diverse field. it's 90% men and most of those men are white or asian. We had GPA requirements for entry level positions and we wouldn't accept applicants from what we perceived to be poor colleges(online schools, certain tech schools, etc). Because white or asian men dominated the work force, we actively tried to hire non-white/asian men and we actively tried to hire women. But there just aren't as many of those applicants out there with the credentials. As a result, if you were a white or asian man and met the minimum requirements, you weren't going to get an interview.  You had to overachieve and really have a great resume, i.e. graduate from a good school and have a GPA well above the minimum requirement(3.3), and it would be great if you had other resume boosters as well. And that was just to get an interview, you weren't guaranteed a job. For Non-Asian/white men, so long as they met the mimimum standards, they were pretty much guaranteed an interview unless there was something about their history that was negative. And if they exceeded the minimum requirements, they were nearly guaranteed a job offer.  I once got a guy hired who graduated from a questionable school and had an arrest on his record. My boss would have laughed in my face if I even TRIED to push through a white or asian man with the same. When it came to women, if they met the minimum standards they got an interview and were very likely to get the job. If it was a woman of color(but not Asian), and she met the minimum and was breathing, she was going to get a job offer. As you can imagine, the white and asian new hires came in with much higher credentials than the rest, and as a result were much more likely to be promoted later on, even with promotion practices that had a positive bias towards women and non-asian minorities. So yeah, the white dudes(and asian dudes) who asked for a wage increase were much more likely to get one. And in general they deserved it more too. 

Now let's look at this on the flip side.  Government work is much more diverse than some other fields. As a result, there might be less internal pressure to hire or promote women or non-white men. As a result, some biases may be more likely to get through, where as in IT in my example, the bias was in the other direction. In both examples, white men might be more likely to positively negotiate their salary.

Men have been shown over and over again in study after study to be much more motivated by compensation when making career decisions. Which means men seek out higher paid fields and work longer hours. 

Unless you can change how people make decisions, you cannot negate the wage gap.  Unless you want to do it through artificial means, such as preferential hiring(which will only take you so far if fewer women work in certain fields), or by paying women more for the same work as their male counterparts and also take away overtime pay and other such things. But this would be discrimination. Like actual discrimination, where as the actual wage gap is not tied to discrimination, but rather decision making patterns(which can be influenced both by social norms AND biology).",Turinturambar44,t2_ce2sz002,1,0,reddit4

Below is  bit about R. Lemkin who, at the UN, coined the term 'genocide'. I honestly was so skeptical of all of this until I learned more about the Geneva conventions and read about Genocides in history.

I honestly wish I had never read the UN website on 'Replacement Migration' also.

From: [http://genocidewatch.net/2013/03/14/raphael-lemkin-defines-genocide-2/](http://genocidewatch.net/2013/03/14/raphael-lemkin-defines-genocide-2/)

**Genocide**

Raphael Lemkin in his masterpiece “Axis Rule in Occupied Europe” (1943) invented the term “genocide,”by combining “genos” (race, people) and “cide” (to kill).

**Lemkin defined genocide as follows:**

>***“Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.”***

When Lemkin proposed a treaty against genocide to the United Nations in 1945, he defined it as follows:

>***“The crime of genocide should be recognized therein as a conspiracy to exterminate national, religious or racial groups. The overt acts of such a conspiracy may consist of attacks against life, liberty or property of members of such groups merely because of their affiliation with such groups. The formulation of the crime may be as follows:***  
>  
>***“Whoever, while participating in a conspiracy to destroy a national, racial or religious group, undertakes an attack against life, liberty or property of members of such groups is guilty of the crime of genocide.”***

**The Genocide Convention**

[https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml)

The Genocide Convention adopted by the UN in Paris in 1948 defines genocide without the precursors and persecution that Lemkin noted in his definitions. The Convention defines genocide as follows:

“Article II: In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

* (a) Killing members of the group;
* (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

**“Article III: The following acts shall be punishable:**

* (a) Genocide;
* (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;
* (c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;
* (d) Attempt to commit genocide;
* (e) Complicity in genocide.”

That’s objectively not how any business works in today’s world because shareholders are king and lining the pockets of higher ups is more important than giving underlings a comfortable existence.

As we learned by increased productivity in WFH jobs throughout this pandemic, people naturally want to excel and push industries further. People who enjoy their fields do work without exclusively considering money as the deciding factor. Giving them comfortable wages though allows them to not worry about finances, and allows them to spend more time pursuing their goals at work.

I was a 17 year old kid already being paid less than his less-trained counterparts, and their solution was to “allow” a high schooler to spend more of their free time working for explorative wages. All of that while I was already giving my every Friday night and full Saturday to their business as a junior in high school.

My point was that this business took an exclusively exploitational stance, with very little regard to the actual situations of their employees. When I was able to threaten them with my employment status, they attempted to continue to exploit me under the guise of “Well, you get more hours!” I had an exceptional opportunity to leave that crap job and transition into something more applicable to what I wanted to do as a full time positions, but not many of my coworkers had those same opportunities.

Plenty of them were still being exploited by the business when they finally closed shop during the pandemic. The only thing that surprised me was that they managed to stay alive this long.

Of course. My argument is clearly not that this isn't true, it's that this *shouldn't* be true. That the commodification of labor isn't acceptable, it's a big part of the problem. That we shouldn't measure human societies via numbers we made up (money, in case it's not clear), but by the value placed on human lives, the only thing that should actually matter. By the framework that capitalism is right and just, people's labor is worth as little as it is possible to pay for it. This is a bad way to structure a society, because it leads to situations such as, for example, a mandatory coerced underclass.

>I personally work significantly harder now than I did when I was doing a minimum wage job.

And I believe you. But surely you can recognize that this isn't the norm, right? that effort and earnings do not actually correlate, let alone there being a causal relationship between the two? If so, why would anyone want to manage a dig site, when actually building things is so much more strenuous? Why would people bother owning farms, when just working them is where the value is?

The real correlation to earnings is a die roll. Race, parent's class, country, region. That's not to say there aren't exceptions, please don't mention Oprah as evidence that race and wealth don't correlate, I'm talking about averages, trends.

>In the same way, a single mother struggling working multiple jobs to better support her kids could choose not to.

I already addressed this. **A** single mother can work her ass off at two jobs to provide a more comfortable life for her children. They can't **all** do that, there aren't enough jobs. I'm still not talking about individuals, and this point is still irrelevant.

>I think this is exactly how society works, has always worked, and will continue to work until some unknown point in the future that may never come.

Certainly not while most of the population doesn't want it to change. The biggest obstacle to progress isn't some nebulous enemy, it's people's attitudes and desires. It wouldn't matter that a political and economic elite wants to preserve a status quo that they benefit massively from at the cost of the quality of life of nearly everyone on earth if the majority of the population wasn't complicit, consciously or no. What are they going to do, grow their own crops? assemble their own air conditioners and yachts?

As for ""has always worked,"" your definition of always is very Eurocentric and exclusive. For most of human history, in most societies across the planet, egalitarianism was the norm. Because there was no alternative. It was the development of agriculture, specifically the plow, that allowed a small group of people to gain significant power over others, because everyone needs to eat.

Oh I wasn't claiming that they do, my point was that effort is irrelevant to earnings. That was a response to the mention of ""grueling"" labor. ""Hard"" work isn't necessarily low paying, and low paying work isn't necessarily ""hard.""

> The real correlation to earnings is a die roll. Race, parent's class, country, region.

I *strongly* disagree with the comparison to a die roll in modern America or really any industrialized nation. Obviously chance plays a huge roll, but aside from parental quality (and I distinctly differentiate that from class), you have a strong influence on where you end up. That said, it's obviously more difficult when you have a worse starting position, but what's the solution? Should a parent not be *able* to work hard enough that their children have a better/easier life? Unless you disallow that, you will always have an unequal playing field.

> They can't all do that, there aren't enough jobs.

This isn't actually true. We're a far ways off from full employment. People do *choose* not to take certain jobs, but they exist. There is always more work to be done at least for the near term. With further technological advances, that may change.

> The biggest obstacle to progress isn't some nebulous enemy, it's people's attitudes and desires.

I disagree. It doesn't matter what people do or don't want. There is work that needs to be done to support the quality of life that we all take for granted. It will always need to be done, the only thing that will address this situation is further scientific advances.

> As for ""has always worked,"" your definition of always is very Eurocentric and exclusive. For most of human history,

By ""society"" I was limiting the scope to civilization. I'll grant you that we had thousands of years of misery, death, and subsistence living before that. Things were definitely more ""equal"" but by pretty much any other useful metric worse.

But it *does* have its place. Legislation allowing Native Americans to operate reservations outside of white culture specifically targets Native peoples, and is a good idea.

Could you point to anybody pushing for policy that only affects poor black children and not poor white children? Everybody I follow on the left fights as hard for the white kids in Appalachia as they do the black kids in Chicago, with legislative attempts at correcting both areas of failure. Due to a lot of poor white areas having conservative representation, I don’t have many examples of people on the left with the actual ability to currently enact change in poor white areas like Appalachia, though.

> It all boils down to punishing a race of people and/or rewarding another, based on events none of us were alive for.

Does a “reward” (I wouldn’t use that word when discussing reparations, since, ya know, we’re acknowledging there’s something to give reparations for, so it’s not a reward, but deserved) to one group equal a punishment to a group that doesn’t get it? If black business owners got additional tax help, is that also a punishment to white business owners?

> I'll notice you didn't actually address anything I said either. Where does the line get drawn? How black do you have to be? Does this only apply to black people? What about native American people? What about Irish people? What about Chinese people?

Then you didn’t understand what I wrote. I’ll say it a different way in hopes of it making sense for you this time around.

The concept of reparations identifies that the powers-at-large subjected certain groups to known injustices, and are enacting some form of forgiveness via repayment, in some fashion. Identifying that certain groups were specifically targeted doesn’t invalidate individuals who ended up in these same situations as people who *were* subjected to these disparities. By enacting social programs that help these communities, the effect is that all members of the community can receive its benefit, since a poor white person in Chicago still has access to the programs being run in Chicago.

So, there is no “How X are you?” test for reparations, because reparations are a tool to raise up our fellow man to where they should be. Whether they were directly affected by the injustices (like black Americans who are descendants of slaves) or indirectly (growing up in poverty, food desserts, etc. perpetuated in large part by racial disparities), these social programs would touch everyone who needs them, regardless of skin tone or nationality.

One thing that could cause confusion in your understanding, is my assumption that if reparations were actually to be enacted, that we would also be having an honest discussion about the construction of social safety nets for poverty in general. Given the inextricable connection between racial injustices and poverty in America, reparations and general social programs for the poor go hand in hand.",Techfreak102,t2_jy2j8,2,0,reddit4

Seriously -- this is Capitalism 101.  If you don't understand this, you don't understand anything in a conversation about what is capitalism and what is a socialist economy.

CAPITALISM, that great and marvelous economic system that we THINK we have, only works in a sealed vacuum.  It REQUIRES that **all actors in the system** are *transparent* and *honest*.  

This means that information on pricing, supply, demand, and - yes - wages and salaries are all public information and is known to all parties when going into a transaction.  

Obscuring this information is done so with the intent of price gouging or low-balling in a negotiation, and that is when **capitalism breaks down**.  Capitalism cannot stand under its own weight when agents in the system control information necessary for negotiation.  

In a capitalist economy, you cannot sit on a warehouse full of widgets and say that widget prices are rising 5000% because there are no widgets on the market.  You also cannot offer someone a position of X for $10/hr when everyone knows damn well that the industry average is $20/hr, or that you typically pay $15/hr to other workers in the same position.

Hence, why we are on a down-hill slide in America with a widening wage-gap, aging population with no savings, skyrocketing cost of living, and a lower quality of life on average compared to other advanced nations.

The remaining 42% of cases, where the final wage equals the initial wage offer, was largely driven by women avoiding negotiations 34% of the time.


I still don't think this is enough data to say that women lose from negotiations. If 50% the time they are able go get more money, the other 40% they stay the same, and 9% of the time they lose a little bit of money.

I'd like to see these statistics broken down a bit further. Employee compensation goes beyond starting salary. There are benefits, 401k, and scheduled raises based on performance that this data isn't telling us about. 

Second, I would like to see the statistical outcomes of men who negotiate alongside the statistics of women who do. 


To say that ""women are being punished for negotiating"" when 5/10 of the women that do get more money, 4/10 stay the same, and 1/10 see a reduction doesn't seem right. 

And without seeing statistics on the full compensation package (benefits/raises) people the 4/10 and 1/10, we don't have enough data to make a complete judgement.

Only 3% of around 400,000 alimony recipients are male, according to the 2010 census, up 0.5% since 2000. Recipients claimed $9.2 million in payments in 2013 on their tax returns.

Dads continue to pay child support payments more often and in larger amounts than mothers, according to new statistics on child support providers and payments released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Men account for 85% of those ordered to pay child support.

Even in the rare instance where the mother is ordered to pay child support, courts are not ordering women to pay as much as male providers. Annual child support payments averaged $5,450 from male providers and $3,500 from female providers, nearly 56% less.

It’s 2016. Why are men still paying for women on dates?
More than two-fifths of women say they’re bothered if men expect them to help pay. One single man asks, what’s going on here?

Matthew asks the female audience for their opinion, with the majority of them agreeing that the man should pay.

The woman adds: ""I told him, you know, 'I'm sorry, we're dating. You're the gentleman here. You're supposed to pay'.""

It's actually kind of wild how much people are spending on engagement rings these days. In a recent survey of 12,000 bridges and 1,200 grooms in the U.S. by The Knot, men spend, on average, $5,978, which is up significantly (from $5,095 in 2011).

Here's one that's more easy to digest:

We all work at Walmart.  You, me, and NoLogic over there were all hired together to work the cash registers.  We do THE SAME TASK, regardless of the depth of our skill or the length of our tenure as cashiers at other companies.  

We should all be paid equally.  You should not be seeing a 10% discrepancy in such a position.

Now, let's say you're a beast at customer service and you ring up people faster than anyone else, show up on time, and actually show gumption.  Now you get promoted.

Now you're being paid more for the added responsibility and work.  You are not in the same entry-level cashier position as the others.

At the end of the day, the vast majority of jobs in this country fall into retail and administrative categories.  Most of these positions involve rote tasks.  Differences in skill do not make much difference within the structure of the company or the job role you are actually performing.  In the Walmart example, it would be BS to pay you $5 more an hour because you have managerial call center experience.  Go be a call center manager.  If an employee is not pulling their weight, that employee should be cut.  *That's* business, and that's fair for everyone.

In the world on R&D, programming, and IT, where skill DOES matter, larger companies generally have different levels.  ""Engineer I"", ""Enginneer II"", etc.  These are what set your pay -- and your level of responsibility for when shit goes wrong.  ",savageark,t2_13knq6,1,0,reddit1

The person paying child support has to pay about 17% of their income regardless of what their ex earns. The issue is why does the woman get the kids 85% of the time and the MAN is forced to pay? If the man makes more money as you're claiming wouldn't he be able to provide a better household and support than the less income of the woman? Wouldn't it make more sense that the man get the kids 85% of the time and then have the woman pay her 17%?

Researchers have  found that for men there is no amount of income that the woman in the bottom ten percent in terms of appearance can earn to make men prefer her over women in the top 10 percent. That is, looks really matter to men relative to income. For women though, if the man in the bottom ten percent in terms of looks earns more than $248,500, they will prefer him over the more attractive guy earning $60,000. 

As a man, I can say that we don't give a shit about your grooming. We don't care what color your hair is or nail color is. That's all materialistic. We are physical and more concerned with a woman's body. A nice body supersedes grooming every time. So stop spending money on your nails and start hitting the gym.

Horses are based on skill or job review gender discrimination is zebras... it's illegal if someone can prove it on their individual case they can sue meaning it's less likely to be gender discrimination then some other factor.

You're right, and that's why jobs come with JOB DESCRIPTIONS.

Your skill, if it's significant, can make you valuable enough to be provided with a BROADER job description, or a different one entirely.

It is your JOB DESCRIPTION that defines the JOB you have, and what your pay will be.

It is NOT your skill level.

You can have 15 years working in a call center doing collections.  You will still be doing the same work as everyone else sitting on a phone.  If that pay doesn't suit you, move out of call center positions or seek shift management or training positions, or ask to be promoted to a higher tier agent based on the fact that you perform better.

Nobody's resume looks just like someone else's, but *in general*, skill level can be treated in levels of 'similarness'.  You can have all the skills in the world, but if you don't actually do the work, you're worthless to a company, and by and large, two people will similar skillsets and similar productivity will achieve similar work results.

dcnveus,t1_dcnqy0r,2017-01-20 06:22:35,news,"> What is the medical precedent or reason for the DOD to cover the costs?

Transition care is considered medically necessarily for the patient so thats why. Tricare actually covers some explicitly cosmetic procedures up to a certain point IIRC.

> Is this like an extension of a psychological or psychiatric discovery that mandates the approval of tradition coverage?

Yes, though a letter from a psych is pretty standard to begin with for all transition care.

> Does it cover surgeries or just hormones?

Somebody pointed out to me that the coverage has recently dropped SRS but I know it has covered hormones and to some extent other surgery. I don't have any firsthand experience, I'm just repeating what I've been told in conversation with some other folks.

> Is this the full package or does the DOD pony up part of the cost like insurance?

Only some for surgeries, though from what I hear from vets Tricare doesn't completely cover a lot of surgeries.

Tricare isn't considered very good, in case that isn't clear yet. A lot of vets just get regular insurance because Tricare just doesn't cover them effectively.

> I'm a little speechless, because what would be the difference between a a man or woman wanting to transition, as compared to say, an enlisted woman that is feeling chronically depressed or even suicidal because of her small breasts, 

Well you could consult the DSM V, the most authoritative medical literature for various mental conditions, for the answer. Not only that but when crafting the revisions in the DSM V they were careful in their revisions of gender dysphoria so that it'd still receive medical care. Honestly I've had to answer this a hundred times over and the medical professionals who study, document and even define mental conditions not only do it better than I do but they've got it plastered all over the internet whereas I dont even have a copy-paste ready for whenever I'm asked this, though its sufficient to say that they're different conditions despite their superficial similarities and it'd be unscientific to assume that they share a valid treatment.

> does she qualify then for augmentation therapy?

Tricare does cover breast augmentation last I heard. Not sure how that hypothetical situation would work though given that its an enlisted servicemember but if I had to hazard a guess I'd say that they'd need to see their superior, then get a psych eval.

> Is this a fucking overall federal thing?

I'm not familiar with what health insurance federal employees are offered. You'd be better off asking a mailman or just using Google to find the answer.

> What is the DOD's general policy of adopting the opinions of the medical community as it pertains to, well, everything I just said lol.

Tricare doesn't get much funding so it usually cuts based on what benefits the most but otherwise they'll try to cover most of what is considered medically beneficial since you kind of look like a gigantic arsehole when you try to deny coverage to a veteran.

> Isn't that like in the tens of thousands of dollars?

Veterans benefits are too unstable to really extrapolate over a lifetime reliably. That said it'd depend heavily based on what medical procedures occur. Most MtF folks who have served I've known have a lifetime projection of under $15,000 while for FtM folks its a little higher due to the more invasive nature of the procedures. Couldn't really give a ceiling though since most didn't opt for a hysto. 

That said, some have already foregone Tricare and most others probably will in the future. Tricare's financial costs are low but you pay with paperwork and a notoriously long wait.

> And finally, is this a known thing to the LBGT community and do recruiters use it to recruit people? I think a more poignant question would be: Is this a policy to attract LGBT people into the service?

lolno

I mean, have you read a newspaper to see what the VA is like? There's prisoners across the country getting better healthcare and given the state of prison healthcare its pretty damning. Nobody is signing up for that, plus wages for the enlisted are pretty low. I mean, just go straight to army.com and they'll tell you what they make. It isn't that much, even a lot of teachers in run down school districts make more and that's even after those teachers pay for school supplies for the classroom. Then your recruiter will *always* try to screw you out of enlistment bonuses. They have worse reputation than used car salesmen for a reason.

LGBTQ folks are more likely than average to join the military and there are reasons for that but trans care is not reason. Not only have I not met anybody, not only have I never heard of somebody from a cousin's uncle but I have just plain not seen any indication of a marked increase in interest from any source.

If I were to accept transgenderism as a mental illness, sometimes it's easier, cheaper, and more effective to humor it than to try to ""fix"" it.

Most mental illnesses can't really be humored. They either spiral out of control, or cause harm to either the person in question or the people around them. Paranoia, BPD, and similar are like this. If you play into them, they just get worse. OCD can be like that. Mild cases can be managed by letting the person do their thing, often coupled with therapy to reduce anxiety. Major cases have to be treated to stop the behavior.

Transgenderism, considered as a mental illness, is one that we can't currently treat effectively. I've done a bit of research, and the ""success rate"" for convincing someone they aren't transgender is not good, and it gets worse if you consider relapses, and delayed suicide as ""failure.""

OTOH, gender reassignment surgery actually helps. It may offend your sense of an ordered universe (I'm with you, on that one. The entire concept of ""transgender"" is ridiculous on the face of it. But that doesn't mean it isn't real) but the goal of mental health professionals is not to make the world an orderly place, but to see to the welfare of their patient. 

I don't want to speak for all transgendered people, or frankly for *any* transgender people. But *some* of the ones who have spoken to me on the topic have indicated that they would be more than happy for someone to wave a magic wand, and change their brain to be happy with the body they have, or to be the gender their body is. Gender reassignment is the second choice, made because, unlike magic wands and all current forms of therapy, it *works.* 

(of course, some would not want their brain changed, and consider the surgery to be the first choice. Or don't want the surgery at all, but want some other sort of help that I don't understand. Or they don't want anything at all, and just want to be left alone. There's some opinions, is what I'm trying to say)

So, even if you *do* consider transgenderism a mental illness, this is currently the only way to help the people who have that condition. If it's not a mental illness, but a disorder of some other type, then this is probably the only *possible* way to help them.

What the APA and WHO says are just official agreements on what already has been long established through research. That's how they write their manuals.

Gender dysphoria is not and has really not for a long time been recognized as a mental illness. It is a condition tied to hormones and genetics.

It's widely recognized that the ""cure"" to gender dysphoria is to transition and that has been the case since the 1970s.

Before the 1970s, doctors would primarily try to treat patients with psychotherapy, which long since has proven ineffective, but psychotherapy can help in combination with gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy.

Therefore treating normally functioning transgenders as mentally ill is harmful to their rights to employment, benefits, health care, using public gender specific facilities, etc.

Language works precisely because it has rules that everyone can learn and apply. That breaks down when usage becomes too idiosyncratic because your friends might understand what's going on but no one else does. 

For example: I was watching a video of a panel discussion. Then, when I went to read the comments I quickly became confused because people who were involved were referring to someone with a feminine name and I couldn't figure out who she was. Ultimately, someone else in the comment chain admitted to the same issue. It turns out the woman in question was bald, had facial hair and was wearing a man's suit.

The question is, at what point does an individual's desire to avoid reading about herself with pronouns she feels are incorrect trump the need for a functional grammar?

Gender dysphoria may *cause* depression due to for example disgust at one's own body or due to external influences, like rejection or harassment, but gender dysphoria *isn't* depression, because not every sufferer gets depressed, and you cannot cure gender dysphoria by removing the depression with anti-depressants.

This is incorrect.

There is only little correlation between the need for psychotherapy and gender dysphoria. Some need no therapy, they just need to transition. But I would agree that the treatment does start in the psychotherapist's office.

There is however a very high correlation between gender dysphoria and the need for psychotherapy, when they grow up in unsupportive environments, because there is an alarmingly high rate of PTSD and suicide among such sufferers.

Why? If I get a disability pension from my job, nothing is stopping me from getting work at another job. Why should this be different? The LAPD is an employer like any other and a disability pension is part of the deal. We don't complain about vets getting disability payments from the government. 

>Why would you even need disability if you are capable of working full time?

Because the point of the disability pension is not to compensate you for being *unable to work*. It is to compensate people for service-related disabilities. Having one eye is a disability. Have you even read the LAFPP website? ""After five years, members found to be no longer disabled have their pensions reduced to 30% of Final Average Salary.""

Police officers and firefighters in San Jose, California, are rushing to join a program that lets them claim disability and retire in their 30s and 40s -- and that allows them to get tax-free pensions while taking new jobs elsewhere.

The benefit also allows retired police and fire employees in California’s third-largest city to change their pensions to claim the tax break.

“It’s certainly double-dipping,” said Mayor Chuck Reed, 64. “Disability retirement should be for people who are seriously injured and can’t work. Those people obviously can still work and apparently weren’t seriously injured.”

A soldier on active duty has almost no financial hardship, besides what he brings upon him/her self. Look up ""basic allowance for housing"". That's untaxed money the government, just gives out to families to live. 

I explained that to lead into this. The kind of disability he is receiving is payment for his injuries. Something that is insured and prepared for. The police don't provide for their cops like the military does for their soldiers. That's partly why formor military members who reenlist can't collect military pay and disability and it's a rare example your trying to push for. 

If the police departments paid and cared for the cops like soldiers are. Then collecting on your disability wouldn't be kosher. However cops don't and basic living necessities are on their own to deal with. It is indeed cheaper for the LAPD to pay him that money than to give him his job back.

At the time of the awarding. They probably didn't know if he could perform his job or not. If he went back out there and hit a civilian because of his injures, the money going out would be a hell of a lot more than what he would get in disability. That's a risk, pay him a sum of money over years or pay a really large amount of money and terrible PR when he messes up?

If his disability is not workers compensation, then for the new department to say no. It would be discrimination and they would be breaking the law, but by all means, if it is workers compensation, take it from him. That shit is only temporary while you can't work.

Honestly if you have a problem with this guy. You'd hate the VA system. So many people getting disability benefits they don't deserve, the payout they give makes this guys actual injury look like chump change.

I would not be opposed to the payment if it was solely based on the injury and not the salary of the person injured. I think now it is called a disability payment b/c of bad wording in the laws. I am for full information. Call the payment what it is. The payment was initially based on the traditional notion of a disability payment. The LAPD assumed that no one would hire a one eyed cop. When that assumption changes the payment should change.

Basically I think the disability board should reduce payments when the payments are based on faulty assumptions.

I'm not against employee benefits idiot, I never said that dumbass.  Why don't you do the research and see how it is before you open up your big dumb mouth.  

""the self-employed worker, who must pay $10,500 per year for social security and medicare, can expect to retire at the age of 66 with a social security benefit of $20,144 per year. The government worker, who must pay $7,000 per year for their pension, can expect to retire at the age of 60 with a pension of $46,666 per year. The total value of these respective retirement benefits, based on a life-span of 80, is $282,016 for the self-employed worker, and $933,324 for the government worker.""

But I'm sure that's not good enough for you, so mythical and all.  

Here is a state paid nurse who worked in a prison:

The highest-paid nurse in the seven years was Lina Manglicmot, who worked at a state prison in Soledad, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of San Francisco. She collected $1.7 million from 2005 through 2011, including $1 million in overtime, the data show. Manglicmot declined to comment.

But hey, who cares, because even if you vote shit like this happens:

A state court judge has barred the city of San Jose, California, from imposing voter-approved pension cuts on current municipal workers in a ruling with implications for cash-strapped local governments across the United States.

http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/24/us-usa-pensions-california-idUSBRE9BN02L20131224

And don't forget this guy:

The highest-earning employee on state payroll in 2010, according to Controller John Chiang's updated database, was the head parole psychiatrist within the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He or she made $838,706 last year.

Now I know that is their salary, but some of these state employees are retiring with 90% of their salary as a pension.  Oh yea, don't forget this guy:

That would be Dr. Jerry Rohlfing, a prison doctor who “has a history of mental illness” and whose treatment has been judged “substandard”. He’s currently working in the medical records office at the High Desert State Prison in Susanville, because supervisors don’t trust him to see patients.

In 2010, the good Dr. Rohlfing received payments from the state totaling over $777,000, which includes his base pay of $236,000 plus two years’ back pay resulting from a successful appeal of his termination.

And he's still on the payroll.  So if you think that is ok, you must not live in California.  Stop acting like I don't believe in employee benefits, you say that hoping I will cower, because no one wants to be labeled that.  I have no argument against employee benefits, jerk off.

No, I said that once.  In my first post.  I then have responded numerous times explaining that I know now what your position is, and that I agree you are not disagreeing just to disagree.  I responded in my very last post even saying your opinion is not completely crazy, even though most of this thread has been able to easily counter it with why it isn't really well founded.

> Once again, you misunderstood my comment about Facebook and Twitter. You didn't look at the context and started this. Jesus, so done with you. 

So then what did you mean by it?  What other purpose could there be to say it?  You keep saying that I misunderstood the comment, but yet even though my entire history of posts to you have no other point other than this, you have not expanded on it, you haven't explained why it isn't a straw man attack, or why people being on facebook and twitter have anything to do with how much more informed they are about this particular issue.

I'm leaning more towards being young than English as a second language, personally.  Your English seems fine.

Oh and just so you know... Even IF this was a government issued disability, which it's not.  People who are on disability can still work, with restrictions.  People who are considered ""unemployable"" also can work, with restrictions.  Those restrictions, which include salary level, vary depending on why are you considered ""unemployable"".

Want to know the type of person who can be termed ""unemployable"" and work without any income restrictions at all, still receiving their disability checks?  The blind.

I'm not saying this guy is considered legally blind, there are a lot of things to consider when you are deemed that.  My grandfather is legally blind, even though he still can see well enough to read.

All that though is moot, for two reasons.  One.  I never disagreed with you about that, I disagreed with your straw man argument against the rest of this thread, by saying you were right because you didn't spend your time on facebook and twitter.

And two, he's not on disability.  He won a lawsuit that allowed him access to a disability pension, from an organization who was stating he was disabled, even though he didn't agree with them.",bsoder,t2_24m5s,1,0,reddit3

That was the comment before I said this:

""Yea, well, I guess it's just getting over on the man. So who cares if it screws over the whole fucking state? It's like people are too busy looking at Facebook and Twitter all the time, no body thinks to look in the mirror.""

If you can try to reach inside that pea sized brain of yours, can you see the context of my response as being not an argument at all?  Can you see it is a social commentary on people being so distracted by social media, material things, fluff, etc., that they are not paying attention to what is going on around them?  Or rather, they don't realize how they are screwing themselves in terms of being a tax payer?  That is not an argument, more an observation of how things seem to be today.  You are looking for an argument based on a comment that had nothing to do with you, or any straw man.  Perhaps I overestimated my audience with that comment.  But regardless, I don't care if the blind are working, I don't recall having a problem with that.  It's not state issued disability, so your diatribe is not necessary.  So whatever you got out of my Facebook and Twitter comment was misunderstood.  Clearly it was.  I am ready to move on.  If there is any other minutiae you don't understand, I'm sorry.

The payment he is getting is strictly for his injury and nothing else. It's the same kinda payment vets get when they are disabled in the line of duty. No one ever sees thoes payment numbers tho because it gets tossed into the VA budget as a whole and no one wants to touch that beast. State and local workers numbers are more publicly visible because they arnt so big.

If they classed him disabled and unable to work. Then they could hang him out to dry for doing the same job, but they would have to pay him more.

They can't because they gave him less benefits and said he could still work and government can't tell you which job you can or cannot have based on a disability. Big violation of rights if they do.

Also, in the small amount of research I've done, the salaries reported are grossly under reported.  That means the projections for funding the future pensions of city workers is much larger than they make it out to be.  I can only guess this is to keep legislation and make legislation not to curb or lower pension benefits for city and county workers.  The unions have a lot of power and the taxpayers pay for that.

In theory, if you could pass it through congress and stop the federal 50%, state 50% would go easy. Though a bill like that making it out of the house is slim to none.

He wasn't even a condescending asshole when he wrote it. It was very plain, laid out, ""women prefer other careers, usually people focused, men prefer object focused. The reason women aren't in STEM isn't from sexism, it's biology.""

So of course thousands of people screamed ""DO YOU MEAN WOMEN ARE BIOLOGICALLY INFERIOR TO MEN REEEEE"" and he was fired. If you don't see the absurdity and terror that speaking fact can get you fired, i'm not sure what else there is to say. 

Now that they've failed to sway the mass public that STEM careers are discriminatory toward women, the next move from the hard left is going to be an attempt to decrease the pay of STEM and other high paying, male-centric careers. You already can see it in this thread. ""Well NOW the issue is why are the jobs that men choose to go into higher paying?!"". And then study after study will come out that shows that men trend toward taking crappier, higher paying jobs that require more hours worked. And then the goal post will be moved some more. The goal will be to be like the Scandanavian soccer team that gave up their own pay to supplement the women's team. 

Programmers, welders, and plumbers be weary. It's only going to get worse as old trade labor and contractors retire and fewer people replace them. Demand will stay the same, supply will be lower, prices of trades will increase, and the hard left will see it as a conspiracy that some higher institution is attempting to lower women centric careers wages (teaching, nursing, etc) while raising male centric work. ""I mean how is it justified. They don't even have to go to college. Why do they deserve to be paid so much.""- future outcry about plumbers.

Ironically if there IS any institutional sway regarding the improved wages of trades it's from the liberal controlled academia. They pushed SO hard for this ""everyone must go to college"" nonsense so they could profit off hoards of students indebting themselves with student loans that are handed out like candy. Now all the university educated jobs are worth half as much as they were before (women make up the majority of university students currently), and nobody went into trades.

The study of High School Students cited found:

""while boys’ and girls’ achievements in STEM subjects were broadly similar, science was more likely to be boys’ best subject. Girls, even with their ability in science equalled or excelled that of boys, were often likely to be better overall in reading comprehensions, which relates to higher ability in non-STEM subjects""

So in High School both genders did about the same in ""STEM subjects"" but the girls who were best in science also tended to do well in ""reading comprehensions"" which somehow is unrelated to STEM for these researchers.  From here the researchers decided that because women are apparently better at school they are less likely to go into STEM fields then boys who are unable to do anything else well.

There's an explanation in there - but it seems rather distantly related to the research and trying to push a scientific rather then cultural explanation for why there's a disparity in women in STEM.

Freakonomics recently did a podcast analyzing data on of earnings of uber drivers to see whether a gender wage gap emerged. The premise was that because uber paid everyone completely equally, with the fluctuation in fares centering around its (sex-independent) algorithm, we should not see differences in earnings.

Long story short: men did earn more than women. But, there is no evidence that the effect stemmed from sexism. Rather, it was accounted for by factors such as working for longer periods of time and working late at night. When it came to tips, women earned more than did men.

This is *obviously* not still happening in STEM, though.

There are a fair number of comments talking about how we shouldn't *force* women into fields they don't want to be in, like that's what the movement to get more women in STEM is about. But, sure, in that straw man scenario, you're totally the feminist.

One of the highest comments is about income inequality—which is tangentially related at best—and the discussion underneath is about how some dude's mom told them feminism was about women wanting to get away with the shitty things men are doing, followed by a bunch of dudes mocking women for their choices—weird how people are able to take the high ground on both sides of respecting women's choices.

I'm struggling to find a highly rated comment that mentions that, even if biological predisposition is a variable that will prevent a 50/50 representation, that does not mean that that alone explains current representation in any given market.

And if you aren't a STEM major, whatever you do, DON'T TELL THEM. You'll be treated like dog shit because CLEARLY you contribute fuck-all compared to us GODS of society. 

TL:DR STEM majors can be pretentious fucking pricks who think their shit doesn't stink, and I have more of a problem with that than gender inequality (as a female biologist).

Edit: I might have been a little mad when writing this. Now emotionally sober, I realize I veered off topic. Apologies. ",altariasong,t2_qklwz,-1,0,reddit1

Wasn't it in the Netherlands where it was shown that, despite the economic opportunities available to them, women just were happier choosing lower paying, part-time jobs? In our capitalist, overconsumerism lifestyles, we seem to take ""want good life, take high pay"" as default. But in this scenario, when given the option of stress and high pay over lower pay and more leisure, leisure prevailed.

Helps that the Netherlands is pretty good about using its wealth to keep its people healthy and happy. As our excess-based economy keeps pushing past its straining point, it's something to consider.

Equality of opportunity?

>Now for the first-generation student.  This student had to work, but worked off campus at the local department store where the wages were higher, and they offered evening and weekend hours.  This student was not even aware of leadership programs, thinking they were not a leader and could not participate.  They did not know that internships were a possibility.  And study abroad – that is only for rich kids.  And playing a role in student government – not even on the radar.  Equality of outcome?

dug59tg,t1_dufxnbq,2018-02-18 17:08:53,news,">Equality of Rights doesn’t guarantee Equality of Outcomes, and it honestly shouldn’t.

I think you mean equality of opportunity. Part of equal opportunity is helping people overcome cultural or personal barriers to doing things that they are otherwise fully capable of attempting.

An example would be two teens of equal intelligence and academic ability applying for college. One has parents who have a tuition fund saved up, coached him/her on how to apply for schools, and how to pick a good major. The other has parents who are poor, who never went to college, and are possibly even hostile towards education, never providing any help and making him/her feel guilty for not immediately going to work to support the family.

In order to give the latter a truly fair shot I think a school guidance counselor ought to pull him/her aside, congratulate them for having good grades, and provide some encouragement and practical information in achieving what they are capable of.

To do otherwise is to abuse the concept of equality of opportunity, by defining opportunity in the most minimalistic way possible until its absurd.

>If people of a particular gender/sex are less inclined toward certain fields that is 100% alright

Maybe not.

Your economy is firing on only half as many cylinders when people of a certain gender don't take jobs that the labor market is crying to be filled. It means there's a part of the population that is choosing, for cultural reasons, to remain underemployed and rely more on government assistance.

Its also not just about ladies. It goes both ways. There are lots of medium-skill jobs in healthcare and a lot of unemployed blue collar men who have the right stuff and could fill them but that's not happening.

There are a lot of single moms without the physical stamina or personality traits to be a nursing assistant or something like that who could provide for their family by studying IT or business but they don't.

This problem also makes me wonder if cultural issues are why its hard to fill manual labor jobs often filled by immigrants. The problem feeling like a minority' in a workplace where everyone else has different expectations about work and how to treat coworkers could just as easily apply a to a white male working in a construction trade dominated by mexicans as it does to a woman software developer in an office full of nerd bros.",steavoh,t2_furlg,-3,0,reddit1

dugjgf1,t1_dufxnbq,2018-02-18 21:06:44,news,"While I 100% agree with your conclusion in general, I feel like this is a case to be very careful of invisible inequalities (i.e. cultural inequalities rather than legal/policy inequalities). If it's just aggregate personal preferences leading to an inequality then that's fine (people who sunburn easily probably take fewer carribean vacations), but that's almost certainly not the case here. 

What's more likely is that the way men and women are brought up, which interests of theirs are encouraged, which professions are sold as accessible to who, etc.... lead to unequal outcomes.  (I know I was better encouraged to be a curious little shit by my teachers than my sister was). That's not alright. Even if policy is fair, the system isn't fair if the informal norms aren't. My experience is that women given the opportunities and encouraged in the same way men are turn out to have a proportionally similar interest in STEM. 

As mentioned in other comments. While elementary teaching jobs are overwhelmingly held by women, men have the same nominal opportunity to hold them but face more questions and more scrutiny on a personal level when trying to obtain them than women specifically because it's against the norm. That additional burden very likely explains a large part of the skewed proportion to begin with. We need to be careful of analogous problems for women going into STEM. I feel like the analogus problems are very real, I think women are culturally pushed away from STEM from an early age, and often when pushed towards it are pushed towards specific stereotypically more female fields and for very different motives than men are (e.g. be a doctor because it's profitable vs. be a physicist because you're curious even if you'll likely be dirt poor). I've seen all of this, and I'm a guy in STEM.

All that being said, the solution is not to change admissions rates to schools or set quotas or anything like that, it's to fix our culture by changing our expectations of men and women and being careful not to be biased in how we encourage and nurture the interests of children based on gender.

dugt9ci,t1_dufxnbq,2018-02-19 00:13:34,news,"That doesn't explain fewer. The article is saying that some countries with less gender equality have more females with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and Mathematics.

For that to be non behavioral related and simply genetics, it would have to mean that the women from that particular region were more capable in stem degrees.

I don't think it's regional genetic superiority. I think it's almost certainly Behavioral. It may be other factors in the countries such as incentives or just behavioral trends that led to women being in science and technology more and have nothing to do with gender equality. You could easily just be looking at correlation.

It could be other more Universal behavioral Trends in humans, some kind of compliance versus competition thing, but my guess is it's some unique series of events in that nation's history that led to an opportunity for women to get into these fields. It could also be that countries with high drug use problems or alcoholism Macy outcomes where the men are significantly more impacted by The Addictive substance. Send Nation with high crime, often the men are the ones significantly more involved in crime.

It could be that a group of billionaires decided they wanted to hire a bunch of women because they found them less threatening and the outcome was seeding the nation with higher educated women, their children wanting to live up to their parents, have a higher likelihood of seeking out Advanced careers. 

It's not that a billion more people can't do science, technology, engineering, and Mathematics, it's that most of them are just lazy and don't want to. If you can convince them to, trick them to, force them to, you'll find that the average brain can handle most degrees. I'm not saying you can make the average person to genius through education, I'm saying that most degrees just aren't that hard to get. 

You may also be looking at a difference in educational standards. 

It's hard to say, but my guess is it's not related to gender equality at all other than perhaps the standard of living is high enough in nations with higher gender equality that women don't feel compelled to change their status. If a compelling reason came along, like World War, you would see more women get into fields based on a common need and demand, just like we've seen in the past.

Women can run the factories and women can be the human calculators, that's nothing new. I think it's hard to overlook that a career is demanding and women tend to be in the more unique position of not necessarily having to get a job if they can find a man who's willing to pay their way. While I think women are perfectly capable of supporting men, I see that outcome a lot less often. I think men are more easily compelled to support women do to their ego and competitivenesa and perhaps possessive nature.

Part of the price we pay for being big competitive gorillas is that we don't notice that women are usually significantly more socially capable and aware. These Superior communication and empathy skills are not merely limited to their ability to be polite in public. They are in every way the most naturally gifted manipulator's of humans. They don't have the physical superiority, so what women developed were Superior negotiation skills. 

The net result is that in a modern Society with full gender equality woman get a lot of advantages. Men's physical strength and speed are not really all that useful in a lot of fields. However women's Superior organizational skills, attention to detail and communication skills are quite useful. However, given the system is rigged against them instead of for them, I think a lot of them are specifically looking for a guy who can support. That's because they know they have the luxury of demanding that. 

Let's face it, a lot of girls grow up thinking I'm going to find some Rich and successful guy. Guys grow up thinking, I'm going to find some really attractive girl. 

In many cases behind every great man is a smart woman who worked hard to secure her catch. 

Women are the greatest Fishers of Men. They are the genetic deciders of humanity. They select and attract the males they want, the males are allowed to think it's all their doing. Do you really doubt their powers? 

On the other hand though, life isn't fair and the physically dominant species can often get its way in a less equal Society. For the majority of human evolution women have most often been seen as possessions of men. We're talkin about 300000 years of being treated like possessions, I think it might take a little bit more time to undo that damage. Still, even with a long history of being second-class citizens, they have somehow managed to rise up to the highest ranks and power throughout time. They're more often been held down then they've been allowed to rise, but I think giving a few more centuries will have that mostly fixed.

They get it from their mothers who were more or less trained that their role in life is to hook up with some guy and pop out a baby. They worry by not enforcing that on their daughters that they won't be able to marry. Marriage = access to financial stability. They're not used to living in a time where a woman's perfectly capable of providing for herself.

Said daughters of women who drank the koolaid try to enforce those norms on their peers. After all, if they're going to grow up and not accomplish much because society expects them to be that way, then someone who is trying to accomplish something will make them feel bad about that choice.

Others go along with it because they think that's how they have to be in order to impress and attract a mate. Knew plenty of people who'd intentionally act stupid to try and get a hook up. They're taught to not value their own abilities. It's sad.

We may technically still be as *able* to pursue a STEM career as men are, but there are still so many other factors contributing to why less women go into these fields... Things like you said, conditioning from birth that shapes young girls' interests away from science and technology (combined with activvely shaping boys' interests *towards* those things), and the possibility of actually sexist people (not people who do discriminatory things without realizing it because of how normalized it is, but people who actively think women are inferior) being in positions of power -- like as professors or hiring managers. 

I can appreciate the idea that ""equality of rights doesn’t guarantee equality of outcomes"" and completely understand why so many people in here are saying that, and am not shitting on them for it; but the kind of insidious thing about trying to discuss modern feminism is that a lot of the problems aren't overt. They can be so deeply entrenched in society that most people, including some women, don't even notice them until they *really* look.

dug9oz1,t1_dug51nv,2018-02-18 18:11:01,news,"This is a really challenging issue and I'm not sure if there's a clean way to address it.

Law, medicine, and even business were once totally male-dominated fields and are now rather gender equal or in some cases (especially select subpractices of law and medicine) female-dominated. Computer science, on the other hand, used to be almost entirely female dominated in the earliest days. The jerks didn't keep women from going into law or medicine once they had the opportunity, why are they keeping women from going into CS?

I think that, in general, women _are_ naturally less interested in tech than men. The article linked provides some evidence for that, and anecdotally I'm a male CS/math double major and my math classes have a slightly higher proportion of men (maybe 3:2?) while my CS courses are dramatically skewed in favor of men (probably 8:1 at least) and I go to a university with an almost 70% female population that takes harassment claims and gender disparity very seriously. If there's a way to increase female representation in CS to 1:1 without literally setting quotas for the number of men allowed to take the major, then I haven't seen it.

EDIT:
Also, when I first wrote this comment it had a long story demonstrating how, without men in CS being worse than men in other fields, the gender ratios alone could produce a hostile environment. It was unnecessary and I decided that it didn't really contribute to my point. However, it occurs to me now that I haven't addressed your complaint about your personal experiences studying CS. I'm sorry you had such a bad time in CS. That sucks. 

I don't think fixing tech's harassment problem will fix the gender disparity, but that doesn't mean it's not worth doing. There are women in tech, and men too, who suffer from the culture as it stands.

Sure, women might have some obstacles to get over to go into stem, but the bottom line is absolutely tied to interests and encouragement. I've pushed my nieces towards those fields too, because the work is enjoyable and the money is excellent (still not enough to do it).

The largest problem facing almost all forms of education is how boring school is compared to the actual job. You might have hated robotics in school, but chances are you could have liked or even loved the job. 

When guys say they're going to do something in  stem fields, that's where all their eggs are. They are expected to finish what they start. If a guy walks away from stem, what is his alternative? There isn't any or much that could provide the same lifestyle they would expect. So they push through it. Often they'll find they liked the job much much more than school, and things work out. Oftentimes you get these guys that do hate their field, finish and work in it anyways and are a real ""treat"" to work with. The pressure to finish keeps them going where that may be absent for women.

But with women and stem, there isn't much expectations. They can do it or quit and it doesn't matter. Nobody is going to judge them for not pushing through it. They won't judge themselves the same way because there wasn't any expectations and that same pressure. ",,,-8,0,reddit1

People will always be drawn to the next big shiny thing they come up with and yet the every day world that runs in the background goes completely unnoticed. 

TL;DR Its less about the genders that go into certain jobs, but how society treats the value of the jobs in general. similar sentiments to farmers and trash collectors. ",PastelNihilism,t2_d619ihh,-3,0,reddit1

Yes, lots. To support the claim you made initially, you'd need science saying there is influence; not the contrary.

To the point where it causes economic hardship for men and might be fueling radicalism in those countries.

https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/boys-are-not-defective/540204/

So what's the right way to look at this situation? Do we just write off males as being ""stupid"", say its' their ""natural choice"" to flunk out and dig ditches for a living? Say ""well they have equal opportunity because there's no anti-male rule at schools"" and that's the end of it?

Or do we push for schools to change how they deal with male students, make them study harder, make school something more masculine to appeal to them? So that we can save them from a life of poverty and inferiority and not living up to their potential?

My mum was really not impressed at the complete lack of male role models available to her kids at the school they spend half their day at.

Teaching (especially of small children) also has the issue that while men might be perfectly allowed to go in to it, there's a certain social stigma that means they are disproportionally likely to be accused of being a pedophile which can have a rather chilling effect on men wanting to go in to it. There are even places that give additional training to men in such positions to avoid situations where they could be accused of such things; things that women do not have to do.

It switched to female as the size of the US expanded and we didn't have teachers willing to live in the harsh, dangerous climates out west, especially for the tiny amount of compensation. 

Teaching then became pushed as chance for female Christians to go out and teach in these areas for little pay but as a chance to serve God.  very similar to the missionary mindset. Once these women married, they were no longer allowed to teach. It was a stopgap between teaching college and marriage (or something to support yourself if you were so unlucky as to not get married).

There were still many pushes to get male teachers back in the classroom because they were ""inherently smarter"" and wouldn't coddle the children the way women do. But women were able to stay because we were plentiful and were willing to accept lower wages. Men wouldn't work for such low pay,  and once teaching became associated with ""women's work,"" they wouldn't do something so undignified. 

Teachers are still paid poorly because of these sexist beginnings, and there is still a negative, female association with the profession.

* Being told I only got into my college's CS Honor society because I'm a girl. Joke's on that guy, since I later learned that it was a national requirement that I was in a top percentage (10%, I think?) of my class in the CS department. Joke's also on him since I went on to be president of the group during my senior year, due to me working my ass off to create and run tons of events for the group (in addition to other things).

* Being constantly mistaken for a marketing intern or data entry intern. Once when I was interning at one place, I was on a team that had devs and a few data entry people. I had an older man ask me if I was a marketing intern, then when I told him what team I was on, he immediately asked if I was doing data entry.

* And then of course, reading a bunch of shit online about how women in CS only get interviews and jobs because they're female, not because they're skilled. What's sad is this also means there often can't be average women in CS without some pushback. There can be average men and people don't think much of it, but if there's an average woman in CS, it's very much a ""Why is she even HERE?!?"" situation. I honestly sometimes feel pressure to be as talented as possible to ""prove"" I should be there.

What I'm trying to do now is help other women in CS (especially those still in school) as much as possible. I'm so glad that I made it through my degrees (having almost switched majors), and I want to help other women now.

They asked another guy and would use their advice, trusting them more just because they were male. This also happened when I got my job, customers would ask me to call someone else on the phone to confirm what I did was correct. Customers talked to me like I was a kid. (Not all of them were bad, I loved some of my customers, one even made a point to visit me in person when he toured our facility to thank me for setting up his server, that was awesome.)

I got sexually harassed a fuckton. Went through HR and talking to managers, they did nothing because some of the guys in question were valuable technical people. One manager kind of scared me by telling me to not make up stories. He seemed mad at me for rocking the boat..all day he talked shit about his wife and abot wanting an affair, so I doubt he liked me wanting a professional work environment.

Not necessarily.

>So, even though girls can match boys in terms of how well they do at science and mathematics in school, if those aren’t their best subjects and they are less interested in them, then they’re less likely to choose to study something else.

Damore's memo does not explicitly say that women are less talented at STEM fields. I think the thing people often misinterpret is the line that 
>Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate

Which _could_ be read as saying that preferring female candidates over male candidates lowers the bar because women are not as good in STEM fields, but given the context I think it's more of a statement about how, since the vast majority of _applicants_ are men, preferring to hire women will provide an unnatural selection curve that will lead to the women being hired having to meet a lower bar than the men.

This does not require that the base pool of women be any less talented than the base pool of men and so it is not a statement about biological ability. However, it _is_ a statement that implies that the women who work at Google (and who were Damore's co-workers) are less qualified to be there than the men. It's a subtle difference, but one that I think justifies Damore's firing as it could create a hostile work environment.

This is a really challenging issue. I consider myself a feminist and I think that the tech world has some serious issues with harassment that need to be addressed. However, every piece of evidence I can find suggests that, yes, women really do tend to be less interested in STEM fields than men. Even though women can perform equally well (or even better, depending on the study) in these fields, the difference in interest seems dramatic.

The one line I wish people would read and internalize from Damore's memo is that
>We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.

Sexism can cause gender gaps, but it's not an if-and-only-if relation. When we use gender ratios is the primary or even sole indicator of sexism in an industry we not only unfairly target companies that may be totally equitable in their hiring practices, but we focus our energy _away_ from industries that might have a more equitable gender parity but still have serious problems with sexism.

EDIT: Someone pointed out elsewhere that Damore's memo contains the line
>I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men
and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why
we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. 

Which does seem to be arguing a biological difference in ability, which I have not found evidence for and which Damore's memo does not cite sources for. I maintain my position that Google was right to fire Damore, now with a little more confidence, but I still think he makes several valid points about interest that are usually lost when discussing the memo.",darkardengeno,t2_qhnt6,4,0,reddit1

I have not read the article tbh but I have watched a (swedish?) documentary about the same phenomenon of the best ""gender neutral"" countries surprisingly be the most gender conforming in lines of work. I think the most accepted conclusion was that if you're a woman in a shithole country that's not in america you go to school and get a degree in the thing that gets you a ticket out, physician, phd, engineer, whatever.

dugkdbh,t1_dugfst8,2018-02-18 21:23:38,news,">I’d actually argue there’s a lot of discrimination against men trying to go into those fields.

This is a firmly held belief on reddit despite the fact that it isn’t true. 

Some background: Am male. Have taught kindergarten and second grade. Left teaching to make more money but I am married to an elementary school principal who like most elementary principals will do just about anything legal to get men working at her school. When I entered teaching I got job offers at every place I applied. My wife did not. While I don’t doubt the veracity of your anecdote, men are not broadly discriminated against in education even at the elementary level. In fact men are absurdly over represented in elementary administration given their tiny numbers in elementary classrooms. 

Society on the other hand sends a distinct message that teaching, especially teaching young children, isn’t manly. I invite you to walk into a group of men and tell them that you teach kindergarten. You’ll got a whole lot of raised eyebrows. 

Teaching as a profession was intentionally feminized in the mid 19th century by the male political leaders of the time because women could be paid far less and they were seen as being more virtuous. Women have been the majority among teachers since the beginning of compulsory education.

>The change in the male-to-female ratio in teaching is not due to a decline in males entering the occupation. The number of males entering teaching has also grown, by 22 percent, which is also faster than the rate of increase of the student population. But the number of females in teaching has increased at over twice that rate.

>AS Tommie Leaders, 22, approached college graduation last spring, his professors told him he would have no trouble getting hired. “You’re a guy teaching elementary, ” they said. Mr. Leaders, who earned his education degree from the University of Nebraska in June, started teaching fifth grade last month in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He is the only male teacher in the building.

>But despite inroads that women have made entering previously male-dominated fields, there has not been a corresponding flow of men into teaching and nursing.“We’re not beyond having a cultural devaluation of women’s work,” said Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. “So that if a job is done primarily by women, people tend to believe it has less value.”

>With so few men currently in teaching, other men may be less inclined to view it as a desirable option. “It will be less and less in their head that this is an occupation for males,” said Richard M. Ingersoll, a professor of education and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania who has analyzed education department data on the demographics of teaching. “There’s a snowball effect.”

There are tons of studies showing the positive social, emotional, and health benefits of breastfeeding. A child's brain is more developed when breast fed, they have greater emotional stability, more intellectual capability, stronger immune systems. It is positive for the child in every way. For the first couple years of life a woman is ""constitutionally"" aka physically more suited to raising a child. Then of course you have this incredibly strong mother/child bond that forms because of all the breastfeeding and because of you know giving birth (metric fuck tons of oxytocin are released into a mothers brain at birth and the babys brain, and then lots and lots of oxytocin are released in both the baby's brain and the mothers brain during breastfeeding). So you have this incredibly strong bond, it would be sort of disruptive to the emotional development of the child if the mother all of a sudden just disappeared to work all day once the child was two years old and the dad swooped in. So no a man is not as well suited to raise a child because he can't breastfeed and that is shown to be much more effective for the development of the child.

I feel like where they really lose girls is the fact that stem fields still seem to have this concept that it's very cut and dry in the process. 

In art it's perfectly acceptable to teach people that your first few years working with any specific medium will be heavily focused on the technical aspects. You can get to the real art much later. Very few people approach engineering with this idea.

Innovation, invention, modification, and interfaces all require a creative process. Good programming is just as much of an art as good writing.

Even in Fields like civil engineering, where your job is to make some Architects artistic wet dream be possible, can be an art. 

YouTube users bragging about how they save their household hundreds of dollars just by couponing seem to be predominantly female. 

If that's a female tendency wait until they learn about how much an engineer can save on construction costs just by choosing specific types of materials and changing the interior structure to get more support with less materials.

We are seeing lawmakers work towards equal laws, but culturally, we are only two generations removed from most American women staying home full time to take care of the kids.  

A mother who only ever knew child care and home making may be hostile towards her daughter getting any education.  And that daughter, when faced with the choice of outright scorn for an education vs being praised for getting married and having children, may chose the easier path of not going against her culture and the values instilled in her.  And although that woman will likely be less hostile towards her daughter getting educated because of how culture has changed since she was a little girl, through a hundred thousand actions in childhood may encourage her daughter to take what she subconsciously views as a more feminine and proper path in her career choice.

Because of actions taken by your grandparents, you live in a certain place, you talk in a certain way, and you hold certain moral beliefs.

Also, change happens slowly. There was a thread yesterday on AskReddit about teachers that made you angry and so many of them said that a discouraging teacher made them hate math or science. All it takes is a family and teacher to say “girls don’t need to know math” for it to get stuck in your head and affect you for the rest of your life. It’s subtle things like that. 

Slowly it’s changing. There are a lot more women now in biology and medicine. Chemistry is catching up. It takes a long time for teaching methods to change and for the old “women belong in the kitchen” assholes to retire and die. But when you instead say that “women are just better at creative stuff”, you’re basically tell girls that they can’t be good at STEM. That affects people. 

The problem is we’re treating STEM like a product to market to women. Being bombarded with negative stuff like that there are few women in STEM scares girls away and intimidates them. When they get in a math class and see they’re the only girl or whatever, there’s pressure to succeed and a fear of failure so that you’re not a stereotype. Then experiencing just a little sexism can be the tipping point so they just drop out. Basically, being “woke” causes anxiety. Because even though all these articles and memes are intended to be read by men so they see a problem,  girls see it too and internalize it. This is one of the problems with oversaturation. 

Instead, it should be nurturing curiosity and critical thinking that starts in grade school. Girls excel in elementary school but then by middle school boys get ahead and leave the girls behind. Something happens here. In the vein of “girls just don’t care about science,” one would argue that boys just don’t care about school up until 6th grade because “boys will be boys” and girls are taught to be studious. So the solution is to just treat students EQUALLY. Don’t just tell girls that “they’ll never use algebra” (not true) and stop memeing “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!” And “Why aren’t they teaching us how to balance a checkbook?” Because most people become scientists because they learned a little bit in school and got interested.

Discrimination exists, of course, and is in many cases prevalent. Especially the subtler kinds. However, the gender gap in tech shows up _everywhere_, across [different cultures](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vgalpin1/ps/Gal02a.pdf) with wildly different gender norms. As the article points out, in cultures with _less_ discrimination and _more_ opportunities for women that gap usually grows _larger_; this isn't just a quirk of the Nordic Council countries, some of the highest participation rates at university level computer science for women show up in Iran (at 41%), Malasia (51%), and Thailand (55%!), which all rank rather poorly in [gender development](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GDI).

Further, it doesn't seem like women have low confidence in the technical capabilities of women (or, at least, [female undergraduates tend to strongly believe](http://education.msu.edu/cepse/mqm/documents/MQMPrelimArticleFS03.pdf) in the statement that women have as much technical ability as men). 

We're never going to '100%' sort out the cultural side of things, but at this point I think we can be reasonably confidant that discrimination is probably not responsible for the gender gap we observe in technology, unless you have some other way to explain this data.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't fight discrimination, though. In fact, I think it means we have to work _harder_ than other fields like medicine or law that were once boys' clubs but now have roughly equal representation of both genders. We need to make sure that tech is as welcoming as it can be for the women like you who _are_ interested and make sure that young girls have all the options they need. 

I just think that we can't use gender parity in tech as a measuring stick for discrimination in tech, otherwise we will have to classify Norway is highly discriminatory and Iran as not particularly discriminatory, which neither I nor the Human Development Index thinks is accurate. Honestly, I think the only way to measure discrimination in technology is to ask people who work in tech and listen to them.",darkardengeno,t2_qhnt6,1,0,reddit1
dugjmhv,t1_duggbc0,2018-02-18 21:09:51,news,"It seems like this would, at best, move the problem to entry in the workforce instead of high school or university. I suspect resource allocation would also be tricky: do you allocate resources evenly and make men study in an overcrowded environment? Or do you allocate resources based on the size of the classes and risk women receiving less attention? Also, if you have a class of men who studied tech without any women around enter a workforce that now does have women, that might not have the positive cultural impact you're hoping for.

It could be worth a shot, though. There's actually a whole class of potential solutions that revolve around making the environment _seem_ like it has more women.

If I were designing a high school or college policy I would focus on small teams set up so that they were either completely male or close to 50/50 so that no woman would wind up as the only girl on a team. Group-focused work seems like it would also be friendlier to women if the hypothesis that they are more likely to be predisposed towards people oriented activities is true.

If your friend hates it, she should quit. Not everything is for everyone, but yet again it's hard to tell when you have only worked for one company.

>>On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:

>>- They’re universal across human cultures
>>- They often have clear **biological causes** and links to prenatal testosterone
>>- Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
>>- The underlying traits are highly heritable-
>>- They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
>>
>>... as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, **innate** dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality becomes wider

The very few males that were intending to teach childcare or primary were firmly told on many occasions that they would need to do things like NEVER be alone in a room with a child. Even us in secondary were told that if it was a necessity to speak to a kid alone, to never have the door shut. They also told us all that being a male teacher naturally came with distrust from parents, from the government and even from peers. 

I found that this was certainly the case on my placements - I was able to teach in a very low decile and very high decile school (poor kids and rich kids respectively). There was no difference in how I was perceived there. I actually had an old female teacher in a seperate department to me grill me in the staff room, implying that I was a pedophile in waiting.

dugqca0,t1_dugkdbh,2018-02-18 23:16:31,news,"You say there is no discrimination.. and continue on to describe the cause of discrimination you claimed doesn't exist.

>Society on the other hand sends a distinct message that teaching isn't manly.

This is what I'm talking about, this is what causes the discrimination. Society as a whole places stigma on male teachers, which causes people to discriminate against male teachers.

Regardless, I understand your personal experiences may be different but what about other people's experiences? Do your experiences mean more than other's? My best friend was a teacher and quit because of continued discrimination; he was made to feel he did not belong because of his gender, by female colleagues above and equal to him. Why should your experiences outweigh any else's?

I also have an issue with you trying to use this as any sort of proof for your argument:

The change in the male-to-female ratio in teaching is not due to a decline in males entering the occupation. The number of males entering teaching has also grown, by 22 percent, which is also faster than the rate of increase of the student population. But the number of females in teaching has increased at over twice that rate.

I don't think this means what you think it means. I assume you're trying to use this as proof for men not being discriminated against somehow, but it says the exact opposite of that, if anything at all. The total number of teachers grows in correlation with total population. More students usually means more teachers. The total number of men increased by 22 percent but that's half the rate of increase for women, which literally means the percentage of males compared to females is dropping. Still, I fail to see how this relates to discrimination. There isn't enough data here to even assume that this percentage fluctuation is remotely related to discrimination. I'm just confused why you even included that bit.

And the second quoted bit you added.. why is it relevant? It's people talking about it; yes they said these things and they're saying things similar to you.. so what? Is there data included to back up the things they're saying? Why include the quote other than to say ""hey these people said things I like""? What makes these statements anything more than anecdotes? Why include the quote.. is it supposed to help legitimize your argument? Because it doesn't seem like it does that.",Khassar_de_Templari,t2_c5eej,10,0,reddit1

If you have to go looking for it to find it, that kind of proves the point. There may be outrage at the lack of women in other careers like cooks and chefs, but it’s not nearly as widespread and well known as the outrage about a lack of women in stem fields. We aren’t constantly seeing news stories about how problematic it is that women aren’t better represented in blue collar jobs that can be dirty or dangerous, and are currently dominated by men. I did some google searches to see how many results I’d get for different terms related to this topic, and these are the results I got. This isn’t an exact metric by any means, but I think it gives us an idea of how much discussion is being generated by the disparity in these fields.

“Lack of women in stem” - 140 million search results
 “lack of women chefs” - 9.53 million search results
“Lack of women logging workers” - 74.3 million search results (I think the word “logging” here brought up a lot of unrelated search results because it’s used in many other contexts)
“Lack of women fishers” - 1.71 million million search results
“Lack of women pilots flight engineers” - 1.18 million search results


Logging workers, fishers, and pilots/flight engineers are numbers 1, 2, and 3 on a [Time Magazine list of most dangerous jobs.](http://time.com/5074471/most-dangerous-jobs/) That list is full of industries where women are heavily under represented, and while I’m sure there’s outrage about disparity in those fields you have to go looking to find said outrage. But when it comes to safe well paying jobs where men heavily out number women, that outrage is big enough to come and find you.

And for the record, I fully support equality between men and women. But as others in this thread are, I support equality of opportunity and not equal outcomes.

If you think that's what's happening, the burden of proof is on you to show that women aren't being promoted enough.

And that's definitely the case, in some situations. I'm not saying that there's no discrimination any more than I'm saying that the real wage gap is 0.

Bu we can't solve this problem by just not controlling for job level at all, because then you ignore actually substantive personal decisions (in *addition* to the hypothetical bias you're trying to ignore). The statistics become even less meaningful.

You need to do both: control for job level and time off, *and* check to see whether that data is manipulated by other factors such as women being systematically underpromoted.

Just look at nursing versus doctors. People put in more time and effort and spend more money to get a doctor's license... and those people tend to be men. Meanwhile nursing is dominated by women. It's a much easier license to earn with fewer personal responsibilities so they earn less while being in the same field.

It takes pretty much nothing to be a substitute teacher, and thats a field dominated by women. Life or death deep sea oil drilling? Men.

**A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys**
*Amanda J. Rose and Karen D. Rudolph*

Psychol Bull. 2006 Jan; 132(1): 98–131. doi:  10.1037/0033-2909.132.1.98

Other research in the peer domain indicates a predominance of connection-oriented goals among girls. Compared to adolescent boys, adolescent girls **scored higher** on a composite goal score that represented the degree to which they **valued social goals (e.g., having friends, helping others) more than nonsocial goals (e.g., getting good grades, making money; Ford, 1982). In middle childhood, studies indicate that girls also are more likely than boys to endorse goals that involve mutual participation (Strough & Berg, 2000), friendliness (Murphy & Eisenberg, 2002), and supportiveness (Rose & Asher, 2004).** One study of early adolescents indicated that girls were more likely than boys to endorse intimacy and nurturance goals (Jarvinen & Nicholls, 1996). These studies yielded medium to large effects. Although the effects were smaller and not always statistically significant, there also is some evidence suggesting that girls in middle childhood are more likely than boys to adopt relationship maintaining goals (Chung & Asher, 1996; Rose & Asher, 1999) and goals of resolving peer problems (Rose & Asher, 2004). Because the research on specific social goals focuses primarily on youth in middle childhood, there is little information regarding the developmental progression of these goals for girls and boys.

Notably, **girls focus on relationships may contribute to worries about social approval, abandonment, and the status of their friendships. For example, studies of adolescents reveal medium to large effects indicating that girls are more likely than boys to desire closeness and dependency, and to worry about abandonment, loneliness, hurting others, and loss of relationships as a result of expressing anger (Blatt et al., 1993; Henrich, Blatt, Kuperminc, Zohar, & Leadbeater, 2001; Kuperminc, Blatt, & Leadbeater, 1997). In addition, compared to boys, studies yield small to medium significant effects indicating that girls in middle childhood and adolescence exhibit greater concerns about peer evaluation** (LaGreca, Dandes, Wick, Shaw, & Stone, 1988; LaGreca & Lopez, 1998; LaGreca & Stone, 1993; Liu & Kaplan, 1999; Rudolph & Conley, 2005; Storch et al., 2003; Storch, Zelman, Sweeney, Danner, & Dove, 2002). No clear developmental pattern is apparent in the strength of these effects. Recent research with late childhood and early adolescent youth also examines whether girls feel more jealousy than boys over their friends relationships with others. The findings are not completely consistent, with sex differences emerging in some cases but not others (Parker, Low, Walker, & Gamm, 2005; Roth & Parker, 2001). However, the effect sizes tend to favor girls, and may be especially large when classmatesâ€™ reports are used as compared to when self report or friend reports are used (Parker et al., 2005).
[. . .]
Taken together, these studies indicate that girls’ relational orientation style is characterized by stronger interpersonal engagement than that of boys. Specifically, girls tend to care more about dyadic friendships, to more strongly adopt connection-oriented goals in peer contexts, and to feel more empathy for others, whereas boys focus more on agentic goals, including their own dominance in the peer group. Perhaps as a consequence of their interpersonal engagement, girls demonstrate heightened concerns about the status of relationships and about peer evaluations. Unfortunately, the developmental progression of sex differences in these constructs is challenging to evaluate because studies focus either primarily on middle childhood youth (i.e., studies of goal orientation) or adolescents (i.e., studies of interpersonal vulnerabilities such as dependency and worries about abandonment) or because there are few studies on a particular construct (i.e., studies of friendship jealousy). Nevertheless, developmental differences were found for the one construct for which they could be evaluated. Specifically, self-reports of empathy did indicate stronger differences among older than younger youth. Additional research is needed to test whether there is a similar divergence between the sexes with age for the other aspects of social-cognitive style.

One example I see brought up is that women are actually going into engineering and technology fields in college at a good rate, but then a significant number drop out (change majors) after about a year into the program.

People argue that that must be because the professors and other students are just so sexist it makes the major unbearable through its toxic environment.  So the women opt for less sexist majors like business, medicine, and law.

I would suggest the largest reason at play, is that girls are told constantly, even starting in elementary school, that they *should want* to go into the STEM fields.  That they have something to prove as women.   And then they're given lots of preferential acceptance rates, and especially scholarships into those programs.  So they have a lot of stuff pushing them into trying out the major.  But once they get there, and sit through the one or two engineering classes you actually take as a Freshman, they decide they don't really like the subject matter and go towards a field that involves more personal interaction.",Hypothesis_Null,t2_dtbpi,7,0,reddit1

The point isn't that men aren't involved in raising a child.  The point is, even if we assume child rearing responsibilities are divided totally equally post-birth, women still carry the inherent burden of (1) literally growing the child, and (2) breast-feeding.  Men simply can never do these two tasks.

Therefore, as I said, women have it harder by nature.  They have a larger responsibility when it comes to raising children, again by nature.  

Unfortunately, that means all things being equal they will wind up working less hours.  Now the question becomes, should we legislate around this biological inequality?

As for what you said here:

>Do we really discredit the working dad's because that was their role? Oh wait... We do.... Women want time off work to have kids and their husbands catch shit for spending more time at work. Where do you think the $233k necessary to raise a child in America comes from??? So now we've blended the lines between gender roles which is cool but all the focus is still on women.

Part of the smear was removing the sources and citations page, but they went further by trying to pain Demore as a misogynist, simply because they didn't like the science he used to prove his point.

Now, if you have an hour you should watch this video:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5wgoit

It clearly breaks down his argument from Damore himself, he explains all his reasoning and cites his sources.

He's an engineer so he's a bit awkward, but he validates his stance extremely well.

If you don't have an hour, I'll just pull out what is relevant in your question.

> ""Men’s higher drive for status 

> We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life. 
 
> Status is the primary metric that men are judged on​4​, pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and ​suffer 93% of work-related deaths​.""

This is the crux of the criticism against him.  People like /u/waveduality read the above and take it to mean that he's attacking women, when it is the exact opposite.

He's just showing what we already know, that the gender wage gap is due to personal choice and not gender.

For this you put the blame on the shoulders of feminists why? There is a lack of interest and concern for these type of workers across the board, not just in feminist circles. Cooks and chefs put up with pay and working conditions that would never fly in most other industries and barely a whisper is heard of it outside of our industry.

dugcny9,t1_dug9omk,2018-02-18 19:01:52,news,"I’m of the opinion that besides intrinsic reproductive differences, and the fact that men can lift more for longer, men and women are virtually identical in the ways that matter. Men and women are socialized differently, and this leads to slightly different results in behavior and adeptness at certain tasks, but these differences are usually on the margins of being testable, only show up when talking about populations and not individuals, and again are very probably the result of socialization.

But a lot of men and women (often those with low self esteem) build their identity on a sort of ethereal, undefinable sense of masculinity or femininity. I have yet to see any consistent trend of differential intelligence, creativity, work ethic, or altogether utility of a male versus a female worker. 

We still have a lot of work to do towards building a society that treats both genders well, and I think part of the solution is going to be acknowledging the issues men face, not only for the sake of men, but because disenfranchised men tend to cause problems for all of society. For example, I suspect that a major driving factor behind sexual assault is that men are socialized to believe a their status comes from successful sexual escapades with women. While sexual assault is inexcusable regardless of the reasons, if we can change these pressures that men face, not only will this reduce the arbitrary shaming of sexually unsuccessful men, it will reduce the amount of vile behavior these men subject women to. 

Men and women should be treated virtually identically by the law. This has seen vast improvements in the last century. And they should be treated equally well by economic forces, and while this metric has gotten far better, we still have a ways to go. One of the major factors here is childcare. When women take time off to raise children, they see a massive hit to their career’s trajectory. Women who don’t have children by comparison tend not to experience this to anywhere close to the same degree. If we could provide universal childcare to our society, it would enable women to continue to work throughout the early days of raising children. This would benefit both genders, and society at large. The fathers would experience less economic stress as they would no longer become the sole breadwinner for the family, and given the resources put into educating women, our society would be use its resources more effectively if half the population wasn’t expected to make decisions that lead to the underutilization of their education.

LOL no.

Even when fathers are actively fighting for custody, they have a a very small chance of getting it.  In contrast, when the mother is the plaintiff, she has a very high chance of getting custody.

I like how you don't link any studies, as there are none.

Studies show the opposite. Will edit in source when I get back home.

Edit in a source as promised:

For instance, here's one study from 2002 https://wakespace.lib.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/26167/Back%20to%20the%20Future%20%20An%20Empirical%20Study%20of%20Child%20Custody%20Outcomes%20%20(SSRN).pdf

>Of  the  custody  
resolution  events  awarding  physical  custody  either  to  mother  or  
father  or  jointly,  the  mother  received  primary  physical  custody  in  
71.9%  of  the  cases  (235/327).    The  father  received  primary  physical  
custody  in  12.8%  of  the  cases  (42/327).

But that's just because fathers just don't ask for or want custody right? And if they did, they would have equal chance as a woman?

>If 
the plaintiff was the mother and sought primary physical custody, she 
got  it  in  81.5%  of  the  cases  (145/178).    If  the  plaintiff  was  the  father  and  sought  physical  custody,  he  received  it  in  33.7%  of  the  cases  
(29/86).

It's an entry level job that requires a graduate degree? Sounds like the biggest crock I've read here today. Most engineering jobs require a PEng designation which you get from working at least a few years after additional testing and review.

duij9f5,t1_duiaz0z,2018-02-19 23:07:28,news,"You're looking at it like everyone is being trained to go compete for YOUR job.    No man, the schooling or educational path is left to the individual. Nobody forces anyone to go be a plumber or a Java dev.   Everyone can go after whatever job they want, ideally, just like you chose to do whatever it is you do.   If everyone decides to go be an artist when the world only really needs 50 artists, they're all equally and fairly screwed.     
  
When we're talking about things being ""fair"" it doesn't mean ""make it easy for /u/baddlebrock to get a job"".  If it's fair, that means no one has an unfair advantage and you're all competing on a fair and level playing field. If... previously... no one without a beard was allowed to apply for your job, and then that changes and now the beardless are allowed then there's going to be more competition. That sucks for you man, but it sucked way more for the beardless prior and now it sucks an equal amount for everyone.  That's fair. If there's too much competition, you are free to go search elsewhere, just like everyone else.   When I was 18 I looked around and saw everyone was getting into computers, and I considered a career in animation. But the pay sucked. So despite what I worried was a glut on the market I went on to be a code-monkey. That paid out because the field expanded. The onus is on the individual to choose a career path that's best for them. That includes finding out or predicting what's in demand and balancing that against what they want to do.    Anything else would be tyrannical. 

Speaking of which, what's the alternative you're considering? Barring anyone else from even applying for a certain job? Stop them from studying to get the job? Any alternative that reduces the potential pool of hirees in your field is necessarily unfair to those people.  It sounds like you want a guaranteed job you're destined for. Like some sort of nepotism or guild assurance or union seniority system. Or the state to dictate who gets what job. None of which are meritocracies.   You can't claim ""that's not fair"" if someone comes along and does your job better than you.   Now, giving your job away to someone just for a diversity requirement, I'd agree that's not fair and ill-thought-out attempt to get equality of outcome. Plus affirmative action is illegal now. 

The world doesn't owe you a job. You have to go fight for it like everyone else. That's fair.

On the other hand men have to take risks and compete in order to attract a woman. This propensity to take more risks manifests itself in men asking for raises or promotions. While for women, since there is less of a need to take risks then they are also less likely to ask for raises/promotion because asking for a raise and promotion is a risky move.
