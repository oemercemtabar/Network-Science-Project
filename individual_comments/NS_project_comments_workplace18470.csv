id3tggx,t3_vgsges,2022-06-20 21:15:27,WorkReform,"I don't want to be super negative and obviously I don't know the exact circumstances.

To me this reeks of a union which bends over backwards to not offend the capitalists. I was super excited when I got my first union job. Turned out the union was run by liberals who sold out the workers who didn't have college degrees. It was a two tiered system where maintenance and custodians got pay cuts while bus drivers got a raise to match inflation. Teachers and administration got solid raises, better benefits. They didn't have to pay for their healthcare out of their pay it was fully covered by the district. 

I mean I would be extremely curious if this bakery would have voluntarily recognized this union if it was affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World. What do I know they could be though. 

Moral of the story is there are many unions which are only for the ""right"" people. The idea of a union of working class people demanding meaningful change scares and disgusts them, they see us as a threat to their privileges.

They make horribly bad wages, usually b/c vets make horribly bad wages (factoring their just-as-expensive medical degree).

Frankly, if someone gets trained to do a job, and spends money on it, they'll do it. **But if they find more money to do something untrained, they'll do it.**

The ""sudden"" rise to $15 was in response to low labor availability. The hope was they could ""get theirs"" when it comes to cheap employees b4 they lost to higher-wage jobs.

But now the $15 goes for $18, the $18 goes for $20, and suddenly, $20 doesn't seem as good because there's probably $25 for the same efforts.

First false advertising isn't fraud it is a seperate thing under the law. 

Second prosecution only refers to criminal offenses. False advertising (federally) and most forms of fraud are under civil laws. So theyre never prosecuted. Instead private individuals and regulatory bodies (such as the FTC) can bring cases against them. Something the FTC does all the time (after first sending cease and desist)

Third no criminal fraud statute would apply here. Only very specific acts are considered criminal fraud such as wire fraud. If you disagree kindly cite a specific statute. 

Next, this isn't civil fraud because it's not an offer. There is no contract to allege fraud over. 

It also isn't false advertising. Not only is all the info there, but the relevant portion is legible, isolated from other text, near the center and direcrtly below the part it is referring to. The eyes are naturally drawn to it. Moreover the font is larger than fonts of protions peets clearly wants to be read such as their benefits.

$14 isn't a living wage anywhere. The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. About 20 states follow the federal minimum.

Wyoming is a great example of the federal minimum wage. Many of their cities have a crisis shortage of hospitality and customer service jobs because housing is in extreme short supply, and minimum wage doesn't come close to covering rent. Hospitals and schools buy land and build company housing for their workers. 

That state is so frickin' red they don't once consider raising the minimum wage. Mandating affordable housing is a taboo idea because, ""They're taking muh rights!""

**BY LAW** if a worker doesn't make minimum wage after tips, they **must** be paid minimum wage.

Almost everywhere, tipped positions (ie: those that are universally tipped positions, such as wait staff) make far and beyond what their skillset would earn without the tips. Someone with no experience and no education can and does make 20+ per hour where I worked.

So the only people who have a right to complain about tipping are the customers, which, to be fair, are most people. But any worker who complains about it either A. doesn't understand their rights, or B. is lying.

If a standard wage was put in place for wait staff, their wages would be cut in half overnight. That's a guarantee almost everywhere in the country.",Necromancer4276,t2_e1720,4,0,reddit3

""in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States""

The operative words is in any matter. Matter doesnt refer to anything. It means a proceeding or investigation.

 Within the jurisdiction of the 3 branches of the us governement refers to matters that are before and within their jurisdiction. 

This isnt an opinion. This is what the friggen law means. 

And no something being outside of the writ of the law doesnt make it subjective. A standard and interpretation by a court isnt an opinion (in the non-legal sense). That becomes the law. We live in  hybrid of a common and statutory law legal system. Court rulings are laws. Theyre just not statutes.

So weird that this is a thing (and common).

Where I worked the FOH had a write up system for being late, doing something they shouldn't, and they had to put in orders through the POS

BOH had nothing. Late? Nope. Call off? Not really unless it was a habit. Food order? Just cook yourself something. Writeups? I didn't even know that was a thing until a host told me. 

Two sets of standards for the same staff. And of course the owner was far more understanding and nice to the BOH vs FOH.",bulboustadpole,t2_69jgl,6,0,reddit4

ioo3uhf,t1_ioo2hx0,2022-09-16 14:25:45,WorkReform,"There are a lot of companies that do this already. For example, this is actually the case for investment bankers and I actually don't think that this is necessarily a good thing. It creates an environment where you work 18hrs a day, and you expect others to do the same (because it impacts your personal bottom line). At the end of the day it would lead to situations where people are overworking and not enjoying life.

I think a better approach is a bonus structure targeted toward a certain %, but then also scales up as company profitability scales up. I have a 20% bonus which is enough for me to want to work hard, and people in my industry have been known to get 30%-40% if the company does well/they go above and beyond. That's sufficient for me.

Lastly it goes back to capital incentives. If you put in a ton of capital, personal blood sweat and tears, then you'd expect to gain the returns on this. If you give away equity, you've front loaded the risk and then paid out the rewards. I'm not against paying people fairly, I'm just saying that there's no way that this scenario would ever be the norm.

Edit - the other reason you wouldn't do this is due to control. If you give people equity and then they leave, how do you compensate the next group who comes in? How do you account for the sixth guy who has equity but doesn't work as hard as the first five? Equity owners don't typically care about the individual for these very reasons. There's nothing wrong with giving your employees equity, but that already happens in a lot of places but it's to a less drastic degree and typically for businesses that are not currently earning that much money (ex.

iook7lx,t1_ioo3uhf,2022-09-16 16:12:13,WorkReform,"so my Idea is that it's not equity on paper, you get to keep it as long as you're an employee, I guess you could think of it as a bonus or commission but its not capped, the more money the business profits, the more money you get. Its not 20 to 40℅of your salary, its 30℅ of company profits, (it doesn't have to start of that high, ot could start at 10℅ or lower and as each year goes by, that percentage increases as success increases) 

If you don't pull your weight, you lose your portion of this ""Equity"" and it gets redistributed to the rest of the team that did do the work not back to the company. This can be measured using fair KPI's that are specific to each individual and not lumped as a catch all for all team members. Because at least in my experience, not all KPI's are one size fits all.


You don't pull your weight even more after that, you're out.


And yes, I understand the idea that people might become overly pushy and Judgey about the amount of work, however, no one would be allowed to work more than the required, each individual should perform their daily tasks and achieve their targets, a manager that does not condone infighting, nor succumb to favoritism, the expectations should be, show up, do your thing, go home, the managers job is to ensure that everyone is doing exactly what they should be doing, nothing more, nothing less. 

If a person would like to do more for the business, then it is an individual effort and must not be expected of others, this individual effort would then be rewarded differently, such as salary increments or additional days off or a promotion if deemed necessary. This is reinforced by the business owner. 


Another thing I'd like to add is that this would not be an automatic thing you get from the get go, there would be a proving period, say a year where you not only prove that you can do the job well but also mesh well with other colleagues.


I get that there are kinks to work out, but that's where people like yourself come in to help iron them out, I'm not saying I have it all worked out, it's sort of an experiment I like to think about and work out different scenarios and what ifs.


The end of it would be (in my mind anyway) after say 10 years of running it in this manner successfully, I as the business owner would then transfer a large chunk of the business to the individuals who basically run the place officially on paper (if they want it) and I go and retire retaining a small portion of the profits to live off of.

yes it may very well be an idealistic way of looking at it, but hear me out, if a business or a company had a bunch of individuals that not just get a salary or a bonus out of a company but real net profit percentages would potentially grow the business exponentially, the more the business makes, the more everyone in the company that had earned a share of the profits makes

Regarding your second point about selling the business, this does exist in practice when an individual doesn't have a familial successor.

Personally I consider passive income as using the capital you own to make more money, so you have not contributed any meaningful labor in the generation of the value, except for owning capital. If you work and create something, generating value from your labor, I don't consider that passive income. Also, if you have to keep doing that in order to maintain a decent middle class lifestyle, I consider you working class.

An editor wasn't required (I even offered to proofread on the cheap, I'm decent but not perfect), but she wanted to do it right. She made all that back in royalties, and then some.

She's far from the only self-published author to do that. I was surprised to find out that many self-pub authors (even small ones) pay for a part-time personal assistant, even.

I think my wife paid for a cover artist, an interior artist (for special chapter pages and custom art for section breaks), an editor, a proofreader, and some software tools to help her self-promote easier (like mailing list management, creating different images with her cover in it for marketing, some sort of book distribution tool, some sort of prize giveaway tool, etc).

i0e21hk,t3_tcjp7u,2022-03-12 17:25:22,WorkReform,"My experience, and what Ive seen with my peers, is that the only way to get a real raise is to move up (to a position with a higher classification and higher salary band) or move on. You are in the best position for negotiation if you are already employed. Future employers that want you are more incentivized to offer you more to get you to leave.

You should move up or move on every few years, or at whatever point you have learned everything the job you have will teach you about your profession. It will be pretty clear when your position stagnates. Either your work will no longer be challenging or there wont be more opportunities for challenging, or youll ask for an advancement opportunity (to move up) and theyll give you the runaround or just decline you.

If you choose to move on, aim for an increase of 20-50%. Make it clear up front what youre looking for, in dollars, and if theyre unwilling to offer that range, you can walk away and keep looking. If they say ok and the. offer you less than your range, walk away and keep looking.",armahillo,t2_716zr,14,0,reddit1

i0e9sca,t3_tcjp7u,2022-03-12 18:14:23,WorkReform,"My wife's job at a great hospital in the area that regularly does market research on comparable positions at other organizations in the area, her boss just drops off a letter saying she got a raise for this reason and will take effect next pay period. She also got a 300 dollar bonus for working during the pandemic 2 months ago, not a whole lot but considering she started in June, its a lot more than a pizza party. Meanwhile at my old job I was hired at 15/hour the previous year, a huge upgrade from my 12/hour for exploitation management, with absolutely no hints at a raise coming, even though new hires were offered 16-17/hour. 

I ended up quiting to enroll full time, because as a 2 parent household daycare for our children was 1800 a month. Assuming I didn't miss any work at all due to kids appointments or getting sick, I was making 2000 a month, which taking into account gas, lunch, etc I was basically breaking even. Choosing to go into massive debt over the next couple of years, title 20 pays for half of the day care, and I make about 2000 in fasfa every quarter. The only reason we can even take advantage of that is because the income threshold for getting on the program was lowered with the American Rescue Plan. Without that, in my state for a 2 parent household, we would've been making more than the threshold if both of us were working full time for anything more than 10/hour. Maybe I would feel worse about trying to take advantage of the system if we haven't been paying into it our entire working lives.

Meanwhile, my wife's friend (started as a much better friend but we distanced ourselves as her poor decisions piled up, but continue to check up on her to make sure her kids are okay) gets 20 hours/week of childcare completely paid for, housing assistance, utility assistance, more than twice as much in SNAP benefits as we do, and drives a brand new minivan, all because she makes less than we with part time jobs and she's considered a one parent household because she's not married to the deadbeat Dad who lives there but is in and out of the kid's lives on a whim. Don't get me wrong, I'm not upset that she receives benefits, her and her 3 young children are able to have a roof over their heads, water and heat and lights on, and food on the table.

That said, I do have a few suggestions that can, hopefully, help you. 

Make a point of checking glassdoor for salaries, not only at your company, but at competitors as well. This way, if your company fails to keep up with industry average, you can make plans accordingly.

If you haven't already, set up job alerts both internally and externally. This way you can see what opportunities are out there; it's always in your best interest to find a job before things get bad at your current place.

You might very well be doing all of this, so I don't mean to come across as condescending. I'm just very passionate about worker empowerment. I spent years being underpaid at a job I really liked. When I finally took the plunge and left the company, I got a massive pay increase and found out that I could be happy in another job at another company.

This year they announced they’d be adjusting for market rates again, to go from “mid-market” to “top of market.”  The reason is that we keep losing people to higher offers. Since we’re also trying to increase company size due to increased demand for our services, trying to backfill these positions is onerous. 

Our growing company additionally means we’re promoting from within and training people to where we’d like them to be.

In my case we got an extra raise of 2,5% to “reward and give value to the work the employees are given” AND they raised the value of our daily meal vouchers from 6€ to 8€ a day AAAAND for those who also work remote some days of the week, we are given a “home bonus” of 175€ a month (to help cover internet and electricity costs) AAAAAAAND they also reimburse 100% of your travel costs. 

Edit: we are also given a medical card that makes almost all of the minor interventions and casual visits to the region’s hospitals almost 100% free. Our public free health care already reimburses almost 80-100% of all of it but if there’s residual money you had to pay, our job covers it in full (for most cases, not surgery for exemple).

Benefits like Title 20 and SNAP will consider your income based on gross income minus qualifying expenses like rent/housing, utilities, and I believe even car payments. So for the sake of simplicity let's say the threshold is 2000, its not but its just an example. If you make under 2000 gross you can qualify. If you have 1000 for rent, then benefits wise its considered like you have 1000 take home and gives you benefits based on that. But if you get a raise and start making 2500 gross, you get kicked off benefits, even though based on that you should be considered 1500.

- You are skilled in a trade that not many folks are currently seeking a career path in. Landing a newer employee can relax some of the pressure on their current work staff, while increasing their longevity.

When she put in her 2 weeks they were very shocked. I think they though she'd never leave. They also didn't seem all that concerned at first. They offered her a $10k raise to stay. Then near the end of the two weeks asked her to work weekends to train somebody for 3x her hourly rate. She just said no thanks, I want to move on to my next job and my weekends are valuable to me. 

That's all your wife needs to say.... no thanks.

Those last 2 weeks she kept warning them someone needs to sit with her for the last 2 weeks to try to learn the job (even though it would have taken 2 months to learn it). They never did up until the last 2 days when the manager sat with her, and that is when it sunk in, because previously I don't think the manager even knew what she did every day. That's when they offered the 3x weekend rate.

I did this at my last job. I was “essential” because the owner never replaced my direct supervisor when she left and dumped that work on me.

Chances are the company will not want her to work for them after she leaves because they do not want a disgruntled ex employee to have access to their systems or data.

IF, she decides to do work for her old job then she needs to set herself up as a contractor and have a very precise contract with the company.   It has to be official because she could be sued by the company if her work ""damages"" in any way  the company's private and proprietary systems or data.  She needs to have legal protection stating that she was allowed access.

When I say precise, I mean, they need to define what they want accomplished in detail. For example; They request a sales report showing totals of all remote salespeople. She replies that that she estimate this will take four hours to accomplish and that she needs to access the XXX and YYY databases in order to do this. She deliver it on X date.  This is written in the form of a contact and signed off by all parties.

Once the report is produced they look at it and say, this is great but can you sort it out so that it displays results by region. She says I can do that but you currently have the working report as agreed. What you are requesting is a change order and it will take one hour to complete and here is a new contract in order to accomplish that. If they balk and say it is only a minor change then tell her to walk. They will be constantly be adding minor tweaks and expecting it to be covered by the original contract.

Wages should be 5X her current hourly wage at her new employer.

* Make this ""new"" position a contract position. This isn't an extension, or a modified version of her current role, this is a brand new contract where you negotiate the terms for employment.
* Rate: My immediate suggestion is to make her ""new"" rate be what she's currently making at her new job, but this highly depends on how nice your wife wants to be. You could be honest and give the actual amount, or you could increase the new amount by a few $$ per hour. But it's up to you.
* Hours worked: negotiate what days she's going to work, and the hours she works on those days, and get it in writing. The old company will try to make it ambiguous, and then work her to the bone to grind out as much work as possible, but don't let them. You and her need to decide if she's only going to work Saturday/Sunday for 6 hours a day, or more than that, and then put it in writing for everyone to sign.
* Work to be done: This will also be helpful, because you want to make it clear what work she is to be focusing on. State that she'll be working on projects A, B, C, etc, and nothing more. 
* Any other details that need to be outlined.
* If the company pushes back saying ""it's too much work to handle the paperwork"", then just offer to them that she will bill them every week, or every 2 weeks, for the work she's done. She'll send them an invoice that shows ""hours worked"", the days worked, and then her rate ($$ per hour), and then they will pay her like a contractor. \[Free invoice templates exist online\].

Since she will be a contract employee then make sure you are explicit with your terms. Don't allow ""wiggle room"" from the old company, because the wiggle room is exactly where companies manipulate their people.",numbersthen0987431,t2_2ys2ujy0,0,0,reddit2

With regards to what to charge, check out what expenses she will have first eg. what sort of company, sole trader, etc. needs to be setup to protect any assets she has.  What insurance does she need?  Public?  Professional cover?  The cost of these will start to give you an idea of just the costs.  Now what is it going to cost to get her out the door for several weekends?  If her current hourly rate is under $20, start at $50 an hour, and then triple it.  That's the minimum she should be looking at in a consultant role (plus what you work the expenses out at).  They quite possibly won't pay it, but then that's their problem.

kfz9ogt,t3_18wd058,2024-01-02 14:25:58,WorkReform,"Were I her shoes, I would give my two weeks and leave at the end of it. Some additional points: 

* Give old employer zero information about the new role. Also, don't update the company/role anywhere online until at least 6 months have passed. They aren't entitled to it, and you don't want them calling the new employer to mess up the new position with false info. ""I'd rather not share that information."" 
* During the two weeks, do what can be done in a normal 40 hour week. If they want more than that, let them know you have time to do A, B, C, but not X and Y. ""How would you like me to prioritize given my limited time remaining?"" 
* From the description, I wouldn't offer to help with anything after leaving. It sounds like any offer to help with lead to more and more requests from the toxic environment. ""I won't be able to help. 
* My schedule is completely booked for the foreseeable future."" If someone calls to ask for help, I'd refer them to any documentation that's available. ""You can check the documentation I left on my desk.""

Of course, modify the wording to fit her style. But the key points are 

* Be professional, calm, and courteous. 
* Don't apologize. 
* Use grey rock language so they can't latch on to a point as a wedge to get you to say yes. Example: ""I'll be really busy the first month or two at my new job."" ""Oh, so you can help after a month or two?""

Your wife didn't create this situation of being the sole competent person around. Management did. They can figure it out after she's left. She owed them her time and effort while they were paying her. That obligation ends when her employment ends. If she wants to help (and I hope not), then she should charge them a fee commensurate with her experience and knowledge, plus an additional amount to cover taxes, effort, and irritation. Perhaps her last hourly amount times 6 or 7 or more. But I wouldn't do this. It'll be a never-ending time suck, and she'll never get away from the toxicity.

There are those who will probably say that she should just leave without giving notice. It sounds like this place is a substantial part of her work history. Burning the bridge will probably result in negative information given out when they call to verify employment, like ""do not rehire"". That is too detrimental to her future employment to risk.",basementmatt,t2_9t1cz,1,0,reddit2

* Will money go to your bank account?

2. Private employer realizes that labor costs are the largest cost category and will have the greatest impact on increased profit.

Unions of workers that understood that despite the fact they weren't highly educated their labour and effort was valuable, extremely valuable in fact, as it was made evident every time they refused their labour (striking) and suddenly a whole industry or even country was thrown into disarray.

The ruling classes all over the world have since the 80s through a mix of lies, half-truths and bills passed by the politicians they bought managed to curb unions. Meaning that despite the fact that the world still runs on a majority of ""low skill"" workers, and it still depends on them as much as ever, they have little to no capacity to negotiate a higher share of the profits they make possible.

I was working at a liquor store when the manager quit.

So they pulled me and another guy into a meeting and asked us both to be ""assistant managers"".

""Who will hold the store keys"" I asked. ""You both will""

""who will do alarm call outs"" ?  ""You both will""

""If we disagree about something, who makes the choice?""

Silence. They had not thought of this.

""will we get paid any more ? ""no, you will stay on the same pay rate because you will not a manager""

""so, the store will still be being managed, but it will not have a manager....thank you for the offer, but I think I will just stay as an assistant manager""

I saw the other guy look at me quickly. He realised what I did: These asses  were trying to have both of us managing the store, but neither of us getting paid as managers... 

""I'm sorry but I will decline too"" he said.

The area manager looked gob smacked.

""..Neither of you want to do this?"" he asked looking like a little kid whose ball has been taken away from him.

""No thanks"" we both answered.

A week later they offered me a manager's position and him a 2ic position and both of us got a pay rise.

However, when my contract ended, they couldn't pay me the bonus for achieving goals since I was unqualified for the position. I requested written confirmation before considering legal action. Upon my return to the ICU, a new manager, Karen, took over and implemented changes that negatively affected the staff. She fired me impulsively, but I knew she needed to involve the union. I informed my colleagues and met with a labor attorney. I plan to file for unemployment and pursue legal action based on the breach of contract and wrongful dismissal.

jqqw486,t3_14quhi1,2023-07-05 12:00:25,WorkReform,"I used to manage schedules in Dialysis (full disclosure my role was closer to a Karen in the story). I’d do a schedule, which was always a draft and then as a group we’d swap out all the people needed. — For us, a lot of the Dialysis techs had 2nd jobs so their concern was regular shifts so they could balance both.

Reading what you wrote, I appreciate what you were doing because a lot of work goes into a flexible schedule like that. I think the new person  a. Lacked empathy b. Was lazy

I hate hate hate arbitrary policies. Infection control, must be 100%… bonuses based on degree rather than contributing… bullshit.

The thing about charting made me mad too. You can’t pressure people to do their jobs in an a potentially unsafe way. You could ask that nurse if she needs any help, offer mentorship, or just be fine with the fact that we all have slow days. If this was the end of a 12 hour shift or a complex patient, or her home life is complex at the moment… fuck it, hopefully the team can help her with some side duties. Prioritizing speed over safety hurts patients.

I’m sorry you have to leave as well.

Every spot I’ve been in, I’ve either been able to get people set days off or at least desired shifts whenever set days off won’t work. Ive been talked to by management a few times about how I can’t do set days off for employees and yadda yadda, the “needs of the business” and such. 

Too many times I’ve found things like employee A wants to work mornings, and employee B wants to work nights. They both have the same availability during the week, so it’s a no brainer, one is on mornings the other is on nights. Done. 

I leave the department and their schedules are flipped for some reason, probably someone on a power trip. Frequently I’ve walked into work and found half of the department has called out. It’s not hard people. Our raises at this job are based on hours worked and not merit, so that makes it really difficult to build moral off of raises and bonuses, basically you do the time, you’re getting the money.

jqqe577,t1_jqqb9z5,2023-07-05 08:09:34,WorkReform,"Sure. It's possible that OP would not have been able to perform the job one level up as well as they performed the ICU management role. It's also possible that they would be able to perform that role but not the one above that. It's even possible that this view that they've given us on their own performance doesn't quite reflect reality, and that there are plenty of things that they overlooked or did badly and were simply not aware of. I would certainly be curious to get OP's boss's account of this story and hear some of the things that OP left out.

All that notwithstanding, the first part of this post looks like a success story. OP knew exactly what all the other ICU nurses were dealing with and all of the considerations that the higher-ups were unaware of or didn't care about, and managed the ICU in such a way as to promote a healthier work environment, more sustainable work practices, more robust new hire onboarding, and better work/life balance for the staff. OP's method could almost be a case study for how to run an ICU. 

As this is a very short account of the story--months of reforms boiled down into a few paragraphs--I'd be curious to hear OP drill down into some more of the challenges of running an ICU, including more of the considerations that they were aware of and managed besides the scheduling awkwardness, and some of the other duties that they took on. It's possible that as great as OP looks in this post, the post is severely understating everything they got right.

That said, from where I'm sitting right here, unfortunately unable to interview OP, their former bosses, or their former coworkers, it looks like this is a textbook example of a promotion gone right--the opposite of the Peter Principle. It looks like OP was promoted after they knew the ICU from top to bottom and everything that went on there, and their deep knowledge helped them implement practical reforms that made the whole place function better for both the patients and the staff. 

Promoting from within doesn't always work, and people often flounder when they're promoted up. It's even possible that OP was floundering and didn't know it on other parts. But regarding the parts that are conveyed in this post, it looks like this story has nothing to do with the Peter Principle.

>Much cheaper to spend tens of millions on emergency measures and lawsuits when your department collapses due to no staff and some of your patients die.

Unfortunately, this is actually the incentive for managers and it's an economy-wide, world-wide problem.

See, let's say you have the choice of:

- No change in profits

- 90% chance of making 5% more profit and 10% chance of losing all your profit.

Now logically speaking this is a no-brainer. You do the right thing and don't cut the corner.

The problem is this: if the manager picks the 5% profit profit the manager hits a good KPI and gets a nice bonus. 

But then, you ask, ""what about the 10% chance of catastrophic failure? The manager stands to lose 20x as much!"" Well of course that's not the case.

The manager is getting fired - but this *vastly* underpunishes them. Managers are seldom, if *ever* properly accountable for massive catastrophes. They don't get bankrupted for that mistake.

Even if, from the *company's* perspective, it's a tradeoff between a 90% small gain and a 10% chance of a huge loss that's 20x the size of the gain, from the *manager's* perspective it's a 90% chance of a small gain vs a 10% chance of a loss that's only say 3x of the gain. 

In order to *actually hold that manager accountable* proportionate to the size of the catastrophe would require they be personally sued to bankruptcy, which almost *never* happens (remember Lehman Brothers and 2008? Heck even the Sacklers aren't bankrupt or in Jail either). And because they aren't punished properly for catastrophes the incentives are clear.

This is a simple game theory explanation for why people behave why they behave. What people see as stupidity may well be cold-hearted self-interest.",Eric1491625,t2_164s3o,7,0,reddit1

Essentially, to align the manager's incentive's with the owner's incentives, you need to make them an owner. 

If you are worried about the actions of the individual effecting the whole, you can track metrics so that if they mismanage their resources and lose the company 5% profits, those 5% profits come out of their share.

The military actually trains people who are on that trajectory to become good leaders because it’s not like those people are going to job hop to a different country’s military in two years. They’re going to be stuck with a ton of bad leaders if they don’t take training and mentorship seriously. And the Russian military shitshow is a great example of how badly it hurts a military to have incompetent leaders at every level of the organization.

Meanwhile, many companies don’t invest any time, money, or effort into explicit leadership training (not just “This is your role as the manager of x department” but actual leadership theory) and you just have to do your own research and figure it out for yourself. 

That could go really well if you’re already well-suited for leadership and find influences who are also great leaders. It could go very poorly if you’re only being promoted because you’re the top individual contributor on the team, know nothing about what it means to lead, and find bad sources of influence to help you develop that concept on your own as a new leader.

We could all have nice things if the corporate world took training for leadership more seriously and valued employees as more than just numbers on a spreadsheet.

I liked working at “Goli’s”, I was young and it was very “mom and pop”, but I’ll NEVER forget the panic that hit when union pamphlets started circulating. I was a kid, maybe 16, when the HEAD of HR came to talk to us about the consequences of joining a union. The man threatened the END of the “family” - literally- by saying the owner would rather close up shop than deal with unions. I can’t imagine what they said to the department heads.

I stayed with the company for a long time. I went from “odd-jobber” to “department head” and worked really hard to prove my continued worth. The small “mom and pop” went from 2 stores to 7, and became the largest independent grocer in the state (sans unions). With that transformation came impersonalization and industrialization without compassion.

I’ll never stop regretting not unionizing. Old friends were forced out, and others are currently suffering. They work thankless jobs in a thankless industry for thankless masters.

There is another side to that coin that I don’t think gets enough attention. 

You shouldn’t be able to fire an employee without good reason. The employee also deserves the dignity of being allowed to improve their performance once an issue has been pointed out to them. 

So, in the process of documenting performance problems you make sure to set clear and specific expectations. This makes it easier to demonstrate there is a performance issue, but it also provides additional structure that can help a struggling employee succeed if they want to.

You Union should grieve each step of this process, since they represent you, but if management has followed the contract, and has *documented* that they have followed the contract, the discipline will stick through the grievance process.  

The reality is though that the actual front line supervisors will likely not be backed up by middle management, and discipline will just be a big bother, so management will typically just let things ride.

iickwr6,t1_iibo83d,2022-07-31 05:29:07,WorkReform,"Read about company unions and the Wagner act. Companies have a history of corrupting unions in their favor. It was a big enough deal that the US explicitly made it illegal in the 1930's.

It's no different from regulatory capture - corruption will always exist, and big money will always seek to corrupt whatever they can in the name of profits. That includes unions.

Thankfully this doesn't seem to be common today, if it's happening at all - but it's evidence that unions can and have been used *against* workers.

A union obtains its power by harnessing the collective power of its members. As such, it's both the right and the duty of those workers to scrutinize their unions.  The way to fight corruption and undue corporate influence is through the vigilance of individual members. It is important - foundational, even - to the cause of the worker to be critical of unions, to watch them closely and to speak out against them whenever they don't act as zealous advocates for the laborers.

This isn't only true of unions, but of any large organization which controls large sums of money which they purport to use for good; the exact same principals apply to charities, for example. One should understand a charity's operations well and scrutinize their finances and actions before making any contributions, be it money or labor. Many charities exist today to simply act as tax write-offs for corporations, or worse - to directly convert charitable contributions to corporate profits.",Rythoka,t2_4sb3h,2,0,reddit2

What I do is put a filter up for everything I want. I work remote so my options are enormous. Basically entire USA (or world, really, as I am software dev). 

I would then open up indeed and at first I did those stupid ass tests. I've literally completed like 30 of them. They used to be a lot quicker but now, no way in hell am I doing them.

I then open up a tab and just new window open every single job. Literally like 50 applications and I just spam the shit out of my resume without reading. I had a file on my computer with copy paste answers and honestly most the ""basic"" questions are prefilled once you have done them once before. 

Basically I just spam out like 50 jobs a day. And I swear after a week or two I have tons of awesome offers. I also have massive loads of shit but I just delete those. When I get a response of interest I look at the job and pay and either drag that into an interested folder or delete. 

I think I did it that way from like 2018-2020 and I landed decent jobs until in 2020 I took the last one and have stayed.

It's an entry level position, no qualifications required, paying $17/h for a large company. When the HR rep calls they make it very clear you'll be on call 24/7, holidays included and there will be lots of OT. 

Full disclosure, on the first HR call I hemmed and hawed a bit when they mentioned being on-call 24/7 but ultimately stated I was willing. In previous jobs I've always had holidays off and worked at most 60 hour weeks, but never constantly on-call, year-round. It almost seemed like they were trying to scare applicants away.  

I heard back a few days later via email, they were going with someone else. However, the listing never got taken down. I waited a couple of weeks and went to apply again which is when I found out about their 6 month re-application policy. I kept looking elsewhere and managed to pick up freelance gigs to keep the bills paid.  

Before I knew it, 6 months had passed and I reapplied to the listing that was surprisingly still there. A couple days passed and I received a call where they again tried to scare me away by mentioning nothing but negatives during the entire pre-interview process but this time I made sure I was cheery, upbeat and ready to do whatever was needed of me to at least get to the second phase of interviews. She thanked me for my time and I hung up, extremely optimistic that I was definitely going to be moving forward. Two days go by, I get the same email informing me they were going with a different candidate. Again the listing didn't get taken down.  

I floated freelance work again, applied to lots of different jobs and had more interviews than I can count over the last 6 months. All of them took down their job postings after I received notice that the job had been filled. A week ago I hit the 6 month mark again on that position and figured what-the-hell, I'll give it a go one more time.  

Same ordeal as the first two times. I was ready for every negative assertion she provided regarding what the position would entail. I was bright, ready and ensured she knew I was willing to work. Toward the end, my constant optimism seemed to wear off and she sounded kind of happy on the other end. Two days later I got the same email. The job is still listed right now.. I don't know what they're doing but they're clearly not actually hiring folks for that job. They just want it to look like they are.

Republicans outright destroyed the pensions for new teachers. This happened about 10 years ago. I was grandfathered in, but the new teachers now have a lot worse retirement options and have to work a lot longer to be able to afford retirement.

I'm in my 40s (just to give you an idea how long ago I was in school) and I was just talking to my favorite high school teacher (who was in his late 20s / early 30s when I was in HS) when I saw him out and about in town. He's now newly 60 years old and already retired from one school district and working for a 2nd school district. He is getting ready to retire from that one in I think 2 more years, at which point he will get a 2nd retirement income from the state or something.  He is then going to move to one of the states bordering this state and work for a third school district, where he will make a veteran salary (bc of his experience) while simultaneously collecting two retirements/pensions from the other two school districts.  I didn't ask how much he was raking in but it seemed like quite a bit. ???

Is this something that a new teacher in 2023 will not be able to accomplish in their own retirement?  Or is this a job where you starve the first 10 years and then do alright later on?

Or is this guy just special?  I mean he is my favorite teacher because he was legit like one of those amazing teachers they make movies about, where he touches a bunch of students' lives.  So he is kinda ""famous"" in the area I guess, so maybe he is just getting some sweetheart deals that an 'average teacher' doesn't.  But the retirement + move schools thing seems like something anybody can do.

I'm perfectly aware that new teachers are dirt poor.  But just seems to be juxtaposed against veteran teachers I know who are doing very well.

(Don't get mad at this guy... he's legit an awesome teacher who loves kids, works long long days because he's always run at least 2 or 3 after-school programs/clubs, etc. I'm glad he's doing well for himself.)

Then there are the multi-cultural problems, having no tools to deal with misbehaving kids, and sometimes violent behavior as young as in pre-teen kids.

Four friends of mine became teachers ~10 years ago. Three of them have since quit their jobs because of the children and their parents. The one who remains feels like a zombie going through the motions, she teachers art, and she thought it was a dream-job-come-true.

Her reality: Endless screaming, bullying (also to her), the kids see her class as a playground, and the threat of detention is reason for verbal and sometimes physical violence. 

My guess: She's pregnant now, and she's probably going to make use of maternity leave (quite substantial and fully paid in my country), and then take up all of her (paid) holidays, and extend her maternity leave at reduced pay for as long as possible (up to 3 years I believe), and then quit.

I actually ran out of desks and chairs, mostly because the fire marshal only let us have 25 desks in a room. Admin's answer was to give students clipboards to work on. I prayed everyday morning that there would be absent kids just so I wouldn't have to hand out clipboards. It also made seating charts impossible because I couldn't bring myself to choose which kids didn't have seats.

The worst part of that situation was that I was required to enter in 2 grades for each student each week. I had 185 students and about 4 total hours for planning each week. Even if I spent the impossible 1 minute reviewing work, writing feedback, and entering in a grade for each paper, there still wouldn't have been enough time in the week to grade everything. 

The only mildly good part is that I didn't have to write any tests for my classes. I wasn't legally able to test 3 of my classes because there were 4 student in each of those classes who had IEP accommodations that required 1 on 1 testing and there was no one to do that and no where to send those students for tests. There isn't any use in testing just half of my students, so I just didn't do tests in my classes. Looking back on it, I wonder how or if those students got their testing accommodations outside of my classes. 

I sometimes think about going back to teaching the k-2 grades because those classes cap out at 24. But then I remember that some of the schools in my district split the k-2 classes instead of getting subs for the classes. And I just don't known if I can do 30 kids again, even if it's only for a day or two. 

Long rant aside, the reason teachers are leaving isn't just because of pay. It's because if the workload. There isn't enough money in three world that could convince me to go back to trying to fit 15 to 20 hours worth of work into a 4 or 5 hour period of time.",PinkPixie325,t2_hvbra88c,4,0,reddit4

School boards back load the pay scale to keep the staff costs low. Attrition is high and keeps payroll down. If you pay your “dues” for 10 years you get to be one of the teachers that make it to a living wage. 

Your great teacher was grandfathered in to the good ol’ boomer pensions most likely. His generation got to retire with something like 2% at 52 years old (add to that for every year past 52 with 3% likely at 62). Those old pension formulas gave an employee years of service times the percentage as a fixed income. So he probably got a good portion of his final salary.  If he worked 30 years and retired at 62 he would get 30x3% so 90% of his final salary. And his pay scale was probably much more evenly distributed throughout his career. 

Now these new teachers get paid with the terrible back loaded salary scale and they are offered 2% at 65. So they have to work 13 more years than the generation before them to earn the same pension as the boomers did.

jx802l1,t1_jx7t6ns,2023-08-22 02:37:19,WorkReform,"A few further issues I see already with your analysis.

For one, the ""Unions work"" comes off as patronizing a bit - I hope that wasn't your intention. First, no... [CTU teachers don't start at 70k](https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2019/11/13/20963703/chicago-teachers-union-contract-vote-chicago-public-schools-experience-salary-pay#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20a%20starting,the%20union%20late%20last%20week.), they start around 58k per contract from 2019 (unless you have information showing this is now higher, which might be the case after Covid, but I didn't find anything saying otherwise.) I think you're looking at what teachers after 5 years would be making with the new plan via CTU, not what a starting teacher would be making. Remember, half of teachers quit by year 5.

Not all union states have this kind of pay. Michigan is a union state, 44k is the norm starting - 36k in my hometown of Flint. You're ignoring CoL causing the pay in Chicago to be so high - one of the highest in the nation, as far as I'm aware. You'd see similar payments for high CoL areas, which is something you'd see in all professions. ALso, mind you, when you look at percentages, even 70k in Chicago is rough when the median house is 365k or the median rent is 2.2k (40% of take-home monthly at 70k). It also ignores other aspects of it - someone with a master's is going to be on a higher pay grade than those with just a teaching degree. 

&nbsp;

For two, your mother is probably an experienced teacher, you're pretending a long-time teacher with 20 years experience (I'm assuming here) is akin to a starting teacher in their career. Again, we're talking starting pay here, not what the end-of-career teachers are making. Have you actually asked your teacher mom how many hours she puts into work a week? And if you think teachers just stop working on shit for the next week cuz they're getting a ""union holiday,"" you're sadly mistaken. I'm a professor, I'm literally doing shit every single day of the week all semester, rain or shine, holiday or no. 

&nbsp;

For three, your mother as an example is anecdotal at best. I literally went and found sources to make sure I was getting it right before I said anything. Here are [two](https://www.edweek.org/research-center/reports/teaching-profession-in-crisis-national-teacher-survey) [separate](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass_2004_26.asp) links showing you exactly what I just said. That 2nd one is from 2004, the first from 2022. Both showing around the same number of hours on average. Here's a[ third](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/survey-teachers-work-53-hours-per-week-on-average/2012/03/16/gIQAqGxYGS_blog.html) from 2013 that shows 53.",dirtyploy,t2_ac4be,1,0,reddit4

I know other schools give out shit lunches for the kids eating for free and “good” ones to others, or give the poor kids a voucher or whatever that can be identified. Both of these cases are pathetic and shouldn’t happen. 

And you’re right, free lunches for all gets rid of the scenario in which a needy kid with lazy or embarrassed parents won’t have to rely on their action in order for them to eat. That’s good. 

Maybe the only solution is to have free lunches for all the kids. I don’t know and don’t have heartburn either way.

My brother and I work the same job at the same company. He had his review before I did, so I knew to expect the smaller raise. The boss prefaced it with this whole big thing about how we went way over our labor budget last year. But the operational director likes to let us grunt workers know where the company's at financially, and I've sat in on enough meetings to know last year was a record year for us. And while it might not be sustainable for the rest of this year, the numbers looked really good this May, too.

I didn't thank upper management. In fact, I expressed my disappointment to my supervisors during my review, and told them that I was worried this may trigger a second wave of our company's great resignation. I have a feeling that concern fell on deaf ears.",MasteringTheFlames,t2_oxupb,29,0,reddit1

In high school I wanted to be a surgeon, so I took many biological science classes but I also joined a FIRST robotics team. That's where my exposure to robotics began. I really didn't know what I wanted to do anymore so I decided after high school to go to community college for engineering technology, but I quit after 1.5 years and a really poor experience as an intern. I fumbled around in life between a few jobs - 4.5 years at a hardware store, 6 months at a body shop, and 4 years at a bike shop. I didn't really feel I was going anywhere so I decided to go back to school and got my A.S. with the intent to transfer somewhere for environmental studies. However, a new campus opened in my city and offered a B.S. in engineering technology and I chose to go back that route. I had a much better experience and I was much, much more mature at that point. I excelled and landed the job I mentioned I quit after I graduated in 2019, at the ripe old age of 32. 

This job came out of the blue. A recruiter called me up after about 2 years of off and on interviews at many different places. There wasn't even a mention of salary, but the job description fit exactly what I was looking for - creative, innovative, and science-based.

Yes, they will try. So you shore up those loopholes when they find them for you. You enact stronger penalties for willful avoidance. You keep pushing until the ‘loopholes’ are more trouble than they’re worth, or too small to be significant. 

I don’t know that a hard cap of 10x base salary works. I dont hate the idea but I’m confident there will be many situations it is hard to swing, and each exception you make creates further inequality, confusion, complexity, and room for new loopholes. 

I really like the idea that the workers should have a presence on a board of directors, and I think workers collectively should maybe approve executive compensation.  It gives room for flexibility while also giving executives good incentive to treat employees well.  This wouldn’t work in private setting so something else would have to be worked out, though…

I also think minimum wage should be corrected and then tied to a combination inflation and local CoL metric.

I think employment at will should be tempered with some greater employee protections, like minimum notice periods, requiring some good reason, etc. It won’t prevent wrongful terminations, but it would make them a little harder and soften the blow when it occurs.

I also think we should generally leverage more unions and cooperative structures.  But unions should be accountable to something else in turn. I have less concrete ideas here, yet. Unions do more good than harm imo, but they do do harm and there are plenty of good examples of unions out of control.

Thus they overcompensate themselves even if it takes away from the compensation of others that deserve it.

Generally, where there is leadership, those in power will try to take advantage of those they have power over. For example, with the United States government, the constitution exists partly to limit the power of government and to expressly define the rights of the people. Shouldn't we just know what rights humans should have? Yes, but it's not in our nature to just live it out without some sort of governing body and regulation. And those in power, when unregulated, have been shown to do heinous things to those under them for the purposes of their own welfare.",ChaoticGood3,t2_j2vhc2qi,1,0,reddit2

Yes, they will try. So you shore up those loopholes when they find them for you. You enact stronger penalties for willful avoidance. You keep pushing until the ‘loopholes’ are more trouble than they’re worth, or too small to be significant. 

I don’t know that a hard cap of 10x base salary works. I dont hate the idea but I’m confident there will be many situations it is hard to swing, and each exception you make creates further inequality, confusion, complexity, and room for new loopholes. 

I really like the idea that the workers should have a presence on a board of directors, and I think workers collectively should maybe approve executive compensation.  It gives room for flexibility while also giving executives good incentive to treat employees well.  This wouldn’t work in private setting so something else would have to be worked out, though…

I also think minimum wage should be corrected and then tied to a combination inflation and local CoL metric.

I think employment at will should be tempered with some greater employee protections, like minimum notice periods, requiring some good reason, etc. It won’t prevent wrongful terminations, but it would make them a little harder and soften the blow when it occurs.

I also think we should generally leverage more unions and cooperative structures.  But unions should be accountable to something else in turn. I have less concrete ideas here, yet. Unions do more good than harm imo, but they do do harm and there are plenty of good examples of unions out of control. 

In the same note, I think HOAs should be more restricted in what they can command for homeowners (slight distinction from an apartment building).  Why the duck can’t I plant some lime trees if I want limes on my property? Because Karen doesn’t like the aesthetic?

One of the biggest problems, and I hate to say it, is how these are messaged in the US. 

Rebrand unions to workers freedom initiatives. 

Rebrand unemployment to individual-funded bronze parachutes. 

Rebrand abortion to individual liberties. Freedom from state interference. Etc.

My rebranding is sub par but you get the idea.

Many C-suite members will draw fairly relatively low salaries, in the 200-400k range, and are largely compensated through stock options, bonuses, or profit sharing incentivizes. Many managers/leads have similar systems.

Ultimately, it sounds like you have an unrealistic understanding of what high paid professional roles look like. That you are invoking the constitution here further suggests to me that you're not coming at this from a perspective of what existing white collar work looks like, and claiming 'the law will cover the loopholes' is fairly naive.

I'm one who thinks looking at totals can often be misleading.  For instance, I'll see the memes that list a CEO's pay and then go find the number of employees to discover that it's worth $150 per year per employee, so it is not the reason that anyone is underpaid.  And if someone is managing to keep a company going that employs that many, then darn tootin' they should get more than someone managing fewer!

I'd also be concerned about treating cash and shares/options the same.  If it were to be limited somehow, then  someone choosing shares should have a larger multiplier.  That could end up being even more later, but it can also be less, so they should be able to choose their risk level.

For instance, let's say the initial calculation determines you could have $2M cash or $3M shares, so a 1.5 multiplier for shares.  So they could choose maybe $1M cash and $1.5M shares, or $1.5M cash and $750k shares.",Realistic_Ad3795,t2_7y5ioabu,1,0,reddit2

I don't even need a better job but I know the market is hot right now, at least in IT so if anything better pops up I'm out.

If on salary add 10%) Regardless, I currently make this much. Can you please tell me the pay range now?""

This will either scare them off or actually give you the pay range. Which usually turns out being too low anyways. But it always feels good to be on the other side and reject them just like they reject us mercilessly.

Edit: I see other people here saying to ask for 20% and up and you can certainly add whatever percentage you want.

Also, if they ask you what your expected pay range is answer with ""Well, what do you have to offer?"" Or ""What is the highest you're willing to pay?""",SpookyBeast1918,t2_3vl3z4u3,13,0,reddit3

Ask about the role, if it's a new position, ask (in general terms) what happened with the last employee in that role, etc.

Generally, recruiters are vile creatures that eat their young. However, if we must deal with them, save the salary question until YOU know more about the role, expectations and what's really required. At that point, you have leverage.

Know your market and scale for the role. If they low-ball you with the offer, you can go back to your notes and say ""well, you need this, that and the other thing.""

If you tell the recruiter that you quite like your current job and that he'd need to go up quite a bit from your current wage before you'd consider leaving, you could get a negotiation tool for getting a higher wage at your current job, by telling your boss that someone is trying to recruit you for a higher wage, and see whether he's willing to match it.

That’s what they’re hiring, right?  

A very important part of work reform, in my opinion, is to stop letting companies get away with this “contract position” bullshit. 

My husband is the kind of contractor that builds houses - And every time I get a message like this, I answer them the same way and with the same kinds of questions he asks his clients.  

Sure, I can give you a quote for my services.  Let’s go over the details of the project so I can accurately invoice you. What is your total budget?  What (if anything) needs to be completed onsite?  What specifically needs to be accomplished and completed?  

“Possibility of extension” is a red flag. That’s their way of saying “We should be hiring a W-2 employee, but we don’t want to.”  Ask specifically what an extension means. Regular maintenance?  How regular?  Is there more than one location or project that needs my services? Obviously the questions asked would depend entirely on the field you work in - just giving examples. 

Once I have the job info, I sit down and crunch numbers. If I’m being asked to take on a full time contract position, then I’m calculating everything from cost of private insurance to job expenses and other various fees. Then, I give them a total price and a payment schedule which includes an initial sign on fee. 

I allow for negotiation here and there, but ultimately - I’m offering a service and charge x amount. They can either pay it or not.  It helps that I’m good at what I do and have a good reputation, so I can afford to have a little audacity- but even if I couldn’t, this approach would be worth it JUST for the reactions. 

It’s especially fulfilling when they start trying to dictate my work hours or expecting me to come into their office for whatever reason. Or when they inevitably ask me to “extend the contract” and I tell them I’m happy to give them a quote for their next project - but if they want me to stay on as a regular employee, they’ll have to make me a job offer.",,,1,0,reddit3

Take the minimum salary that would actually be worth it for you to switch to that job for and add (10-50%), then say I would be looking for something around $xx,xxx per year. Try to make a specific offer because then they are likely to round down to something more in your benefit. For example you could say you would be happy to move for something around $92,000 which would be better than saying $90,000 because they'll round to $90,000 instead of trying to move you to $80,000.

Ask for the amount of hours per week that are expected; if they give you a range, pick the higher end because they’ll always want to work you as much as possible. Then take that hour amount and multiple that by your current hourly rate and 52 weeks in a year. Then multiple your current rate by 120%.

For example, if you are making $25 an hour and the average for your role is $28 an hour, use $28 an hour. Now let’s say the hours expect is between 40-50 hours a week, assume it is 50 hours. So…$28 * 50 * 52 * 1.20 = $87,360 per year",HanSoloMay1977,t2_72cfltqc,1,0,reddit3

Currently I’m a contractor through a recruiting firm. My contract is temp, and is guaranteed through July. I filled in for someone on maternity leave. My recruiter told me that 9/10 of the last people he placed in this role ended up signing over full time within 4 months. The 1/10 just didn’t like the job. I’ve been here for a month now, love it, love the company and coworkers. 

**Any advice to speed up my transition from temp to full?** I hate the fact that my wages are effectively getting garnished. Perhaps there’s no chance that it’ll happen until July, if the company & recruiters have some specific agreement on my timeline to maximize their profits. **Is that possible?** When I ask, the recruiter just tells me to keep being patient, working hard, and making sure I like the job. 

I am thankful for the job, but it’s time to cut out the middle man. Also the benefits suck through the recruiters lol like 15% of my paycheck are healthcare premiums. 

I’m **sure** the recruiter lied to me when he told me my asking salary is at the top of the range that the company is willing to pay. I get paid $25/hr so I’m not complaining, but the fact that the company is paying out at least $30/hour for my work kinda makes me sick.",climb-high,t2_11x5xx,1,0,reddit3

Respond back like this: I understand that you have a job to do and are following the directions of your agency. I need to know the salary for this role before I can consider the opportunity. I look forward to your response. 


If this recruiter is worth anything, they will tell you the salary range, at the very least the lower end of the range. 

Many recruiters, especially 0-3 years, are instructed to not discuss salary with prospective candidates. Theyre told to redirect the question back. Hell, there are ""Cons"" like Comic Con, that teach recruiters this. In great detail no less. 

You just need to hold your ground when they do this. If they don't want to tell you, it's not going to be something you're wanting to hear. During my job hunt, one recruiter after about 15 minutes of talking told me the salary was $30k a year plus capped commission of $15k a year. All that after emails back and forth then the conversation. So while my employer does not want me giving it out immediately in my reach outs, as soon as I'm asked I give it. I also tell candidates when they don't ask me and they give me their range, to bump that shit up when they're low or in the middle of the budgeted range. I don't want to get in trouble at work, and at any time any email I've sent can be reviewed (theyre stored in our ATS). 

Stand your ground OP, this role could be better than what you've got, but don't budge and if the response you get back isn't with a salary range, end it and walk away.",x2x_Rocket_x2x,t2_w5hxx,1,0,reddit3

Me: Blah blah blah my experience is...

Me: Yes, tons of questions blah blah blah

Recruiter: ""You sound perfect for the role, what is your salary range""

Me: ""Mr. Recruiter I appreciate the question and understand why you are asking me. BUT its a loaded question, we both know it's bullshit. This job already has a salary range attached to it. If I give you my range, I'm either going to price myself out of the position or I'm going to lose money. Those are two things I absolutely won't do.  If you think I'm a great candidate for this position, give me some real numbers at the top of the range, including the numbers you would have to go back and discuss with the company. If those numbers work for me all you have to do is get me in front of the hiring manager and I will make you look like a superstar.""

There are many ways to do this, but the simplest way is to take your current salary, add 10% or 15% to it and make that your target salary. Then calculate 150% of that target and make that the top of your range. Your response is that your range is the target you calculated and the maximum you calculated. 

If you move, leave your current employer positively and let them know you enjoy working there but really need to earn more moment given the things you want to achieve. If they ask, let them know how much you are leaving for and see if they counter. You then have choices.

Contract work requires a higher hourly rate, since insurance and other benefits will not be part of the job.

This means you're going to pay out the ass providing benefits for yourself, unless you can be carried on a spouse's insurance plan.

You also didn't disclose what field you work in, so none of us can offer you any assistance in helping you out.

As a programmer, my contracted hourly rate is $175/hr. I have my own contract that the hiring company must also agree to, including stipulations such as $225/hr for any work over 40 hours, no weekends (if insisted, $500/hr), and guaranteed 1 day off for every 3 weeks of continued work. There are other stipulations, but you get the point.

If you've never done contract work before, you need to understand this is a far cry than a cubicle in an office. You are your own boss, but this also means you are also your own accountant, lawyer, healthcare insurance, vehicle insurance, and so many other things most people never consider when taking on such a task.

Do your homework. Once you do, you'll come up with a reasonable price for your area.

It’s important to have good research on what the actual competitive salary range is for the general position and to provide a much higher amount than that but still be a somewhat reasonable amount.

However; if it's for contract or hourly work, there's a good chance they are charging the client up to double your paid rate. A big tell is if the recruiter is quoting you stuff that feels suspiciously below industry rate and are unable negotiate much higher, or if you are paid through the recruitment agency, not the client. (This is of course depending on the industry, I do know that this is pretty standard in creative industries)

Obviously you generally won't get the full 15% higher, but I've gotten 5-10k like this before. Worst outcome possible in a negotiation is having them agree right away to your amount, means you could have gotten more if you took the shot",DrJingleCock69,t2_b910w0s6,163,0,reddit3

Actually, here’s a super good example, one of my current jobs…

Right now I’m working on a Senior Electrical Engineering role with multiple offices across the US. Had a guy who was interested in their Atlanta office. 

They never gave us a pay range but I spoke with the consultant who is also working on the job with me and he said… looks like the average in the area for that position is about $120k-130k. We both did some quick googling and looked at the top results.

This man is making about $156k or so. Obviously he wouldn’t want to take a pay cut because that can affect multiple things for him, so, I asked him… what’s the minimum you’d be willing to accept? The most realistic minimum salary for you? $150k, he said.

So I told him, okay, I’ll check and see if we can submit you in for that. 

Checked with that previously mentioned consultant, sent the guy this Sr EE’s resume. 

Consultant said yes, let’s send him through!

And then I did. So it can take a sec to check but if someone is interested in the position then I always double-check.

TL;DR - I never try to “sell” a job to someone and I just try to have a frank discussion to see if they’re interested. 
If they’re outside the range, I always check with a consultant or my recruiting manager first before I submit them through and I let the candidate know what I’m doing each step of the way and explain the processes so they know what going through our agency will be like.",hipsterishbullshit,t2_16y0fc,2,0,reddit3

i1vhht5,t1_i1v9i3u,2022-03-24 01:12:20,WorkReform,"Employer chiming in (I'm a business owner and have been in upper management/executive positions most of my life).

It's become a common tactic in the last 20 years to evade that question at all costs. If you let a prospective employee define their own salary range, they almost ALWAYS come in way under budget. 

Let me show you an example of how this goes down:

1. Company management has a meeting and goes over projections for the next 8 fiscal quarters. Let's say we decide we need 10 experienced employees for remote work-from-home positions to fulfill the labor needs of a particular job that is expanding. After considering the C/P, we budget each position at $80,000 each. 

2. We tell the hiring manager the parameters and budget, and they put a job advertisement up. Resumes start trickling in.

3. Manager picks the best resumes and emails you asking to set up a phone interview. 

4. You email him back saying sure and asking how much it pays. We email back confirming the time and date of the phone interview and tell you that the question will be answered by the hiring manager.

5. Phone interview comes. In this example, let's say you have more than enough skill and experience for the job (we already assume this by looking at your resume). You ask again about the pay, and the manager asks what you're currently making now. You say $52,000. The manager tells you it depends on experience and other factors so we need you to interview with the person who you would work directly for since THAT manager can make a better determination of your worth, and THEN we can offer a salary. We then set up a second phone interview. 

6. Second phone interview. Same damn thing as the last one, except with the Production Manager. You ask again about the pay, and the Production Manager says something like, oh, ""The way our teams are structured, this is an entry level position for this company and the pay range is between $40,000 and $62,000. But before we can make a firm offer we need you to interview in person real quick."" 

7. In person interview comes. Same thing again, just in person now. You get the same rub around.

8. You finally get an email asking you to call cause you got the job!

9. You call and get told to start Monday for orientation. The salary is $58,000. Isn't that great? We were able to negotiate higher than you make now bc you're so awesome!

10. You accept the offer. 

Do you know why you did? Because of something called ""sunk-cost fallacy"". We know you just put in ALL those damned interviews (seriously, we'll waste fuckloads of hours of your time, gas, sanity, etc) and all those weeks of waiting, waiting, WAITING as those interviews drug out. To turn down the offer would mean you did it all for nothing - so you accept it.

We also know that most likely you've been doing that job at your current company for fifteen years with a measly 2% annual raise, but cost of living has been going up by 6-7% each year - in other words, you think you've been getting *raises* since you started that job at $45,000 and now make 52000. But your salary for what you do has actually *decreased* compared to what it's actually worth on the open labor market. After fifteen years, that same job is now worth $73,000 if you had been given a simple cost of living increase to meet inflation.

So, an extra $6000 a year for this new job? Hell yah! Oh wait, except you don't realize the whole industry has increased in demand by leaps and bounds (which is why our company is expanding and needs people, too!), and your position isn't just worth $52k or even $72k -- it's actually worth upwards of $100,000. And remember, we budgeted $80,000 cause we assumed we could easily get plenty of people for cheaper for aaaalllll the reasons above.

But, hey, in our company executive and upper management bonuses are tied to ending the fiscal year *under budget*. So while we budgeted $800,000 total to hire 10 people, thanks to the stupid and insane tactics above, we came in at only $560,000! Now we have $240,000 already in the payroll budget that can go to executive ""performance"" bonuses!

And now you know how assholes up top would review the EoQ and EoY actuals versus budgets, and allocate bonuses to all those executives patting themselves on the backs.

All because you just didn't say ""pay me $100,000"". 

P.S. I'm saying this as a business owner nowadays. Your TIME and your LABOR are worth MONEY. DEMAND YOUR WORTH, EVEN IF ITS YOUR FIRST JOB EVER AND REQUIRES NO TALENT OR EXPERIENCE. My biggest competitor pays $11/hr for a very easy job and employee turnover is atrocious due to hostile work environment. Me? I pay $17/hr for the same exact position and my attitude starts and ends with ""As long as the work gets done, idc - go nice and slow and easy. Finish early? Eh find something else to do and run out your clock"" (in my last interns case, that meant they fired up the Xbox on those days). And the messed up part? *My net income is still ridiculous - I'm not hurting one damn bit*

I hope this helps you guys.",moosewhippets,t2_82otq8ro,3,0,reddit3

Agencies own the risk of the employees they staff, need to pay recruiters/account managers, operations costs, benefits, etc are all included in the bill rate for a lump sum that otherwise most people don't think about.

They pay you $25/hour (made up number) and tell you it's the absolute best rate they could get out of the client. Unbeknownst to you, they have told the client that your hourly contract rate is $40. 

They pocket the additional $15 per hour that the client is paying. 

This is called the spread. Typically the recruiter makes 5-10% of the spread. If there's an account manager involved as well (almost always is), they also get 5-10% of the spread. The recruiting firm takes the rest. 

Hence, the entire recruiting organization is incentivized to get you to accept as low a rate as possible.",FeedMeEthereum,t2_1f11bi0q,28,0,reddit3

Let me flip that around. I will (and have) laughed at recrutiers that contact me and then are not forthcoming with compensation ranges.  
   
A recruiter that is not forthcoming about compensation throws red flags in the same way that a candidate that is not forthcoming about their education would.

""Hiring budget"" is the business jargon for a potential new hire's potential pay. it is very important to use - properly - such business and industry jargon whenever it is relevant. Words like pay and salary are terrible word choices that fail to account for benefits. Compensation is better, but it and the otter two invoke an employee-first imagery. And while I am certainly not ""business-first"", the hiring process is a game - an act - in which one must convince the business that it is in the business' best interest to hire them over others.

My advice that I've been giving out for *decade* now is to always take every possible interview you can that matches your requierement. 

Don't treat it as a waste of time (even though most of them are) but as *training and market research*.

If you look for job once every few years, and you go against a recruiter that does several ones of those every day. Unless he intentionally handicaps himself he'll be better at negotiating then you do. Know market better then you do. Know rates better then you do. Know employment law better then you do.

Plus if you do one interview every 2-3 years, you'll be *stressed*, but if you do those every other month? 

My final advice when negotiating prices is always this: How many job offers you need to get to get a job? **One**.

Yes, private does mean something, that's how words work. Private, as in confidential. No, everything is not private until told you ask. You clearly just spelled out that information is still private after you ask. ""Businesses always have a choice to disclose or not disclose that information."" See, right here. So, you understand that it's not ""private until you ask"" it is private until it's no longer confidential Information. All budgets are confidential. I'm sorry you can't grasp this. 

No, just because they don't disclose company secrets to you, does not mean they are swindling you. And again, all the information I available. If you can't find it, that's not anyone else's problem. I was taught how to find this information over a decade ago.

Again, what you can and will pay employees is not private budgetary information. Why can't you grasp this? It's not a complicated concept. A budget, is a private document, focussing on an individual project, this information is private because other businesses can use it to their advantage, in hiring, contract proposals, stock, etc.. it's not a they don't want to. It's they can't, they shouldn't, and they won't. 

I'll say this one more time. Clear as day.

Which simply isn't true. Many businesses attempt to keep their available budget confidential because it serves their purpose of minimizing how much they pay employees. And also because it seems you're confused we aren't asking for their quarterly budget or their earnings and all their budgets for salaries or equipment or some vague ""budget"". We are asking *specifically* for the budget *for this position.* The request is for how much money the business can afford to pay for this role. Keeping this a secret again only has 1 singular purpose, it allows the business to try and lowball OP. There simply is no other reason to keep this information hidden (and no ""bEcAuSe ItS a SeCrEt"" isn't a reason).

You wanna know what's easier than digging around glassdoor and coldcalling employees about how much they earn at a company? Being told outright when you ask. And again any company that is genuinely looking for talent and to appropriately compensate said talent, has absolutely zero reason not to just outright tell you what they can pay you. Businesses want you to jump through hoops and get invested in the interview process before telling you what you'll earn in an attempt to leverage the sunk cost fallacy against you, so that you accept offers below your worth.

I'm aware recruiters don't care about you. That's why you make their job unsuccessful as long as they are withholding (whether by their choice or the company's) basic information  about the job.

Before you continue I want to reiterate the exact phrasing I used in my original comment: ""how much is budgeted for this position"". If you are going to continue talking in circles please actually address what I said instead of slowly trying to reword what I've said so that it suits your narrative.",5ManaAndADream,t2_3t9mmqnj,1,0,reddit3
i206pro,t1_i1vy5zn,2022-03-25 00:41:04,WorkReform,"Where are you from? The compensation for a position at a company is not generally publically available. There may be entimates for what the market pays based on self-reporting for a particular job title. But those have a range of 100-200+% and do not reflect if any particular company is willing to pay you what you are rooking for.   
  
It is not a made up situation to be expected by a company to hold off mentioning compensation until an offer is made. Nor is it a made up situation to spend 4-8 hours or more sitting for interviews at a company before they make an offer.  
  
That was the norm for generations. I'm simply saying that I am not putting up with it and that I do not have to. Companies looking to higher in Colorado already have to be upfront about compensation ranges for a position. And I have enough recruiters talking to me that I can ghost those that give me push back about providing salary information.   
  
This attitude has not hindered me in anyway with finding new employment when i want it.   
  
Go about interviews however you want. But you are mistaken if you think the only way to get hired is to put up with whatever companies and recruiters ask of you.",NamityName,t2_ic5rz,1,0,reddit3

This is only continuing because you keep pressing this ridiculous notion random people have the right to private budgetary information because you want to be paid as much as possible. That's just not how the world works. 

Just because you don't like something or understand it that doesn't make it circular reasoning. Explaining multiple reasons as to why that information is confidential is not ""it's confidential because it's confidential"" I sorry if you can't grasp concepts like the SEC. 

Yes, it is true businesses are not allowed to just share w.e they want. We have established you don't want to understand that concept. Ad nauseam.

I didn't say quarterly budget. Or any of those other budgets you listed. Position budget is still private budgetary information. Again, not my fault you refuse to understand that. Businesses really don't care about you that much. You have some weird ideas on how business and recruiting officers thinks. 

I didn't say to dig around glass door. Or to cold call anyone. Where are you getting all this information?? Seems like you're arguing with other people? 

Again, it's not possible to just outright tell you a number or a range..

If they tell you a range

A) you will only accept the top amount

B) this makes the job non competitive because everyone regardless of experience will be paid the same

C) it is now a standard wage that other companies can just price out

If they tell a number

A)this makes the job none competitive because everyone regardless of experience will be paid the same

B) it is now a standard wage that other companies can just price out. 

This is not about saving money. It's about being able to recruit and run a functional business. I'm sorry you don't grasp how companies, corporations and markets work. 

The interview process is not some mind game. Again, these are WEIRD and concerning ideas you have. No one it trapping you by interviewing you. You can again, easily get information on what jobs can and should pay. 

Recruiters don't care about you, because they are just doing their job, so make it harder? Do you apply that to any service? McDonald's? Walmart? Or just people trying to help serious people get jobs, change lives, that sort of thing? And again, you left out the SEC out of your list of people preventing companies from sharing confidential information like budget information. 

And, I am not talking in circles. I did address what you said. You just don't like it because it doesn't fit into the little echo chamber your head has made where you think interviews are some weird mind game like torture device to guilt you into working for them.

Havin a child changes one’s life, the persons outlook in life, behaviours, their contribution to society, so any.

I don’t think removing the voice of the Childless population wound be beneficial tho, I don’t hate what he is saying, rather I think that those that get offended by this sentiment should review why, it is likely that the emotions that drive that response are inward self benefiting thoughts. 

this may highlight a very real gap in the way that single person thinks and acts (the gap that gets filled by becoming a parent and being responsible for other humans lives) I’m not saying parents think better, they don’t.

Once Hoffa helped people unionize back then the working conditions changed dramatically, and working peoples lives significantly changed for the better. People were happier, they had decent pay, pensions (retirement in general), vacation time, and more. I think this is partly what we are missing today.

People end up depressed, unhappy, and turn to drug use and other ways to cope with their lives when life is overly hard and they can't make ends meet or struggle to. It's no secret.

You have an unmarried employee, they can go anywhere in America/the world for a new job if your conditions suck so to keep them, you have to be a decent employer. Have a married couple, the mobility decreases to places both can find a job/one job can support both which is still alot of competition but less than for the unmarried and while you don't have to be a great employer like for the single employee, you do have to be ok. Now, you have someone with kids, they have to be in an area with childcare. That can be near family or affordable daycares when the kids are tiny then with decent school systems when they get older. That limits mobility a ton. If the kid is in school, parents may be effectively trapped near the school district since it's easy enough to convince them that they'd be bad parents to take their kids away from their friends. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, of course it does, but with kids, people have more ties to where they live so employers can treat them worse with less risk of them leaving. You tie voting to kids, you force people to tie themselves down and let you treat them poorly because they feel like they have few other options. It's very rational.

And what is insidious is that Elon & some in the GOP are blaming our current terrible leaders on the fact that too many vote.

Conservatives are brilliant at pushing toxic narratives into the public consciousness so we have to take this seriously. Billionaires who think like Elon will add further caveats to voting rights beyond ending them for childless adults. Wealth will be a pre-requisite thrown about (& has been).

It is important to understand their reasoning & how they will advocate such antidemocratic ideals. And as we do that, union membership will continue to grow this decade as working people realize both their rights at work & at the ballot box are at stake.

Back to the argument they will make on wealth - they will argue that those who pay less taxes nominally should have no say in how the tax money of the rich is spent. They will likely frame it around property ownership, like Steve Bannon has long done:

Marx has written a lot about the meaning and value of capitalism and materialism. 

The general TL:DR is that the ruling class needs a working class to support them and so they support policies and ideas that contribute to the continuation of the working class. This means supporting heterosexual relationships as they’ll reproduce and have kids that will join the work force. It also means discouraging and condemning homosexual relationships as they won’t have kids that will add to the workforce. It also means banning things like abortion as if you force people to have kids when they’re not in a position to support them, it’s much easier to exploit them as they’ll be desperate to do so. 

Finally, I’m not very educated about critical theory. I’ve skimmed the surface reading it and find it interesting and see points where the ideas I’ve read align, but I imagine there’s lots more nuance to them and alternate ideas that have grip that I simply haven’t been exposed to.

Ideas such as less work, no work, post-scarcity, singularity, gaming and porn, predominate.

>Or the kids of the working class, whose effective spending power is plummeting year over year, will be living like it’s the 1950s?

I'm speaking of the generations after the newest we have. Economies go in cycles. There are boom and bust periods and the catalyst for the future could be less competition for work, but nobody can really know. If we continue to stay in this mode, where the working class is suffering and more than half the country is barely making any ends meet, then I have no idea what the end game is there. Everyone currently alive is going to struggle like hell, and that 60% is going to look like the ""good days"" once that number adds millions of more people put into that situation. A system cannot stay up if that continues forever. The pressure on the working class is beyond what should be acceptable, and I don't know how much longer this can go on, which is why I predict that it *should* turn around for future generations. Or else I don't think those generations will even exist.

If past generations fought hard to get the life their offspring had, then I assume that the common person isn't going to take this for much longer. History *should* repeat itself here. Humans have not changed, and I'm betting that the working class will start fighting back. Just as humans of the past did.",Dumb_Vampire_Girl,t2_cikbkas1,2,0,reddit4

They've investigated new states they didn't previously have an employee in when people have wanted to switch to full remote in the past and worked with them when possible (eg the NY/NJ border, which side to live on when it didn't matter as much to the employee, or keeping a staff on as a contractor when they moved to California until they found a new salaried job). They are currently working on reviewing all states to provide a full list of states that they can maintain compliance with. 

It would be great on an employee level if we could really live just anywhere, but I can understand why maintaining legal compliance in all possible locations would be too much, considering states have different income taxes, withholding obligations, vacation and paid-leave laws - and some states have legal obligations that straight up contradict those of other states.",marjoramandmint,t2_39vh075i,1,0,reddit1

I was in a similar situation but thankfully i work for great guys that were willing to negotiate with me when I brought a 36% raise for myself (from $47.5k to $65k) to the table and (after a week of stressing out over it, sleepless nights, a little bit of persuasion, and some very nicely lain out metrics) we came to an agreement… to give me what I want. 

Not everyone can do this though. The reality of it is, at this point in the game, companies need to start to reevaluate an employee’s worth and how much their jobs impact their businesses. There are still so many businesses out there bitching because “no one wants to work” yet they’re offering $17/hr to literally hold their businesses together. Everyone deserves a living wage and everyone deserves to be compensated based on how important their job is to the overall foundation of the business. It doesn’t matter if you’re flipping burgers, waiting tables, changing oil on vehicles, or managing multiple companies’ networks; everyone who works deserves to get a wage they can be proud of and feel like they’re making their worth. Another question companies need to start asking themselves is: how important is the quality of work? Pay someone more, take care of those who are taking care of you, and generally you’ll get a better payout as far as quality goes. Of course there are exceptions but I like to believe that a happy employee is a good employee. 

The point of my rant is this: you need to live. Just like a business you have expenses, you have goals. If someone wants to start a business, part of that risk and responsibility is taking care of the people making your business successful. 

The workers run the show, everyone else just gets fat off of our labor. Make it worth my time I’m taking away from my family and my own self interests.

I had a recruiter who had been trying to get me into one of her positions for the past 7 years tell me that I was over estimating my range when I told her I would take no less than $68,000 and it had to be 90% remote and that I wanted to get out of the day to day boring staff accounting.

Take no offense, as I started on hourly with little/no negotiation possible; but realistically, I could be replaced with a warm body and a week of training.  It took years of working up, gaining skills and experience until I could negotiate anything.  Some people, most typically white collar professionals, start at this level of negotiation because of their education and time served in internships or other work experience.  For most of us in trades and services, you have to work your way up to it, if ever.  The key, though, is actively working your way up.

My current job came in $1 less hourly than I required, but I negotiated min and max overtime and other considerations that have a value of $2-$10 more than I required.

You're right that a range gives them the chance to offer the lowest, but it also allows them to give better benefits if they now know the base salary is low. For example, I'd probably take my minimum salary requirement over the max range I gave if I was offered an extra week or two of vacation.

if4ij8f,t1_if33p0e,2022-07-06 21:20:25,WorkReform,"The typical answer for most white collar jobs would be ""a bachelor's degree"" as it is the educational starting point that usually includes some on the job experience (internship) and is generally geared towards the field you are seeking to enter.

After that, one typically pursues either a master's degree or further certification in their field.  Master's degree is more of a pipeline into management, executive roles, and teaching (broadly speaking).  

 Accountants might have a bachelor's and then get an accounting certification; but the manager of the entire region may only have a master's in business administration.

It can be a number of things outside of college as well.  There is a lot to be said for simple experience, and doing something for 10+ years is worth more than a degree in some fields, especially the trades.  Then there are numerous certifications and classes for various fields that can help take you to the next level.  Like in my field, degrees are near worthless, but piles of technical certifications and experience will get you a red carpet.  Most of my certs came from community college classes, time worked in the field, and employer sponsored trainings.",The_Freight_Train,t2_16ohwi,1,0,reddit2

 uPTO isn't reference to just any time off. 

Hypothetically, Every day I go home at 5pm is the start of my non-committed time. uPTO is the time you take off with permission that you'd otherwise be obliged to avail yourself to actually work. Like if you normally agree you're the 9 to 5 weekday guy, you can't just disappears on vacation without making sure some one will fill your shift. You take PTO and uPTO. With notice during your shift. 

Not when it's your normal day off, sleep time or what have you.

At least that's what uPTO meant at every job I've had. You would schedule unpaid time off to indicate you normally worked that shift but are not available during those hours noted.",Quizzelbuck,t2_670no,8,0,reddit2

To say organizing is lazy gives away your lack of understanding of what organizing _is_ and why it's critical for improving our working conditions. Organizing requires blood, sweat, and tears and will typically happen out of desperation despite all of the fears and risks involved and we owe everything we have and enjoy to the workers who came before us and organized.

The corporation is not a just or fair meritocracy; it's an authoritarian hierarchy that exists to extract as much surplus value as possible from its laborers with working conditions as bad as they can get away with. Only those at the very very top benefit from this power structure and the only way to alter this power structure is through organizing, which could also be understood as a process of democratizing the workplace.

The corporation is not a just or fair meritocracy. No argument from me there. Do your own thing was my original point. Quality of service and products often degrades when companies become large.

I've worked with unions. Even worse: Government unions. You can't find a more uninspired workforce than those people. There is no incentive at all to provide high quality service or products because there is no negative feedback loop to inspire improvements.

Someone mentioned the USPS. I can't think of a better example of what I'm saying than the postal service. USPS is awful compared to companies like UPS. Why? UPS cares if customers hate them because they'll just leave to go somewhere else. USPS has no such pressure.

izuu6lf,t1_izu5uk9,2022-12-12 00:33:50,WorkReform,"The implied suggestion from this example comes from a single issue; that being that individuals in unionizing workplaces are more likely to abandon the effort the larger the scope of the union to be created is. But this issue to me looks like a red herring. 

A larger group unionizing is only more vulnerable to disruption because we can assume a larger group won't care as much on an individual level. 

I say that because it seems reasonable that more people involved means less individual action possible for each person involved, which means a lower level of personal investment per person, and so these individuals could be more easily dissuaded from participating in the unionization push with incentives that are inconsequential to the company, at least compared to what they'd lose after a company wide union forms.

And while I think that's all true, to me if we could truly inform people as to the benefits of unionizing, and show that no company incentive can ever outweigh them, it wouldn't matter really how big the scope of the push is, because people will want a union based on what they know and not so much because of the continued pressure of their coworkers.

Your original comment was completely ignorant. It’s no coincidence that the downfall of working standards in the US and stagnancy of wages coincided with the eroding power of unions.

If you really believe you as a policeman are a worker just like everybody else... Get ready to bury your head in the sand HARD the next several years.  2020 was just a warm-up for conflict between Police and Labor.

I inquire about hire date, rates, etc.  It's an important part of the labor market information the government collects.  I've been doing this for 12 years.  Never once.  Not ever has an employer reported anything but the bottom value on a blind job order.  It has nothing to do with your experience.  It everything to do with their need and your knowledge of your value.  

I had a guy the other day.  He's filing for unemployment.  I ask if he'd ever consider a different employer.  At his current job, layoffs are frequent and also weather based.  
He says to me, ""I'm 64 years old, I make 80000 dollars a year, who can afford to pay me this top rate?"" 
I can certainly understand his concern.  The man is a high level crane operator.  He's been with the same company for 30 years.  80000$ is pretty good for the region.  I left it go and continued to assist Jim with his unemployment.   I ask him, ""I know you Saud you make 80k a year, but what is that hourly?""
He replies, ""20 dollars.""
For those keeping score, at a 40 hour work week, 20 dollars an hour is 41,600.  I would assume the usual time and a half for overtime.  Which would avg out to roughly 25 hours of overtime every week for 52 weeks.  The only problem with this math is that he didn't work most winters.  Roughly 9-12 weeks.  So he was packing all of those hours into 9 months.  
This company created themselves the perfect wage slave.  He believed he could get no better deal, that his employer isn't hiring new people at a higher market rate than he makes.

Otherwise, that's exactly what the recruiter is doing--going to the company website and attempting to intercept others who may be on their way there. 

If that's the case, the recruiter has no more of an ""in"" or any more information than any other ""outsider"" so will be working for their own benefit rather than yours (ie telling you to accept a lowball, misrepresenting your skill set to the potential client in the hopes of getting their ""finder's fee"" whether or not you're a good fit or the job is appropriately compensated).

And there's every chance the company would pass on your resume because you came from an unsolicited recruiter submission (potentially in a batch of dozens farmed by that same recruiter).

If the recruiter has been retained by the company to recruit, they'll usually say so up front or relatively early in the conversation.

We always had our highs and lows but they had crazy low turnover for the industry. Well, when covid hit they didn't handle it very well, like many employers. 

They handled the layoffs poorly. They were very shitty to those who were left, they even got PPP money but opted to not use it and still cut our hours and pay, they said they didn't want to pay people to not work... Our coworkers who got laid off were making more than we were thanks to the supplemental unemployment. 

When things got busier they also handled bringing people back terribly. Some they ended up needing within a month or two of letting them go, so those people were rightfully mad that the company didn't think needed them when they did. Then they tried to bring everyone back at lower pay and reduced hours. Any that pushed back they threatened with reporting to unemployment for turning the offer down, never mind it wouldn't have worked since some would have made half what they did before. 

After things got somewhat back to normal and most people had come back, inevitably, they started losing people. Some had been there for years, like decade plus. I eventually got fed up with their mentality post covid and quit. It's been two years and they haven't replaced me. It's almost an entirely new team at this point minus a few who just don't know where to go and feel trapped. All of them are looking for new jobs though. 

Management was warned over and over that they were going to keep losing people and they didn't listen. Didn't matter how many of their good people they lost, they always had some excuse for themselves. Now they are in a spiral of losing business and what few good people they have left and the people they need to help them recover are all gone.

I got so stressed I was grinding my teeth in my sleep and I would get 3 hours of sleep at night. At a certain point I said fuck this job. I wanted to quit I really did but i couldn't risk missing unemployment. I applied to a few places but unfortunately it was during a shit market so I got nothing. Then I got fired. That first few days was utter relief that I didn't have to deal with that bitch. But market didn't improve so I was unemployed for months. Got a bit depressed. Moved back with family. And after months I landed a new job with a solid manager and I've been loving it ever since. I'm honestly considering leaving my old job off my resume completely mainly because of my old manager

I spent the first 8-9 years of my career working as a DoD contractor. I've also worked in cyber security. I know the risks of which you speak.

I made a conscious decision to aim for high tech jobs and have never looked back. It did require me to humbly ask for assistance.

I also regularly get 'cold calls' from folks I do not know who've heard me speak on podcasts or seen my presentations where I openly state that I am always open to mentorship and giving advice to anyone that asks it of me.

In my 17+ year career I've never turned anyone away.

You can be safe and still take risks. They have to be calculated risks, but what are your alternatives otherwise?

Seek out a mentor that's doing the work you desire.",spiegro,t2_6pkl9,2,0,reddit1

That doesn't mean there are no repercussions, socially or otherwise. It's against all our interests to call for the arrest of every police officer. While we protest and act for change, we shouldn't discount the work of allies within the system, even if by and large this work provides cover for bad actors. We want and need cops who say ""No, this is wrong."" Our system treats these people as the bad apples while actual antisocial behavior is handwaved. 

The current discourse gives minimal room for change without buckets of blood. There has been enough blood spilled, and anyone who calls for more is a dangerous ally for a nonviolent left.
